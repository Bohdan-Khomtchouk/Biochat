TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Six1/2-1(RNAi) animals and POU2/3(RNAi) animals

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes that were expressed in the protonephridial system. Because Six1/2(RNAi) and POU2/3(RNAi) animals lose the tubules, flame cells and accessory cells, these animals were expected to show decreased levels of the genes expressed in the nephridial system relative to control RNAi animals.

DESIGN
RNA from Six1/2(RNAi) and POU2/3(RNAi) animals was harvested with Trizol at days 8 and 15 after RNAi initiation for the former and days 15 and 21 for the latter. Three biological replicates were used. RNA from the four samples were competetively hybridized on a microarray with RNA from control RNAi animals of the corresponding days.
