TITLE
Lack of hepatic response of microRNA in mice following DB[a,h]A exposure (Agilent expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene  DB[a,h]A is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon potent carcinogen. Few studies have investigated the role of DB[a,h]A on mRNA and miRNA expression. In this study a 10-week old male MutaTM Mouse were exposed to 6.25, 12.5,  and  25  mg/kg/day  DB[a,h]A by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. DNA adducts were detected in the livers at each  DB[a,h]A  dose  tested,  and a dose-dependent increase in lacZ mutants was observed in the same samples. MAANOVA analysis  revealed  minor  changes  in  the  mRNA  expression  for the two lowest doses. Differential expression of 19 up-regulated  and  22 down-regulated transcripts with fold-change > 1.5 (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) were identified in the 6.25  mg/kg/day  DB[a,h]A treatment group. For the 12.5 mg/kg/day treatment group 13 transcripts were up-regulated and 32  down-regulated  (FDR-adjusted  P < 0.05  and  fold-change > 1.5). Major effect on mRNA expression resulted from exposure  to  the  highest  dose  (25  mg/kg/day)  of DB[a,h]A with 135 up-regulated and 104 down-regulated genes with fold-change > 1.5  (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). The significantly regulated genes are involved in circadian rhythm, drug metabolism,  glucose  metabolism, cholestrol and lipid metabolism, immune response, cell cycle, and apoptosis. We also investigated  miRNA  response to the three doses of DB[a,h]A. MiRNA expression was relatively unaffected. Only miR-34a showed significant (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) up-regulation with a fold change above 1.3-fold.

DESIGN
Individual total RNA (200 ng) from 4-5 mice per treatment group (control, 6.25 mg/kg, 12.5mg/kg, and 25mg/kg) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA. Agilent mouse 8 x 60 K oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess global gene expression in response to 6.25, 12.50, and 25 mg/kg DB[a,h]A treatment
