TITLE
Histone protein and peptide reactivity within patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the ABCoN cohort

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that IFN high SLE patient sera is more reactive to whole histone proteins and post-translationally modified histone peptides than IFN low patient sera. We diluted patient sera 1:250 and incubated dilutions on a nitrocellulose-platform array printed with whole protein and peptide histone antigens.
