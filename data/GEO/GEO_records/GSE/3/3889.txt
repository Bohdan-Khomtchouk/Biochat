TITLE
Scd1 Knockout Mice on very low fat diet

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-deficient (SCD1-/-) mice have impaired monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) synthesis.  When maintained on a very low-fat, high-carbohydrate (VLF-HC) diet, SCD1-/- mice develop severe hypercholesterolemia characterized by an increase in apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and the appearance of lipoprotein-X.  Additionally, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is dramatically reduced in VLF-HC SCD1-/- mice.  The concomitant presence of elevated plasma bile acids, bilirubin and aminotransferases in the VLF-HC SCD1-/- mouse are indicative of hepatic dysfunction.  Supplementation of the VLF-HC diet with unsaturated fat (canola oil), but not saturated fat (coconut oil), prevents these plasma phenotypes.  However, dietary oleate was not as effective as canola oil in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, signifying an additional role for dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency in the development of this phenotype.  These results indicate that lack of SCD1 results in an increased requirement for dietary unsaturated fat to compensate for impaired MUFA synthesis and to prevent hypercholesterolemia and hepatic dysfunction. Keywords: repeat (genotype and diet)
