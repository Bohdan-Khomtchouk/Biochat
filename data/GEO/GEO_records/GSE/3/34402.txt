TITLE
Transcriptional analyses of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus Paxillus involutus during growth on various lignocellulose soil substrates

ORGANISM
Paxillus involutus ATCC 200175

SUMMARY
In this study, examinations were performed on how the ECM fungus Paxillus involutus degrade complex, plant and litter material by using elemental analyses, FTIR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy together with microarray analyses screening 12,214 gene models, derived from 454 sequenced cDNA libraries.
