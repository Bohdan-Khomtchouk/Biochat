TITLE
miRNA profiling in the adult mouse incisor

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was compared in 3 distinct regions of the adult mouse incisor: the labial cervical loop, which houses ameloblast stem cells; the lingulal cervical loop, which houses stem cells but not ameloblast stem cells; and ameloblasts. Differentially expressed miRNAs from these regions are likely involved in the renewal and differentiation of stem cells.
