TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Thermotoga maritima under multiple growth conditions [tiling array]

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima MSB8

SUMMARY
Investigation of transcripts (boundary, level, etc.) across the entire T. maritima genome in mulitple growth conditions, including logphase, late exponential, heat shock and hydrogen inhibited conditions. The new genome annotation has been approved by Genbank [CP004077, pending release of the manuscript].

DESIGN
A fourteen array expression profiling study was performed using total RNA from four distinct growth conditions collected under maltose minimal media.
