TITLE
Choroid Plexus Expression Data from Add1 Null Mice on the C57BL/6J Background Strain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Add1 Null mice on the C57BL/6J background develop hydrocephalus that may be due to gene expression changes in the choroid plexus. We used microarrays to detail choroid plexi gene expression prior to the manifestation of hydrocephalus.

DESIGN
Choroid plexi from the four ventricle were dissected out, for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays, from  male Add1 wildtype, heterozygous and null mice at three weeks of age.  Five mice were selected for each genotype to assess gene expression prior to the development of hydrocephalus.
