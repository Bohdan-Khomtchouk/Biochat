TITLE
DNA microarray data from transgenic rice Huahui 1 (HH1) and its parent Minghui 63 (MH63)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis has been proved to be an effective method in investigating unintended effects in genetically modified (GM) crops. But the distribution of differentially expressed genes in GM crops remains unclear. So the results of microarray analysis might be invalid for assessment of unintended effects if differentially expressed genes are extremely distributed. We used microarrays to study the distribution pattern of differentially expressed genes in HH1 at different developmental stages and environmental conditions.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from both HH1 and MH63 at different developmental stages and environmental conditions and were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected differentially expressed genes, common differentially expressed genes and common significantly changed pathways hoping to clarify the distributions of differentially expressed genes in HH1.
