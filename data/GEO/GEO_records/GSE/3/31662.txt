TITLE
Grape skin transcriptome in the berries cultured in vitro treated with exogenous abscisic acid

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The softened green berries of Cabernet Sauvignon were cultured in a Petri dish. 0.3M sucrose solution with (±)-abscisic acid (ABA) and without (±)-ABA (control) were applied to the Petri dishes. The berry skins were sampled at 3 and 10 days after the application. PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Kazuya Koyama.  The equivalent experiment is VV17 at PLEXdb.

DESIGN
ABA treated - time: 3 days(2-replications); ABA treated - time: 10 days(2-replications); Non-treated (control) - time: 3 days(2-replications); Non-treated (control) - time: 10 days(2-replications)
