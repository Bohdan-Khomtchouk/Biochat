TITLE
Expression data for effector T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined differential gene expression in na誰ve human CD4+ T cells, as well as in effector Th1, Th17-negative and Th17-enriched CD4- T cell subsets. We observed a marked enrichment for increased gene expression in effector CD4+ T cells compared to naive CD4+ among immune-mediated disease oci genes. Within effector T cells, expression of disease-associated genes was increased in Th17-enriched compared to Th17-negative cells. We used microarray to examine the gene expresssion profile and level of human na誰ve, Th1 and effector T cell subsets.

DESIGN
Human PBMCs were isolated and sorted to na誰ve, CD161-CCR6- and CD161+CCR6+ memory T cells. Na誰ve T cells were differentiatied to Th1 cells, and CD161-CCR6- and CD161+CCR6+ memory T cells were in vitro expanded for Th17-negative and Th17-enriched effector T cells. The gene profile was compared among naive, Th1, Th17-negative, and Th17-enriched cell subsets.
