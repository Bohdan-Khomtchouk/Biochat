TITLE
Augmented hematopoiesis in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with Down syndrome.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes, which led to the augmented hematopoiesis in DS-iPS cells, we performed gene expression profiling of D12-DS-iPS cells (DS-iPS-T32, DS-iPS-T33 and DS-iPS-T31) and control hiPS cells (253G1, 253G4 and A31) generated by 3 factors.  In the comparison of gene expression levels in each DS-iPS cell clone with the average of these in control iPS cell clones, 972 genes showed more than 2-fold increased expression, and 1118 genes showed decreased expression in all DS-iPS cell clones. Among these upregulated genes, 61 genes including GATA1 were involved in hematopoiesis-related genes according to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Among the above 2-fold more upregulated genes in DS-iPS cells, 18 genes were on Hsa21. The expression of RUNX1 on Hsa21, a hematopoiesis-related gene, was significantly upregulated in DS-iPS cells. The high expressions of GATA1 and RUNX1 were also identified in 4-factor DS-iPS cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in blood cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with Down syndrome and healthy donor was measured in 12 days after induction of differentiation. Eight cell lines were used.
