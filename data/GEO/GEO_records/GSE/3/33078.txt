TITLE
Comparison of intestinal surface CD3- refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII) cell lines with intestinal surface CD3+ cell lines of non-RCDII patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional differences between aberrant (surface CD3-) RCDII cell lines and regular (surface CD3+) intraepithelial cell lines in order to characterize aberrant RCDII cells. All cell lines were cultured from duodenal biopsies of RCDII or non-RCDII (either celiac or non-celiac) patients.

DESIGN
We compared 3 RCDII cell lines from RCDII patients P1-P3 with the following control cell lines: CD3+CD4+ T cell line from P1 and P3,  CD3+CD8+ T cell line from P3 and mixed CD4/CD8+ T cell lines from non-RCDII patients. All control cells matched the phenotype of mature T cells (CD3+CD4+ and/or CD3+CD8+). Samples were randomly distributed among two BeadChips and measured in duplicates.
