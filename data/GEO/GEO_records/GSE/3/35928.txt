TITLE
Expression of FRY-targeting shRNA in MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified the predicted FRY gene as a candidate mammary carcinoma susceptibility gene. This gene has not been characterized in mammals, so for part of our analysis we conducted microarray experiments to look at the changes in gene expression which occur when FRY-targeting shRNA is expressed in the nontumorigenic MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line (a cell line which we identified as having higher FRY mRNA expression than breast cancer cell lines). We used microarrays to identify the FRY interactome and identified that FRY affects the expression of gene networks that maintain normal cellular and tissue architecture, organization, differentiation of epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Three RNA samples were utilized for each of the two types of cell transfection.  These samples varied in passage number.
