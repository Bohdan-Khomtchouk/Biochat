TITLE
Effects of template switching (TS) primer and cDNA cleanup columns on T7 based RNA linear amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification Table 1 This experiment was designed to determine the effects of template switching (TS) primer and the type of columns used in ds cDNA cleanup on the fidelity of the T7 based RNA linear amplification. BC91 total RNA was amplified with or without TS primer and with two different ds cDNA cleanup protocols. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
