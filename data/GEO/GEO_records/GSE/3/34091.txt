TITLE
Nucleosome dynamics specifies genome-wide binding of the male germ cell gene regulator CTCFL and of CTCF [Mouse430_2 Expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of CTCFL mutation on the transcriptional program in testes

DESIGN
Testis RNA extracted from CTCFL wildtype and mutant mice was hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse430_2 arrays
