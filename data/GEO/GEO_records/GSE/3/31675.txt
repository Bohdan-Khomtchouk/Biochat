TITLE
High temperature effect on Cabernet Sauvignon berries

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The experiment was conducted using four 11-year-old potted  grapevines of V. vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted on  SO4 (Selection Oppenheim No. 4) grown in a phytotron. Vines  were trained on a Guyot trellising system and each vine carried  4-10 clusters of grapes. The experiment started approximately  1 week before veraison, when berry softening started, and continued  to fruit maturity. The two temperature regimes consisted of a high  day (06.00–20.00 h) temperature (max.35C) and a control (max.  25C). Under both conditions, the night-time (20.00–06.00 h)  temperature was 20C.
