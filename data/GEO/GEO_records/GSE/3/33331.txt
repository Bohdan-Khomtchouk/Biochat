TITLE
Expression data from high grade astrocytoma surgical samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Survival in the majority of high grade astrocytoma (HGA) patients is very poor, with only a rare population of long-term survivors. A better understanding of the biological factors associated with long-term survival in HGA would aid development of more effective therapy and prognostication. We used microarray gene expression profiling of 26 patient surgical samples with known clinical outcomes to discover novel prognostic markers.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from surgical tumor samples using Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips. All genes were correlated with survival as a continuous variable in order to identify ontologys associated with risk of recurrence.
