TITLE
Genotyping Tool for Studying Epidemiologically Related Isolates

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Replicates of strains used in comparison of microarray to RAPD analysis for the publication. Findings from use of an open-reading frame-specific Campylobacter jejuni DNA microarray to investigate genetic diversity among clinical isolates associated with 5 independent clusters of infection were compared with data from random amplified polymeric DNA (RAPD) and Penner serotyping analyses. The DNA microarray provides a highly specific epidemiological typing tool for analysis of C. jejuni isolates and reveals both divergent and highly conserved gene classes among isolates Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
