TITLE
Role of miR-146a in colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs exert various biological functions by targeting different cellular targets. Studying miR-146a functions in colon cancer cells helps to understand colorectal cancer (CRC) malignancy and progression.

DESIGN
HT29 miR-146a-expressing cells and empty control cells were established for mining the gene expression profiles upon miR-146a expression.
