MMS toxicogenomics collaboration Affymetrix data

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
In order to screen candidate genes that discriminate genotoxic hepatocarcinogens from nongenotoxic ones, we compared gene expression in the liver of mice treated with 6 genotoxic hepatocarcinogens or 5 nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens.

DESIGN
6 genotoxic and 2 non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens with expression time of 4h, 20h, 14 days, and 28 days
