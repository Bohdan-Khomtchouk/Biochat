Recurrent Variations in DNA Methylation in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells and their Differentiated Derivatives [Illumina Infinium 27K DNA Methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are potential sources of cells for modeling disease and development, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. However, it is important to identify factors that may impact the utility of hPSCs for these applications. In an unbiased analysis of 205 hPSC and 130 somatic samples, we identified hPSC-specific epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations in genes subject to X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and genomic imprinting, which were not corrected during directed differentiation. We also found that specific tissue types were distinguished by unique patterns of DNA hypomethylation, which were recapitulated by DNA demethylation during in vitro directed differentiation. Our results suggest that verification of baseline epigenetic status is critical for hPSC-based disease models in which the observed phenotype depends on proper XCI or imprinting, and that tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns can be accurately modeled during directed differentiation of hPSCs, even in the presence of variations in XCI or imprinting.

DESIGN
To obtain a comprehensive view of hPSC-specific epigenomic patterns, we collected 136 hESC and 69 hiPSC samples representing more than 100 cell lines for analysis.  In order to establish expected variation in human tissues, we collected 80 high-quality and well-replicated samples representing 17 distinct tissue types from multiple individuals. Finally, we selected 50 additional samples from primary cell lines of diverse origin to control for any aberrations that may arise as a general, non-hPSC-specific, consequence of in vitro manipulation. With these samples, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiling using the Illumina Infinium 27K and 450K DNA Methylation BeadChips as well as the Illumina HT12v3 Gene Expression BeadArray.
