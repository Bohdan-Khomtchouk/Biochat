TITLE
Global expression analysis identified a preferentially NGF-induced transcriptional program regulated by sustained MEK/ERK and AP-1 activation during PC12 differentiation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF is a prototypical model in which signal duration determines a biological response. Sustained ERK activity induced by NGF, as compared to transient activity induced by EGF, is critical to the differentiation of these cells. To characterize the transcriptional program activated preferentially by NGF, we compared global gene expression profiles between cells treated with NGF and EGF for 2-4 hrs, when sustained ERK signaling in response to NGF is most distinct from the transient signal elicited by EGF. This analysis identified 69 genes that were preferentially upregulated in response to NGF.

DESIGN
PC12 cells that were starved in low serum media for 24 hrs were treated with NGF (50ng/mL) or EGF (25ng/mL) for 2 or 4 hrs, or left untreated.  Total RNA for 3 independent biological replicates was extracted and subjected to Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0ST Arrays.  The 69 genes that were preferentially upregulated by NGF compared to EGF met the following criteria: NGF/No treatment log2 > 1, FDR p value < 0.01 and NGF/EGF log2 > 0.75, FDR p value < 0.01.
