TITLE
ArrayCGH from human neural progenitor cells (NHNP) and NHNP cells after differentiation induction 

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NHNP cells (Lonza, Belgium) were grown in Maintenance medium for 24 h. Differentiation was induced by withdrawal of EGFand FGF and addition of BDNF. ArrayCGH experiments were done before differentiation, 24h, 2d and 5d after differentiation induction. 

DESIGN
ArrayCGH from undifferentiated NHNP cells, 24h differentiated NHNP cells, 2d differentiated NHNP cells and 5d differentiated NHNP cells
