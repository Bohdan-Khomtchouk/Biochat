TITLE
CDK8 and MED12 knockdown in R1 mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of R1 mouse ES cells infected with non-targeting control (NTC) shRNA and two different shRNA sequences against Cdk8 (shCdk8-1 and shCdk-2) and Med12 (shMed12-1 and shMed12-2).

DESIGN
Multi-condition experiment comparing shNTC versus shCdk8-1 and shCdk8-2 after 8 days (3 biological replicates each) and shNTC versus shCdk8-1, shCdk8-2, shMed12-1, and shMed12-2 after 13 days (3 biological replicates each); in total 24 samples profiled.
