TITLE
MicroRNA expression during somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Viridiplantae

SUMMARY
The microarray test aims to find the miRNAs involved in somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.  The plant microRNA array V2.0 (CapitalBio Corp., Beijing, China) contained 426 non-reduplicated plant miRNA probes, including 188 in Arabidopsis. Finally, 75 plant miRNAs expressed differentially, 36 increased and 39 decreased included.
