TITLE
Preoperative Diagnosis of Benign Thyroid Nodules with Indeterminate Cytology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: Following fine needle aspiration, 15-30% of thyroid nodules are not clearly benign or malignant. These cytologically indeterminate nodules are often referred for diagnostic surgery, though most prove benign. A novel diagnostic test measuring the expression of 167 genes has shown promise in improving pre-operative risk assessment. We evaluated this test in a prospective, multicenter study. METHODS: Over 19 months, we performed a prospective study at 49 clinical sites enrolling 3,789 patients and collecting 4,812 samples from thyroid nodules > 1cm requiring evaluation. We obtained 577 cytologically indeterminate aspirates with corresponding histopathology of excised lesions on 413. Central blinded histopathologic review served as the reference (“gold”) standard. After applying inclusion criteria, gene expression classifier results were obtained for 265 indeterminate nodules used in this analysis, and performance was calculated. RESULTS: 85 of 265 indeterminate nodules were malignant. The gene expression classifier correctly identified 78 of 85 as ‘suspicious’ (92% sensitivity, [84%-97%] 95% CI). Specificity was 52%, [44%-59%]. The negative predictive value was 95%, 94%, and 85%, respectively, for aspirates with AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN, or ‘suspicious’ cytology. Analysis of 7 false negative cases revealed 6 with a paucity of thyroid follicular cells, suggesting that insufficient sampling of the nodule had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Though individualized clinical care is recommended, these data support consideration of a conservative approach for most patients with indeterminate FNA cytology and benign gene expression classifier results.
