TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad [Cyp26b1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the function of retinoic acid in the male germ cell differentiation, we performed expression microarray analysis of the Cyp26b1-/- male gonads from E12.5 to E15.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each stage and genotype for each experiment.
