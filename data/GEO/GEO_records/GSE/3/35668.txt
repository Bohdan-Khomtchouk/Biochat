TITLE
Parental MeWo and highly metastatic LM2 human melanoma cell line derivatives with or without miR-199a or miR-1908

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human melanoma MeWo cells and their respective LM2 metastatic derivatives, generated through in vivo selection, were transcriptomically profiled in the context of miR-199a and miR-1908 gain- and loss-of-function in order to identify putative target genes for these miRNAs,

DESIGN
MeWo cells and their respective LM2 metastatic derivatives in the context of miR-199a and miR-1908 gain- and loss-of-function
