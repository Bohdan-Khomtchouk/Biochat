TITLE
Gene expression in adipose tissue of intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) and Macrosomic animals that developed in a crowded uterine horn

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Animals that are growth restricted in utero may show rapid postnatal growth that ultimately results in adult obesity.  Macrosomic animals at birth typically remain large and are also obese as adults.  Our goal was to examine the differences between animals that reach obesity in different ways.  We also aimed to examine gene expression in animals that start out lean and stay lean compared to those that start out lean and become fat. We used microarrays to detail gene expression in adipose tissue.

DESIGN
3 samples each from IUGR animals with rapid postnatal growth (IH), IUGR animals with slower postnatal growth (IL), and macromsomic animals (M).
