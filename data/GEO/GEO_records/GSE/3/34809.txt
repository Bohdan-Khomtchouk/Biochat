TITLE
A transcriptomic analysis of the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increases in NADPH oxidation [2010]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Experience 2: 59A vs. 59A NADH Bdh200 mM, 59A NADPH Bdh200mM and 59A NADPH Bdh300 mM

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA samples of three replicates by strain extracted from cells harvested at mid-exponential phase of wine fermentation
