TITLE
Expression data from Escherichia coli O157:H7, strain EDL933, cultivated in caecal content of rats associated with the human intestinal microbiota

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The human intestinal microbiota associated with rats produces in vivo a soluble(s) factor(s) that down-regulates the expression of genes encoding for the Shiga toxin II in E. coli O157:H7. The Shiga toxin II is one of the major virulence factors of E. coli enterohemorragic leading to the deadly hemolitic and uremic syndrome. Investigation of the effect of the human intestinal microbiota on the whole transcriptome of EHEC O157:H7 is of major importance to increase our understanding of the pathogen transcriptomic adaptation in response to the human microbiota. We analysed by microarray hybridization the gene expression pattern of EHEC O157:H7 grown in the caecal content of germ-free rats or rats associated with the human microbiota of a healthy human subject. By doing so, we increased our understanding of the regulatory activities of the human gut microbiota on E. coli O157:H7
