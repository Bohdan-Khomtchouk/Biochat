TITLE
Genome-wide analysis rice transcriptional change during the early stages of false smut formation caused by Ustilaginoidea virens [set A]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice false smut is a common fungal disease caused by Ustilaginoidea virens. As it only scatter occured in panicle at florescence, little information is known about this crop disease. Here, we injected suspension spores into a susceptible indica rice cultivar 9311 booting panicle (infected water as mock) and divided the early disease symptom into 3 uninterrupted stages(S) at 6 day post inoculation (dpi): the infected pistil became expand (S1), the hyphae began to infect the bottom of anthers (S2) and the hyphae growth went on and surrounded the floral organ forming a floral-hyphae complex (S3). To gain insight into rice putatively differential responses to U. virens, all 3 infected and mock spikes with same spike length were collected and analyzed by Solexa/Illuminaâs digital gene expression (DGE) system, BGI. Our results contribute to the knowledge of understanding rice molecular mechanism in response to U. virens infection.

DESIGN
Four samples including one control (CK) and three infected (S1, S2, S3) were analyzed
