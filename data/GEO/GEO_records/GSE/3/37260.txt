TITLE
Analysis of potential transcriptomic biomarkers for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is the characterize and compare heart and PBMC transcriptomes of rats treated with doxorubicin in order to isolate a list of similarly differentially regulated genes with an ultimate goal to indentify PBMC biomarkers for early prediction of doxirubicinduced cardiotoxicity

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PBMC and hearts of rats treated with doxirubicin or saline for 48 hrs and used for gene expression
