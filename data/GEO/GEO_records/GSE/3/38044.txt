TITLE
Gene activation by Rag-mediated DNA double-strand breaks in G1-phase murine pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective is to identify genes that are differentially expressed following the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the Rag proteins in murine pre-B cells. Cells lacking Artemis are used since the Rag-induced DSBs will not be repaired, and thus, will provide a continuous stimulus to the cell.

DESIGN
Murine v-abl-transformed pre-B cells were treated with 3 uM STI571 for 48 hours. Cell types included RAG-2-deficient (3 biological replicates) and Artemis-deficient (3 biological replicates) G1-phase pre-B cells. Each sample was hybridized once using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 2.0 GeneChip arrays (Mouse 430 v2, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Data were analyzed using the RAG-2-deficient samples as the controls.
