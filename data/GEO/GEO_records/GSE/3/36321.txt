TITLE
Gene expression analysis of H9 hESC derived neuron stem cells (NSC) harboring pathogenic LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic mutations on leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. The Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation on LRRK2 gene is a relatively common cause of familial Parkinson's disease in Caucasian population. In this study, we generated H9 hESC harboring LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation by gene knockin. Wildtype and LRRK2 mutant hESC were differentiated into NSC using a chemically defined protocol.

DESIGN
LRRK2 mutant NSC were treated with or without the LRRK2 kinase specific inhibitor (LRRK2-IN-1). Global gene expression analysis was performed to assess the overall similarity of gene expression profiles among three NSC groups (wildtype; LRRK2 mutant; LRRK2 mutant with inhibitor treatment).
