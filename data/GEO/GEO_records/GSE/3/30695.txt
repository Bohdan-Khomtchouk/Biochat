TITLE
Viral microRNA expression in two nasal NK T cell lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used microarray profiling to examine the expression of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) in two independently derived nasal natural killer T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) cell lines, SNK6 and SNT16.  The goal of the study was to investigate the role of the viral miRNAs in the genesis and maintenance of NKTCLs.
