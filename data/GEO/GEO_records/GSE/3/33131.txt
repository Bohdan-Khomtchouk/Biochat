TITLE
Escherichia coli O157:H7 Isolates Related to the 2006 Spinach-associated Outbreak Exhibit Distinct Transcriptional Profiles

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptional profiles of 12 E. coli O157:H7 isolates grown to stationary phase in LB broth. These isolates possess the same two enzyme PFGE profile and are related temporally or geographically to the above outbreak. These E. coli O157:H7 isolates included three clinical isolates, five isolates from separate bags of spinach, and single isolates from pasture soil, river water, cow feces, and a feral pig.
