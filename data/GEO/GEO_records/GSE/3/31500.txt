TITLE
Methylation study of Theobroma cacao L. clones raised under alternative temperature conditions.

ORGANISM
Theobroma cacao

SUMMARY
Methylation differences between SIC 5 cocoa seedlings germinated in a common environment before growth for 74 days under semic controlled environmental conditions set to mimic the Malaysian or Brazilian temperature environment. Genomic DNA sonicated and the methylated fraction enriched using a 5-methylcytosine antibody before whole genome amplification and hybridisation to the array.
