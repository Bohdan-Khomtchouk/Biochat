TITLE
Miniature pigs tooth germ tissue: four different developing stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression profile of four typical stages of tooth development, embryonic day 35 (E35), E45, E50, and E60, which cover the major morphological and physiological changes in pig tooth germ growth and development throughout pregnancy, including the bud, cap, early bell, and late bell stages.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: E35 vs. E45 vs. E50 vs. E60. Biological replicates: 3, independently removed under a microscope. Four replicates per array.
