TITLE
Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to type B trichothecenes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The evaluation of mycotoxicity of type B trichothecenes using a yeast gene expression comparison analysis. The yeast BY4743 derivative PDR5 mutant was used for this study. The yeast cells were treated with trichothecene mycotoxins, and incubated at 25 degree for two hours, respectively. Total RNA was isolated with commercial kit (FastRNA Pro Red kit, Q-Biogene), and amplified RNA (aRNA) was synthesized with 3'IVT Express kit (Affymetrix). All samples were hybridized with Gene Chip (Yeast Genome 2.0 Array, Affymetrix), then each array chip was scanned by GeneChip Sanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
