TITLE
Transcriptional responses of resistant and susceptible fish clones to the bacterial pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptional response to the bacteria in the pronephros of a susceptible and a resistant line by micro-array analysis five days after infection

DESIGN
Four to seven individual fishes have been analyzed for each experimental condition : Infected or Control ; Susceptible or resistant line
