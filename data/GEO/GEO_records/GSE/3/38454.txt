TITLE
Analysis of the global gene expression in VEGF-B transgenic rat hearts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We show that an excess of VEGF-B protects the heart via adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and increased coronary arterial reserve, and by inducing a shift from lipid to glucose metabolism.

DESIGN
Six VEGF-B overexpressing transgenic hearts were compared to six littermate wildtype controls
