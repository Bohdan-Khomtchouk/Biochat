TITLE
Expression changes in HeLa cells treated with siRNA against HCFC1 or control luciferase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared in triplicate mRNA levels from cells treated with siRNA against either HCF-1 or, as a negative control, luciferase.  We observed that 19% of Refseq annotated genes are differentially expressed (either up or down regulated with a multiple testing corrected p value of â‰¤ 0.05) upon depletion of HCF-1.  This large number of differentially expressed genes upon HCF-1 depletion demonstrates a broad role of HCF-1 in the regulation of gene expression.
