TITLE
Pulmonary miRNA expression in C57BL/6 non-pregnant female mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs were measured in mice exposed to vehicle control (0.9% NaCl MilliQ water containing 10% v/v acellular BAL) or 0.162 mg Printex 90 in vehicle by intratracheal instillation and sacrificed 1, 3 and 28 days after exposure.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.000 or 0.162 mg Printex 90 and sacrificed 1, 3 and 28 days after exposure. Individual total RNA enriched with small RNA from 6 mice per treatment group (control and 0.162mg) was hybridized to 8 x 15K Agilent miRNA slides.
