TITLE
Shifted Metabolic Bias in Livers of Mice Lacking Hepatocytic Thioredoxin Reductase-1 Protects Against Acetaminophen Toxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic disruption of thioredoxin reductase 1 protects against acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity. To determine the role of the thioredoxin system on xenobiotic metabolism we challeneged wildtype and txnrd1liver-null mice with acetaminophen.

DESIGN
Adult male wildtype and txnrd1 liver-null mice (C57BL6/J) were treated with either saline (PBS) or 100mg/kg APAP. Liver RNA was harvested eight hours after challenge and processed for microarray analysis. Comparison of 2 treatment conditions in 2 genotypes, biological replicates in triplicate.
