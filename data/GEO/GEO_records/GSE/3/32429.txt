TITLE
Toxic effects of dietary methylmercury (MeHg) on juvenile rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
Juvenile rainbow trout were fed Biodiet starter (4% body weight per day) with MeHg added at 0, 0.5, 5 and 50 ppm for six weeks. Atomic absorption spectrometry was applied to measure the level of MeHg in the whole fish body. Trout at six weeks were sampled from each group for gene expression analysis by cGRASP 16K cDNA microarrays. MeHg-exposed rainbow trout did not show overt signs of toxicity, nor were significant differences seen in mortality, length, mass, or condition factor. The chronic accumulation of total Hg in trout exhibited dose- and time-dependent patterns. The dysregulated genes have multiple functional annotations, such as involving metabolism, cellular development, ion binding and homeostasis, stress response, immune response, transcriptional regulation, hemolytic development, and apoptotic pathways. These results show that numerous molecular pathways involved in the growth and development of multiple organ systems are disrupted by exposure to moderate levels of dietary MeHg.  The dysregulated genes will be selected by further analysis and used as biomarkers for MeHg exposure in aquatic environments.
