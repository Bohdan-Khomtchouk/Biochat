TITLE
Development and application of a new immunophenotypic algorithm for molecular subtype classification of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): Report from an International DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied 498 de-novo adult DLBCL cases, which had been diagnosed between January 2002 and October 2009, as part of the International DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program Study We perform global gene expression profiling from formalin fixed paraffin embedded 498 DLBCL tissues RNA by SPIA mediated microarray detection and identified the distinct subgroups of the disease within DLBCL, known as germinal-center-B-cell-like (GCB), activated B-cell-like (ABC), and unclassified DLBCL (UC).

DESIGN
RNA of 498 FFPET DLBCL patient samples were extracted, amplified using a novel RNA amplicfication method, Single Primer Isothermal Amplification (SPIA, NuGen Inc.), and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. This dataset is the collaboration between The University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center and Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.
