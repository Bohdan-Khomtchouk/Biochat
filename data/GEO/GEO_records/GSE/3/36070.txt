TITLE
iCLIP analysis of EZH2-interacting RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAs directly interacting with EZH2 were isolated from human colorectal HCT116 cells using an in vivo crosslinking and immunoprecipitation strategy (iCLIP, KÃ¶nig J et al, Nat Struct Mol Biol 2010) coupled to an ultrasequencing approach.

DESIGN
RIP sequencing for 1 Human sample
