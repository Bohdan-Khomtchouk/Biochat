TITLE
Transcription profile of fetal human CD140a-defined OPC differentiation in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fetal dissociates from 19-22 week gestational age were magnetically sorted for CD140a antigen. CD140a-defined OPCs were plated into serum free conditions and allowed to differentiate in the absence of growth factors or mitogens. RNA was extracted from cells immediately following isolation and every day for 4 days. To block differentiation, matched cells were cultured in the presence of PDGF-AA (10ng/ml). This treatment prevents the acquisition of O4-positive oligodendrocyte cell fate and delays MBP mRNA expression by human CD140a-sorted OPCs.

DESIGN
29 samples, 4 time points, 2 media conditions, at least three biological replicates per time point and media condition
