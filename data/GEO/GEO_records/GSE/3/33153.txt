TITLE
Copy number analysis of high-grade osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed copy number analysis of high-grade osteosarcoma samples. in order to detect osteosarcoma drivers, we integrated these data with genome-wide gene expression data. We performed two different methods - a non-paired and a paired integrative analysis.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis was performed on 32 pre-treatment high-grade osteosarcoma diagnostic biopsies, of which 29 overlapped with the 84 samples used for gene expression analyses.
