TITLE
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 wild-type grown in CDM+10 mM arginine compared to D39 wild type grown in CDM + 0.05 mM arginine

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
Comparison of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 wild-type grown in CDM+10 mM arginine compared to D39 wild type grown in CDM + 0.05 mM arginine to define the genome-wide transcriptional response to arginine. Details described in Kloosterman TG and Kuipers OP. ArgR1 and AhrC Mediate Arginine-Dependent Regulation of Arginine Acquisition- and Virulence Genes in the Human Pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.

DESIGN
Two condition design comparison of wild type strain
