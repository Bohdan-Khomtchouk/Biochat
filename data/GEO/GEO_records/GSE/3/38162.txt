TITLE
Transcription profile in patients with cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot undergoing corrective surgery using controlled reoxygenation cardiopulmonary bypass

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine cardiac transcription profile in cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot patients subjected to conrolled reoxygenation cardiopulmonary bypass, we collected myocardial samples at the end of the ischemic time. The transcriptional profile of the mRNA in these samples was measured with gene array technology

DESIGN
Myocardial samples were collected at the end of ischemic time from cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot patients undergoing corrective surgery using conrolled reoxygenation cardiopulmonary bypass
