TITLE
Profiling brain cortex from tMCAO rat stroke model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This program addresses the gene signature associated with brain (cortex) in the tMCAO rat model for stroke.

DESIGN
The tMCAO stroke model profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in brain cortex of the Sprague Dawley rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion compared to the sham-operated controls.
