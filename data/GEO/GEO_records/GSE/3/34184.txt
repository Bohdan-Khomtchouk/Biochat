TITLE
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array assay of 15 human MLL-associated samples and 9 human normal bone marrow   [HuEx-1_0-st]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential target genes of leukemia-related miRNAs such as miR-196b and miR-150 in human MLL-associated leukemia, we performed Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array assay of 15 human MLL-associated samples and 9 human normal bone marrow (including 3 each of CD34+, CD33+, and MNC) cell samples.

DESIGN
A total of 15 MLL-associated (9 primary untreated leukemia and 6 leukemia cell line) samples and 9 human normal bone marrow samples (including 3 each of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor, CD33+ myeloid, and mononuclear cell (MNC) samples) were analyzed by use of Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetirx, Santa Clara, CA).
