TITLE
Expression data from pig BMDM treated with salmonella LPS

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) grown in macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) have been used widely in studies of macrophage biology and the response to toll-like receptor agonists. We investigated whether similar cells could be derived from the domestic pig. Cultivation of pig bone marrow cells for 5-7 days in presence of rhCSF-1 generated a pure population of BMDM that expressed the usual macrophage markers (CD14, CD16, CD163, CD172a), are potent phagocytic cells and produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bone marrow cells could be stored frozen and thawed, providing a renewable resource. We profiled gene expression in pig BMDM from outbred animals (Large-White Landrace F1cross) responding to LPS using Affymetrix microarrays. The temporal cascade of inducible and repressible genes more closely-resembled human than mouse macrophages, and included genes involved in tryptophan metabolism (IDO, KYN), lymphoattractant chemokines (CCL20) and the vitamin D3-converting enzyme Cyp27B1. Conversely, pig BMDM, like human macrophages, did not induce genes involved in arginine metabolism, nor did they produce nitric oxide. The data establish pig BMDM as an alternative tractable model for the study of macrophage transcriptional control.

DESIGN
RNA for gene expression analysis was collected at time points 0, 2, 7 and 24 hours post LPS stimulation (100ng/ml). Each time point included BMDM from the same three pigs and each cell culture was replicated. The replicate of the pig3_24h was not suitable for RNA analysis. Therefore, a total of 23 microarrays were hybridized.
