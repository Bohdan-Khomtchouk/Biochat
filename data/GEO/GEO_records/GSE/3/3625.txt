Effects of neonatal dosing of SERMs on CD1 mouse uterine gene expression at 3 months

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is an effective treatment for breast cancers. In the CD-1 mouse model, neonatal oral dosing with tamoxifen leads to the development of adenomyosis.  Both 4-hydroxyestradiol and tamoxifen can form DNA-reactive metabolites and may be involved in carcinogenesis of the uterus. After comparing the uterotrophic response of several SERMs the maximal uterotrophic doses of estradiol (100mg/kg) 4-hydroxyestradiol (385mg/kg) and tamoxifen (250mg/kg) were determined. Maximal uterotrophic doses were given orally to newborn CD-1 mice on days 1 – 4 after birth and gene and pathological changes examined in the uterus at 3 months after dosing. ERKOa knockout mice were dosed orally with tamoxifen (1mg/Kg) on days 1 – 4 after birth and uterine gene expression compared with CD-1 mice.
