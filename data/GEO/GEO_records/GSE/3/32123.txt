TITLE
Expression data from Aspergillus niger comparing aerial structures with vegetative mycelium

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88

SUMMARY
A. niger undergoes dramatic changes during asexual development. We tried to identify the differences in RNA expression levels that are important for this development. We used micro-arrays to determine which genes were up- or down-regulated in the aerial structures, the part of the colony that is formed during asexual development.
