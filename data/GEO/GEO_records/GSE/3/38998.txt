TITLE
RNA sequencing in fly heads to examine the effect of spermidine feeding on transcription in the ageing fly brain.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
mRNA sequencing was used to identify genome wide transcriptional changes occuring in fly heads in response to spermidine feeding. This study shed light on the molecular mechanisms through wich spermidine can protect against age-dependent memory impairment.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from 3 and 10 day old Drosophila melanogaster heads were generated in duplicate by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx. mRNA profiles from flies that were fed food with 5mM spermidine were compared to profiles from flies that had no spermidine in thier food.
