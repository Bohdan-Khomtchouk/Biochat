TITLE
Real time quantitative PCR analysis of murine macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine macrophages were isolated from the lungs of mice given a pulmonary challenge with C. neoformans strain H99. Mice were either given a protective (H99Î³) or a mock (HKCn) immunization prior to C. neoformans H99 challenge, and macrophages were isolated from the lungs of mice 24 hours, 3 days, or 7 days post-challenge using anti-CD11b microbeads according to the Miltenyi cell sorting system. We used SA Biosciences Toll-like Receptor PCR assay panel to quantitate gene expression of signal transduction factors in total RNA isolated from macrophages derived from immunized mice compared to non-immunized.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Macrophages from 5 mice per group were pooled and assayed as indicated in the summary. Each experiment was performed 3 times and the resulting Ct values of each group from each experiment averaged prior to data analysis. TIme points were analyzed separately
