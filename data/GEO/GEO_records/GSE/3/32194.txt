TITLE
Changes of miRNA expression in granulocytes of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) receiving INCB018424 in a Phase 2 study

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
A global microRNA expression profile was obtained from gradient-purified granulocytes ( > 95% pure) collected at the time of screening and at cycle 4 of treatment Protocol #18424-256 is a Phase 2 study of the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor INCB01842 in patients with advanced polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) refractory to hydroxyurea;
