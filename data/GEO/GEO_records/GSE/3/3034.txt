SUMMARY
Tumor cell lines and drug-resistant counterparts.  These data support the publication Gyorffy et al, Oncogene 2005 (July), Prediction of doxorubicin sensitivity in breast tumors based on gene expression profiles of drug-resistant cell lines correlates with patient survival. We contrasted the expression profiles of 13 different human tumor cell lines of gastric (EPG85-257), pancreatic (EPP85-181), colon (HT29) and breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) origin and their counterparts resistant to the topoisomerase inhibitors daunorubicin, doxorubicin or mitoxantrone. We interrogated cDNA arrays with 43 000 cDNA clones ( approximately 30 000 unique genes) to study the expression pattern of these cell lines. A cell type comparison design experiment design type compares cells of different type for example different cell lines. Keywords: cell_type_comparison_design
