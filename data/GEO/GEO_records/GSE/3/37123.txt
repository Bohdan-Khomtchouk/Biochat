Gene expression signatures of MEF2D-silencing hepatocellular carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global expression profiles in Huh7 after infection with Lv-shMEF2D and Lv-scrambled, as well as transfection with siRNA-MEF2D and siRNA-control, were compared to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in MEF2D-mediated regulation of cell cycle.

DESIGN
In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in MEF2D-mediated regulation of cell cycle, we assessed gene expression profiles in Huh7 cells after infection with Lv-shMEF2D and Lv-scrambled, as well as transfection with siRNA-MEF2D and siRNA-control, by cDNA microarray. Analysis of global mRNA expression profile indicated a shift toward G2/M arrest in the cells after downregulating MEF2D expression. The genes that inhibit G2/M transition were found to be expressed in high level in MEF2D-downregulated group, as compared with control group. Meanwhile, mRNA abundance of G2/M transition-promoting genes, except CDC2 and CDC25C, was reduced when MEF2D expression was depressed in Huh7 cells
