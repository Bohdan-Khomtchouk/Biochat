Molecular mechanisms of partial resistance to Aphanomyces euteiches in Medicago truncatula (affy_molecularmechanism_medicago)

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
affy_molecularmechanism_medicago - affy_molecularmechanism_medicago - -Aphanomyces euteiches (Ae), a soilborne oomycete, is the causal agent of pea root rot, a major disease on various cultivated legume species. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying partial resistance to this pathogen, a pathosystem has been developed using the model legume Medicago truncatula (Mt). Two Mt accessions A17 and F83005.5 have been shown to display differential responses upon infection with Ae (partially resistance and susceptibility, respectively). Genetic analyses using a RIL population derived from a cross between those two lines lead to the identification of, prAe1, a major QTL involved in the observed partial resistance. Near isogenic lines (NIL) NR2 and NS2 whose genomes are identical except at the prAe1 locus (resistant alleles for NR2, susceptible alleles for NS2) have been generated, and the same differential response toward Ae has been found. The aim of this experiment is to analyse and compare NR2 and NS2 transcriptomes at 1 and 6 days after Ae inoculation to identify gene networks that are regulated in a prAe1 dependent manner.--Fifteen-day-old NR2 or NS2 plants were grown in vitro on M medium. The entire roots were then inoculated (or not = 0dpi) with a A. euteiches zoospores (75000zsp/ml) and harvested one or six days after inoculation. Three independent repeats were performed.
