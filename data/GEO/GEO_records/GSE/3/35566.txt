TITLE
Expression profiles of a panel of MSS and MSI colon cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling was used to identify genes differentially expressed in MSS (microsatellite stable) and MSI (microsatellite unstable) colon cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
5 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 5 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines profiled.  Each cell line grown and arrayed in duplicate, and the duplicates averaged for each cell line before calculating means for MSS and MSI lines.
