TITLE
Expression data from mouse testis cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our testis transplantation data demonstrate that only Sox2-GFP+c-kit- cells contain testis-repopulating potential and we wondered whether a molecular comparison of the Sox2-GFP+c-kit+ and Sox2-GFP+c-kit- spermatogonial cells would uncover genes that could explain the exclusive repopulation potential of the latter cell population. To this end, we sorted individual testis cell populations and subjected extracted and amplified RNA to array analysis.

DESIGN
Mouse testes of 2-week old Sox2GFP mice were isolated, and dissociated with collagenase. Single cell suspensions were generated and stained with FACS antibody for ckit. FACS analysis was done based on internal GFP signal and ckit antibody signal. PI was used to exclude dead cells. Sox2GFP+ckit- and Sox2GFP+ckit+ populations were sorted into Trizol and sent to ExpressionAnalysisR for processing and profiling. 20 testis were pooled into one sample, two biological replicates were analyzed.
