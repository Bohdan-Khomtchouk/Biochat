TITLE
Expression data from Shh-driven mouse medulloblastoma and control adult wild-type mouse cerellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric CNS cancer. In order to identify important molecules important for deregulated tumor cell growth, we use microarray to detail the global gene expression profile in Shh-driven mouse medulloblastomas and determine the most differentially expressed genes compared to the control wild-type cerebellum.

DESIGN
Medulloblastoma and control cerebellum tissues were dissected and processed for RNA extraction and microarray analyses using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST.  The mice were from a mixed genetic background  involving C57BL/6 and C3H strains.
