TITLE
Dorsal dependent CBP binding on a genome wide scale

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We find a high concordance between the binding of the Drosophila transcription factor Dorsal and the co-activator CBP during early embryogenesis. This relationship was furter examined by comparing CBP distribution in Drosophila embryos derived from wt and mutant flies lacking intranuclear Dorsal (gd7). Our data suggests a specific involvemet of CBP in initiating early dorsoventral patterning, but not in anterioposterior.

DESIGN
CBP ChIP seq of 2-4 hours old Drosophila embryos derived from w1118 (wild-type) or gd7 homozygous mutant mothers
