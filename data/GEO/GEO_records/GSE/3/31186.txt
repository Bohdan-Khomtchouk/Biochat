TITLE
The human Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein EWS-FLI1 causes Ewing's-type tumors in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The  fusion oncoprotein EWS-FLI1 arises from a t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation and causes Ewing's Sarcoma, a malignant bone tumor.  The mechanism whereby EWS-FLI1 transforms cells is unknown.  Somatic, mosaic expression of human EWS-FLI1 in zebrafish from the heat shock promoter [Tg(HSP:EWS-FLI1)] caused small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs) similar to human Ewing's sarcoma. We performed microarray studies comparing zebrafish SRBCTs to another tumor type, zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).  The results identify a conserved set of EWS-FLI1-regulated genes,and provide insight into the pathogenesis of Ewing's Sarcoma tumors.

DESIGN
Zebrafish SRBCTs arising from somatic insertions of the EWS-FLI1 transgene were collected.  MPNSTs from non-transgenic fish of the same genetic background were collected in parallel.  RNA was prepared from all samples and hybridized to zebrafish-specific Affymetrix arrays.
