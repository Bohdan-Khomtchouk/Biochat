TITLE
Expression Data from Brucella abortus strain 2308 and isogenic abcR1 abcR2 mutant cells

ORGANISM
Brucella abortus

SUMMARY
abcR1 and abcR2 produce two regulatory RNA molecules, that are produced during stationary phase growth. We used custom-made Affymetrix B. abortus strain 2308 derived GeneChips to compare the gene expression properties of wild type and isogenic abcR1 abcR2 double mutant cells.

DESIGN
B. abortus strain 2308 or abcR1 abcR2 double mutant cells were grown to stationary phase growth, total bacterial RNA was isolated and subjected to GeneChip hybridization and analysis.  We sought to determine the regulatory effects of abcR1 and abcR2 RNA species.
