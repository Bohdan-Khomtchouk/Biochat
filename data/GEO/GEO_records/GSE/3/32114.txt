TITLE
microRNA expression signatures and parallels between monocyte subsets and atherosclerotic plaque in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small non-coding microRNAs (miRs) have emerged to play critical roles in cardiovascular biology. Monocytes critically drive atherosclerotic plaque formation, and can be subdivided into a classical and non-classical subset. Here we scrutinized the miR signature of human classical and non-classical monocytes, and compared miR expression profiles of atherosclerotic plaques from human carotid arteries and healthy arteries.
