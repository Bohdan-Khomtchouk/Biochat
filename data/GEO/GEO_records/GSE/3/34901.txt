TITLE
Expression data from mouse lungs during E. coli pneumonia in the presence or absence of LIF neutralization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is amongst the IL-6 family cytokines expressed in the lungs during pneumonia.  However, the function of endogenous LIF during pneumonia has never been explored.  The purpose of this study was to determine the transcriptional response to pneumonia in the lungs and whether or how this response is influenced by LIF. Mice received intratracheal instillations of vehicle (PBS) or Escherichia coli (10^6 CFU).  Control IgG or anti-LIF specific IgG was included in the instillate.  24 hours after the challenge, lungs were collected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
RNA from 3 separate groups of mice (3 mice per group) was analyzed: 1) 24h Vehicle/control IgG-treated; 2) 24h E. coli/control IgG-treated; and 3) 24h E. coli/anti-LIF-specific IgG.
