TITLE
HEB and E2A function as SMAD/FOXH1 cofactors

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Nodal signaling, mediated through SMAD transcription factors, is necessary for pluripotency maintenance and endoderm commitment. We have identified a new motif, termed SMAD Complex Associated (SCA) that is bound by SMAD2/3/4 and FOXH1 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived endoderm. We demonstrate that two bHLH proteins - HEB and E2A - bind the SCA motif at regions overlapping SMAD2/3 and FOXH1. Further, we show that HEB and E2A associate with SMAD2/3 and FOXH1, suggesting they form a complex at critical target regions. This association is biologically important, as E2A is critical for mesendoderm specification, gastrulation, and Nodal signal transduction in Xenopus tropicalis embryos. Taken together, E2A is a novel Nodal signaling cofactor that associates with SMAD2/3 and FOXH1 and is necessary for mesendoderm differentiation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Smad2/3 and Input in X.tropicalis, stage 10.5 embryo.
