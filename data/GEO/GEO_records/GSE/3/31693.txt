TITLE
Overexpression of Ssz1 S295F and Zuo1 amino acids 365-433 S427G in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
WT strains were transformed with a control TAP plasmid, plasmid containing the Hsp70 chaperones Ssz1 containing a mutation in S295F, or J-domain containing protein Zuo1 amino acids 365-433 with the S427G mutation. These mutations are known to enhance the induction of the pleiotropic drug resistance pathway.

DESIGN
RNA from three biological replicates were pooled and analyzed by Nimblegen array.
