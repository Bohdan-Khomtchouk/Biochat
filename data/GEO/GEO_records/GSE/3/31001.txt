TITLE
Daphnia ecotypes fed lab versus natural resources

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
Consumer-resource interactions are a central issue in evolutionary and community ecology because they play important roles in selection and population regulation.  Most consumers encounter resource variation at multiple scales, and respond through phenotypic plasticity in the short term or evolutionary divergence in the long term.  The key traits for these responses may influence resource acquisition, assimilation and/or allocation.  To identify candidate genes, we experimentally assayed genome-wide gene expression in pond and lake Daphnia ecotypes exposed to alternate resource environments.  One was a simple, high-quality laboratory diet, Ankistrodesmus falcatus.  The other was the complex natural seston from a large lake.  In temporary ponds, Daphnia generally experience high-quality, abundant resources, whereas lakes provide low-quality, seasonally shifting resources that are chronically limiting.  For both ecotypes, we used replicate clones drawn from a number of separate populations.
