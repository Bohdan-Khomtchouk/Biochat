TITLE
Effect of squalene on liver transcriptome of mice lacking apolipoprotein E

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothesis that the squalene of olive oil might influence hepatic gene expression in an apoE and sex-dependent ways was tested in mice. Gene expression was analyzed using DNA microarrays in male apoE-deficient mice that received 1 g/kg/day of squalene for 10 weeks.

DESIGN
As initial screening of potential candidate genes involved in a differential response, only genes with remarkably modified expression (signal log2 ratio > 1.5 or < -1.5) were further considered
