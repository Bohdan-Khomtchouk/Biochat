TITLE
Gene expression after single and dual insulator protein knock-downs in Drosophila Kc cells.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional changes assayed with two bilogical replicates in wild type and RNAi mediated insulator knock-downs RNAi mediated insulator knock-downs cause changes in the H3K27me3 levels and spread of Topoisomerase II In order to understand the role of insulators in gene expression and regulation we used Drosophila Kc cells to knock-down single and multiple insulators in combination to assay for transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
Two biologial replicates were prepared in independent experiments. Each cDNA samples were labeled with Cy3 dye and hybridized and scaned as per manufactures instructions at Florida State University Nimblegen facility.
