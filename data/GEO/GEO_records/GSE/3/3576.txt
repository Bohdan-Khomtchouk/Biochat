TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of genes positively regulated by HapR

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Vibrio cholerae strains A1552 and ATN140 (A1552-delta-hapR) were diluted 1:100 from over night cultures and grown aerobically (at 250 rpm) in M9 minimal medium supplemented with vitamins (MEM vitamin solution, BRL) and 0.5% lactate. At OD600 ~ 0.3 2 mM (GlcNAc)6 (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) was added and the cultures were further shaken for 2 hours. After harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in Trizol reagent (GIBCO/BRL) and stored at -80 degrees C until further use. The procedure of RNA isolation and the corresponding amplicon microarray experiments was described by K. L. Meibom et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 101, 2524-9 (2004). Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
