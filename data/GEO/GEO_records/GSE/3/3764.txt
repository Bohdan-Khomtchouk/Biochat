TITLE
Expression Profile of Homogenous Bone Marrow Stromal Stem Cell Clones

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of bone marrow stromal cells in angiogenesis and tissue regeneration has previously been assessed by the use of heterogenous populations. This experiment is designed to assess the angiogenic potential of homogenous, well characterized clones and to provide gene expression profiling for these clones. Keywords: other
