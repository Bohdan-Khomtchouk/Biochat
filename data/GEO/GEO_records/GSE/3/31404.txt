TITLE
Expression profiling of LSK cells from Bmi1 cKO mice in hematopoiesis versus LSK control cells from WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bmi1 is a protein member of PRC1 and plays a major role in the maintenance of gene repression. We are studying the role of Bmi1 in the context of hematopoietic stem cell aging. We used microarray to study the gene expression profile of LSK cells in relation to the knocking-out of Bmi1 in vivo
