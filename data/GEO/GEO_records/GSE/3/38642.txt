TITLE
Expression data from human pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Close to 50 genetic loci have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but they explain only 15% of the heritability. In an attempt to identify additional T2D genes, we analyzed global gene expression in human islets from 63 donors.

DESIGN
Islets from cadaver donors (54 non-diabetic and 9 diabetic) were provided by the Nordic Islet Transplantation Programme (www.nordicislets.org), Uppsala University. The microarrays were performed using GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript according to Affymetrix standard protocol.
