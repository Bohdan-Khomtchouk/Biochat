TITLE
Changes in DNA methylation In cultered WI-38 cells over passages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Illumina infinium methylation array analysis to document spontaneous DNA methylation changes in human fibroblasts growing in long term culture. Starting with a culture derived from a single cell we compared the methylation profile of late passage clones with that of the initial culture, allowing unambiguous identification of methylation changes.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 5 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
