TITLE
Comparison of exercise and pregnancy-induced cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of mouse cardiac left ventricle gene expression: voluntary wheel exercise and pregnancy-induced cardiac hypertrophy

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis on RNA from left ventricles of mice in non-pregnant diestrus cycle, mid-pregnancy (MP), late-pregnancy (LP), and immediate post-partum (0PP). These were compared to 7days (7EX) and 21 days (21EX) of voluntary wheel running exercise.
