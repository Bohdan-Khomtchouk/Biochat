TITLE
DSB formation in replication compromised cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DSBs were mapped genome-wide by ssDNA enrichment in cdc6-mn replication comprimsied strains.

DESIGN
We mapped DSB sites by detecting DSB-associated ssDNA enrichment on microarrays. To test the role of DNA replication in DSB formation, we mapped ssDNA in a cdc6-mn replication depleted strain. ssDNA was isolated from cells after 5 hours in sporulation medium. As a reference, ssDNA isolated from cells at 0 hrs in sporulation medium prior to DSB formation was differentially labeled and co-hybridized to the same array. For each experiment, we have submitted biological replicates that were hybridized to separate arrays. For each experiment a dye swap was performed and shown to have no effect on the data observed, although not all experiments in this series include the dye swap sample (we have included only two representative experiments for each strain).
