TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells transfected with SLC44A5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified SLC44A5 as a gene associated with birth weight in cattle based on genome wide association studies. To identify the mechanisms involved in growth and choline transporter, we performed genome-wide mRNA expression analysis in HeLa cells transfected with SLC44A5.
