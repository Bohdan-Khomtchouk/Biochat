TITLE
Transcript Profiling of the Common Bean - Rhizobium Symbiosis under Oxidative Stress

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
A wide range of environmental stresses lead to an elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells thus resulting in oxidative stress. The biological nitrogen fixation in the legume - Rhizobium symbiosis is at high risk of damage from oxidative stress. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) active nodules exposed to the herbicide Paraquat (1,1 '-Dimethyl-4, 4'-bipyridinium dichloride hydrate) that generates ROS accumulation, showed a reduced nitrogenase activity and ureide content. We analyzed the global gene response of stressed nodules using the Bean CombiMatrix Custom Array 90K, that includes probes from some 30,000 expressed sequence tags (EST). A total of 4,280 ESTs were differentially expressed in oxidative stressed bean nodules; of these 2,218 were repressed. These genes were grouped in 44 different biological processes as defined by Gene Onthology. Analysis with the PathExpress bioinformatic tool, adapted for bean, identified five significantly repressed metabolic path
