TITLE
Microarray analysis of TAP::ALG-1 associated RNAs isolated from synchronized 'wild-type' animals and 'mir-58' mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To discover new miRNA targets, we generated a C.Â elegans transgenic line expressing a functional N-terminally Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) tagged ALG-1 protein (C. elegans strain WS4303). We crossed the TAP::ALG-1 transgene into the mir-58(n4640) mutant background to generate the strain WS5041. For simplicity, we will hereafter term the TAP::ALG-1 transgenic animals as wild typeand the transgenic WS5041 animals as mir-58. We compared the mRNA population that coimmunopurified with TAP::ALG-1 from synchronized L4 stage wild-type animals with that from synchronized L4 stage mir-58 mutant animals by one-color Affymetrix gene arrays. miR-58 target mRNAs should be specifically underrepresented in the latter samples.

DESIGN
Strains WS4303 (wt) and WS5041 (mir-58) were used for TAP::ALG-1 IPs. All experiments were conducted in three independent replicates. For each replicate, WS4303 and WS5041 were grown in parallel. 150 ng of TAP::ALG-1 associated RNA isolated from synchronized late L4 animals were sent to the GeneCore facilty in Heidelberg, Germany ( ), and the microarray data were generated according to their standard protocol (Weinmann et al. 2009).
