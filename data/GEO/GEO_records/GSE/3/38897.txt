TITLE
Bacillus subtilis Rnase Y activity in vivo analysed by tiling microarrays

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
RNase Y is an essential endoribonuclease affecting global mRNA stability in Bacillus subtilis. We used high-resolution tiling arrays to analyze the effect of RNase Y depletion on RNA abundance covering the entire genome. The data confirm that this endoribonuclease plays a key role in initiating the decay of a large number of mRNAs as well as non coding RNAs. Comparison of the data with that of two other recent studies revealed very significant differences. About two thirds of the mRNAs upregulated following RNase Y depletion were different when compared to either one of these studies and only about 10% of were in common in all three studies.Our data confirmed already known RNase Y substrates and due to the precision and reproducibility of the profiles allows an exceptionally detailed view of the turnover of hundreds of new RNA substrates.

DESIGN
A four arrays study of the transcriptome profiles of the B. subtilis RNase Y depletion strain SSB447 (Shahbabian et al., 2009) in which the gene rny is under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. Rnase Y depleted cells (IPTG-) are compared to the transcript profiles of non depleted cells (IPTG+). As the rny gene is essential, depletion can only be partial. Here we carefully selected the time point for taking the sample in order to minimize growth rate effects and to obtain an highly reproducible data set.
