TITLE
GEP data from BCWM.1 cells treated with LNA antimiR-155 or scramble control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA-155 acts as an oncogenic miRNA in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders including Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). we used an 8-mer LNA (locked nucleic acid) phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeting the seed region of miR-155 to effectively antagonize in vitro tumor growth in WM.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis on BCWM.1 cells after treatment with LNA antimiR-155 or scramble control for 48 hours.
