TITLE
Extrinsic and Intrinsic Regulation of DOR/TRP53INP2 Expression in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective is to relate changes in expression of DOR/TRP53INP2, a factor involved in thyroid hormone action and autophagy, to body composition in mice fed a fat (FD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 8 days and in a genetically obese mouse model. We conclude that DOR expression depends on sex, fat content of diet, age, tissue type and tissue weight.

DESIGN
4 samples: 2 (normal diet control, fat diet) x2 replicates
