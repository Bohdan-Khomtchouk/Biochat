TITLE
Regulatory role of multinucleated giant cells derived from placental CD14+ macrophages: Pathophysiological implications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of placental macrophages is largely ignored in the success of pregnancy. We found that CD14+ macrophages purified from at-term placentas spontaneously matured into multinucleated giant cells (MGCs). MGCs lost the expression of CD14 and co-inhibitory molecules, such as Programmed cell Death-Ligands 1 and 2. Although MGCs kept phagocytosis and property to produce ROS, their inflammatory potential measured by TNF/IL-10 imbalance and activation of p38 MAPK and NF-ÎºB was blunted without being associated with M2 phenotype. The investigation of gene expression revealed the enrichment with categories related to inflammation, apoptosis and canonical functions of macrophages in MGCs. Whereas most of the genes associated with inflammation and immune responses were down-modulated, those such as VEGFC or associated with matrix remodeling were specifically up-regulated in MGCs. Importantly, we found that patients with preeclampsia or chorioamnionitis, two inflammatory and infectious pathologies, respectively, that affect placentas, were unable to generate MGCs. Taken together, these results suggest that MGCs represent a new way to regulate the inflammatory and cytocidal activity of placental macrophages in a context that imposes contradictory constraints, such as semi-allograft acceptance and defense against aggression. The dysregulation of MGC formation may be associated with placental inflammatory and infectious pathologies.

DESIGN
Placental macrophages CD14+ were cultured for 9 days to form multinucleated giant cells (MGC). The transcriptome of MGCs was compared to the transcriptome of placental macrophages (CD14+)
