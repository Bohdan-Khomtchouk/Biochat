TITLE
Micro RNA expression from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens from patients undergoing liver transplantation.

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Current selection criteria for liver transplant in patients with HCC (the Milan criteria) do not incorporate biologic metrics. MiRNA expression profiles correlate with HCC recurrence after transplant and can add significant value to the Milan criteria.
