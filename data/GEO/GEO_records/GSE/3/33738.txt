TITLE
Fetal programming of muscle transcriptome in response to gestational dietary protein levels in the pig [HP]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
German landrace gilts were fed a high protein diet (HP, 30% CP) throughout their whole pregnancy. Subsequently muscle transcriptome profiles of the offspring were analysed at prenatal (94 dpc) and postnatal stages (1, 28, 188 dpn)

DESIGN
per stage offspring of 3 gilts were collected for expression profiling
