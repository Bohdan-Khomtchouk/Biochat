TITLE
Transcriptional  analysis of epithelial cells in grapefruit peel

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Epithelial cells (EC) lining the most inner layers of secretory glands in Citrus peel are hypothesized to be the specialized cells that synthesize citrus essential oil. The major biosynthetic pathway(s) for essential oil are therefore postulated to be specifically and highly active in EC; transcripts that are involved in the pathway(s) are expected to be highly up-regulated in the cells as well. We performed cell-specific transcriptional analysis using GeneChip Citrus Genome Arrays to probe the global gene expression in EC during initial stage of essential oil biosynthesis and to identify groups of highly expressed genes in the EC.
