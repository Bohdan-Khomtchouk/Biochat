TITLE
Effects of PD-0332991 on gene expression of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PD-0332991 is a small molecule inhibitor for Cdk4 and Cdk6. It exerted growth inhibitory effects on PDAC cell lines (AsPC-1 and COLO-357). Microarray analysis was used to characterize the changes in gene expression profiles of AsPC-1 and COLO-357 upon PD-0332991 incubation

DESIGN
AsPC-1 and COLO-357 cells were treated in the absence or presence of 5 ÂµM PD-0332991 for 24 h and 72 h. Each expreimental condition had biological triplicates. Twenty-four samples were analyzed in total.
