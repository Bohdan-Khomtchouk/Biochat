TITLE
Genome-wide recruitment profile of Tat protein on cellular genes in HIV-1 infected T-cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 Tat is a multifunctional protein, that in addition to its primary function of transactivating viral transcription also tends to modulate cellular gene expression, the molecular mechanism of which remains to be clearly elucidated. We have reported earlier NFÎºB enhancer binding activity of Tat and proposed its potential role in regulation of cellular gene expression. In the present study, we have analysed genome wide occupancy of Tat protein in HIV-1 infected cells. Our results identify an entire spectrum of binding sites of Tat protein on chromatin and also reveal that Tat is recruited majorly on gene promoters indicating its possible involvement in the regulation of cellular gene expression.
