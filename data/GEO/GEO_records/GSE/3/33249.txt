TITLE
High resolution comparative genomic hybridisation analysis of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a previous study of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast (see GEO accession #GSE7882) we identified six genes at chromosome 17q21.33 that were over-expressed in high grade cases, and showed a correlation between expression level and gene copy number. The aim of this study was to determine whether potential drivers of high grade breast cancer growth could be identified at 17q21.33. High resolution comparative genomic hybridisation was used to interrogate genomic aberrations in laser capture microdissected samples of ductal carcinoma in situ.

DESIGN
Amplified DNA from laser capture microdissected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was hybridised with amplified male DNA are a reference.
