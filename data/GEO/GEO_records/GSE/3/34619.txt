TITLE
Gene expression profile in Barrett's esopahgus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was used to identify differential gene expression pattern in Barrett's esophagus (BE), compared to the normal adjacent epithelia gastric cardia (GC) and normal squamous esophagus (NE)

DESIGN
RNA was extraxted from endoscopic  biopsies of BE (n=10), GC (n=10) and NE (n=10, only 8 uploaded). One NE sample was excluded since clustered with BE and all the intestinal markers were positive, indicating sampling error.
