TITLE
H3Cit26 ChIP-chip from MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor α (ER), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, regulates transcriptional activity by ligand-dependent recruitment of cofactors which, in turn, locally alter chromatin structure. It is generally believed that co-factor activity at target promoters leads to a more open, transcriptionally permissive chromatin structure, however, these mechanisms remain to be fully established. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs) catalyze the conversion of positively charged arginine and methylarginine residues to neutrally charged citrulline and this activity has been linked to the gene regulation. Here, we found that PADI2 citrullinate H3 Arginine 26 (H3R26) in vitro and, using a specific H3R26 citrulline (H3Cit26) antibody, we demonstrate that H3Cit26 occurs in vivo following 17β-estradiol (E2) stimulation and this unique and pronounced global activation of H3Cit26 is ER-dependent. Using a mammalian-based promoter chromosomal array system, we observed that citrullination at H3R26 is robust and co-localizes with ER at decondensed chromatin loci. Additionally, this histone modification is specifically enriched at ER bound regions of target promoters, forming a permissive chromatin environment for gene transactivation. Interestingly, we have shown in a reciprocal way, that either depletion of PADI2 or inhibition of ER not only dramatically abolished E2-induced activation of H3Cit26 on gene promoters but also affect ER recruitment. Collectively, our results demonstrate that citrullination of H3R26 by PADI2 following estrogen stimulation plays a role in ER target gene activation, likely via decondensation of the local chromatin architecture.

DESIGN
Two H3Cit26 ChIP-chip biological replicates under vehicle treatment and two H3Cit26 ChIP-chip biological replicates under E2 stimulation from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are included.
