TITLE
Sequentially acting Sox transcription factors in neural lineage development [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report sequential binding but unique functions of different Sox transcription factors during distinct stages of neural differentiation

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide Sox2, Sox3 and Sox11 transcription factor binding during different stages of neurogenesis.
