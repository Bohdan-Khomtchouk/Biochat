TITLE
Expression data from mouse skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated skeletal muscle-specific knockout mice lacking the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and analyzed expression patterns in the skeletal muscle these mice. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression regulated by YY1.

DESIGN
Wild type or knockout mice at 6 months were sacrificed and the soleus was isolated for RNA extraction.
