TITLE
The Histone Methyltransferase Wbp7 Controls Macrophage Function through GPI Glycolipid Anchor Synthesis. [Expression Profile]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone methyltransferases catalyze site-specific deposition of methyl groups, enabling recruitment of transcriptional regulators. In mammals, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3, a modification localized at the transcription start sites of active genes, is catalyzed by six enzymes (SET1a and SET1b, MLL1â€“MLL4) whose specific functions are largely unknown. By using a genomic approach, we found that in macrophages, MLL4 (also known as Wbp7) was required for the expression of Pigp, an essential component of the GPI-GlcNAc transferase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis. Impaired Pigp expression in Wbp7-/- macrophages abolished GPI anchor-dependent loading of proteins on the cell membrane. Consistently, loss of GPI-anchored CD14, the coreceptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial molecules, markedly attenuated LPS-triggered intracellular signals and gene expression changes. These data link a histone-modifying enzyme to a biosynthetic pathway and indicate a specialized biological role for Wbp7 in macrophage function and antimicrobial response.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles for bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from either Wbp7+/- (HET) or Wbp7-/- (KO). Cells were left untreated or challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2hrs or 4hrs. Each genotype-treatment combination were performed in triplicate.
