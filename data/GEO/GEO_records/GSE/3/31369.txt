TITLE
Expression profiling of rpb1-12XWTCTD and rpb1-12XS2ACTD fission yeast strains.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
In fission yeast, the nuclear-localized Lsk1p-Lsc1p-Lsg1p cyclin dependent kinase complex is required for the reliable execution of cytokinesis and is also required for Ser-2 phosphorylation RNA pol II carboxy terminal domain. To address whether alterations in CTD phosphorylation might selectively alter expression of cytokinesis genes, expression profiling of site-directed CTD mutants was performed.
