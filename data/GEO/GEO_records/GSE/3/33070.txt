TITLE
Adipose tissue gene expression associated with weight gain in kidney transplant recipients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the association of gene expression profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue with percent of total body weight change in 26 kidney transplant recipients. Using multivariate linear regression analysis controlled for race and gender, expression levels of 1553 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with weight change.

DESIGN
A secondary data analysis was done on a subgroup (n=26) of existing clinical and gene expression data from a larger prospective longitudinal study examining factors contributing to weight gain in transplant recipients.
