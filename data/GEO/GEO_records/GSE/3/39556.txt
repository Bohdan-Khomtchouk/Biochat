TITLE
Genome-wide expression study of the responses of murine NK cells and dendritic cell subsets after poly(I:C) injection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The injection of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) leads to the activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. This activation is  due to different innate cytokines produced early after injection, in particular IFN-I. The objective of the study was to compare the pattern of expression of IFN-I stimulated genes between DC and NK cells. The project focused on a specific subset of conventional DC, CD8a DC, which responsiveness to IFN-I determines the capacity to activate CD8 T cells by cross-presentation of exogenous antigens.  To identify the responses to IFN-I selectively induced in CD8a+ DC, we compared their gene expression profile to that of NK cells, using gene chips, before and after poly(I:C) stimulation.

DESIGN
This study includes data from CD8a+ cDCs and NK cells purified by flow cytometry from the spleen of WT C57BL/6 mice, under steady-state conditions or 3 hours after administration of 100 ug  poly(I:C) by intravenous injection. Two independent replicates were made for each cell type.
