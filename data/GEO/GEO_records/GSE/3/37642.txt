TITLE
Prognostic gene signature for AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease in respect of molecular aberrations and prognosis. We used gene expression profiling of 562 patients treated in the German AMLCG 1999 trial to develop a gene signature that predicts survival in AML.

DESIGN
Analysis of 562 samples (140 HGU-133plus2; 422 HGU-133A; 422 HGU-133B) from adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
