R6/1 brain hemisphere time series gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HD R6/1 transgenic mouse line brain hemispheres dissected.  RNA targets were created for transgenics and wildtypes at time points 18, 22 and 27 weeks.  Profiles and data analysis performed using the Bioconductor software and linear model contrasts using LIMMA on RMA probeset summarys. Keywords: timecourse
