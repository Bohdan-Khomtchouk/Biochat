TITLE
autologous pairs of cutaneous melanocyte and melanoma cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early-passage ( < 10 passages) cultures of melanoma cells from metastatic lymph node lesions and normal adult melanocytes explanted in parallel from the adjacent, non-involved skin of 5 patients were compared by cDNA arrays. Differences between normal and neoplastic counterparts were then assessed upon adjustment for individual factors.

DESIGN
cDNA expression profiles comparison between normal and neoplastic counterparts in a strictly autologous setting
