TITLE
Manipulation of Temperature and Photoperiod Identifies Molecular Networks Associated with the Para- to Endo-dormant Transition in Leafy Spurge Crown Buds

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
Leafy spurge is a model for studying well-defined phases of dormancy in underground adventitious buds (UABs) of herbaceous perennial weeds, which is a primary factor allowing many invasive perennial weeds to escape conventional control measures. A 12-week ramp down in both temperature (27°C → 10°C) and photoperiod (16 h → 8 h light) is required to induce a transition from para- to endo-dormancy in UABs of leafy spurge. To evaluate the effects of photoperiod and temperature on molecular networks associated with this transition, we compared global transcriptome data-sets obtained from UABs of leafy spurge exposed to a ramp down in both temperature and photoperiod (RDtp) vs. a ramp down in temperature (RDt) alone. Analysis of transcriptome data-sets indicated that numerous genes associated with circadian clock, photoperiodism, flowering, and hormone responses (CCA1, COP1, HY5, MAF3, MAX2) were preferentially expressed during the transition from para- to endo-dormancy. Gene-set enrichment analyses highlighted metabolic pathways associated with ethylene, auxin, flavonoids, and carbohydrate metabolism; whereas, sub-network enrichment analyses identified hubs (CCA1, CO, FRI, mir172A, EINs, DREBs) of gene networks associated with carbohydrate metabolism, circadian clock, flowering, and stress and hormone responses during the transition to endodormancy. These results helped refine existing models for the transition to endodormancy in UABs of leafy spurge, which strengthened the roles of circadian clock associated genes, DREBs, COP1-HY5, carbohydrate metabolism, and involvement of hormones (ABA, ethylene, and strigolactones). Further, we propose that the RDtp treatment ultimately leads to a chain effect, responsive to photoperiod and temperature signaling, to synchronize molecular processes associated with the transition from para- to endo-dormancy.
