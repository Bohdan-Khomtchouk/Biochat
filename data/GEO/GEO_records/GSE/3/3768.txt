TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Neural Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue from the telencephalon was isolated from E13.5 BALB/C mouse and allowed to culture as neurospheres in the presence of FGF2. These cultures were assessed for undifferentiated neural stem cells by the expression of Nestin and were found to be ~98% Nestin positive. Comparisons of these nestin positive neural stem cells will be made to R1 ES cells to identify the genes that are important in totipotent, self-renewing ES cells vs. commitment to the multipotent, self-renewing neural stem cell phenotype.
