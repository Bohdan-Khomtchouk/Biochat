SUMMARY
Comprehensive Profiling of Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded miRNAome Associated with Specific Latent Type in Tumor Cells Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an etiological cause of many human lymphocytic and epithelial malignancies. EBV expressed different genes associated with three latent types. So far as many as 44 EBV-encoded miRNA species have been found but their comprehensive and comparative profiling is not well documented in three latent infection states linked to various tumor cells. In this study, we utilized the polyA-tailed quantitative real time RT-PCR procedure to measure the relative abundance of viral miRNA species that linked to individual viral genome locations in combination with microarray evaluation in a subset of representative lymphoid and epithelial tumor cells undergoing various types of EBV latent infection. The results showed that miR-BHRF1 family and miR-BART family are expressed differentially in a tissue-dependent and latency-dependent manner. In particular, in NPC tissue and the only EBV consistently harboring cell line C666-1 with latency type II, there were highly abundant miR-BART family but not miR-BHRF1 family members that accounted for more than 10% of the whole known human miRNA library, implicating their important roles in maintaining EBV latent infection and driving NPC tumorigenesis. In addition, EBV miRNAome-based clustering analysis could classify three distinct EBV latency types, meanwhile, for the first time, we found and subsequently evaluated a novel secret latent switch in BL cell line Daudi from type I to III, which was unable to be identified by traditional latent biomarkers. Together, our data provided an in-depth and comparative profiling of EBV miRNA transcriptome in correspondence with three EBV latent infections, suggesting that different viral miRNA species were involved in divergent host cell carcinogenesis. Finally, EBV miRNAome, as a cluster of novel latency biomarkers expressed variedly in tumor cells, greatly complements and improves the classical typing criteria in conjunction with other latently expressed marker genes.
