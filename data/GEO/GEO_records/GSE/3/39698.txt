TITLE
Comparing control and IL17A treated A2780-derived ovarian cancer stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A2780-derived ovarian cancer stem cells were  in vitro cultured in the presence of 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor , 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor , 5 μg/mL insulin, 0.4% bovine serum albumin. Then ovarian cancer stem cells were stimulated  for  4 and 6 hours in the presence or absence of 250ng/ml IL17A. Total RNA was isolated and processed according to the Agilentmanufacturer’s standard protocols

DESIGN
Gene expression in ovarian cancer stem cells from A2780 cell line was measured at IL17A stmulated (4 and 6 hours) and un-stmulated.
