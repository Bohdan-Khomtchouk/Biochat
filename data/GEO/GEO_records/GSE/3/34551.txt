TITLE
NPTX1 is a Critical Regulator of Neural Induction in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NPTX1 is a key inducer of neural lineages from the human ESC. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying neural induction by NPTX1.

DESIGN
A timecourse of neural Induction from human ESC in NPTX1 shRNA expressing cells and control cells was examined.
