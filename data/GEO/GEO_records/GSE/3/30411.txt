TITLE
Clock rescue in the brain restores 12- and 24- hour rhythms in the liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian profiling was performed in mouse livers from three different genotypes/treatments: Wildtype, Clock mutant, and brain-specific Clock rescue. Rescuing Clock specifically in the brain partially rescued robust circadian and harmonic rhythms.

DESIGN
Samples were collected every 2 hours for 48 hours from 2-4 mice per time point; samples were pooled and analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Exon arrays, analyzed at the gene level.
