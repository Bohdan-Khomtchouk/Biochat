SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Carrie Davis (experimental), Alex Dobin (computational), Felix Schlesinger (computational), Tom Gingeras (primary investigator), and Roderic Guigo's group at the CRG). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). These tracks were generate by the ENCODE Consortium. They contain information about human RNAs > 200 nucleotides in length obtained as short reads off the Illumina GAIIx platform. Data is available from biological replicates of several cell lines. In addition to profiling Poly-A+ and Poly-A- RNA from whole cells, we have also gather data from various subcellular compartments. In many cases, there are Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE, RIKEN Institute) and Small RNA-Seq ( < 200 nucleotides, CSHL) and Pair-End di-TAG-RNA (PET-RNA, Genome Institute of Singapore) datasets available from the same biological replicates.
