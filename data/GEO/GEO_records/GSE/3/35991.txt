TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for a melanoma lesion and a cellline derived thereof

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report on a bulk culture termed MCM1, which was derived from a 61 year old male diagnosed with a nodular melanoma stage T2a, N0. At passage three of culturing, DNA was isolated and Affymetrix SNP6.0 array hybridizations were performed. Cultured MCM1 cells revealed overall identical copy number gains and losses as compared with the primary patient-derived lesion and were therefore used in this study.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA, which was extracted from a patient derived melanoma sample and from a cellline generated from the same melanoma sample at passage three.
