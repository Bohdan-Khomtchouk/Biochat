SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Terry Furey ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). These tracks display DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS) evidence as part of the four Open Chromatin track sets. DNaseI is an enzyme that has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility, and DNaseI " hypersensitivity " is a feature of active cis-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, locus control regions, and novel elements. DNaseI hypersensitivity signifies chromatin accessibility following binding of trans-acting factors in place of a canonical nucleosome. Together with FAIRE and ChIP-seq experiments, these tracks display the locations of active regulatory elements identified as open chromatin in multiple cell types ( ) from the Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, UT-Austin, and EBI ENCODE group. Within this project, open chromatin was identified using two independent and complementary methods: these DNaseI HS assays and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for select regulatory factors. DNaseI HS and FAIRE provide assay cross-validation with commonly identified regions delineating the highest confidence areas of open chromatin. ChIP assays provide functional validation and preliminary annotation of a subset of open chromatin sites. Each method employed Illumina (formerly Solexa) sequencing by synthesis as the detection platform. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 cell types were additional verified by a second platform, high-resolution 1% ENCODE tiled microarrays supplied by NimbleGen.
