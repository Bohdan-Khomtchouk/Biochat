TITLE
Development of gene expression profile in different tissues of zebra mussel and larvae

ORGANISM
Dreissena polymorpha

SUMMARY
To analyze the different pattern of expression among tissues in D. polymorpha it was used acustom microarray designed in our laboratory using 4057 publicly availabe DNA sequences from Dreissena and other realted genera. Transcriptome profiles were analyszed using gills, digestive gland, gonad and half a body of adult zebra mussel and larvae 24 h pf. The samples analyzed in the microarray were not treated in order to detect the normal pattern of expression in each tissue. A total of 221 transcripts changed significantly their mRNA levels in the different tissues (ANOVA p < 0.01, fc Â±1.5). The results showed a clear separation on transcriptome profiles between samples with the main changes in gills, larvae and half a body.

DESIGN
Non treated animals were use to study different patterns of gene expression in different tissues using gills, digestive gland, gonad from both sexes, and half a body as well as larvae. It was used 2 replicate for each tissue.
