TITLE
Gene expression changes in oncogenic Kras-containing, Apc-mutated mouse intestinal organoids in the presence or absence of TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated and selected intestinal adenoma organoids from Apc1638N/+ and Apc1638N/+; Kras mice. After the selection procedure, we maintained the cultures with or without TGF-beta for 18h. RNA was isolated to determine the effect of oncogenic Kras on the gene expression changes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from  Apc1638N/+; Kras  organoids were compared to Apc1638N/+ samples in the absence or presence of 3 ng/ml TGF-beta (18h).
