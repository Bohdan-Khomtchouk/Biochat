TITLE
Regulation of gene expressions in vivo by anti-VEGF therapy [Mouse430_2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
U87-EV human glioblastoma xenograft tumours is therapeutically treated by bevacizumab, a humanized anti-human VEGF mAb, when tumour is established in BALB/c SCID mice. At the end point, collect tumour samples and extracted total RNA for microarray to investigate the gene profile changes compared to control. These include the genes from human tumour cells and mouse host stroma cells.
