TITLE
Trimethoprim response in Escherichia coli in bacteriostatic and bactericidal conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E. coli MG1655 to Trimethoprim in i) LB media, ii) M9 minimal media and iii) M9 minimal media with supplements to study the association of gene expression with corresponding lethal and non-lethal growth conditions. Supplementation conditions in M9 media included addition of 50 microgram/ml of adenine, methionine, glycine or thymine in various combinations.

DESIGN
For all growth conditions, TMP was added to E. coli in mid-log phase and samples were taken at regular intervals from 10 minutes to 120 minutes post treatment. 1 Biological replicate per time point.
