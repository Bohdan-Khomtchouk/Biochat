TITLE
Expression data from Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild type and TTHA1559 disrupted

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of wild-type and TTHA1559 disrupted Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain at 70°C.

DESIGN
Wild-type and TTHA1559 disrupted T. thermophilus HB8 strains were pre-cultured at 70°C in 10 ml of synthetic medium. The cells (0.1 ml) were inoculated into 10 ml of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 5h, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA was analyzed on a GeneChip.
