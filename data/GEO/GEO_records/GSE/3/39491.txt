TITLE
GLOBAL CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS COMPARED TO NORMAL SQUAMOUS ESOPHAGUS AND GASTRIC CARDIA TISSUES

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), the most rapidly increasing cancer in western societies. While the prevalence of BE is increasing, the vast majority of EA occurs in patients with undiagnosed BE. Thus, we sought to identify genes that are altered in BE compared to the normal mucosa of the esophagus, and which may be potential biomarkers for the development or diagnosis of BE.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on fresh frozen tissue samples of Barrett’s metaplasia and matched normal mucosa from squamous esophagus (NE) and gastric cardia (NC) in 43 BE patients.
