TITLE
Long non-coding RNA expression in Human tissues and cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We designed a custom microarray to profile the expression and used it to measure the expression of 9929 human lncRNAs manually-annotated by the GENCODE group as part of the ENCODE consortium.

DESIGN
One microarray hybridisation per biological sample.
