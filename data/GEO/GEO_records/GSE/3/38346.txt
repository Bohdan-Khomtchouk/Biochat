TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 4T1 tumors expressing mouse urokinase plasminogen activitor (uPA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of uPA regulation of 4T1 tumor growth at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that overexpression of uPA in 4T1 tumor influence the tumor growth and metastasis related cell signaling pathway.

DESIGN
4T1 cells were stably transduced by lentiviral vector expressing mouse uPA or empty vector. After day 7 of inoculation of 4T1 cells into fatpad of Balb/c mice. Total RNA was extracted from tumor samples (triplicate) using Qiagen total RNA isolation kit. The Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Wallingford, CT) was used for gene expression. The raw data from the fluorescence intensity measurements of each array experiment was processed using GeneSpringGX v.11.0 software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Statistical analysis, fold change calculations, and hierarchical clustering of the data were also performed in GeneSpring software. Genes that expressed significantly differently with more than 1.5-fold change and a p-value of < 0.05 with respect to controls were taken into consideration. Gene expression data were further validated by qRT-PCR analysis.  Pathway analysis was performed by MetaCore software (GeneGo, Inc, St. Joseph, MI).
