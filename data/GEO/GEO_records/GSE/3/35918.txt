TITLE
Expression data of Xrx1 gain and loss of function experiments from early Xenopus laevis embryos (stage 13)

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Eye development is a multistep process that requires specific inductive signals and precise morphogenetic movements, starting early during development in the eye-field, a well-definite region of the anterior neural plate. It has been demonstrated that a gene network of eye field transcription factors (EFTFs) contributes to specify the neural and retinal fate of the eye field. Among these EFTFs, Xrx1 is involved in proliferation and neurogenesis in the eye field and is necessary for the correct development of the retina. By means of Affymetrix microarrays, a high throughput screening was performed, looking for genes that can mediate the function of Xrx1, by comparison of the expression profiles of whole embryos in which the Xrx1 function was either overexpressed or abolished by use of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides.

DESIGN
Xenopus laevis embryos were harvested soon after fertilization. 50ng of capped Xrx1 mRNA or 0.5pmol of MoXrx1 antisense oligonucleotides were coinjected with 400ng of GFP synthetic mRNA as a tracer, in both dorsal blastomeres of 4-cells stage embryos. Embryos were let to develop until stage 13, in which the eye field induction steps are active, and selected for correct injection site by fluorescence topographic assessment. RNA was extracted from each single embryo and control PCRs were performed to assess the correct molecular signature of Xrx1 loss- and gain- of function.
