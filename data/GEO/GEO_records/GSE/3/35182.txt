TITLE
Sex differences during  acute myocarditis against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis (10 dpi) and  chronic myocarditis/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) against CVB3-induced myocarditis (90 dpi)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Men are at an increased risk of dying from heart failure caused by inflammatory heart diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously showed that immune responses in the heart are phenotypically distinct in male compared to female mice 10 days after infection resulting in severe DCM in males.

DESIGN
Groups consisted of Infected Males, Infected Females, Uninfected Males and Uninfected females. There are 3 mice per group. A total of 12 samples were analyzed in this experiment (12 for 10 dpi and 12 for 90 dpi).
