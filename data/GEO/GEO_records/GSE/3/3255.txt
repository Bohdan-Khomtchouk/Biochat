TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles with Common Translocations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using SAGE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SAGE was used to profile gene expression in leukemic myeloid progenitor cells of AML patients with t(8;21), t(15;17), t(9;11) and inv(16). Keywords: SAGE analysis of gene expression in leukemic myeloid progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow
