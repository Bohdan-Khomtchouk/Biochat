TITLE
Expression Profiles of HepG2 cells treated with 7µM of the genotoxic compound cisplatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by 7µM of cisplatin after treatment for 12, 24 and 48h

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 12,24 and 48 hours of exposure to 7µM of cisplatin and its solvent. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 18 arrays .
