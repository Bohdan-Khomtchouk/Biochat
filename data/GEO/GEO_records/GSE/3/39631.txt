TITLE
action of microgravity on root development-Action of microgravity on root development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au11-03_gravite - action of microgravity on root development - Action of microgravity on root development - Arabidopsis were grown on horizontal or vertical clinostat for 4, 8 or 12 days. Seedlings on horizontal clinostat were in simulated microgravity and seedlings on vertical clinostat are considered as a control. Comparison was made between plants grown on simulated microgravitry and vertical position.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
