TITLE
Gene induction during differentiation of human pulmonary type II cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of human fetal lung in explant culture and in isolated epithelial cells have demonstrated that both glucocorticoids and cyclic AMP promote differentiated alveolar type II cell phenotype as assessed by ultrastructural morphology and surfactant production.  This project profiles changes in gene expression associated with hormone induced differentiation.   Undifferentiated human fetal lung (13-20 wk) epithelial cells were cultured in serum-free medium (control) or with dexamethasone/8-Bromo cyclic AMP/isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI) to promote type II cell differentiation.  RNA from five sets of experiments (10 samples) was evaluated using the U133A Affymetrix GeneChip set. Keywords: Hormone treatment
