TITLE
Fertile offspring derived from mouse spermatogonial stem cells cryopreserved for more than 14 years

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the possible deleterious affects prolonged cryopreservation and assisted reproductive technologies may have on the DNA of F0 progeny, we used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for analysis of genomic DNA.

DESIGN
ICSI-derived progeny were generated from ♂ (ZFLacZ sperm) x ♀ (DBA x C57BL/6 oocyte), where the ZFLazZ transgenic mice were originally generated from an SJL x C57BL/6 background.
