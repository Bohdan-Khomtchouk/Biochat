TITLE
The AIN-centered DCN of delayed-type eyeblink conditioned mice: 7-d paired and 7-d unpaired training groups

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) is a proposed site of memory formation of eyeblink conditioning. A large part of the underlying molecular events, however, remains unknown. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, we examined transcriptional changes in the AIN of mice trained with delayed-type eyeblink conditioning Keywords: 7-d paired training, 7-d unpaired training, delayed-type eyeblink conditioning of mice, anterior interpositus nucleus-centered deep cerebellar nuclei
