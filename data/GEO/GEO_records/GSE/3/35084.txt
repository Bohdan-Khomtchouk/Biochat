TITLE
Expression data from human HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LPA, which can signal through the Ga12/13 family of G proteins, is a potent stimulator of fibroblast migration.  LPA downregulate mTOR activity dependent on protein synthesis in cell migration and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We used microarray to identify LPA-regualted gene expression and find potent regulators in this process.

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were treated with or without LPA. Then RNA was extracted and Hybridization was done on Affymetrix microarrays.
