TITLE
Identification of biomarkers for tumor endothelial cell proliferation through gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extensive efforts are underway to identify anti-angiogenic therapies for the treatment of human cancers. Many proposed therapeutics target vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) or the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR/VEGFR-2/FLK-1), the mitogenic VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by endothelial cells. Inhibition of KDR catalytic activity blocks tumor neo-angiogenesis, reduces vascular permeability, and, in animal models, inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. Using a gene expression profiling strategy in rat tumor models, we identified a set of six genes that are selectively overexpressed in tumor endothelial cells relative to tumor cells, and whose pattern of expression correlates with the rate of tumor endothelial cell proliferation. In addition to being potential targets for anti-angiogenesis tumor therapy, the expression patterns of these genes or their protein products may aid the development of pharmacodynamic assays for small molecule inhibitors of the KDR kinase in human tumors.
