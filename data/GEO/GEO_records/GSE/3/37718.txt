TITLE
Nanos2-associated mRNAs in the embryonic male gonad

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Nanos2-associated mRNAs, we performed microarray analysis of mRNAs coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged NANOS2 with male gonad from Tg-Nanos2 enhancer-3xFLAG-Nanos2-3'UTR at E14.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each sample.
