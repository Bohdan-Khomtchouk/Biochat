TITLE
Individual array-based gene expression patterns generated using total RNA prepared from whole blood of 991 participants of the SHIP-TREND cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data set comprises individual array-based genome-wide gene expression data of 991 participants of the SHIP-TREND cohort generated using RNA prepared from whole blood. *** Due to privacy concerns, the SNP and phenotype data is not available with unrestricted access. Individuals wishing to obtain this data for research purposes may request access directly from the submitter (contact info below). ***

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from whole-blood samples from 991 individuals belonging to the epidemiological SHIP-TREND cohort. Individual mRNA profiles were generated using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip.
