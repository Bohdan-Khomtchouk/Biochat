TITLE
The cellular response to 1st and 2nd generation Ad vector infection at different time points in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were injected intravenously with 1st generation or 2nd generation Ad vectors (each bearing a LacZ transgene) or mock infected (controls) to completely transduce the liver.  At different time points post-injection (6 hours, 3 days, and 3 weeks (21 days)), the liver was harvested and the overall transcriptome response to viral infection was assayed to measure the cellular immune response. Keywords: Immune Response
