TITLE
Expression Changes Relevant for Apoptosis in K562 Cells Co-Treated with Amifostine and Imatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We had previously demonstrated an increased proapoptotic effect of Imatinib (STI571) in combination with Amifostine (AMI) in K562 cell line. In this study we used genomic scale gene expression profiling to monitor changes at transcriptional level in K562 cells during the treatment with AMI+STI571. We identified a transcriptional repressor of survival genes, known as BTF, which triggers a pro-apoptotic signal, potentially helpful to overcome the resistance to STI571. This finding could be particularly useful to design novel therapeutic strategies for leukaemia patients. Keywords: Pharmacogenomic
