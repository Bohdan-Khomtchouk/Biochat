TITLE
The Wilms' tumour 1 transcription factor regulates epigenetic states via DNA methyltransferase 3A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Wilms' tumour 1 transcription factor regulates epigenetic states via DNA methyltransferase 3A.

DESIGN
The data consists of two Nimblegen promoter/CpG island microarrays hybridized with MCIP DNA immunoprecipitated from either a HEK293-derived cell line expressing a heterologous WT1 cDNA (W210) or a control cell line containing the expression vector (IP100), both hybridized against input DNA.
