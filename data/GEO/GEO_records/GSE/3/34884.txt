TITLE
Differential gene expression in human myeloid dendritic cells interacting with different knockout strains of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) are the most important antigen presenting cells and play a pivotal role in host immunity to infectious agents by acting as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems.  Myeloid DCs (mDC) were isolated from peripheral blood and co-cultured with conidia (con) and germlings (ks) of Aspergillus fumigatus knockout (mitA, mnt1, rodA) and wildtype (wt) strains for 6 hours at an MOI of 1. RNA was extracted and hybridised to microarrays. Microarrays contain probes for approximately 110 selected human immune-relevant genes, including cytokine and chemokine genes, their receptors and downstream innate immunity genes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of human myeloid dendritic cells after 6h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus wildtype and knockout mutants
