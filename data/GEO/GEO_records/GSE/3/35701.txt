CP001: Modulation of glutamine metabolism by the PI3K-PKB/c-akt-FOXO network regulates autophagy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The PI3K-PKB/c-akt-FOXO signalling network provides a major intracellular hub for regulation of cell proliferation, survival and stress resistance1. Here we report a novel function for FOXO transcription factors in regulating autophagy through modulation of intracellular glutamine levels. To identify novel transcriptional targets of this module we performed an unbiased microarray analysis after conditional activation of the key components PI3K, PKB, FOXO3 and FOXO4. Utilising this global pathway approach we identified glutamine synthetase (GS) as being transcriptionally regulated by PI3K-PKB-FOXO signalling. FOXO-mediated increase in GS expression specifically induced glutamine production independently of cell type, and this was evolutionary conserved. FOXO activation resulted in mTOR inhibition by preventing the translocation of mTOR to lysosomal membranes, which was dependent on GS activity. Increased GS activity resulted in increased autophagosome turnover as measured by LC3 lipidation, p62 degradation, and confocal imaging of LC3, p62, WIPI-1, ULK2 and Atg12. Inhibition of FOXO3-mediated autophagy resulted in increased apoptosis, suggesting that the induction of autophagy by FOXO3-mediated upregulation of GS is important for cellular survival. These findings reveal a novel signalling network that can directly modulate autophagy through regulation of glutamine metabolism.

DESIGN
conditional activation of pkb and pi3k were followed in a timeseries. Each timepoint consists of 4 independent replicates, labeled with either cy3 or cy5 and put on array against time0.
