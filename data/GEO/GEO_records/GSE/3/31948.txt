TITLE
An Alternative Splicing Switch Regulates Embryonic Stem Cell Pluripotency and Reprogramming [AS microarray]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) is a key process underlying the expansion of proteomic diversity and the regulation of gene expression. However, the contribution of AS to the control of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is not well understood. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved ESC-specific AS event that changes the DNA binding preference of the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1. We show that the ESC-specific isoform of FOXP1 stimulates the expression of transcription factor genes required for pluripotency including OCT4, NANOG, NR5A2 and GDF3, while concomitantly repressing genes required for ESC differentiation. Remarkably, this isoform also promotes the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and the efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. These results reveal an AS switch that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pluripotency through the control of critical ESC-specific transcriptional programs.

DESIGN
In order to identify AS events that potentially control stem cell pluripotency, we used microarray profiling to compare patterns of AS in undifferentiated and differentiated H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
