ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Sites by ChIP-seq from Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Philip Cayting ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Included for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control condition where no antibody targeting was performed. For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for TF binding (Signal), along with sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding (Peaks).
