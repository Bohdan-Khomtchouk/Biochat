TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of  Lung H1299-BRG1 inducible cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global Transcriptional analysis of BRG1 in lung cancer cells

DESIGN
Comparative transcriptional profile comparing the expression in lung cancer cells  before and after  restoring the  Wild type  BRG1 or Mutant BRG1 expression controlled by the  Tet-ON system ( doxicycline depending expression)
