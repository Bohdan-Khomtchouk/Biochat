TITLE
Early Leaf Development: A not so gradual process

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Early leaf growth is sustained by cell proliferation and subsequent cell expansion that initiates at the leaf tip and proceeds in a basipetal direction. Using detailed kinematic and gene expression studies to map these stages during early development of the third leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana we showed that the cell cycle arrest front did not progress gradually down the leaf, but rather was established and abolished abruptly. Interestingly, leaf greening and stomatal patterning followed a similar basipetal pattern, but proliferative pavement cell and formative meristemoid divisions were uncoordinated in respect to onset and persistence. Genes differentially expressed during the transition from cell proliferation to expansion were enriched in genes involved in cell cycle, photosynthesis, and chloroplast retrograde signaling. Proliferating primordia treated with norflurazon, a chemical inhibitor of retrograde signaling, showed inhibited onset of cell expansion. Hence, differentiation of the photosynthetic machinery is important for regulating the exit from proliferation.

DESIGN
GSM839070-GSM839081: Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from leaf 3 of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in vitro and treated or not treated with norflurazon (NF) at 8 days after stratification (DAS) and harvested 24 and 48 hours after treatment. RNA from three biological repeats of each timepoint and treatment were submitted to AGRONOMICS1 array hybridization. GSM839082-GSM839099: Total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from leaf 3 of Arabidopsis seedlings 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 days after stratification (DAS) and grown in vitro. RNAs from three biological repeats of each timepoint were submitted to AGRONOMICS1 array hybridization.
