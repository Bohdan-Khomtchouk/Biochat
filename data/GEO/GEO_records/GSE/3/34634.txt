TITLE
Sauvignon blanc berry developmental

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Berries were sample at three developmental stages (green, veraison and ripe) and flash frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue was subsequently ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80°C. At least three independent berry samples were collected (with n≥50 berries per sample) at three time points: at pre-véraison/green stage (Eichhorn-Lorenz (E-L) system stage 31), at véraison (E-L stage 34) and at ripe/harvest stage (E-L stage 38)

DESIGN
Ground tissues for each developmental stage were pooled.  Replicates: Separate RNA extractions were performed on aliquots of the ground tissue from each developmental stage, labeled and hybiridized to the microarrays
