TITLE
mRNA profiles after experimental ischemia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression we isolated total mRNA from the core, periinfarct and contralateral cortex of 60 sprague-dawley rats after 24 hours or 3 days of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Also ipsilateral and contralateral cortex was obtained from sham-operated and healthy animals. A total of 44 microarrays were performed with RNA pooled from 3 independent animals. For each experimental condition the total n number is of 12.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of different areas of the rat brain (core, periinfarct and contralateral cortex) after 24h and 3days of permanent ischemia
