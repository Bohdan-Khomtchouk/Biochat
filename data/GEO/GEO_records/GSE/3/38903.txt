TITLE
rnapaths--3_02/2012-RNAPATHS-3

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
blanc-08-01_2012_01_rnapaths_03 - rnapaths--3_02/2012 - Identify the transcript overlap and specificity between the PTGS and decapping/exoribonuclease pathways b identifying transcripts that are significantly changed in double mutants versus single mutants, and transcripts that are commonly changed among the single and double mutants compared to WT. - Identify transcripts that are significantly changed in double mutants (L1 vcs sgs2) (xrn4-5/sgs3-11) versus their respective single mutants (L1 vcs and L1 sgs2) (xrn4-5 and sgs3-11) , and identify transcripts that are changed among the single and double mutants compared to WT (Col) reference or to mutant L1 reference.

DESIGN
20 dye-swap - genotype comparaison
