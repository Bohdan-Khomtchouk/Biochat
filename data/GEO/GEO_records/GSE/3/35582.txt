TITLE
The characteristics of genome-wide DNA methylation in naïve CD4+ T cells of patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are characterized by polarized CD4+ T cell responses. During the polarization of naïve CD4+ T cells, DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation status of naïve CD4+ T cells in patients with psoriasis or AD and healthy controls using a ChIP-seq method. As a result, twenty-six regions in the genome ranging in size from 10 to 70 kb were markedly hypomethylated in patients with psoriasis. These regions were mostly pericentromeric on 10 different chromosomes and overlapped with various strong epigenomic signals, such as histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites, that were observed in the ENCODE project. Gene-centric analysis indicated that the promoter regions of 124 genes on the X chromosome had dramatically elevated methylation levels in patients with psoriasis as compared to those from healthy controls ( > 4-fold). Moreover, immune-related genes on the X chromosome had higher hypermethylation than other genes (P < 0.05). These findings imply that methylation changes in naïve CD4+ T cells may affect CD4+ T cell polarization, especially in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Keywords: Psoriasis, Atopic dermatitis, DNA methylation, naïve CD4+ T cells
