TITLE
Expression data from Caenorhabditis elegans L1-stage larvae exposed to ethidium bromide and/or serial ultraviolet C radiation

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Ultraviolet C radiation (UVC) damages the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes; this damage is repaired in the nuclear but not mitochondrial genome. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) inhibits mitochondrial DNA replication. We were interested in the transcriptomic response to exposure to UVC, EtBr, and the combination. The UVC exposure protocol results in a high level of mitochondrial DNA damage, and a low level of nuclear DNA damage (because of repair).

DESIGN
We exposed age-matched L1-stage Caenorhabditis elegans to ultraviolet C radiation (UVC ) three times, separated in time by 24 h, in the absence of food. After the third exposure, larvae were placed on K agar plates with OP50 bacterial food. In some cases ethidium bromide was also used. Nematodes were sampled for RNA isolation several times.
