TITLE
Vreteno, a gonad-specific protein, is essential for germline development and primary piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In Drosophila, Piwi proteins associate with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and protect the germline genome by silencing mobile genetic elements. This defense system acts in germline and gonadal somatic tissue to preserve germline development. Genetic control for these silencing pathways varies greatly between tissues of the gonad. Here, we identified Vreteno (Vret), a novel gonad-specific protein essential for germline development. Vret is required for piRNA-based transposon regulation in both germline and somatic gonadal tissues. We show that Vret, which contains Tudor domains, associates physically with Piwi and Aubergine (Aub), stabilizing these proteins via a gonad-specific mechanism, absent in other fly tissues. In the absence of vret, Piwi-bound piRNAs are lost without changes in piRNA precursor transcript production, supporting a role for Vret in primary piRNA biogenesis. In the germline, piRNAs can engage in an Aub/Argonaute 3 (AGO3)-dependent amplification in the absence of Vret, suggesting that Vret function can distinguish between primary piRNAs loaded into Piwi/Aub complexes and piRNAs engaged in the amplification cycle. We propose that Vret acts at an early step in primary piRNA processing where it plays an essential role in transposon regulation. These studies show that vreteno (vret) has a role in germline development and primary piRNA regulation in Drosophila.

DESIGN
Transposable element expression profiles from Drosophila ovaries mutant for vreteno, piwi and aubergine were compared using genome-wide mRNA expression profiling by Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (Drosophila 2.0). Key targets were validated by qPCR experiments.
