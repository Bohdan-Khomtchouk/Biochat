TITLE
Transcriptional Alterations in Skeletal Muscle Following Desmin Deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Desmin is a cytoskeletal protein in muscle involved in integrating cellular space and transmitting forces.  In this study we sought to determine the effects of desmin deletion on skeletal muscle at the transcriptional level across many pathways of muscle physiology.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the TA muscle of mice of two genotypes (wildtype (WT) and desmin knockout (KO)) and two ages (7-9 weeks (Adult) and 12-14 months (Aged)).  Numbers per group are as follows: WT_Adult (5), WT_Aged (5), KO_Adult (5), KO_Aged (4).
