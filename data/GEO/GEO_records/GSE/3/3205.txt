TITLE
Homeostatic Adjustment and Metabolic Remodeling in Glucose-limited Yeast Cultures Time Course 1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time course of batch growth. Reference (channel 1) was a culture grown in MD medium with 2.4 g/L glucose, with 5 slpm air-flow, stirring at 400 rpm and a constant 300C temperature, dilution 0.25 volumes/hour. The experimental (channel 2) time course samples were grown in batch for the indicated time.  The " Low-D chemostat vs. High-D chemostat " hybridization's channel 2 sample was grown in a chemostat, with a dilution rate of 0.05 volumes/hour; it is most similar to the time course samples taken between 8 and 9 hours. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series.
