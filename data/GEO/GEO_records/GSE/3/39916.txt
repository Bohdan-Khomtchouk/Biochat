TITLE
Expression data from murine bone marrow-resident plasma cells and spleen mature follicular B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD138+ B220- plasma cells were sorted from bone marrow and B220+ CD23+ mature follicular B cells were sorted from the spleens.  Plasma cells were sorted from C57BL/6 mice 7 days after boosting with antigen, with mice first primed with an i.p. injection of KLH/IFA followed by boost at day 21 with KLH/PBS i.p. Mature B cells were sorted from antigen-naïve C57BL/6 mice. We compared expression profiles of plasma cells and mature B cells to identify differentially expressed transcripts.

DESIGN
Seven days after boosting with KLH, plasma cells were enriched by CD138-PE/anti-PE magnetic bead enrichment and then sorted to purity.  Affymetrix microarrays were performed on 50,000-70,000 plasma cells and 2,000,000-3,000,000 naïve B cells.
