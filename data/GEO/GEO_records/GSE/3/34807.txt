TITLE
The estrogen receptor α is required and sufficient to maintain physiological glucose uptake in the mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rationale: Estrogens attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and increase cardiac contractility via their cognate receptors ERα and ERβ. Since female sex hormones enhance global glucose utilization and because myocardial function and mass are tightly linked to cardiac glucose metabolism we tested the hypothesis that expression and activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) might be required and sufficient to maintain physiological cardiac glucose uptake in the murine heart. Methods and Results: Cardiac glucose uptake quantified in vivo by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was strongly impaired in ovarectomized compared to gonadal intact female C57BL/6JO mice. The selective ERα agonist 16α-LE2 and the non-selective ERα and ERβ agonist 17β-estradiol completely restored cardiac glucose uptake in ovarectomized mice. Cardiac FDG uptake was strongly decreased in female ERα knockout mice (ERKO) compared to wild type littermates. Biochemical assays, affymetrix cDNA array analysis, western blotting and immuno-staining of cardiac glucose transporters revealed a positive correlation of ERα dependent cardiac FDG uptake with preserved cardiac glucose transporter-1 expression and micro-vascular localization. Conclusions: Systemic activation of the ERα estrogen receptor is sufficient and its expression is required to maintain physiological glucose uptake in the murine heart, which is likely to contribute to known cardio-protective estrogen effects.
