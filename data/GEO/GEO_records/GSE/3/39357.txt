TITLE
ETV1 and ERG genome binding/occupancy profiling by genome tiling array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS factors, ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. How these factors contribute to tumorigenesis and whether they play similar in vivo roles remain elusive. We show that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but in an opposing fashion. In mice with ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus, either factors cooperated with Pten-loss, leading to localized cancer, but only ETV1 supported development of advanced adenocarcinoma, likely through enhancement of androgen receptor signaling and steroid biosynthesis. Indeed, ETV1 expression promotes autonomous testosterone production, which may contribute to tumor progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patient data confirmed association of ETV1 expression with aggressive disease. We conclude that despite many shared targets, ERG and ETV1 contribute differently to prostate tumor biology. Hence, prostate cancers with these fusions should be considered as distinct subtypes for patient stratification and therapy.

DESIGN
Genomic targets of ERG and ETV1 transcription factors were identified by antibody-mediated and biotin-mediated ChIP-chip in human VCaP and LNCaP cells, respectively.
