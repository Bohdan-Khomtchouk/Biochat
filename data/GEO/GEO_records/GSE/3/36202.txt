TITLE
Effect of LIF and IL-6 on gene expression in JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo trophoblastic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase the invasiveness of JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells. This study examines the effect of LIF and IL-6 on gene expression in trophoblastic cell models viz. JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells to decipher the molecular basis of the increase in invasiveness.

DESIGN
JEG-3 and HTR-8/Svneo cells were stimulated with LIF (50 ng/ml) and IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h in plain medium keeping untreated cells as a control. After 24 h of stimulation, total RNA was isolated from these cells and used for microarray experiments. These experiments were performed once.
