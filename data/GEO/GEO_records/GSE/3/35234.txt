TITLE
Analysis of the gene expression within the cochlea of aging C57BL6j mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression within the cochlea of C57BL6j mice was examined. The hypothesis was that there was a genetic component to Age Related Hearing Loss and microarray would be useful in detecting candidate genes.

DESIGN
Mice were aged in the laboratory to 4, 15 and 45 weeks of age. The cochlea were removed and pooled into groups of 5 for each age group. Total RNA was extracted and used in the micoroarray analysis. Differential expression was analysed between the different age groups i.e 4 - 15, 4 - 45 and 15 - 45 weeks.
