TITLE
Transcriptional Response to Nitrogen Limitation in Pelagibacter ubique

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1002

SUMMARY
Nitrogen is one of the major nutrients limiting microbial productivity in the ocean, and as a result marine microorganisms have evolved specialized systems for responding to nitrogen stress. The highly abundant alphaproteobacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique lacks the canonical GlnB, GlnD, and NtrB/NtrC genes for regulating nitrogen assimilation. A survey of 127 Alphaproteobacteria genomes found these genes to be highly represented in free-living and pathogenic organisms with large genomes and only missing in a subset of obligate intracellular organisms and other SAR11 strains. We examined global differences in mRNA and protein expression in Ca. P. ubique strain HTCC1062 during nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-replete stationary phase to understand how this thriving organism responds to nitrogen limitation. Transporters for ammonium (AmtB), taurine (TauA), amino acids (YhdW), and opines (OccT) were all elevated in nitrogen-limited cells, indicating they devote increased resources to the assimilation of nitrogenous compounds. Enzymes for assimilating amine into glutamine (GlnA) and glutamate (AspC, GltBD) were similarly up-regulated.  Differential regulation of the transcriptional regulator NtrX in the two-component signaling system NtrY/NtrX was also observed, implicating it in the control of the nitrogen starvation response. Comparisons of the transcriptome and proteome suggest that Amt is post-transcriptionally repressed during nitrogen limitation, supporting previous studies that computationally identified a novel cis-acting riboswitch upstream of this gene. These observations support the conclusion that Ca. P. ubique has an unusually simple regulatory system that enables it to increase its capacity for the uptake of nitrogenous compounds in response to nitrogen limitation.
