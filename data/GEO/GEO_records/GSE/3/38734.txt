TITLE
Expression data from primary ovarian samples and matched abdominal deposits

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to analyse expression in primary ovarian tumors and associated abdominal deposits. GeneGo pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between primary tumors and deposits revealed 4 of the top 10 pathways related to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell adhesion.

DESIGN
Primary ovarian tumours and matched abdominal deposits were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
