TITLE
Multiple bypass pathways of Hsk1 kinase essential for initiation of DNA replication in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Cdc7/Hsk1 is a conserved kinase required for initiation of DNA replication that potentially regulates timing and locations of replication origin firing. Here, we show that viability of fission yeast hsk1∆ cells can be restored by loss of mrc1, which is required for maintenance of replication fork integrity, by cds1∆, or by a checkpoint-deficient mutant of mrc1. In these mutants, normally inactive origins are activated in the presence of HU and binding of Cdc45 to MCM is stimulated. mrc1∆ bypasses hsk1∆ more efficiently because of its checkpoint-independent inhibitory functions. Unexpectedly, hsk1∆ is viable at 37°C. More DNA is synthesized, and some dormant origins fire in the presence of HU at 37°C. On the other hand, hsk1∆ bypass strains grow poorly at 25°C compared to at higher temperatures. Our results show that Hsk1 functions for DNA replication can be bypassed by different genetic backgrounds as well as under varied physiological conditions, providing additional evidence for plasticity of the replication program in eukaryotes.
