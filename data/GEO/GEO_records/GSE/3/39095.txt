TITLE
Colon tissue of Il10-/- mice monoassociated with Escherichia coli NC101 or NC101-delta-pks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed that deletion of polyketide synthase (pks) from E. coli NC101 reduces its ability to induce tumors in interleukin-10 knockout (Il10-/-) mice injected with azoxymethane (AOM), without altering histologic inflammation. The goal of this experiment is to assess inflammatory cytokine levels in colonic tissue of these mice.

DESIGN
2 germ-free Il10-/- mice were assayed and used as controls. 3 E. coli NC101 and 3 E. coli NC101-delta-pks monoassociated mice were experimental samples.
