TITLE
An expression signature for p53 in breast cancer predicts mutation status, transcriptional effects, and patient survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological tumor samples (ie, breast tumor specimens) consisted of freshly frozen breast tumors from a population-based cohort of 315 women representing 65% of all breast cancers resected in Uppsala County, Sweden, from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989.  Estrogen receptor status was determined by biochemical assay as part of the routine clinical procedure. An experienced pathologist determined the Elston-Ellis grades of the tumors, classifying the tumors into low, medium and high-grade tumors.  The clinico-pathological characteristics accompanying each tumor include p53 status, ER status, tumor grade, lymph node status and patient age. Keywords: Tumor sample comparisons
