TITLE
The Global Transcriptional Response of Fission Yeast to Hydrogen Sulfide

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an important gasotransmitter has fundamental roles in human diseases. The cellular effect of H2S has received lots of attention recently. H2S can affect ion channels, transcription factors and kinase in mammals. The mechanism of cellular effect of H2S is not completely understood. We used fission yeast as a model organism to study the global transcriptional profile in response to H2S by microarray.
