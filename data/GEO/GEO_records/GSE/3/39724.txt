TITLE
Gene expression analysis of iTregs and nTregs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MBP TCR Tg mouse (1B3) generates only iTregs when crossed onto RAGKO background. Tregs from 1B3.RAG mouse were used for gene expression analsysis to determine genes selectively expressed in peripherally generated iTregs

DESIGN
iTregs from 1B3.RAG mice ( > 90% Foxp3+) were run against total Tregs from 1B3 and WT NOD mice. Foxp3- CD4+T cells were used as control from all strains as Tconv. (1B3 denotes MBP-TCR Tg mouse).
