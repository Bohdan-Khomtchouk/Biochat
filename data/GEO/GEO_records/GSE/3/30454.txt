TITLE
Colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability display unique miRNA profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microRNA expression of tumoral and non-tumoral colonic tissues. The aim of this study was to analyze the global miRNA signatures in various groups of well-characterized CRCs based on the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI).

DESIGN
Total RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 4 different groups (normal colonic mucosa, Lynch syndrome tumors, sporadic MSI tumors and MSS tumors) was isolated using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer instructions. MiRNA expression profiles were analyzed using miRNA microarray platform.
