Enterococcus faecalis EfaR mutant transcriptome profile

Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
Metal ions are important cofactors of inumerous enzymes and can interfere in many biological processes. Manganese is a particularly relevant metal as it is also involved in protection from oxidative stress and several Mn-dependent regulators have been shown to have a role in bacterial pathogenicity. A putative DNA-binding motif, here called efa motif  was discovered in the promoter regions of genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in the presence of excess zinc, manganese and copper ions. This motif led to the finding and study of the genes putatively involved in the maintenance of manganese homeostasis in E. faecalis. In these genes is included the efaCBA operon, regulated by the Mn-dependent regulator EfaR. Other genes with this efa motif are shown to be regulated by EfaR. Regulation of these efa motif genes by EfaR is discussed as well as some clues on metal interaction with EfaR. Experiments mimicking conditions occurring on biological processes in the host showed that an EfaR plays an important role in biological processes crucial for E. faecalis colonization and virulence.
