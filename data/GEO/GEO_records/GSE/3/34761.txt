TITLE
All-iPS cell mice generated from terminally differentiated B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) often results in aberrant silencing of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, which compromises their ability to generate entirely iPSC-derived mice (“all-iPSC mice”). Here, we show that reprogramming in the presence of ascorbic acid attenuates hypermethylation of Dlk1-Dio3 by enabling a chromatin configuration at its imprint control region that interferes with abnormal binding of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a. This approach allowed us to generate adult all-iPSC mice from mature B cells, which have thus far failed to support the development of exclusively iPSC-derived postnatal mice. Our data demonstrate that factor-mediated reprogramming can endow a defined, terminally differentiated cell type with a developmental potential equivalent to that of embryonic stem cells. More generally, these findings indicate that the choice of culture conditions used for transcription factor-mediated reprogramming can strongly influence the epigenetic and biological properties of resultant iPSCs.

DESIGN
This series consists of quadruplicated mRNA expression microarray data (Affymetrix mouse 430_2 3'-IVT array) for iPS cells derived from MEF cells under cell culture conditions with or without ascorbic acid supplementation. iPS cells were generated from MEFs of the Col-OKSM reprogrammable mice. In the presence of doxycycline, the reprogramming transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc were induced in MEFs to derivate iPS cells. Total RNA was isolated from iPS cells derivated in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid in culture medium.
