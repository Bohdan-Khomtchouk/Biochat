TITLE
Gene profiling in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis between the actinorhizal tree Casuarina glauca and the fungus Glomus intraradices.

ORGANISM
Casuarina glauca

SUMMARY
Casuarina glauca belongs to a family of angiosperms called actinorhizal plants because they can develop nitrogen-fixing nodules in association with the soil bacteria Frankia.  They can also develop arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) while associated with Glomeromycota fungi. The aim of this transcriptomic study was to get a global view of the plant symbiotic genetic program in AM and to identify new key plant genes involved in endosymbioses.

DESIGN
C. glauca plants were grown in hydroponics  then transferred to pots with or without spores of Glomus intraradices and watered with low phosphate solution to enhance mycorrhization. For this study we considered two stages:  -  a stage where plants were inoculated with G. intraradices, roots were harvested 8 weeks after inoculation with the G. intraradices. AM structures were present.   - a stage where plants were not inoculated, roots were harvested at the same time as the inoculated roots , this is our control condition. AM structures were absent.   Three biological replicates were used for each condition. Microarrays were designed by Imaxio (Clermont Ferrand, France ; ) which has been accredited by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA; ) as a certified service provider for microarray technologies. Based on 14327 annotated unigenes for C. glauca, 60mers probes were designed using eArray software (1 probe per unigene) and custom 8 x 15K Oligo Microarrays were manufactured by Agilent.
