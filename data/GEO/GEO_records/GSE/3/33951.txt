TITLE
Identification of target genes of ABI3 [Agilent 44k]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ABI3 is a key regulator of seed development in Arabidopsis and other plants.To identify genes regulated by ABI3 we performed array based transcriptome analysis of Dexamethasone inducible ABI3 transgenic seedlings. ABI3 mostly in concert with abscisic acid (ABA) was found to activate genes specifically expressed during the maturation phase of seed development.

DESIGN
Two weeks old wildtype and 35S::ABI3::GR seedlings were treated with ABA, Dexamethasone (DEX) and ABA plus Dexamethasone for 4 h. Two biological independent experiments were performed. Wildtype was induced to control for DEX-induction of genes.
