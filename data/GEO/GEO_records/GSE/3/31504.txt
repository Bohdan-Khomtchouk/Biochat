TITLE
Impact of Gene Expression Profiling Based Risk Stratification in Patients with Myeloma Receiving Initial Therapy with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities by FISH and metaphase cytogenetics allows risk stratification in multiple myeloma (MM); however, gene expression profiling (GEP) based signatures may enable more specific risk categorization. We examined the utility of two GEP-based risk stratification systems among patients undergoing initial therapy with lenalidomide in the context of a phase 3 trial.
