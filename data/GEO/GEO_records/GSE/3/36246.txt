TITLE
Small molecules enable highly efficient neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Forced expression of pro-neural transcription factors was shown to mediate direct neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts. Since neurons are postmitotic, the conversion efficiency represents an important parameter. Here we present a minimalist approach combining two factor neuronal programming with small molecule-based inhibition of GSK3ÃŸ and SMAD signaling, which gives rise to functional neuron-like cells (iNs) of various neurotransmitter phenotypes with an overall yield of up to > 200% and a final neuronal purity of up to > 80%.

DESIGN
Timcourse of reprogramming of fibroblasts towards an neuronal phenotype in two independent fibroblast lines
