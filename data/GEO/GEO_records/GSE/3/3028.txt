TITLE
Genomic and Proteomic Characterization of Sessile and Planktonic Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
In order to understand the cellular mechanisms that facilitate a surface-associated lifestyle, expression profiles were determined at the levels of transcription and translation for sessile and planktonic Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 700819)). These investigations indicate that the immobilized bacteria undergo a shift in cellular priorities away from metabolic, motility and protein synthesis capabilities towards emphasis on iron uptake, oxidative stress defense and membrane transport. Keywords: transcript profiling
