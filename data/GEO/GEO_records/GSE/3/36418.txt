TITLE
Genome wide expression in ADAMTS13-deficient thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study sought correlates of relapse tendency in TTP by examining gene expression profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with acquired ADAMTS13-deficient TTP in remission and matched healthy controls for global gene expression and autoantibodies.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PAXgene RNA tubes from 39 patients with with acquired ADAMTS13-deficient TTP (all patients had relapsed) and 39 healthy controls.
