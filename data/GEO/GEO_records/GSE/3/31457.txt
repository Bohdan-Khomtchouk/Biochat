TITLE
Gene expression in the adrenal glands of two spontaneously hypertensive rat strains at 3 and 6 weeks of age

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression profiles in the rat adrenal glands using genome-wide microarray technology, and determined gene expression profiles in 3 rat strains: normotensive WKY, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP). To identify candidate genes involved in the genesis of hypertension in the SHR strains, we compared the gene expression levels at 3 and 6 weeks of age, isolated 407 genes showing a more than 4-fold increase or a less than 1/4-fold decrease.
