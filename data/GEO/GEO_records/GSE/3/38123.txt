TITLE
Expression Profiles of PMH treated with 7µM of the genotoxic compound cisplatin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic changes induced in primary mouse hepatocytes (C57BL/6 ) by  7µM of cisplatin after treatment for 24 and 48h

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in PMH mRNA following 24 and 48 hours of exposure to  7µM of cisplatin and its solvent. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 12 arrays.
