TITLE
Chip-chip from budding yeast cells with Sir3

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Sir3 applied with tilling array chip ( ChIP on chip of Sir3) analysis demonstrated that Changes of conventional and dynamical Genome-wide localization of Sir3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during different growth stages

DESIGN
comparison the genome-wide localization of Sir3 of logarithmic phase younger cells vs of stationary phase older cells
