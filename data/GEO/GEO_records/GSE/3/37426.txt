TITLE
miRNAs expression in kidney tissues of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning  regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By using high-throughput microRNA profiling analysis, we identified a series of miRNAs dysregulated in local inflammatory lesions of human patients with autoimmune diseases such as SLE.

DESIGN
We isolated the renal biopsy samples from eight SLE patients as well as tumor adjacent kidney tissues from four kidney cancer patients as controls for comparison. Total RNA was extracted for the TaqManÂ® Low Density Assay v3.0
