TITLE
Dominant MLH1 epimutation linked to 5'UTR variant c.-27C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Constitutional epimutations of tumor suppressor genes manifest as promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of a single allele in normal somatic tissues, thereby predisposing to cancer. Constitutional MLH1 epimutations occur in individuals with young-onset cancer and demonstrate non-Mendelian inheritance through their reversal in the germline. We report a cancer-affected family showing dominant transmission of soma-wide highly mosaic MLH1 methylation and transcriptional repression linked to a particular genetic haplotype. The epimutation was erased in spermatozoa but reinstated in the somatic cells of the next generation. The affected haplotype harbored two single nucleotide substitutions in tandem: c.-27C > A located near the transcription initiation site and c.85G > T. The c.-27C > A variant significantly reduced transcriptional activity in reporter assays and is the probable cause of this epimutation.

DESIGN
Five members of a three-generation Caucasian Lynch syndrome family with an autosomal dominant MLH1 epimutation linked to a single nucleotide variant (c.-27C > A) within the MLH1 5'UTR were examined for copy number variations and retention of heterozygosity on chromosome 3. These five carriers of constitutional MLH1 methylation and the c.-27C > A variant were compared with 300 healthy Caucasian controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium using three algorithms (QuantiSNP, PennCNV, COKGEN) to detect any copy number variants. The five family members studied were female (the proband II5, her affected mother I1, and three asymptomatic relatives II2, II4 and III2) are labeled according to the pedigree in Figure 3 of the associated publication (Hitchins et al., Cancer Cell, 2011).
