TITLE
Ectopic expression of wild-type Cop Fry in MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified the wt Cop allele of the predicted Fry gene as a mammary carcinoma susceptibility gene. This gene has not been characterized in mammals, so for part of our analysis we conducted microarray experiments to look at the changes in gene expression which occur when the wt Cop Fry allele is ectopically expressed in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (a cell line which we identified as having low FRY mRNA expression). We used microarrays to identify the Fry interactome and identified that Fry affects the expression of gene networks that maintain normal cellular and tissue architecture, organization, differentiation of epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Three RNA samples were utilized for each of the two cell lines.  These samples varied in passage number.
