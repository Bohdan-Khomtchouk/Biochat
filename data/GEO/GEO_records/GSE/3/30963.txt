TITLE
Widespread Generation of Alternative UTRs Contributes to Sex-specific RNA Binding by UNR

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Upstream of N-ras (UNR) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation and stability by binding to sites generally located in untranslated regions (UTRs). In Drosophila, sex-specific binding of UNR to various RNAs plays key roles in the control of X chromosome dosage compensation in both sexes. In order to investigate broader sex-specific functions of UNR, we have identified its RNA targets in adult male and female flies by high-throughput RNA binding and transcriptome analysis. Here we show that UNR binds to a large set of protein-coding transcripts and to a smaller set of non-coding RNAs in a sex-specific fashion. The analyses also reveal a strong correlation between sex-specific binding of UNR and sex-specific differential expression of UTRs in target genes. Validation experiments indicate that UNR indeed recognizes sex-specifically processed transcripts. These results suggest that UNR exploits the transcript diversity generated by alternative processing and alternative promoter usage to bind and regulate target genes in a sex-specific manner.

DESIGN
Of the total 6 chips, three are independent immunoprecipitations, while the other three microarrays are their dye-swaps (same IPs).
