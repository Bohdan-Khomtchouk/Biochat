Genome-wide study of HCFC1 binding sites and its associated transcription factors in cycling Human HeLa cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional regulation in human cells has implicated a large number of promoter-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate transcription via diverse mechanisms.  In some cases, these DNA-sequence-specific factors associate with intermediaries that orchestrate interactions with the chromatin-modifying enzymes.  One such intermediary is HCF-1 (host-cell factor-1; HCFC1).  HCF-1, first identified for its involvement in herpes-simplex virus transcription and subsequently shown to be an important cell-cycle regulator, has a poorly defined role in genome-wide transcriptional regulation.  We show here, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequence analysis (ChIP-seq), that HCF-1 is a major transcriptional start site associated factor, whose promoter association correlates positively with transcriptional activity.  Thus, in HeLa cells HCF-1 is observed on 5400 generally active CpG-island promoters.  Examination of the DNA sequences underlying the HCF-1-binding sites revealed three sequence motifs associated with the binding of (i) ZNF143 and Ronin/THAP11, (ii) GABP, and (iii) YY1 sequence-specific transcription factors.  Subsequent ChIP-seq analysis of these four transcription factors revealed a large co-association of HCF-1 with these four transcription factors at approximately 90% of HCF-1-bound promoters.  These studies suggest that a relatively small number of transcription factors -- some (ZNF143 and Ronin/THAP11) in novel combinations -- play a major role in HeLa-cell transcriptional regulation in association with HCF-1.
