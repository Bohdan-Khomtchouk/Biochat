TITLE
Genomic Study of RNA Polymerase II and III SNAPc-Bound Promoters Reveals a Gene Transcribed by both Enzymes and a Broad Use of Common Activators

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNAPc-dependent promoters are unique among cellular promoters in being very similar to each other, even though some of them recruit RNA polymerase II and other RNA polymerase III. We have examined all SNAPc-bound promoters present in the human genome. We find that there is a surprisingly small number of them, some 70 promoters. Among these, the large majority is bound by either RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III, as expected, but one gene hitherto considered an RNA polymerase III gene is also occupied by significant levels of RNA polymerase II, which synthesizes an RNA distinct from that synthesized by RNA polymerase III. Both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III SNAPc- dependent promoters use a largely overlapping set of a few transcription activators, including GABP, a novel factor implicated in snRNA gene transcription.
