TITLE
High-throughput screen for genes predominantly expressed in the ICM of mouse blastocysts by whole mount in situ hybridiz

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We attempted to identify candidate genes that are expressed more highly in the ICM than in TE cells. Mouse ES cells are cultured from the ICM, whereas mouse TS cells are cultured from the TE. Although these cells have been cultured in vitro, they represent the in vitro equivalents of the ICM and TE. Therefore, genes which are expressed more highly in ES than TS in microarray studies were good candidates for genes predominantly expressed in the ICM in blastocysts. Keywords: strain or line design
