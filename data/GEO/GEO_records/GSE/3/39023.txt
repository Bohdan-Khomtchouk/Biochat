TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides under nitrogen limitation.

ORGANISM
Rhodotorula toruloides

SUMMARY
Nitrogen limitation is a major regulator to initiate lipid overproduction in oleaginous fungi. To examine the influence of nitrogen starvation, chemiostat cultures of R. toruloides in defined media with abundant ammonium (MM) or minute ammonium (MM-N) were performed to obtain steady-state samples. Then Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) technology was used for high-throughput transcriptome profiling of these samples.

DESIGN
Two samples cultured in minimum media with abundant ammonium (MM) or minute ammonium (MM-N)
