TITLE
Long-term culture associated gene expression changes in MSC [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were isolated from human bone marrow. Here, we have compared gene expression profiles of MSC at early and late passages. Long-term culture associated gene expression changes were then correlated with DNA-methylation profiles. The goal of this study was to determine if senescence-associated DNA-methylation (SA-DNAm) changes are reflected by differential gene expression. Overall, genes with SA-DNAm changes (particularly with SA-hypomethylation) were detected at low level and seemed to be scarcely expressed at early and late passages.

DESIGN
MSC were isolated from three different donors and culture expanded until replicative senescence. Gene expression profiles were compared at early and late passage using GeneChip Humang Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). Six hybridizations are included in this series.
