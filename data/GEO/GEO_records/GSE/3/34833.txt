TITLE
Gene expression data of BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors from ETV5 wild-type and ETV5 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanism of ETV5-mediated pre-B cell survival signaling, we investigated the gene expression pattern in BCR-ABL1-transformed ETV5+/+ and ETV5-/- B cell precursors.

DESIGN
BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors of ETV5wild-type and ETV5 knockout mice were subjected to RNA isolation
