TITLE
Transcriptional Signatures as a Disease-Specific and Predictive Inflammatory Biomarker for Type 1 Diabetes [Pneu_S3S24_10Pneu_4HC]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.  Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC).  Here, using an optimized cryopreserved PBMC-based protocol, we compared the signature found between unrelated healthy controls and patients with bacterial pneumonia.

DESIGN
UPN727 cells were stimulated with either plasma from unrelated healthy controls (n=18) or plasma from patients with bacterial pneumonia (n=10). Gene expression analysis was perfromed in order to evaluate the transcriptional signature associated with bacterial pneumonia.
