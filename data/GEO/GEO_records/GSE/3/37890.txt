TITLE
Cardiac miRNA expression (random section containing both ventricles) in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to vehicle or 0.162 mg carbon black nanoparticles by intratracheal installation and were sacrificed 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure. Gene expression was investigated in two sets of mice treated according to the identical exposure protocol. MicroRNAs were investigated in the second set of mice.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.000 or 0.162 mg Printex 90 and were sacrificed 1, 3 and 28 days after exposure. Individual total RNA enriched with small RNA from 6 mice per treatment group (control and 0.162mg) was hybridized to 8 x 15K Agilent miRNA slides.
