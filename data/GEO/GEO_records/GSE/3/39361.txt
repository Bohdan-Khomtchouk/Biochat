TITLE
Changes of miRNAs during osteogenic differentiation of PDGFRa+ mesenchymal progenitors derived from human skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive analyses of miRNAs expression were performed using miRNA microarrays during osteogenic differentiation of PDGFRa+ mesenchymal progenitors isolated from human skeletal muscle to identify miRNAs that are involved in osteogenesis of PDGFRa+ mesenchymal progenitors.

DESIGN
PDGFRa+ mesenchymal progenitors were isolated from the gluteus medius muscles of two different patients, and then subjected to osteogenic induction. Expression of miRNAs was examined using miRNA microarrays at the time points of one week and two weeks after osteogenic induction and were compared with that of uninduced cells.
