TITLE
mRNA degradation in Mycobacterium smegmatis under aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
Transcription was arrested using 50 ug/ul of rifampin leaving RNA degradation as the sole vector responsible for mRNA abundance. mRNA half-lives were calculated from the decay of signal intensity from T0.

DESIGN
Three replicates were sampled before transcription arrest, and after 5 and 10 minutes of mRNA decay for a total of 9 arrays.  Five minutes of RNA degradation occurred during the processing of these samples, therefore sample times, indicated in the sample name, represent 0, five, and ten minutes of RNA degradation.
