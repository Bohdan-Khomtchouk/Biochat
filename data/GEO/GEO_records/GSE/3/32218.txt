TITLE
Histone Modifications by ChIP-seq from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale

ORGANISM
Mouse ENCODE

SUMMARY
This track shows probable locations of the specified histone modifications in the given cell types as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Each experiment is associated with an input signal, which represents the control condition where immunoprecipitation with non-specific immunoglobulin was performed in the same cell type. For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for histone modification (Signal), along with sites that have the greatest evidence of histone modification, as identified by the PeakSeq algorithm (Peaks).
