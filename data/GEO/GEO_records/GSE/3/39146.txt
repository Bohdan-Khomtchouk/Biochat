TITLE
Slicing-Independent RISC Activation Requires the Argonaute PAZ Domain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small RNAs regulate the genetic networks through a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA induced silencing complexes (RISC), which in mammals contains at its center one of four Argonaute proteins (Ago1-4). A key regulatory event in the RNAi and miRNA pathways is Ago loading, where double stranded small RNA duplexes are incorporated into RISC (pre-RISC) and then become single stranded (mature-RISC), a process that is not well understood. The Agos contain an evolutionary conserved PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain whose primary function is to bind the 3â€™-end of small RNAs. We created multiple Paz domain disrupted Ago mutant proteins and studied their biochemical properties and biological functionality in cells. We found that the Paz domain is dispensable for Ago loading of slicing-competent RISC. In contrast, in the absence of slicer activity or slicer substrate duplex RNAs, Paz-disrupted Agos bound duplex siRNAs but were unable to unwind/eject the passenger strand and form functional RISC complexes. We have discovered that the highly conserved Paz domain plays an important role in RISC activation, providing new mechanistic insights into how miRNAs regulate genes, as well as new insights for future design of miRNA and RNAi-based therapeutics.

DESIGN
Various Argonautes associated small RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing the Agos-IP samples in HEK293 Cells transfected with corresponding Argonaute.
