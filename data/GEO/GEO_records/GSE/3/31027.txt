TITLE
Effects of pre-B Cell Receptor in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of pre-B cell receptor in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from Ighm KO mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with uchain-CD8 or empty vector control (CD8) and subjected to gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Five days post transduction, total RNA of CD8 positive sorted cells were extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
