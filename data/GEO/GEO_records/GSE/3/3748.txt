SUMMARY
One hundred ninety wildtype male C57BL/6J mice age 7-10 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and entrained to a 12:12 light:dark cycle for 2 weeks. Mice were placed in light-tight boxes on a 12:12 LD cycle for 4 weeks, then released into constant darkness. Starting 30 hours after entry into DD (CT18), tissues from 5 (skeletal muscle) or 10 (liver or SCN) wildtype mice were collected every 4 hours for 48 hours, for a total of 12 timepoints. At timepoints 34 through 58 hours in DD, tissues from age-matched male C57BL/6J Clock/Clock homozygous mutant mice that had been treated with the same light entrainment protocol as the wildtype were collected. Tissues were collected from 5 Clock/Clock mutants at each timepoint except for 34 and 46 hours after the onset of DD, when tissues from 10 Clock/Clock mice were collected and run as independent replicates. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the optic nerves were severed in complete darkness; brain dissection was performed using illumination from an infrared viewer (FJW Industries, Palatine, IL). SCNs were dissected out, pooled at a density of 5 per tube in 100 ?l RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX), frozen on dry ice, and stored at â€“80?C until use. Keywords: time course
