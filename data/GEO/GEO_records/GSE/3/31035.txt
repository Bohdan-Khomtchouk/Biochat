TITLE
SNP analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) represent a unique opportunity for regenerative medicine since they offer the prospect of generating unlimited quantities of cells for autologous transplantation as a novel treatment for a broad range of disorders. However, the use of hIPSCs in the context of genetically inherited human disease will require correction of disease-causing mutations in a manner that is fully compatible with clinical applications. We analyzed hiPSC line and genetically modified derivatives using high-density SNP array to investigate genomic instability associated reprogramming and genetic modification.

DESIGN
Primary iPSC lines derived from patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency were generated. This genetic disorder is caused by homozygous mutation (Glu342Lys) in the SERPINA1 gene. We carried out mutation correction by 2 steps: zinc-finger nuclease-stimuated gene targeting and piggyBac trasnsposon-mediated selection cassette elimination. Parental fibroblast lines, primary iPSC lines and homozygously targeted iPSC lines were subjected to SNP genotyping using Illumina CytoSNP-12 BeadChiP.
