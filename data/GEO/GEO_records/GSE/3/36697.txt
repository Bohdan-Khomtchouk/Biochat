TITLE
Effect of deletion of the selenium-binding protein 1 gene on gene expression in the ovary of C57BL/6J mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Selenium-binding protein 1 (SeBP1) is a cytosolic protein expressed in various tissues such as liver, kidney and gonad. This protein is suggested to serve in tumor suppression, anti-aging, modification of oxidative stress, protein transport/degradation in cells, and other phenomena. However, the physiological function of SeBP1 remains obscure because of lack of definitive evidence. To address this issue, we compared gene expression between wild-type and SeBP1-knockout (KO) mice using DNA microarray analysis. The results obtained in this study revealed that the deletion of SeBP1 causes a lot of changes in the expression of proliferation-related genes, including a decrease in myelocytomatosis oncogene and an increase in adenomatosis polyposis coli and tumor necrosis factor. Thus, it is suggested that SeBP1 plays a role in the proliferative and/or anti-proliferative effect via the regulation of these genes.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from the ovaries of wild-type and SeBP1 KO mice at 20 weeks old (each N=3), and their cDNAs were applied to the analysis using Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Oligo DNA Microarray (4x44K) version 2.
