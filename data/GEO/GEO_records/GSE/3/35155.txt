TITLE
Density Transfer Data for Lachancea waltii DNA Replication Profile

ORGANISM
Lachancea waltii

SUMMARY
Array data detailing the progression of DNA replication in the yeast Lachancea waltii.

DESIGN
L. waltii cells were pregrown in heavy isotope medium and synchronized at early S phase. They were then released into normal medium, wherein DNA replication proceeds. Replicated DNA molecules are thus of heavy-light (HL) composition as compared to unreplicated molecules, which are heavy-heavy (HH). 4 time points were taken and the percent of heavy-light DNA was determined at each time point. The heavy-heavy and heavy-light DNA molecules were separated by ultracentrifugation, differentially labeled, and hybridized to a genomic array for L. waltii.  The array thus shows the progression of DNA replication.
