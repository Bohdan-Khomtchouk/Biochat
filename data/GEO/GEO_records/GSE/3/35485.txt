TITLE
Transcriptional Programs Controlling Perinatal Lung Maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, time dependent genome wide lung mRNA profiling changes were assessed using C57BL/6J and A/J mice. Through comprehensive bioinformatics and functional genomics analyses, we identified both temporal and strain dependent gene expression patterns, systemically mapped key regulators, bioprocesses, and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation, providing the basis for new therapeutic strategies to enhance lung function in preterm infants.

DESIGN
In this study, we designed a genome-wide mRNA expression time-course study from E15.5 to Postnatal Day 0 (PND0) using lung RNAs from C57BL/6J and A/J mice that differ significantly in gestational length.
