TITLE
Expression data from C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We exposed wild-type Vibrio cholerae E7496, multiple Vibrio cholerae virulence factor deleted genes with intact hemolysin A gene [CVD109] and without hemolysin A gene [CVD110] in E7946, and E.coli OP50 to wild-type C.elegans N2 for 18 hours. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
C. elegans were exposed to Vibrio cholerae and E.coli then hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chips.
