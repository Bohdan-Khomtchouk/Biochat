TITLE
Microarray analysis of purified germ cells in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of purified pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. Each stage was examined in wild type and RNF8 knockout mice in two biological replicates.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST Arrays with purified pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids were enriched from 3 to 4 males from the WT or Rnf8-KO via BSA gravity sedimentation according to the previous publication [PMID 8231890] and > 95% (PS, RS) enrichments were verified after DAPI staining under a fluorescent microscope. For microarray analysis, total RNAs from purified pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids were examined.
