TITLE
Differentially regulated genes induced in Mycobacterium smegmatis by in vitro acid-nitrosative multi-stress

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of Mycobacterium smegmatis in in vitro acid-nitrosative multistress, comparing untreated control cells and bacteria under multi-stress.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MSMEG-K vs. MSMEG-ACID-NO treated. Biological replicates: 3 controls, 3 Acid-NO treated, independently grown and harvested. In controls and Acid-NO treated cells, good quality RNA samples obtained from each pellet were pooled together and used for microarray experiments to get an average of three separate experiments, three replicates per array.
