TITLE
Bone marrow microenvironment: interaction of monocytes and stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two human stromal cell lines, HS-5 and HS-27a, represent functionally distinct components of the bone marrow microenvironment.  A third influential component of the microenvironment is resident monocytes and macrophages. The baseline expression profile of normal peripheral blood monocytes was determined and their effect on the gene expression of the stromal cells was investigated in a co-culture sytem. Control RNA for all samples was Stratagene Universal human reference RNA. Keywords: Cell Line Comparison and Culture Comparison
