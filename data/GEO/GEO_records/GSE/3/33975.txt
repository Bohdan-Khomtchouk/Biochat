TITLE
Gene expression profiling reveals potential breast cancer prevention mechanisms associated with the rat Mcs5a allele (DGE)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using global gene expression profiling in T-cells from untreated Mcs5a resistant and susceptible congenic rats, we asked if signatures of potential risk-decreasing mechanisms could be identified.

DESIGN
On two independent sample sets, we applied microarray (MA) or digital gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing T-cells from Mcs5a resistant and susceptible congenic rats. This file contains the DGE data. T-cell RNA sample pools were compared between the susceptible (susc.; n=3 pools) and the resistant (Mcs5a; n=3 pools) congenic lines
