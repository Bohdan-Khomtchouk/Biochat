TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in xenotransplanted and non tumor bearing CB17 SCID.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cutaneous melanoma first metastasizes into sentinel lymph nodes that control the lymphatic drain from the area of the primary tumor. This observation is used clinically for melanoma patients with primary melanomas thicker than 1mm (tumor stage ≥T2a), for these patients sentinel lymph node biopsy has become an important and routinely performed diagnostic procedure. The importance of sentinel node analysis is reflected by a significant better prognosis of melanoma patients with tumor free sentinel nodes compared to patients with metastatic sentinel nodes. Although intensively studied, not much is known about mechanisms responsible for the development of melanoma metastasis.To analyze gene expression in mouse SLNs of M24met tumor bearing animals as compared to tumor free control animals, SLNs were taken at different time points and analyzed for the presence of human M24met to classify SLNs into control, negative, macro metastatic SLN. After categorized SLNs were subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To analyze gene expression in mouse SLNs of human M24met tumor bearing animals as compared to tumor free control animals, SLNs were taken at different time points and analyzed for the presence of human M24met to classify SLNs into control, negative, macro metastatic SLN. Briefly, explanted SLNs were stored in RNA later (Ambion, Austin, TX) and DNA as well as RNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit and RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. To detect human cells in mouse SLNs we used a polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of a human-specific 850-bp fragment of the alpha-satellite DNA on human chromosome 17. For analysis of gene expression RNA from control SLN from tumor free animals (control), RNA from tumor negative SLN (negative), and RNA from macro metastatic SLN (positive) from tumor bearing animals was used to analyze gene expression on Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
