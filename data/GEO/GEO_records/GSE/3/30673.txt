TITLE
Comparison of Gene expression profiles between myometrium, MED12 mutation positive uterine leiomyomas and MED12 wildtype uterine leiomyomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of 10 uterine leiomyomas and their matched normal myometrium specimens were studied using Affymetrix GeneChip   Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression arrays. Four tumors displayed a codon 44 mutation, four carried a intron 1 mutation, and the remaining two displayed no MED12 mutation.

DESIGN
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed to assess similarity in gene expression profiles between myometrium, MED12 mutation positive uterine leiomyomas and MED12 wildtype uterine leiomyomas. Gene expression data from the MED12 mutation positive leiomyomas was compared to matched myometrium to identify differentially expressed genes.
