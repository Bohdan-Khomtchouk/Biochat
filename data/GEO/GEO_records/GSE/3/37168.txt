TITLE
Expression data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumors in two time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of a large genetic evolution study we also acquired 3'UTR expression arrays at two time points for the same 18 patients with CLL. We have analysed the data to evaluate whether genetic evolution (somatic mutations and Somatic copy number alterations) also manifested at the transcriptome level, either globally, or at the level of pre-defined curated geneset that correspond to specfic evolving genetic lesions.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at two time points along the patients clinical course, with 13 patients having samples before treatment and at relapse, and 5 patients that were long term non progressors had sampling at two time points without intevening therapy.
