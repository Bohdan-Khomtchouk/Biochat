TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs in porcine endometrium

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Affymetrix miRNA arrays were used to generate miRNA profiles of on the endometrium of Meishan and Yorkshire pigs on days 15 (implantation stage), 26 (post-implantation stage) and 50 (mid-gestation stage) of gestation.  The study allowed for the determination of the miRNAs that were differentially expressed in porcine endometrium on different gestational day and breed. The majority of the miRNAs were differentially expressed during the implantation stage. This study will provide the information to better understanding of the role miRNAs in the porcine endometrium during pregnancy.
