TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the oxygen response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118 under wine fermentation conditions

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Oxygen additions play a critical role in winemaking. However, few studies have focused on how this oxygen affects yeast metabolism and physiology in wine making conditions. We performed microarrays to unveil the oxygen response in wine making conditions.
