TITLE
H4IIE liver cell line ChIP-Chip with Egr1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Egr1 regulates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in liver.  ChIP-chip assays were performed on H4IIE liver cells that were either treated or untreated with insulin for one hour. This experiment includes a custom ChIP-chip design incorporating many genes that are dynamically regulated by insulin signaling. The Egr1 antibody used was from Santa Cruz sc-189.

DESIGN
Egr1 ChIP samples from untreated and 1h insulin treated cells were hybridized.
