TITLE
Analysis of H3K9 trimethylation in unstimulated and stimulated dendritic cells and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The distribution of H3K9me3 was analyzed in order to investigate the influence of H3K9me3 levels surrounding candidate enhancers and other cis-regulatory elements.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K9me3 and input DNA controls, from 2 cell types (DCs & fibroblasts) under 2 conditions (unstimulated & stimulated)
