TITLE
Gender specific comparisons of gene expression during Zebrafish pectoral fin regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To identify gender specific differences in gene expression during fin rgeneration, pectoral fins were amputated from both male and female adult fish. Fins were allowed to recover for 4 days in standard tank condtions then tissue was collected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis
