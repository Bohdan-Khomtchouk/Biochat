TITLE
Copy number data from paired primary and relapse ovarian tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used copy number analysis of paired primary and relapse ovarian tumours to identify genes associated with acquired resistance

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from ovarian tumours. Copy number profiles of 22 primary and matched ascites samples. Multiple biopsies of four samples were also profiled to assess the intra tumour heterogeneity in samples.
