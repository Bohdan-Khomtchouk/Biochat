TITLE
Pulmonary miRNA expression in C57BL/6 Bom Tac mice (dams) intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs were measured in pregant mice exposed to vehicle control (nanopure water) or a cumulative dose of 0.268 mg Printex 90 in vehicle by intratracheal instillation and sacrificed at weaning (26-27 days after exposure).

DESIGN
Pregnant mice were exposed to vehicle control (nanopure water) or a cumulative dose of 0.268 mg Printex 90 in vehicle by intratracheal instillation. Doses of 0.067 mg were delivered 4 times in pregnant females on gestational days 7, 10, 15 and 18. Mice were sacrificed at weaning (26-27 days post-exposure).
