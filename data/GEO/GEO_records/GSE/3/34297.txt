TITLE
Expression data from skin of mice treated subcutaneously with TGF-beta, IL-13 or TSLP for 7 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in mice skin stimulated with 3 different cytokines We used microarrays to detail the global programme of specific or common gene expression by 3 cytokines: TGF-beta, IL-13 and TSLP

DESIGN
Mice skin were taken from the outlet of the 7-day pump (subcutaneous) and RNA was extracted.
