TITLE
Genome-wide identification of non-coding RNAs targeted by XRN exoribonucleases in collaboration with FRY1 using RNA-Seq in Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report new insight of non-coding RNA degradation mediated by XRN exoribonucleases and FRY1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We suggest that XRN3, in combination with FRY1, is required to prevent the accumulation of 3â€™ extensions that arise from thousands of mRNA and miRNA precursor transcripts.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide transcriptomes of Arabidopsis genotypes such as fry1-6, xrn3-3, xrn2-1xrn3-3, xrn2-1xrn4-6 and xrn3-3xrn4-6 using directional RNA-Seq method.
