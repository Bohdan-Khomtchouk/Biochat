TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Zymomonas mobilis under furfural stress

ORGANISM
Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 = ATCC 31821

SUMMARY
Investigation of the expression profiling of the ethanologenic Zymomonas mobilis in response to furfural stress.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Zymomonas mobilis ATCC31821 and three separate cultures of a triple treated with 1.0 g/l furfural. Each chip measures the expression level of 1800 genes from Zymomonas mobilis ATCC31821 and the associated plasmids, with three-fold technical redundancy.
