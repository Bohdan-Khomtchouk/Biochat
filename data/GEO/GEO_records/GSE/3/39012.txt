TITLE
Expression data from L3 stage Caernorhabditis elegans after arsenic exposure

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to explore the global affect on gene expression in C. elegans after exposure to arsenic

DESIGN
L3 stage N2 worms were incubated for 6 hrs in sodium arsenite containing media of concentrations .003 and .03. Three independent extractions of RNA were performed from no exposure, .003 exposure, and .03 exposure worms.
