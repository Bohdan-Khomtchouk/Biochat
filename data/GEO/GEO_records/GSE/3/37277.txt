TITLE
Differentiating factors of cumulus cells related to quality of the human oocyte

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single embryo transfer (SET) is the most successful way to reduce the frequency of multiple pregnancies during in vitro fertilisation. However, selecting the embryo with the highest chances of pregnancy for SET remains a difficult challenge, since morphological and kinetics criteria provide poor prediction of both developmental and implantation ability. Partly through the expression of specific genes, the oocyte-cumulus interaction helps the oocyte to acquire its developmental competence. Our aim was therefore to identify at the level of cumulus cells (CCs) any genes related to oocyte developmental competence. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
