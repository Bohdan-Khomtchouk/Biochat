TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify new markers of vascular cell senescence with potential in vivo implications, primary cultured  Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs),  were analysed for microRNA (miR) expression.

DESIGN
QRT-PCR microRNA expression profiling in 3 senescent (XIII passage) vs. 3 young HUVECs (II passage).
