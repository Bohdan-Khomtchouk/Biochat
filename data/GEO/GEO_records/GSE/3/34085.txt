TITLE
Karyotype analysis of radicicol-resistant yeast colonies by array CGH (Radr1,2,3)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Aneuploidy, a state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes, is a form of large-effect mutation able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions. Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stresses could in turn induce aneuploidy in budding yeast.  Cells exposed to radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor, exhibit chromosomal instability. To assess the karyotype of cells with an acquired resistance to radicicol, array CGH was used to compare three stably resistant yeast colonies to a WT strain.

DESIGN
Single replicates of DNA prepared from radicicol-resistant yeast colonies are compared to a control WT colony.
