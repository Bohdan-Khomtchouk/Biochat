TITLE
Gene expression in pluripotent and TSKM-iPS induction cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that Tet1 (T) can substitute Oct4 and initiates somatic cell reprogramming in combination with Sox2 (S), Klf4 (K) and c-Myc (M). Moreover, the TSKM secondary reprogramming can proceed rapidly with widespread accompanying increase of 5hmC and 5mC at TSS and ES-active regulation regions followed by 5mC-5hmC pattern switchand, and the activation of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog was Tet1 and 5hmC involved in this process. We used microarray to explore the global expression change during the reprogramming process

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression change in 3 different cell lines covering the main stages during the reprogramming process
