TITLE
Oral Samples (HOMIM-v.02); A Characterization of the Oral Microbiome in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Patients

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of allogeneic stem cell transplant on oral microbiota and to examine differences in those patients who acquired respiratory complications. Forty-five patients were consented for the study and followed for 100 days post-transplant. Eleven patients represented by 115 speciment had specimens collected before and after transplant were subjected to further analysis. The Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray was used for this analysis. In these 11 patients, five developed respiraotry complications after transplant and six did not develop this complication. Cluster analysis was used to identify patterns in the data.
