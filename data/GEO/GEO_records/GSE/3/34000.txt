TITLE
Expression data from the dorsal root ganglia during streptozotocin-induced painful diabetic neuropathy in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
FK1706 potentiated nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, putatively mediated via FKBP-52 and the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway. It also improved mechanical allodynia accompanied by the recovery of intraepidermal nerve fiber density in a painful diabetic neuropathy in rats. We analyzed gene expression of the dorsal root ganglia together with measurement of mechanical allodynia in diabetic rats to try to capture the global fingerprint of changes in gene expression associated with FK1706 administration and also to elucidate the putative mechanisms of its neurotrophic activity in vivo.

DESIGN
Normal, STZ-treated controls, and STZ + FK1706 groups were used to evaluate gene expression analysis. Dorsal root ganglia from L4 to L6 were collected at the day after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of FK1706 administration, were immediately immersed in RNAlater reagent, and stored as instructed before RNA extraction. Equal amounts of total RNA from five rats were collected for each group.
