TITLE
Differences in gene expression patterns in mouse embryonic fibroblast Flp-In-3T3 cell lines stably expressing Pax6 or Pax6(5a).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Novel target genes for the two transcription factor isoforms Pax6 and Pax6(5a) were identified by generating mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines stably expressing either Pax6 or Pax6(5a), and comparing their gene expression pattern with the original mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line.
