TITLE
Intratumor heterogeneity of gene expression profiles in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of NSCLC tissues let to the establishment of several prognostic, predictive gene signatures with little overlap. To study factors introducing variability into gene expression microarray studies we compared interpatient (patient-to-patient) and intrapatient (tumor sub-sample) variations in gene expression profiles in stage I and II NSCLC tissues. We identified 128 probe sets which showed variable intratumoral expression
