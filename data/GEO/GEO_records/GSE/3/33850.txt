TITLE
Core transcriptional regulatory circuit controlled by the tal1 complex in human t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Subseries)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL is aberrantly overexpressed in over 40% of cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), emphasizing the importance of the TAL1-regulated transcriptional program in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. Here we identify the core transcriptional regulatory circuit controlled by TAL1 and its regulatory partners HEB, E2A, GATA3, ETS1 and RUNX1 in T-ALL cells. We find that TAL1 forms an interconnected auto-regulatory loop with its partners, which contributes to the sustained upregulation of its direct target genes. Importantly, we also find the MYB oncogenic transcription factor is directly activated by the TAL1 complex and positively regulates many of the same target genes, thus forming a feed-forward positive regulatory loop that further promotes the TAL1-regulated oncogenic program.

DESIGN
Human T-ALL cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total TAL1 (Santa Cruz SC-12984), TCF12/HEB (Santa Cruz SC-357),TCF3/E2A (Santa Cruz SC-349X), LMO1 (Santa Cruz SC-10494), LMO2 (R & D Systems AF2726),  GATA3 (Santa Cruz SC-22206) and RUNX1 (Santa Cruz SC-8563). This represents the ChIP-seq portion of this dataset. Human Jurkat cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min.
