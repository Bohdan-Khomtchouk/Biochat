TITLE
Determination of transcript abundance before and after serum induction in human HCT-116 colon cancer cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation of developmentally controlled genes is at the heart of differentiation and organogenesis. In this study, we have performed mRNA transcript abdundance analyses in human cells in response to serum activation signal by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
mRNA transcript abundance determined before and after serum activation signals using two biological replicates.
