TITLE
Nucleosome maps in skeletal muscle in response to diet in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The nucleosome signature reflects the cellular epigenetic memory and contributes to the cellular phenotype and function. Obesity and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis is largely dependent on environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications and is marked by skeletal muscle insulin resistance; however, no in vivo skeletal muscle nucleosome maps exist to date. Herein, whole genome nucleosome maps via MNase-seq in skeletal muscle of mice on a low fat, high fat or high fat diet with the chromatin modifier sodium butyrate show that complex interactions among mitochondrial function, the tissue microenvironment, cellular phenotype and nucleosome landscape determine whole body phenotype and insulin resistance.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle samples (n=5 per group) were pooled after homogenization under liquid nitrogen with a motar and pestle to give one sample per group for MNase-seq
