TITLE
Chip-chip from WT and Polycomb Component Knock Out Mouse ES cells for H2AZ, H3K27me3, EZH2 and Ring1B.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The essential histone variant H2A.Z localises to both active and silent chromatin sites. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), H2A.Z is also reported to co-localise with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at developmentally silenced genes. The mechanism of H2A.Z targeting is not clear, but a role for the PRC2 component Suz12 has been suggested. Given this association, we wished to determine if polycomb functionally directs H2A.Z incorporation in ESCs. We demonstrate that the PRC1 component Ring1B interacts with multiple complexes in ESCs. Moreover, we show that although the genomic distribution of H2A.Z co-localises with PRC2, Ring1B and with the presence of CpG islands, H2A.Z still blankets polycomb target loci in the absence of Suz12, Eed (PRC2) or Ring1B (PRC1). Therefore we conclude that H2A.Z accumulates at developmentally silenced genes in ESCs in a polycomb independent manner.

DESIGN
Array design includes 2 biological replicates for all samples and technical replication (dye swaps for H3K27me3_WT_ES, EZH2_WT_ES, EZH2_RING1b_KO_ES, H2AZ_WT_ES(2), H2AZ_Eed_KO_ES and H2AZ_Suz12_KO_ES). Ring1B_WT_ES is represented by a single replicate.
