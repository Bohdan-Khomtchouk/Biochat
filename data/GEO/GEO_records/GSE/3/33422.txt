TITLE
Epigenome analysis of endometrium tissue from women with metastatic endometrial cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in endometrium tissues from women with metastatic endometrial cancer. Endometrium tissue samples were drawn from 18 metastatic endometrial cancers. The metastatic endometrial cancer tissue samples were from women (mean age 67.1) who were diagnosed with metastatic endometrial cancer.
