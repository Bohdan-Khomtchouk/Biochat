TITLE
Gene Expression profile of Sox9 sorted cells from Vertebral column of E12.5 wildtype (WT) and Homozygous (HOMO) mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to look at gene expresion profiles between wildtype and Sox9 knockout cells of the vertebral column in a E12.5 mouse embryo. Instead of looking at the whole vertebral column, only cells expressing Sox9 were sorted by Fluroscent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and subjected to expression profiling by microarray.

DESIGN
EGFP was knocked into the Sox9 locus by homologous recombination in mESC followed by generation of chimaeric and stable mice line. Heterozygous embryos expressing EGFP was was used to dissected out the vertebral column and Fluroscent activated cell sorting was used to sort out cell expressing Sox9 as marked by EGFP. For Homozygous geneotype chimaeric embryos were used as Sox9 homozygotes die at E11.5. Total RNA was extracted and hybidized to an Illumina WG6 v1.1 mouse array.
