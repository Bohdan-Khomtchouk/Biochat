TITLE
Gene expression analysis of bovine oocytes with high developmental competence obtained from FSH-stimulated animals

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to analyze the impact of various lenght FSH withdrawal period (coasting) after the last FSH injection on transcriptome changes in in vivo bovine oocytes at the GV stage. Oocytes were collected from super-stimulated animals after 20, 44, 68 and 92 hours of coasting.

DESIGN
For each cow individually (biological replicate), each coasting time was compared to others (i.e. 20 hrs vs 44 hrs; 20 hrs vs 68 hrs; 20 hrs vs 92 hrs; 44 hrs vs 68 hrs; 44 hrs vs 92 hrs and 68 hrs vs 92 hrs) for a total of six comparisons. Overall, 36 hybridizations, corresponding to the three cows and six comparisons were done using a dye-swap set-up.
