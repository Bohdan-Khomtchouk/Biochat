TITLE
Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004: wild type vs. ravA (or ravS or ravR) mutant

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 comparing control wild type strain with ravA  (or ravS or ravR) mutant The effects of mutating ravS, ravR and ravA on EPS synthesis, biofilm production and motility were very different , the factors responsible for these differences are not clear. With comparative analysis of the regualtion pathways by RavS, RavR and RavA, we can indentify different genes regulated by these three genes and maybe explain the different phenotypes caused by these genes mutations.

DESIGN
Comparative analysis of the regualtion pathways by RavS, RavR and RavA Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. mutants. Biological replicates were independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array
