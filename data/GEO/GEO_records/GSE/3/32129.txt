TITLE
Targeted ErbB3 loss in mammary organoids harvested from ErbB3 DOX-KO mice +/- DOX treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary organoids harvested from ErbB3 DOX-KO mice, which utilize MMTV-Cre transgene expression in the LE to cause genomic recombination at floxed ErbB3 alleles in ErbB3FL/FL were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline to induce ErbB3 loss.  The gene expression shift following DOX-induced ErbB3 loss in the 3D organoids was examined by microarray.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns were interrogated in mammary organoids from ErbB3 inducible-knockout mice cultured in the presence of absence of doxycycline.  Three biological replicates of the experiment were performed, resulting in a total of 6 samples (3 treatment, 3 control).
