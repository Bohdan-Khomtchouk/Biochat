TITLE
Gene expression profiles in 74 laser microdissected colorectal cancer tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissues from another series of 74 patients with colorectal cancer were collected by laser micro-dissection with the Leica Laser Microdissection System (Leica Microsystems).

DESIGN
Gene expression levels obtained from 74 microdissected colorectal tumors were compared with 5 microdissected normal colon epitheliums. We used the commercially available Human Whole Genome Oligo DNA Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies). Labeled cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray (Whole Human Genome 4Ã—44K Agilent G4112F). Fluorescence intensities were determined with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner and were analyzed using G2567AA Feature Extraction Software Version A.7.5.1 (Agilent Technologies).
