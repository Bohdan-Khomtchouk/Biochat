SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Richard Sandstrom ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project. This track shows genome-wide assessment of DNA replication timing in cell lines using the sequencing-based " Repli-seq " methodology (see below). Replication timing is known to be an important feature for epigenetic control of gene expression that usually operates at a higher-order level than at the level of specific genes. For each experiment (cell line, replicate), replication timing was ascertained by the isolation and sequencing of newly replicated DNA from six cell cycle fractions: G1/G1b, S1, S2, S3, S4, G2 (six fraction profile). Replication patterns are visualized as a continuous function based on sequencing tag density (Percentage-normalized Signal) and as a wavelet-smoothed transform of the six fraction profile (Wavelet-smoothed Signal). Replication peaks corresponding to replication initiation zones (Peaks) and valleys corresponding to replication termination zones (Valleys) were determined from local maxima and minima, respectively, in the wavelet-smoothed signal data. A measure of relative copy number at each genomic location (Summed Densities) was determined by summing the normalized tag density values of each cell cycle fraction at that location (equals one replicated genome equivalent).
