TITLE
Gene expression Microarray analysis for HEK293 WT and ELL KD with control and 1hr EGF stimulated conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription is a multi-stage process that coordinates several steps within the transcription cycle including chromatin reorganization, RNA polymerase II recruitment, initiation, promoter clearance and elongation.  Recent advances have identified the super elongation complex (SEC), containing the eleven nineteen lysine rich leukemia protein (ELL), as a key regulator of transcriptional elongation.  We show here that ELL plays a diverse and kinetically distinct role prior to its assembly into the SEC by stabilizing Pol II recruitment/initiation and entry into the pause site.  Loss of ELL destabilizes the PIC complexes and results in disruption of early elongation and promoter proximal chromatin structure prior to recruitment of AFF4 and other SEC components. These changes result in significantly reduced transcriptional activation of rapidly induced genes.  Thus, ELL plays an early and essential role during rapid high amplitude gene expression that is required for both Pol II pause site entry and release.

DESIGN
Total RNA for unstimulated and for simulated with EGF (50 ng/mL) for 1hr from wild type and stably induced ELL KD in HEK293 cells were isolated and purified and submitted to LMT-Affymetrix microarray facility to obtain the raw data. Affymetrix Human Exon ST1.0 platform was used for the microarray analysis. Raw data in CEL files were preprocessed using Affymetrix Expression Console software.
