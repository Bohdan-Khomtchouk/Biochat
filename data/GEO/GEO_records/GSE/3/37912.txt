TITLE
Peripheral blood gene expression as a novel genomic biomarker in complicated sarcoidosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous syndrome invariably affecting the lung, typically spontaneously remits but in ~20% of cases progresses with severe lung dysfunction or cardiac and neurologic involvement (complicated sarcoidosis). Unfortunately, current biomarkers fail to distinguish patients with remitting (uncomplicated) sarcoidosis from other fibrotic lung disorders, and fail to identify individuals at risk for complicated sarcoidosis. We utilized genome-wide peripheral blood gene expression analysis to identify a gene signature distinguishing sarcoidosis from healthy controls, which also served as a molecular signature for complicated sarcoidosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using standard molecular biology protocols without DNA contamination or RNA degradation. Sample processing (e.g., cDNA generation, fragmentation, end labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays) was performed per manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A total of 29 African descent American (AA) and 10 European descent American (EA) patients with sarcoidosis were included in the overall sarcoidosis cohort with 18 AA and 4 EA patients diagnosed with complicated sarcoidosis.
