TITLE
Gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from 95 unrelated CEPH-Utah individuals treated with 10Gy of ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine gene expression levels from 95 unrelated CEPH-Utah individuals 0, 2 or 6 hours after treatment with 10Gy of ionizing radiation.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from 95 unrelated CEPH-Utah individuals.  Each individual was treated with 10Gy of ionizing radiation and expression was measured 0, 2 and 6 hour after treatment.
