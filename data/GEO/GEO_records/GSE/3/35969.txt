TITLE
miRNA profiling array and analysis in mouse hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We addressed the potential for global regulation of miRNA biogenesis by BDNF using miRNA arrays that selectively measure mature miRNA, as opposed to pre-miRNA.  Hippocampal neurons were treated with BDNF for 30 min in the presence of Actinomycin-D to assess changes due to processing of existing pre-miRNAs rather than new pre-miRNA production.  We used Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system using Taqman Rodent MicroRNA Array A.  Data is from three paired BDNF and Mock experiments (1,2,3).

DESIGN
Each array (TaqMan) contained 375 rodent miRNA targets of which 195 were detectable in hippocampus in three independent paired experiments.
