TITLE
The transcriptional profiles of bluestem and Indian grass - Konza 2006 [Zea mays; Andropogon gerardii; Sorghastrum nutans]

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We measured transcriptional profiles of individuals of Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, two C4 grass species native to North American grasslands, in a field experiment in which both temperature and precipitation have been manipulated to simulate key aspects of forecasted climate change.
