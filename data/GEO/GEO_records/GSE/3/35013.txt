TITLE
Gene profiling on mandibular arches (MdPA1) from Tbx1+/+ and Tbx1-/- mouse embryos E9.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome/22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) patients have a submucous cleft palate, velo-pharyngeal insufficiency associated with hypernasal speech, facial muscle hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Inactivation of both alleles of mouse Tbx1, encoding a T-box transcription factor, deleted on 22q11.2, results in a cleft palate and a reduction or loss of branchiomeric muscles. To identify genes downstream of Tbx1 for myogenesis, gene profiling was performed on mandibular arches (MdPA1) from Tbx1+/+ and Tbx1-/- mouse embryos.

DESIGN
To obtain enough RNA for microarray hybridization experiments, dissected mandibular arches from three Tbx1+/+ and three Tbx1-/- E9.5 embryos were pooled according to genotype, with three microarrays performed in total per genotype.  Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 arrays (Affymetrix) were used. Hybridization, washing, staining and scanning were performed in the Genomics Core at Einstein ( ) according to the Affymetrix manual.
