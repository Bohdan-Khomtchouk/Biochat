TITLE
LRH-1 and PTF1-L coregulate an exocrine pancreas-specific transcriptional network for digestive function [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined the cistrome and transcriptome for the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in the exocrine pancreas.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that LRH-1 directly induces expression of genes encoding digestive enzymes and secretory and mitochrondrial proteins.  LRH-1 cooperates with the pancreas transcription factor 1-L complex (PTF1-L) in regulationg exocrine pancreas-specific gene expression.  Elimination of LRH-1  in adult mice reduced the concentration of several lipases and proteases in pancreatic fluid and impaired pancreatic fluid secretion in response to cholecystokinin.  Thus, LRH-1 is a key regulator of the exocrine pancreas-specific transcriptional network required for the production and secretion of pancreatic fluid.
