TITLE
DCL4 Functional Analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Rosette leaves (5-8) and inflorescence stages (1-12) from dcl1-7, rdr6-15, and dcl4-2 mutants, involved in Arabidopsis small RNA metabolism. Three biological replicates of each mutant comprising at least 9 independent plants were harvested, and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.  Comparisons among the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by small RNAs (microRNAs and trans-acting siRNAs). Keywords: other
