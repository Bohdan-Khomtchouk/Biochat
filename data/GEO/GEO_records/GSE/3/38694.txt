TITLE
Light exposure of wild-type and kdmA deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wild-type and kdmA deletion mutant in response to white light exposure, against a wild-type dark-incubated reference

DESIGN
Two strains, two conditions. Two biological replicates were hybridised (as dye swaps) for each sample, with the exception of a single sample for the kdmA mutant in the dark (incidental to the main results of the study).
