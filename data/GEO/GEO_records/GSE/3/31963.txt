ADAR1 regulates melanoma progression via miRNAs biogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant RNA-editing was observed in several human tumors, but its significance is mostly unknown. Here we show that ADAR1, a ubiquitous RNA-editing enzyme, is commonly lost in metastatic melanoma cells and specimens. Experimental ADAR1 silencing significantly alters melanoma cell morphology, facilitates proliferation and cell-cycle, and increases the tumorigenicity in-vivo. A series of ADAR1 truncation mutants establishes a novel RNA-editing-independent role for ADAR1 in controlling the nuclear and cytoplasmic processing steps of miRNA biogenesis. Altered expression of ADAR1-controled miRNAs accounts for the observed phenotype. We show that the oncogenic miR-17-5p endogenously regulates ADAR1 expression and that its genomic sequence is frequently amplified in melanoma to overexpress the mature miR-17-5p form. ADAR1 and miR-17-5p are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting the generality of this mechanism.
