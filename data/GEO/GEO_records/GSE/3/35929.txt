TITLE
Digital Gene Expression Analysis Based on Integrated De Novo Transcriptome Assembly of Sweet Potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.]

ORGANISM
Ipomoea batatas

SUMMARY
More than 3.5 million raw DGE tags were obtained in each library. The clean tags in each sample ranged from 3.35 to 3.63 million, and the distinct clean tags ranged from 93,593 to 139,389. The 21 bp DGE clean tags were mapped to sweet potato transcripts. Then, we compared 7 libraries pair-wisely so that 21 pairs of comparisons were implemented. Among these comparisons, we found that 4,721 to 12,151 transcripts had significant changes in expression, and the average number was 9,657. We also observed a large number of specifically expressed transcripts between each two libraries. The expression profiles of those genes involved in root development and carbohydrates accumulation were characterized. Moreover, other genes of interest, such as potentially abiotic stress tolerance and insect resistance, were also characterized.

DESIGN
7 samples are examined: young leaves, mature leaves, stems, fibrous roots, initial tuberous roots, expanding tuberous roots and harvest tuberous roots.
