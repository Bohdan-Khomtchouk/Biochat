TITLE
comparison_cul4_as_light-Functional analysis of the SKP2 and CUL4 proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-04_skp2_cul4 - comparison_cul4_as_light - Antisense and mutants of the SKP2 and CUL4 genes are compared to the Wt in order to identify the genes controlled by those SCF proteins. - The seeds have been sown every two days on MS 255 (Duschefa) without 1% sugar. These plates stayed 6 days in the dark at 4 Â°C. Then they were transfered to the light for 6 more days.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - gene knock out, normal vs antisense mutant comparison
