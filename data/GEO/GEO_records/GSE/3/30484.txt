TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression changes upon Cabut or dE2F1/dDP overexpression in the Drosophila wing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in dissected Drosophila wings at the wandering L3 larval stage, 24h after pupa formation and 36h after pupa formation, expressing either UAS-Cabut or UAS-dE2F1 + UAS-dDP under control of apterous-gal4 with a tubulin driven temperature-sensitive gal80 transgene, compared to the parental strain lacking UAS transgenes.

DESIGN
A 36-chip study using total RNA recovered from four independently isolated samples of 10 dissected Drosophila wings at the indicated developmental stages expressing the indicated UAS-transgenes or the non-UAS-containing matched control strain. One sample (2D) did not pass our internal quality control and, therefore, was not included in the analysis. The dE2F1+dDP data included here is further discussed in L. Buttitta, A.J. Katzaroff, B.A. Edgar (2010). A robust cell cycle control mechanism limits E2F-induced proliferation of terminally differentiated cells in vivo. Journal of Cell Biology vol. 189, 981-96 (PMID 20548101). The Cabut data included here is further discussed in A.J. Katzaroff et al. (2011). The Kr√ºppel-like-factor cabut has cell cycle regulatory properties similar to E2F.
