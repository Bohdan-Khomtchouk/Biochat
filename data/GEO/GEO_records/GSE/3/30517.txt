TITLE
Identification differentially expressed genes upon valproic acid treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to define genes that are differentially expressed in Down syndrome leukemic blasts after treatment with valproic acid (VPA) Here we report the identification gene sets that are downregulated in Down syndrome leukemic cell lines after exposure to valproic acid (VPA)

DESIGN
CMK and CMY cells were treated with VPA for 24h and 48h with 1mM or 2mM VPA. Their gene expression profile was compared against the untreated control.
