TITLE
Role of Smad7 in Hematopoietic (M-O7e) and Non-Hematopoietic (PG13) Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad7 is a member of the TGF-B superfamily that plays a signigicant role in fate determination of hematopoietic stem cells. This experiment compares expression between megakaryotic and fibroblast cell lines that have been transduced with either Smad7 recombinant retroviral vector or retroviral vector alone.
