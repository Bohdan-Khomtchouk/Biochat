TITLE
Human colon cancer HT-29 and LS174T cells: stably transfected with shRNA-Ascl2/EGFP vs. stably transfected with shRNA-Control/EGFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, controls the fate of intestinal stem cells. However, the role of Ascl2 in colon cancer progenitor cells remains unknown. The cell lines HT-29 (47.5-95% of CD133+ population) and LS174T (0.45% of CD133+ population) were chosen for functional evaluation of Ascl2 in colon cancer progenitor cells after gene knockdown by RNA interference.  The microRNA (miRNA) microarrays identified 26 two-fold up-regulated miRNAs and 58 two-fold down-regulated miRNAs in shRNA-Ascl2/HT-29 cells and 178 two-fold up-regulated miRNAs and 172 two-fold down-regulated miRNAs in shRNA-Ascl2/LS174T cells.
