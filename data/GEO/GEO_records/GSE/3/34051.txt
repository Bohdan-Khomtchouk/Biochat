TITLE
Expression profiling of the early postnatal stage of Polycystic Kidney Disease in the B6C3Fe a/a-bpck mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease , we performed a microarray gene expression profiling in early stage kidneys  of B6C3Fe a/a-bpck mutant and wild-type mice at postnatal day 3. Genes with over 1.5-fold expression changes in mutant kidneys compared with age matched wild-type tissues were selected for analysis. This study represents the first widespread profiling of B6C3Fe a/a-bpck mutant mouse kidney and provides a valuable platform for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of polycystic kidney disease in human.

DESIGN
Mutational analysis was performed in accordance with the protocol of Jackson Laboratory, total RNA was extracted from kidneys of 3 days of postnatal age using a monophasic solution of phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to their manual, and the samples were incubated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion). The quality and concentration of each sample were confirmed by spectrophotometry.  Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays were used according to standard Affymetrix procedures. Data analysis was performed with dChip software (Dec.2010 version). These measurements were confirmed by Real-Time PCR.
