TITLE
Transcriptional profile in macrolide susceptible and resistant Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni is a major zoonotic pathogen transmitted to humans via the food chain. C. jejuni is prevalent in chickens, a natural reservoir for this pathogenic organism. Due to the importance of macrolide antibiotics in clinical therapy of human campylobacteriosis, development of macrolide resistance in Campylobacter has become a concern for public health.To facilitate understanding the molecular basis associated with the fitness difference between Erys and Eryr Campylobacter, we compared the transcriptomes between ATCC 700819 and its isogenic Eryr transformant T.L.101 using DNA microarray.

DESIGN
The design utilized an available two color microarray slide for the entire transcriptome of Campylobacter jejuni. Four hybridizations were performed each with independently extracted samples of either macrolide susceptible ATCC 700819 cDNA samples or its isogenic Eryr transformant T.L.101 cDNA samples. A dye swap was utilized to help minimize dye dependent bias. Thus, there were four biological replicates of each sample.
