TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of ROP10 GTPase-mediated abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study, we have identified genes that are respectively activated and repressed by the low concentration of ABA and show that ROP10 gates a specific subset of genes that are responsive only to a low ABA concentration. Keywords: Whole seedlings of wild-type (Ws) and the mutant (rop10-1) treated with or without ABA
