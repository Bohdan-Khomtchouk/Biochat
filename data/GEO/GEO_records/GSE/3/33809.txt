TITLE
Inhibition of Jak2 in SET2 cell line with INC424 (two time points and 3 dose levels in triplicate)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
SET2 cells were incubated with increasing concentration of INC424/Ruxolitinib for 3-6 h and RNA was purified. Affymetrix Genechip miRNA array 2.0 was used to identify miRNA species showing a differential expression in treated cells compared with control cells.
