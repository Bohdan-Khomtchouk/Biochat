TITLE
HSC-3 cells (control) vs. HSC-3-5 cells [cell line]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HSC-3-5 cells were derived from human HSC-3 cells via transwell invasion assay. Transcriptional profiling of human HSC-3 cells comparing with high invasive HSC-3-5 cells.  Goal was to determine the effects of invasion on global HSC-3-5 gene expression during tumor metastasis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, HSC-3 vs. HSC-3-5 cells.
