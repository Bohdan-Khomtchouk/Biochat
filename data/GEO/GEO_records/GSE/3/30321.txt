TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Chinese Hamster Ovary production cell lines

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
The dataset set consists of 295 microarrays from 121 individual CHO cultures producing a range of biologics including monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins and therapeutic factors; non-producing cell lines were also included. Samples were taken from a wide range of process scales and formats that varied in terms of seeding density, temperature, medium, feed medium, culture duration and product type. Cells were sampled for gene expression analysis at various stages of the culture and bioprocess-relevant characteristics including cell density, growth rate, viability, lactate, ammonium and cell specific productivity (Qp) were determined

DESIGN
A total of 295 microarray samples were assayed. In addition 9 continous bioprocess variables were also measured.
