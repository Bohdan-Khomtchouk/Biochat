TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia cepacia IST408 bceE and bceF mutants

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315

SUMMARY
The bacterial tyrosine (BY) kinase family comprises the major group of bacterial enzymes endowed with tyrosine kinase activity. We have previously shown that the BceF protein from Burkholderia cepacia IST408 belongs to this BY kinase family and is involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide cepacian. However, little is known about the extent of regulation in the cell by this kinase protein. In order to examine this, we performed a comparative transcriptome profile between the bceF mutant and the wild-type B. cepacia IST408. As a control, the transcriptome of another exopolysaccharide-deficient mutant, which had a mutation in the bceE gene, was also determined.
