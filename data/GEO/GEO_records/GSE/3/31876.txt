TITLE
The differentially expressed genes in SRSF3 siRNA-treated HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several members of SRSF family play wide-ranging roles in the regulation of transcription and post-splicing processes as well as splice sites selection. Although the expression of SRSF3 was reported to be overexpressed in several cancers, the roles of SRSF3 in the cancer cells are almost unknown. We analyzed differentially expressed genes in SRSF3 siRNA-treated HCT116 cells and identified the specific pathways regulated by SRSF3.

DESIGN
After treatment of HCT116 cells with SRSF3 (sample 02) or control (sample 01) siRNA, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality of the purified RNA and its applicability for microarray analysis were assessed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a RNA 6000 Nano Labchip kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA (400 ng) was used for amplification, labeling and hybridization to a whole human genome oligoDNA microarray (4x44k; Agilent) according to the manufactureâ€™s instructions.
