TITLE
Expression data from bacterial co-infection study in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes (NTS) cause a self-limited gastroenteritis while pediatric patients with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria can develop a life threatening bacteremia that is a major source of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. We used microarrays to detail genome-scale gene expression profiles underlying gastrointestinal immune responses to bacterial infection in mice

DESIGN
Responses were measured in mouse cecal mucosa to infection of non-typhodal Salmonella and Plasmodium yoelii, both singularly and in combination.
