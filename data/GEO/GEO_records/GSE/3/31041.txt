TITLE
Joint analysis of microRNome and 3'-UTRome in the endometrium of rhesus monkey

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Here we used rhesus monkey as an animal model and compared the endometrial miRNA expression profiles during early-secretory (day 15, pre-receptive) phase and mid-secretory (day 21, receptive) phase by deep sequencing. In order to facilitate the prediction of their target genes, the 3'-UTRome was also determined using tag sequencing of mRNA 3'-termini.

DESIGN
Defining the microRNome and the 3'-UTRome in the endometrium of rhesus monkey.
