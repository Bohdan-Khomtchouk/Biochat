TITLE
Gene expression profiling of acute drought response in leaf and root of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this research, an array of 27,448 rice genes was used to elucidate gene expression in air-dried rice seedlings (lead and root) at various periods of treatment times. The analyses show that rice responds to drought stress mainly by down-regulating many biological processes including gene expression and regulation, protein phosphorylation, and cellular metabolism. Among strategies to actively adapt to drought, most significant are inducing protective molecules, which may be differentially regulated based on plant organs.
