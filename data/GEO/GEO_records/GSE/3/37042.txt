TITLE
Antisense Cryptic transcription in histone H3 K36A, K56R and K36AK56R mutant yeast strain compared to wild-type

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray experiments to determine the existence of intragenic (cryptic) transcripts in K36A, K56R and K36AK56R mutant yeast strain compared to wildtype.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. Mutant/WT. Biological replicates=3. Hybridisation of same samples to strand-specific gene expression arrays.
