TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of EST-induced MYB112 (MYB112-IOE) using Affymetrix ATH1 array

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome patterns were determined in MYB112-IOE seedlings induced for 3 h and 5 h with b-estradiol in order to identify the genes early regulated by MYB112 transcription factor. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in EST-inducible MYB112 over-expression line #1, 3 h and 5 h after 10µM EST induction, compared to mock treated plants. Two independent biological replications were performed for 5 h timepoint and one replicate for 3 h timepoint.

DESIGN
In order to identify potential direct/early target genes of MYB112 transcription factor, estradiol inducible overexpression system was used. Two week old Arabidopsis MYB112-IOE (line 1) were treated with ß-estradiol (10µM) for 3 h and 5 h. Control plants were treated with DMSO. RNA was isolated from shoot and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiment was performed in two biological replications for the 5 h timepoint and one biological replicate for the 3 h timepoint. Genes differentially expressed between estradiol treated MYB112-IOE and DMSO treated MYB112-IOE were identified as potential early targets of MYB112.
