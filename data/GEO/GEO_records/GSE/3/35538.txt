TITLE
Identification of the Bacteroides fragilis EcfO regulon 3

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis 638R

SUMMARY
Genome expression study of Bacteroides fragilis strain 638R comparing a EcfO/anti-EcfO null mutant with an empty vector to a EcfO/anti-EcfO null mutant containing the EcfO gene on a plasmid under the control of a maltose inducible promoter.

DESIGN
Two chip study with 8 technical replicates on each chip comparing the EcfO overexpressing strain in a EcfO/anti-EcfO mutant to an empty vector control in the same mutant background.
