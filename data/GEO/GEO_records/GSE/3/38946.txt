TITLE
Array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization of Melanoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study explored the role of targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2), located with 20q11.2, in melanoma pathogenesis, based on initial findings that it was commonly gained and overexpressed. TPX2 copy number was evaluated in melanoma cell lines compared to control DNA.

DESIGN
Thrity-three cell lines were analyzed by Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 2x400K. Samples were compared to Human Female DNA from Promega.
