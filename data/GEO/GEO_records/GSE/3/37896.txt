TITLE
Expression data from iPSCs generated with Yamanaka factors and miR-302 cluster

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Baseline gene expression of adipose stem cell derived iPSCs generated by lentiviral Yamanaka 4 factors. We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression of hACS derived iPSCs with KMOS and KMOS+miR-302.

DESIGN
Compare the global gene expression of iPSCs with hESCs and adipose stem cells.
