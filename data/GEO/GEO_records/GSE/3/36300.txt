TITLE
Effect of AP2IX-9 overexpression on CTG transcriptome upon alkaline treatment

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Overexpression of DDHA-AP2IX-9 under a tubulin promoter in type III CTG strain. Differential expression analysis under addition of shield-1 and comparison to the non-bradyzoite induced parental culture revealed a global downregulation of the bradyzoite gene expression program including canonical markers like BAG1.

DESIGN
11 samples total. Each conditions in duplicates except wildtype CTG under tachyzoite condition in triplicates.
