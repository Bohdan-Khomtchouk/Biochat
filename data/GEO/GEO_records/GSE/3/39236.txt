TITLE
The rsa1-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana with or without salt stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Salt stress is one of the most severe environmental conditions which cause huge losses in crop production worldwide. We identified a novel calcium-binding protein and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to define downstream targets of this important protein. We used the microarrays to reveal the effect of rsa1-1 mutation on global gene expression in response to 120 mM Nacl for 0 or 24 h. A set of genes differentially expressed in rsa1-1 with or without salt stress are identified.

DESIGN
Six-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing RD29A::LUC transgene) and rsa1-1 mutant seedlings subjected to salt stress with 120 mM NaCl for 0, or 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are three biological replicate per genotype.
