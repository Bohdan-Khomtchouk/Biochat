TITLE
WTAP-induced change in gene expresssion in cholangiocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knock-down or overexpression of WTAP regulated migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vivo and vitro studies. To investigate the underlying mechanism for WTAP-regulated migration and invasion, the gene expression between the mock cells and the stable cells was compared

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from the mock cells and the stable cells overexpressing WTAP
