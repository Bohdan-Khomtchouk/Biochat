TITLE
Structural and functional characterization of a winter malting barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparison of the winter malting barley '88Ab536' with the spring malting variety 'Morex' at two time points of the malting process: 'out of steeping' and '3 days of germination'. Three replicates of each genotype and time point were accomplished.   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Maria Munoz-Amatriain.  The equivalent experiment is BB76 at PLEXdb.]

DESIGN
genotype: 88Ab536 - time: 0 days(3-replications);  genotype: 88Ab536 - time: 3 days(3-replications);  genotype: Morex - time: 0 days(3-replications);  genotype: Morex - time: 3 days(3-replications)
