TITLE
Expression data from mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation of CBA/CaH, QSi5 and Advanced Intercross Line (AIL; CBA/CaH X QSi5, the 14th generation)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously we have shown significant differences in lactation performance, mammary gland histology and expression profiles of mammary transcriptome during peak-lactation (lactation day 9; L9) between the ordinary CBA/CaH (CBA) and the superior QSi5 strains of mice. In the present study, we compared mammary gland histology between CBA and QSi5 at mid-pregnancy (pregnancy day 12; P12). We assessed lactation performance during the first 8 days of lactation of the 13th - 14th generation of the Advanced Intercross Line (AIL) (CBA X QSi5) mice. We utilized an integrative approach to analyzing mammary microarray expression profiles of CBA and QSi5 at P12 and CBA, AIL and QSi5 at L9.

DESIGN
The inguinal mammary glands of CBA/CaH and QSi5 during mid-pregnancy (Pregnancy day 12; P12), and the glands of CBA/CaH, AIL and QSi5 during peak lactation (Lactation day 9; L9) were collected and total RNA was extracted for Affymetrix microarray (mouse genome 430 2) assay
