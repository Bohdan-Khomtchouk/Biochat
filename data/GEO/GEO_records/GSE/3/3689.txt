TITLE
Whole genome microarray analysis of growth hormone induced genes in bone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Growth hormone (GH) is important in the development and maintenance of bone; however the IGF-dependent and -independent molecular pathways involved remain to be established.  We used microarray analysis to identify genes acutely regulated by GH, in the bones of four week old GH-deficient mice at 6 or 24 hours following a single injection of GH (4 mg/kg body wt) or PBS (n = 6/group).  6,160 genes were differentially expressed at P = 0.05 and 17% of these genes were identified at both time points.  Several of the 201 genes that were up or down regulated at > 2 fold at 6 and/or 24 hours (P = 0.01) were expressed sequence tags, transcription factors, or signaling genes. In conclusion, GH caused acute changes in several novel genes, suggesting that many GH-induced signaling pathways and target genes remain to be discovered Keywords: GH injection induced gene expression, time course
