TITLE
Characterization of transcriptional and fitness effects of a loss of function mutation in rho

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In order to study the effects of a mutation to the transcriptional termination regulator Rho (referred to as rho*), we made use of expression microarrays to observe the direct and indirect effects of rho* on gene expression. In addition, we used arrays to map the fitness of strains from transposon mutagenized libraries under four conditions, showing that in each case the majority of genes with significant fitness effects were dependent on the genotype at rho.
