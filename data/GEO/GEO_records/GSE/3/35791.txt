TITLE
Analysis of H3K79 methylation during reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by Solexa sequencing for H3K27me3 and H3K79me2 in Fibroblasts, Embryonic stem cells, and fibroblast undergoing reprogramming

DESIGN
Inhibition of the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase increases repgoramming efficiency and genome-wide analysis of H3K79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. Dot1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state.
