TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of a glioblastoma multiforme patient with matched control brain tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate differential gene expression, we analyzed the entire transcriptomes of tumor and matched normal brain tissues obtained from a patient who had glioblastoma multiforme.  We extracted and sequenced the mRNA using Illumina GA2 platform. The raw data was analyzed using our recently developed program called RNASEQR, as well as ERANGE, MapSplice, SpliceMap, and TopHat.

DESIGN
Tumor and matched control brain tissues were obtained from a Han-Chinese patient.
