TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult male zebrafish liver treated with benzo-[A]-pyrene (BAP)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 5, 50, and 500 Âµg/L of benzo-[A]-pyrene (BAP) for 24 and 96 hours, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in BAP-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 34 arrays of BAP-treated adult male zebrafish liver and 15 arrays of control fish.
