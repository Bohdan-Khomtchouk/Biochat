TITLE
Neutrophil-derived IL-1Î² is sufficient for abscess formation in immunity against Staphylococcus aureus in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neutrophil abscess formation is critical in innate immunity against many pathogens. Here, the mechanism of neutrophil abscess formation was investigated using a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection. Gene expression analysis of S. aureus-infected skin revealed that induction of neutrophil recruitment genes was largely dependent upon IL-1beta/IL-1R activation. Unexpectedly, using IL 1beta reporter mice, neutrophils were identified as the primary source of IL-1beta at the site of infection. Furthermore, IL-1beta-producing neutrophils were necessary and sufficient for abscess formation and bacterial clearance. S. aureus-induced IL 1beta production by neutrophils required TLR2, NOD2, FPRs and the ASC/NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, IL-1beta and neutrophil abscess formation during an infection are functionally, spatially and temporally linked as a consequence of direct IL-1beta production by neutrophils.

DESIGN
Lesional skin biopsies obtained from C57BL/6J WT mice or IL-1R-deficient mice at 4 hours post-infection with Staphylococcus aureus.  Uninfected skin biopsies were also collected from WT and IL-1R-deficient mice.
