TITLE
Epigenetic changes due to histone eviction induced by anthracycline doxorubicin and aclarubicin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One major class of anti-cancer drugs targets topoisomerase II to induce DNA double-strand breaks and cell death of fast growing cells.  Here, we compare three members of this class - the antracyclines doxorubicin and aclarubicin, and a chemically unrelated compound, etoposide. Aclarubicin does not induce DNA breaks. We define a new activity for the antracyclines: unsupported histone eviction from ´open´ or loosely packed chromosomal areas reflecting exon and promoter regions.

DESIGN
Comparison of histone H3K4me3 of cells post topoisomerase II inhibitors treatment to un-treated ones by ChIP-seq. Comparison of phosphorylated histone H2AX of cells post topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin and etoposide treatment to un-treated ones by ChIP-seq.
