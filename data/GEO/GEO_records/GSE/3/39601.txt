TITLE
Profile of gene expression in Tax positive (TaxP) cells compared with Tax negative  (TaxN) cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigating the effect of Tax protein on the expression of genes in Jurkat cells. Current study will help us to elucidate the differential gene expression profiles of Tax positive Jurkat cells.

DESIGN
The Tax-positive (TaxP) and Tax negative (TaxN) subline of Jurkat were established. mRNA isolated from TaxN or TaxP cell lines were analyzed using gene array.
