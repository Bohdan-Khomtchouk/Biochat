TITLE
Global gene expression divergence among mutation-accumulation Y-chromosome substitution lines of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling revealed that hundreds of genes were differentially expressed among these Y introgression lines, and that global gene expression pattern diverged between the low-PEV and high-PEV (defined in the accompanying publication) flies. The results further expand our understanding of the role of the Y chromosome in modulating global gene expression, and suggest a link with modifications of chromatin state. Keywords: position-effect variegation (PEV) The Y chromosomes of H15 and H23 have lower level of suppression on the expression of white gene, therefore show lower level of eye color variegation. In contrast, the Y chromosomes of H5 and H7 have higher level of suppression on the expression of white gene resulting higher level of eye variegation.

DESIGN
A loop design was used with all the Y introgression lines. In addition to biological replicates, a Cy5-Cy3 dye swap was performed.
