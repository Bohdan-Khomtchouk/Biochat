TITLE
MicroRNA profile of differentiated vs. dedifferentiated human fetal retinal pigment epithelial (hfRPE) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microRNA microarray analysis to determine microRNAs that are differentially expressed between the differentiated hfRPE monolayer (pigmented, hexagonally packed) and dedifferentiated hfRPE cells (non-pigmented, fibroblast-like). Experiment was performed using the Agilent-019118 Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B.

DESIGN
2 -condition experiment: differentiated and dedifferentiated hfRPE cells. 3 biological replicates for each condition.  Also includes a sample that has characteristics of both cell types (representing a transitional state).
