TITLE
Lunatic fringe deficiency cooperates with the Met/Caveolin amplicon to induce basal-like breast cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary specific deletion of Lfng induces basal-like and claudin-low tumors with accumulation of Notch intracellular domain fragments, increased expression of proliferation-associated Notch targets, amplification of the Met/Caveolin locus, and elevated Met and Igf-1R signaling.

DESIGN
Tumor DNAs from Lfngflox/flox; MMTV-Cre conditional mutant mice are being compared to control DNAs from the same animals in order to identify common alterations associated with tumor progression
