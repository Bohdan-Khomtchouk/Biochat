TITLE
TaqMan whole peripheral blood miRNA profiles of HIV-1-infected donors with different clinical characteristics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used TaqMan low-density arrays to identify and quantitate whole peripheral blood miRNAs of 23 chronically HIV-infected subjects with different clinical characteristics and sought to identify a diagnostic/prognostic miRNA signature to diagnose/predict the outcome of chronic HIV infection

DESIGN
Blood samples were from 23 chronically HIV-infected subjects. Differentially expressed miRNAs were found between extreme groups of CD4+ T cell count (CD4low: CD4 < 250 VS CD4high: CD4 > 450) and of viral load (VLlow: VL < 2000 VS VLhigh: VL > 10000)
