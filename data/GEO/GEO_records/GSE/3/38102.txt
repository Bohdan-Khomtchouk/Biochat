TITLE
Expression data from Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this work is to identify the gene regulatory hubs that control nitrogen-use in Oryza sativa, one of the most important crop plants, by using a combination of genomics, bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Here, we evaluate the role of bZIP1, a transcription factor involved in light and nitrogen sensing, by exposing wild-type (WT) and bZIP1 T-DNA null mutant plants to a combinatorial space of N and L treatment conditions.  We use ANOVA analysis combined with clustering and Boolean modeling, to evaluate the role of bZIP1 in mediating L and N signaling genome-wide.

DESIGN
We also study the interspecies conservation, comparing rice with Arabidopsis thaliana nitrogen transcriptomes, to help identify conserved nitrogen regulation.
