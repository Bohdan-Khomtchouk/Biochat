TITLE
Gene Expression Changes in Non-Dysplastic Mucosa from Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Harboring Remote Neoplastic Lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background and Aims: Individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer, although underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We sought to identify a potential gene expression signature in non-dysplastic distal mucosa that as a “genetic field effect” could be a marker for remote neoplastic lesions. Results: 468 genes were significantly up-regulated and 541 genes were significantly down-regulated > 2-fold in UC patients with neoplasia compared to UC patients without neoplasia. Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly up-regulated from controls to quiescent non-dysplastic UC to UC with neoplasia. Immunostaining of proteins revealed increases in tissue expression of S100A9 and REG1 in UC-associated cancer and in non-dysplastic tissue from UC patients harboring remote neoplasia, compared to UC patients without dysplasia and normal controls. Conclusions: Gene expression changes occur as a field effect in UC patients without active inflammation who harbor a remote dysplastic lesion. Further characterization of these genes and proteins might elucidate pathways of carcinogenesis in IBD and lead to the development of more accurate, less invasive markers of dysplasia in those at increased risk.

DESIGN
Microarray assay were conducted on 20 RNA samples isolated from colon mucosa of 20 patients. Of these patients, 5 were normal controls, 4 had quiescent UC, and 11 had UC with neoplasia. Patients were included if they had a previous clinical diagnosis of UC confirmed by an expert GI pathologist, a disease duration > 7 years, and an extent of disease > 20 cm proximal to the anal verge.
