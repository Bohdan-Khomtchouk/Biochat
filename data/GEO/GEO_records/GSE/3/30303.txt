TITLE
Reliable analysis of the catabolic gene landscape and transcriptome for pollutant degradation using a custom open source microarray with internal calibration

ORGANISM
unidentified microorganism

SUMMARY
Despite various efforts to develop tools to detect and compare the activity and catabolic potential and activity for pollutant degradation of microorganisms in environmental samples, an open-source, curated and reliable method is still required. Here we report on a customize normalization system that can be applied to any microarray design, allowing the assessment of reliability of signals and enabling cross-experiment comparisons. Probes for the underlying catabolic gene array were designed based on manually curated databases for catabolic key genes. Signals were assigned to the respective catabolic protein subfamily that allows to inferring the functions and substrate specificity. The placement of probes for critical degradation nodes and subsequent metabolic steps allows the retrieval of information on the metabolic net. Information on gene localization from genome surveys was correlated to signals of putative hosts to generate phylogenetic community information. Hence, this novel array system was validated using genomic DNA of genome sequenced bacterial strains hosting biodegradation functions and applied to genomic DNA and RNA extracted from environmental samples under aromatic pollution pressure.
