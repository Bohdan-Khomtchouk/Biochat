TITLE
Expression Profiling of Spalax ehrenbergi: bioprospecting for hypoxia tolerance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study compares response to hypoxia in muscle between 2 hypoxia tolerant species of Spalax ehrenbergi, blind subterranean mole rat . The blind subterranean mole rat (Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies) is an excellent model of hypoxic tolerance, living underground and exposed to fluctuating O2 and CO2 levels. Unique structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems allow survival at severely reduced oxygen tension. In this study we have compared expression profiles of muscle tissue between two hypoxia tolerant species of Spalax ehrengergi at normoxic (21%) and hypoxic (3%) levels of oxygen concentration by cross species hybridization using a mouse cDNA array containing 15,000 gene elements. Results uncover numerous genes involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress and responding in a species specific manner to hypoxia. Among the most striking, cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) and activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (Lmcd1) and syndecan 2 (Sdc2). These results support the hypothesis that Spalax is variably adapted to fluctuating oxygen tension. Differences may involve very specific metabolic pathways and functional adaptations at the structural and molecular levels. Elucidation of the natural variation and evolutionary changes under hypoxia within this superspecies may have biomedical applications in ischemic syndromes and cancer.
