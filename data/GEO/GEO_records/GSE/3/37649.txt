TITLE
Responses of tobacco BY-2 cells to boron deprivation

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for vascular plants. Boron works to build the cell wall structure by forming borate ester cross-links with pectin, and the deficiency of this element brings about oxidative damage and cell death. However, the process via which B deficiency leads to such serious damage has not been well understood. We investigated the temporal changes in metabolism of B-deprived cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells by analyzing their gene expression using cDNA microarray.
