TITLE
Effect of FadR overexpression in an engineered fatty acid overproducer

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of strains LT-ΔfadE (control) and FRT-ΔfadE (FadR overexpressor) after 12h of fatty acid production. The strains used are described in detail in Zhang F, M Ouellet, TS Batth, CJ Petzold, A Mukhopadhyay and JD Keasling. Enhancing fatty acid production by the expression of the regulatory transcription factor FadR. (In preparation)
