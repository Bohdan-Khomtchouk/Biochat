TITLE
MELK and UBE2C gene knockdown in prostate cancer cell line PC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to address the putative role of MELK and UBE2C in prostate cancer development and progression, we performed functional analysis upon siRNA-based knockdown, and searched for downstream genes and processes by microarray experiments. RNAi-based inhibition of MELK and UBE2C was efficient in PC3 prostate cancer cells and decreased transcriptional level down to about 30% remaining expression level.

DESIGN
Illumina microarray experiments were done upon siRNA based knockdown 48h after transfection of PC3 cells in triplicates.
