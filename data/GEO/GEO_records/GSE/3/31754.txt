TITLE
Mapping translocation breakpoints using a wheat microarray

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Five RNA samples were used.  The RNA source material was from wheat cytogenetic stocks from Dr. Adam Lukaszewski, University of California, Riverside. The lines used for this study are Pavon, Pavon Dt1BL, 1RS.1BL, 1B+5 and T-1 wheat samples. whole seedling minus starchy endosperm.  Equal portions of RNA from unstressed and 48 hr drought-stressed seedling were combined to make one RNA sample. The person who produced the RNA was Prasanna R. Bhat in the TJ Close lab at University of California, Riverside. Everything downstream of RNA production was done at the UC Irvine DNA and Protein Microarray Facility  (Denis Heck, manager) by Sriti Misra. ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Prasanna Bhat.
