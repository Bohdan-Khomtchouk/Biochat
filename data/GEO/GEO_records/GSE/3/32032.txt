TITLE
Role of ndvB on gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
ndvB is a gene expressed preferrentialy in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has been implicated in antibiotic resistance. This gene also has a role in signaling in some plant pathogens. A knockout ndvB strain was used to determine if it controlled any other gene expression related to antibiotic resistance We used microarrays of wildtype and ndvB knockout P. aeruginosa grown in biofilms to identify the role of ndvB in gene expression
