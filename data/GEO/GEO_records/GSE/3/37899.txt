TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana: auxin-treated seedlings versus control seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with auxin (indole-3-acetic acid),  highlighting to the physiological function of auxin by observing early response of gene expressions in Arabidopsis seedlings.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,  auxin-treated seedlings vs. control seedlings. Biological replicates:2 control replicates, 2 auxin-treated.
