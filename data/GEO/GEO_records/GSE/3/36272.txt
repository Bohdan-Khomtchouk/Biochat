TITLE
Comparison of transcriptional responses of two susceptible rice cultivars to strains of Xanthomonas oryzae

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice.  X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is the causal agent of bacterial streak of rice.  Fourteen day old rice leaves were inoculated with one of five strains of Xanthomonas oryzae. Seven strains of Xoo were used; three wild type strains (PXO99A, T7174, and PXO86) and strains PXO99AME7, which has a nonfunctional type III secretion system and is non-pathogenic, , PXO99AME1, a pthXo6 and avrXa27 double mutant, PXO99ME2, a pthXo1 mutant, and PXO99ME5, a reduced virulence strain with uncharacterized mutation in a TAL effector.  One strain of Xoc (BLS303) was tested.  Controls include an inoculation with water (MOCK) and no inoculation.  T7174 is our label for the Japanese isolate MAFF311018.  Third leaves are inoculated with a needless syringe at adjacent sites along the upper leaf blade.  Six leaves from separate plants are pooled.  RNA samples were collected 24 h after treatment. ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Ginny Antony.  The equivalent experiment is OS66 at PLEXdb.]
