TITLE
The exon junction complex is restricted to a specific subset of splice junctions

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We employ multi-step affinity purification followed by high-throughput sequencing  to determine the location of EJC complexes assembled on a cellular transcriptome in Drosophila S2 cells, finding 6% of the intron-containing genes were not associated with EJCs, and within genes with multiple introns, only specific exon-exon junctions assembled an EJC.
