TITLE
Transcriptional response of  endometrium and the bovine preimplantative embryo to subclinical inflamation of the uterine environment

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Combining the cytological as well as gene expression changes in the endometrium is required to understand the effects of subclinical endometritis on endometrium as well as embryo. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate the gene expression profiles of subclinical endometrium as well the effect of the inflamed environment on the gene expression profile of the developing preimplantative embryo.
