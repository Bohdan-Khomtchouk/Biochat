TITLE
Expression data from AJ and C3H mouse lungs exposed to NNK

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes associated with exposure to the carcinogen Nitrosamine (NNK) in mouse lungs of susceptible (AJ) and resistant (C3H) strains. Microarrays were used to capture all of the up and down regulated genes in two strains of mice.

DESIGN
Lungs were excised and analyzed between 3-12 weeks after exposure to NNK before mature tumors had formed
