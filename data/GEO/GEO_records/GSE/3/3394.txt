TITLE
Gene expression profile of cultured isolated UB in branching (BSN, PTN) and non-branching (HRG) conditions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Genes ontologically classified as proliferative and developmental were down-regulated by HRG, whereas those involved in transport were up-regulated. For example, the mRNA for the GDNF receptors, GFRa1 and ret9 were down-regulated while the mRNA for collecting duct transporters, such as urea transporter2, aquaporin3, sodium-hydrogen exchanger2 were up-regulated in HRG-treated UBs compared with UBs grown in the presence of branch-promoting factors Keywords: Comparing different growth factor treatment
