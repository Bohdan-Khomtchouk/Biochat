SUMMARY
Abnormal metal accumulation is associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and has a relevant role in affecting amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) aggregation and neurotoxicity.In the present study, employing a microarray analysis of 35,129 genes, we analyzed gene expression profile changes due to exposure to Abeta-Zn or Abeta-Cu complexes in neuronal-like cells (SH-SY5Y). Microarray data indicated that Abeta-Zn or Abeta-Cu complexes selectively alter expression of genes mainly related to cell death, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis.Taken together these findings indicate that Abeta-Zn or Abeta-Cu show some commonalities in affecting AD-related target functions. The overall modulatory activity on these genes supports the idea of a possible net result leading to mechanisms that counteract toxic effects of Abeta-Zn or Abeta-Cu.

DESIGN
Analysis used a neuronal cell lines, the SH-SY5Y, exposed to either AB,  the AB-Cu or AB-Zn complex or Cu or Zn alone. The SH-SY5Y without treatment were used that a control. For the exposure to AB, six replicates were performed (three dye swap and three non-dye swap), while for exposure to AB-Cu, AB-Zn, Zn and Cu two replicates each were made (one dye swap and one non-dye swap).
