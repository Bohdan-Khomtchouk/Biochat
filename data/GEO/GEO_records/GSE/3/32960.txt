TITLE
microRNA profile of human nasopharyngeal tissues: nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues vs. normal nasopharyngeal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are biomarkers of prognosis and survival for many types of cancer.  We evaluated whether microRNAs can predict the survival and efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. We retrospectively analyzed microRNA expression in 312 paraffin-embedded NPC specimens and 18 normal nasopharyngeal tissues using microarray. We found Forty-one microRNAs are differentially expressed between NPC and normal tissues, and a five-microRNA signature can predict survival independent of stage. NPC patients with the low-risk microRNA signature have a favorable response to concurrent chemotherapy.
