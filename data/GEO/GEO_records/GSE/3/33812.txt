Gene expression profiles of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in pediatric patients with severe aplastic anemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric severe aplastic anemia (PSAA) is a rare and life-threatening disease, which has been suggested to result from deficiency in essential cytokines or growth factors in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, we examined expression profiles of the essential cytokines and growth factors, which were involved in proliferation and differentiation of MSC, in 5 PSAA patients using oligonucleotides microarrays. Following evaluation of gene expression patterns using cluster analysis and gene ontology classifications, fifteen potential genes that were cell proliferation- and cytokine-related and significantly down-regulated in PSAA were selected. The findings of the microarray analysis were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Interestingly, silencing of chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12, also named stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF1) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene expression reduced cell growth and response to adipogenic factor-induced differentiation, but increased osteogenesis, which possibly derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Re-introduction of the CXCL12 gene or exogenously added HGF, on the other hand, partially recovered cell function of PSAA MSC. These results suggest that gene expression in PSAA MSC is globally down-regulated by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism. Among these down-regulated genes, CXCL12 and HGF played vital roles in regulating cell growth and differentiation.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stem cells from five pediatric SAA patients vs. MSC from five healthy donors, which were pooled together.
