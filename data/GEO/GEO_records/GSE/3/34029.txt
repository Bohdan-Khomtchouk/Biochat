TITLE
Expression differences related to phenobarbital feeding in worker honey bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
The drug phenobarbital induces cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene expression in many animals, but no changes in P450 expression, or expression of any detoxification genes, were observed in worker honey bees fed on phenobarbital-candy relative to bees fed plain candy. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Five replicate microarray hybridizations were performed comparing transcript abundance in phenobarbital-fed and control-fed adult worker bees.  Each total RNA pool was derived from an independent collection of 10 worker bees.
