TITLE
SNP-based LOH of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at locus D4S2964 was found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by our previous studies and othersâ€™. The present study was designed to explore genes around the locus affected by LOH and their clinical implications. 440 SNPs located at 49 genes around D4S2964 were selected from NCBI website for the SNPs microarray fabrication. LOH of these SNPs markers in 112 cases of HCC tissues and paired adjacent liver tissues were investigated by the SNP microarray. A map of LOH of SNPs in genes around D4S2964 was constructed.

DESIGN
112 pairs of HCC tissues and corresponding non-tumor tissues was genotyped. LOH and its clinical implication was analyzed.
