TITLE
A novel non-coding RNA within WHSC1 is over-expressed in t(4;14)-positive multiple myeloma and other cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We designed oligonucleotide tiling arrays spanning the t(4;14) breakpoint region on chromosome 4 to identify additional oncogenic RNAs in an unbiased fashion.

DESIGN
Four (4) multiple myeloma bone marrow samples with t(4;14) and twelve (12) MM BM samples without t(4;14) were analyzed. Furthermore, seven (7) bladder (1 normal, 6 malignant), eight (8) colon (1 normal, 7 malignant) and eight (8) esophagus (2 normal, 6 maligant) tissue samples were analyzed. Finally, five (5) multiple myeloma cell line samples with t(4;14) - three (3) of LP-1 and two (2) of H929 - and three (3) MM cell line samples and three (3) non-MM cell line samples without t(4;14) - three (3) of U266 and three (3) of Hela - were analyzed.
