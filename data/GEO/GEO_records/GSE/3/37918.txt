TITLE
RNA-seq in breast cancer cell lines after manipulation of miR-23b expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing technology has been carried out in order to evaluate mRNA expression changes after manipulation of miR-23b in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines

DESIGN
Our study implicates miR-23b in cytoskeletal remodeling in breast cancer. To evaluate the entire set of genes modulated by miR-23b we performed RNA-seq after ectopic manipulation of this miRNA in breast cancer cell lines. We over-expressed this miRNA in MCF-7 epithelial cancer cell lines and also reduced its activity by stably transfecting MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal-like cancer cell lines with a specific sponge vector. RNA-seq analysis revealed a number of candidate targets of this miRNA.
