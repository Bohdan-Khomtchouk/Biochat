TITLE
Chemokines regulate small leucine-rich proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of the pressure-overloaded right ventricle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chemokines have been suggested to play a role during development of left ventricular failure, but little is known about their role during right ventricular (RV) remodeling and dysfunction. The first aim of this study was to identify chemokines which are regulated during RV pressure overload. We then hypothesized that these chemokines regulate SLRPs (small leucine-rich proteoglycans)

DESIGN
A microarray study was performed on  5 pulmonary banded and sham operated wildype mice.
