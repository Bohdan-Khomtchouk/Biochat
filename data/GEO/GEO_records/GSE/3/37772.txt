TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome profiling reveals the functional impact of rare de novo and recurrent CNVs in autism spectrum disorders.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of lymphoblast cell lines of autisms from Simons Simplex Families. This experiment aims to utilize blood expression data to study the functional impact and to prioritize rare variants potentially associated with autism.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lmyphoblast cell lines derived from 439 Simons Simplex Families.
