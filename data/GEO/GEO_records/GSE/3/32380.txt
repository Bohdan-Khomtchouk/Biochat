TITLE
Identification of candidate enhancer elements in unstimulated and stimulated dendritic cells and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify candidate enhancer elements we analyzed the distribution of two histone modifications associated with enhancers - H3K4me1 and H3K27ac - and one histone modification associated with active transcription - H4 acetylation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H4ac, and input DNA controls, from 2 cell types (DCs & fibroblasts) under 2 conditions (unstimulated & stimulated)
