TITLE
microRNA profiling of HepG2 cells: control vs treatment with cacao, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract or epigallocatechin gallate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mi(cro)RNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. These RNAs have been shown to be involved in a several biological processes, human diseases and metabolic disorders. Proanthocyanidins, which are the most abundant polyphenol class in the human diet, have positive heath effects on a variety of metabolic disorders such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance. The present study aimed to evaluate whether proanthocyanidin-rich natural extracts modulate miRNA expression. Using microarray analysis and Q-PCR, we investigated miRNA expression in HepG2 cells treated with proanthocyanidins. Our results showed that when HepG2 cells were treated with grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), cocoa proanthocyanidin extract (CPE) or pure epigallocatechin gallate isolated from green tea (EGCG), fifteen, six and five differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively, were identified out of 904 mRNAs. Specifically, miR-30b* was downregulated by the three treatments, and treatment with GSPE or CPE upregulated miR-1224-3p, miR-197 and miR-532-3p. Therefore, these results provide evidence of the capacity of dietary proanthocyanidins to influence microRNA expression, revealing a new mechanism of action of proanthocyanidins.

DESIGN
microRNA profiling of Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) comparing control untreated HepG2 cells with cells treated with grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (100 mg/L, 5h), cacao  proanthocyanidin extract (100 mg/L, 5h) or epigallocatechin gallate (50 mg/L, 5h). Two biologival replicates were used for control and  treated cells with one replicate per array.
