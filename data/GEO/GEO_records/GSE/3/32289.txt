TITLE
Rybp ChIP-chip in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rybp binding in wild-type, Eed-KO, and Dnmt1-KO ES cells

DESIGN
ChIP on chip analysis was carried out using the Mouse Promoter ChIP-on-chip Microarray Set (G4490A, Agilent-014716 and Agilent-014717, Palo Alto, Calif., USA). ESCs were subjected to ChIP assay using a Rybp antibody (Santa Cruz; H-115). Purified immunoprecipitated and input DNA was subjected to T7 RNA polymerase-based amplification as described previously (van Bakel et al., 2008). Labeling, hybridization and washing were carried out according to the Agilent mammalian ChIP-on-chip protocol (ver.9.0). Scanned images were quantified with Agilent Feature Extraction software under standard conditions.
