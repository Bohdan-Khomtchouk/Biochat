TITLE
Regulation of hypothalamic gene expression by glucocorticoid: implications for energy homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The current study has investigated the hypothalamic gene expressions regulated by glucocorticoid (GC), key hormones in energy homeostasis. Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, we have studied the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and GC on the transcriptomes of mouse hypothalamus. Approximately, 180 000 SAGE tags, which correspond to 50 000 tag species, were isolated from each group of intact or adrenalectomized mice, as well as 1, 3 and 24 hours after GC injection. ADX has upregulated diazepam binding inhibitor gene expression, while downregulating vomeronasal 1 receptor D4, genes involved in mitochondrial phosphorylation (cytochrome c oxidase 1 and NADH dehydrogenase 3), 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1, and prostaglandin D2 synthase. GC has increased the gene expression levels of dehydrogenase/reductase member 3, prostaglandin D2 synthase, solute carrier family 4 member 4, and five cytoskeletal proteins including myosin light chain phosphorylatable fast and troponin C2 fast. On the other hand, GC has reduced the mRNA levels of calmodilin 1 and expressed sequence tag similar to (EST) calmodilin 2, ATP synthase F0 subunit 6, and solute carrier family 4 member 3. Moreover, seven uncharacterized and 43 novel transcripts were modulated by ADX and GC. The current study has identified genes that may regulate hypothalamic systems governing energy balance in response to ADX and GC. Keywords: Hormone effect analysis
