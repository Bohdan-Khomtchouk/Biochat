TITLE
Crosstalk between Fgf and Wnt signaling in the zebrafish tailbud

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We aimed to expand the knowledge of Fgf and Wnt signaling in the zebrafish tailbud. Both pathways are required for proper axis elongation and segmentation and we wished to explore the genes under the control of each pathway during this process. In addition, we saught to identify crosstalk between the two pathways by determining whether pathway effector expression was being changed after time-resolved modification of each pathway using pharmacological modifiers.

DESIGN
Embryos were treated with either 0.3M LiCl, 50uM SU5402, or E2 for 3hours or 7 hours (E2 and SU5402), followed by tailbud dissection and RNA extraction. Conditions were replicated in triplicate.
