TITLE
Expression data from melanoma subpopulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed at identifying lymphangiogenic subpopulations by comparative analysis of single cell clones derived from a melanoma of a single patient. Selected clones were grafted into SCID mice, where they induced lymphangiogenesis and metastasized into sentinel nodes, whereas non-lymphangiogenic clones from the same patient did not metastasize. RNA isolated from primary SCID mouse tumors were used for transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
A total of 16 Samples were analysed, 4 per group. Parental pool MCM1(C), nonlymphangiogenic MCM1G(G), lymphangiogenic MCM1D(D1), lymphangiogenic and very metastatic MCM1DLN(D2).
