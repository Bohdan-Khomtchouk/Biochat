TITLE
Transient transfection of C28/I2 chondrocytes; the human EST DA125942 (CISTR-ACT's lncRNA) was overexpressed and siRNA-depleted

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overexpression and depletion of DA125942 led to the dysregulation of essential mesenchymal and pre-chondrogenesis genes, transcripton factors and chromatin remodeling factors

DESIGN
3 replicates of each condition
