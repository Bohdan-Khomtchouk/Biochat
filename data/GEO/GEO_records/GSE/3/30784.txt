TITLE
Gene expression profiling of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
OSCC is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. To identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of invasive OSCC, we compared the gene expressions of OSCC, oral dysplasia, and normal oral tissue from patients without oral cancer or preneoplastic oral lesions (controls). Results provided models of gene expression to distinguish OSCC from controls.

DESIGN
RNA from 167 OSCC, 17 dysplasia and 45 normal oral tissues were extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip arrays. The differentially expressed genes were identified using GenePlus software and the validation was done using RT-PCR, using independent internal and external datasets.
