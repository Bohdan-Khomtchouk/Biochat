TITLE
The nsrR regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
In this study, we have defined the NsrR regulon in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium 14028s using a transcriptional microarray. Wild-type and nsrR mutant S. Typhimurium were grown aerobically to early log-phase (OD600~0.5) at 37C in LB medium. Total RNA was isolated from three independent cultures of both strains and interrogated on a PCR product array representing almost all ORFs.
