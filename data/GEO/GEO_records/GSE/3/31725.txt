TITLE
Comparison between mouse ES/iPS derived neurosphere and mouse primary culture of neurospheres obtained from fetal mouse ganglionic eminence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent reports have emphasized the pitfalls of iPSC technology including the potential for immunogenicity of transplanted cells. It is serious safety-related concern for iPSC-based cell therapy. However, preclinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of iPSCs are also accumulating. To address the concern of immunogenicity of ESCs/iPSCs or ESCs/iPSCs-derived neurospheres, global gene expression profiles were compared between undifferentiated mouse ESCs (EB3 line), mouse iPSCs (38C2 line), and ESC/iPSC-derived neurosphere and mouse primary culture of neurosphere obtained from fetal mouse ganglionic eminence. Mouse adult sklin fibroblast was used as a control. We used affymetrix microarrays to compare the global gene expression of neurospheres prepared several origins. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
RNA extracted from neurospheres was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
