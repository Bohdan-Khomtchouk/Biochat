TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of Th1 and Tfh LCMV-specific Smarta  CD4 T cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we sought to distinguish phenotypically and functionally distinct virus-specific effector CD4 T cell subsets that form during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and to examine their ability to develop into memory T cells.  To further characterize the effector subsets and identify genetic pathways and transcription factors involved in their differentiation, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of the three day 8 effector cell populations: (1) PSGL1hi Ly6Chi, (2) PSGL1hi Ly6Clo and (3) PSGL1lo Ly6Clo Smarta CD4 T cells along with (4) day 60 memory PSGL1hi and (5) naïve Smarta CD4 T cells using Illumina BeadChips. Results of this microarray confirmed the validity of our phenotyping by flow cytometry in many ways and showed distinct gene signatures for the three effector subsets.

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was performed on two or three independent samples of five different Smarta CD4 T cell populations: (1) naïSGL1lo, (3) day 8 PSGL1hi Ly6Clo, (4) day 8 PSGL1hi Ly6Clo and (5) day 60 PSGL1hi memory cells.
