TITLE
Brd2 regulates gene expression and alternative splicing.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed a role of Brd2 protein in transcription and alternative splicing. 289 genes change alternative splicing after Brd2 knockdown and 1459 genes alter gene expression compared to cells treated with negative control siRNA.

DESIGN
6 samples (3 independent samples of cells treated with Brd2 siRNA, 3 samples of cells treated with negative control siRNA)
