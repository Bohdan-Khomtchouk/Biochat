TITLE
Copy Number Variants at Chromosome 10q11.21, 12p12.1 and 21q22.11 May Be Associated with Hyperlipidemia in Taiwanese Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix SNP array analysis was performed on DNA extracted from whole blood samples of 7 Taiwanese patients with hyperlipidemia. Three copy number variant (CNV) regions associated significantly with hyperlipidemia were identified through genomic segmentation analysis (P < 0.001).

DESIGN
7 male Taiwanese hyperlipidemia patients.
