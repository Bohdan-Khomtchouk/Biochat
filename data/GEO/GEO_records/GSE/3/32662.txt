TITLE
DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION OF MEDULLARY THYROID CARCINOMA REVEALS SPECIFIC MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH GENETIC CONDITIONS.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of 49 primary medullary thyroid carcinoma tumors. Comparisons MTCM918T vs MTC634 and MTCM918T vs MTCWT.

DESIGN
49 (52 hybridized tumors with 3 replicates) primary Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) cases were hybridized onto a cDNA microarray in order to identify the unique markers for specific genetic classes of MTC.
