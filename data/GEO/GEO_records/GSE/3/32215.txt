TITLE
Reversal of glucocorticoid resistance by AKT inhibition in T-ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (T-ALL). Here we used a systems biology approach, based on the reverse engineering of signaling regulatory  networks, which identified the AKT1 kinase as a signaling factor driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL.  Indeed, activation of AKT1 in T-ALL lymphoblasts impairs glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically,  AKT1 directly phosphorylates the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 protein at position S134 and blocks  glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Consistently, inhibition of AKT1 with MK-2206  increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy both in T-ALL cell lines and in primary patient  samples thus effectively reversing glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results warrant the  clinical testing of ATK1 inhibitors and glucocorticoids, in combination, for the treatment of T-ALL.

DESIGN
This study includes 228 T-ALL samples of which 117 samples are re-analysis of GSE26713.
