TITLE
The genomic architecture of host whole blood transcriptional response to malaria infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of malaria infection on whole blood gene expression and uncovering regulatory effects using eQTL analysis. Testing for relashionships between genotype, expression and malaria phenotypes.

DESIGN
We generated whole blood gene expression profiles and genotypes from 155 West-African children including 94 cases undergoing the symptomatic phase of blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum infection and 61 age-matched controls. PCA, analysis of covariance and eQTL analysis were performed on the data.
