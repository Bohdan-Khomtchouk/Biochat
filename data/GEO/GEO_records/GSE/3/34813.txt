TITLE
Identification of miRNAs in strawberry

ORGANISM
Fragaria x ananassa

SUMMARY
In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation and have been shown to control many genes involved in various biological and metabolic processes.  Deep sequencing technologies have facilitated identification of species-specific or lowly expressed as well as conserved or highly expressed miRNAs in plants. Strawberry is one of the most economically important fruit throughout the world.Although miRNAs have been extensively studied in the past five years, limited systematic study of miRNAs has been performed on the Fragaria genus. These results show that regulatory miRNAs exist in agronomically important strawberry and may play an important role in strawberry growth, development, and response to disease.

DESIGN
High throughput sequencing was employed to identify miRNAs in strawberry and try to describe their functions in strawberry growth and development
