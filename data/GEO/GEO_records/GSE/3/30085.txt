TITLE
Dietary alleviation of maternal obesity and diabetes: increased resistance to diet-induced obesity transcriptional and epigenetic signatures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously reported that providing a control diet to obese and diabetic mice during the periconceptional/gestation/lactation period, led to a drastic sex-specific shift from susceptibility to resistance to high fat feeding (HFD) in the female offspring. In the present study, we aimed to characterize exhaustively the metabolic phenotype of  F1 and F2 sensitive (S1, S2) and resistant (R1, R2) mice and underscore in the liver, muscle and adipose tissue, the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms supporting the response to HFD, the trait of resistance/susceptibility and the adaptation across generations. We report the transcriptomic analyses realized based on a candidate gene approach in the liver using a custom mouse microchip.
