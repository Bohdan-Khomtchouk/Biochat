TITLE
Nucleotidyltransferase gene HESO1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Small RNAs in plants are protected by 2'-O-methylation at 3' terminal nucleotide by HEN1. In hen1 mutant, small RNAs lacking 3' methylation are truncated and tailed at 3' end. We identified a nucleotidyltransferase gene HESO1 in Arabidopsis that tails small RNAs in hen1. In order to study the small RNA tailing and truncation in detail in wild type Col, heso1-1, hen1-8 and hen1-8 heso1-1 double mutant, we constructed small RNA libraries for these four genotypes and we found heso1-1 mutation reduces small RNA tailing in hen1-8 background, however, the 3' truncation is not significantly affected.

DESIGN
8 samples examined: wild-type Col (replicate 1), heso1-1 (replicate 1), hen1-8(replicate 1), hen1-8 heso1-1 (replicate 1), wild-type Col (replicate 2), heso1-1 (replicate 2), hen1-8(replicate 2) and hen1-8 heso1-1 (replicate 2).
