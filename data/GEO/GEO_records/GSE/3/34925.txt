TITLE
Expression data from knockdown of G9a in MDA-MB231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G9a is an H3K9m2 methyltransferase, which is critical in controlling gene suppression and DNA methylation. We used microarray analysis to identify the target genes that are regulated by G9a in MDA-MB231 cells, in which E-cadherin is silenced.

DESIGN
G9a expression was stably knocked-down in MDA-MB231 cells. RNA from this clone and parental (control) cells were purified for microarray analysis.
