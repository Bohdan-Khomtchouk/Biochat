Effects of Estrogen and Tamoxifen on Ishikawa cells after 24h and 48h

SUMMARY
Treatment with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen confers a risk of developing uterine tumors or other endometrial pathologies.  Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which demonstrates tissue-specific activity although the mechanisms remain poorly understood.  Both estradiol and tamoxifen act as estrogen agonists on the human uterus, and therefore have the potential to promote carcinogenicity.  Estradiol and tamoxifen elicit cellular responses via the estrogen receptors (ER), which are involved in multiple signalling pathways.  The effects at the molecular level are further influenced by the differential recruitment of co-factors and the presence of specific promoter motifs in target genes. In this study, ER positive (+) Ishikawa cells are used as a model to investigate the overall effect of treatment with either 17b-estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen on the gene expression profiles. Keywords: Comparison of estradiol and tamoxifen on Ishikawa human uterine cells after 24h or 48h
