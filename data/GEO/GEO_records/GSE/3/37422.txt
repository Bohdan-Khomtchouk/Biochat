TITLE
miRNAs expression in joint of Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By using high-throughput microRNA profiling analysis, we identified a series of miRNAs dysregulated in local inflammatory lesions of human patients with autoimmune diseases, as well as their relevant mouse models such as CIA.

DESIGN
We isolated joint samples pooled from six CIA mice or from six naïve control mice. Total RNA was extracted for the TaqMan® Low Density Assay v3.0
