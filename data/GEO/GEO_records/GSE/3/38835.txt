TITLE
Differential regulation of microRNAs in skeletal muscle from monozygotic twins discordant for type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microRNA expression in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from 11 genetically identical twin pairs discordant for type 2 diabetes. This eliminates the influence of genotype and leads to the identification of microRNAs that are exclusively influenced by environmental (non-genetic) factors.
