TITLE
Knock-down and Over-expression of JMJD6 in MCF-7 and/or MDA-MB231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By survival analysis of breast cancer patients, JMJD6 was found to be significantly associated with poor prognosis. Over-expression and knock-down of JMJD6 in breast cancer cell lines suggested a role in proliferation. In order to study the transcriptional events that occur following JMJD6 expression changes, siRNA-mediated knock-down of JMJD6 was performed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 and stable over-expression of JMJD6 was performed in MCF-7.

DESIGN
There are 2 different siRNA-mediated knock-downs of JMJD6 with 2 biological replicates in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231; 3 clones of JMJD6 over-expression with 3 biological replicates in MCF-7. The control for the knock-downs is scrambled siRNA-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 and the control for JMJD6 over-expression is empty vector over-expression in MCF-7.
