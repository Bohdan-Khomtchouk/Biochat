TITLE
Gene expression in lung fibroblasts of patients with emphysema

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exploratory design using pooled samples of 3 patients with emphysema and 3 patients without COPD Aim: 1.Search for expressed genes to select for a custom designed array (200 genes, n=50). 2. Find highly differentially expressed genes as targets for qPCR 3. Search for regulated senescent associated genes Keywords: disease comparison
