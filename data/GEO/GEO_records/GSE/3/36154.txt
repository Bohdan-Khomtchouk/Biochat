TITLE
Expression analysis of HFF cells in G0 phase [MAT]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide expression in G0 phase. Expression data were processed with MAT (Johnson et al., " Model-based analysis of tiling-arrays for ChIP-chip. " Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103:12457-62, 2006.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
