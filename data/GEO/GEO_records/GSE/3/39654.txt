TITLE
FoxA1 specifies unique androgen and glucocorticoid receptor binding events in prostate cancer cells (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the androgen receptor recruitment to the chromatin of androgen responsive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP-1F5 and VCaP in response to physiological androgen 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) using ChIP-sequencing. We compare the AR recruitment by DHT to that by partial agonist/antagonist cyproterone acetate and mifepristone (RU486) in LNCaP-1F5 cells. We also report the role of glucocorticoid receptor recruitment in presence of dexamethasone (Dex) in androgen responsive prostate cancer cells. The AR and GR cistrome analysis is subsequently compared with gene expression data and RNA Pol II analysis. The ChIP-seq has been performed using AR, GR, RNA Pol II antibodies.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by microarray of LNCaP-1F5 cells treated with vehicle, 100 nM 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 100 nM dexamethasone (Dex), 1000 nM cyproterone acetate (CPA), 100 nM mifepristone (RU486) and combination of 100 nM DHT,100 nM Dex for 24 hours.
