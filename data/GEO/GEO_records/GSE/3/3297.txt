TITLE
Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy Gene Expression Profiling Compared to Healthy Control Kidneys

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles from six donor kidneys prior to surgical manipulation to six kidneys removed after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) and several hours of CO2 pneumoperitoneum.  Biopsies were obtained from renal cortex and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips.  For control kidneys we identified 1380 genes present on all 6 samples that had a signal intensity greater than 1000.  Functional classification of these revealed genes for cellular signaling (201; 15%), regulation of transcription (156; 11%), cellular transport (144; 10%) and cellular metabolism (111; 8%).  A class comparison between the controls and LDN kidneys yielded 865 differentially expressed genes.  Functional classification of the 502 genes differentially up-regulated in LDN kidneys identified associations with apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell signaling, regulation of cell growth/proliferation, immune/inflammation, ischemia/stress response and proteolysis/peptidolysis. These data demonstrate an altered renal transcriptome induced by several hours of CO2 pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery characterized by up-regulation of ischemia and injury associated genes. Keywords: Comparative Expression
