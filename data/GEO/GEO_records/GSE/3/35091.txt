TITLE
Expression data from mandibular arches in mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fusion of branchial arch derivatives is an essential event in the development of craniofacial architecture. A unique feature of the mandibular arch development is medial/lateral compartmentalization for the molecular networks. Those networks give rise to multiple region-specific organs, namely teeth, a tongue, salivary glands, and the supporting matrices such as bones and cartilages. We aimed to investigate molecular networks that govern the fusion process during mouse mandibular development. To this end, cDNA microarray technology was employed for screening of spatio-temporal gene expression in developing mandibular arch from E9.7 through E14.5.

DESIGN
We conducted to divide a mandibular arch medially and laterally to compare both gene expression. From an embryo at E10.5, a medial (M) sample of the mandibular arch was dissected out -at just the distal end of opposed lateral lingual swellings-, and the bulk of remnant lateral region was collected as (L) sample under a stereomicroscope. Forty embryos for each time-point were used to obtain a pool of total RNA.
