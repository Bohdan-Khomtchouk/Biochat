TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis cells undergoing the Mycelium-to-Yeast transition

ORGANISM
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis

SUMMARY
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermodimorphic fungus associated with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a prevalent systemic mycosis in South America. In humans, infection starts by inhalation of fungal propagules, which reach the pulmonary epithelium and transform into the yeast parasitic form. Thus, the mycelium-to-yeast transition is of particular interest because conversion to yeast is essential for infection. We have used a P. brasiliensis biochip, carrying sequences of 4,692 genes from this fungus to monitor gene expression at several time points of the mycelium-to-yeast morphological shift (from 5 to 120 h). Keywords: Time Course
