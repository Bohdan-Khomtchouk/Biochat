TITLE
Constitutive expression of activated NOTCH1 in fetal Sertoli cells dysregulates factors required for proper gonocyte maintenance and survival.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of whole embryonic day 14.5 mouse testes constitutively expressing the activated intracellular domain of NOTCH1 in Sertoli cells. The goal of the study was to identify Sertoli cell expressed genes regulated by Notch signaling, which are critical to gonocyte maintenance and survival. The mouse model was generated by intercrossing anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (Amh)-cre transgenic mice and RosaNICD transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Testes were dissected free from mesonephroi and testis pairs from a single fetus were pooled to generate a single sample. Littermates not expressing Amh-cre were used as controls. Testes from one control and one overexpressor fetus per dam from three separate dams were used for analysis.
