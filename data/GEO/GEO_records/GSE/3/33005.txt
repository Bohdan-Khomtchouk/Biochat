TITLE
Effects of corn oil gavage on gene expression profiles of thymus in Wistar Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of corn oil (CO), common drug vehicle, on the gene expression profiles in rat thymus with microarray technique. Female Wistar Rats were administered daily with normal saline (NS), CO 2, 5, 10 ml/kg for 14 days, respectively. Then, the thymus samples of rats were collected for microarray test and histopathology examination. The microarray data showed that 0, 40, 458 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 2, 5, 10 ml/kg CO group compared to NS group, respectively. The altered genes were associated with   immune response, cellular response to organic cyclic substance, regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation, et al. However, no obvious histopathologic change was observed in the three CO dosage groups. These data show that 10 ml/kg CO , that dosage has been determined as the vehicle in drug safety assessment , can cause obvious influence on gene expression in rat thymus. Our study suggest that the dosage of CO gavage as the vehicle for water-in-soluble agents in drug development should be no more than 5 ml/kg if agents’ molecular effects in thymus want to be assessed.

DESIGN
Gene expression in thymus from female Wistar rats daily administered with 2, 5, 10 ml/kg of corn oil or 10 ml/kg of saline by gavage for 14 consecutive days were measured using Agilent Rat Whole Genome 8×*60K array.
