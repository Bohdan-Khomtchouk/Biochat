TITLE
Mesp1 induces a subset of hematopoietic-associated transcription factors in ES cell-derived Flk1+Tie2+ endothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously, we reported that the transcription factor Mesp1 promotes the cell fates of cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and vascular endothelium. Recently, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were shown to derive from hemogenic endothelium.  Since Mesp1 regulates development of endothelium, it potentially could influence gene expression related to hematopoietic development. Our present fate mapping study found that Mesp1-cre efficiently labeled hematopoietic lineages in vivo. This result suggested that Mesp1 might be expressed in progenitors of the hematopoietic system, such as hemogenic endothelium. To test this, we purified Flk1+ Tie2+ endothelium derived from differentiating ES cells with or without Mesp1 induction, and used microarray expression analysis to identify genes strongly up-regulated by Mesp1.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem (ES) cells harboring a doxycycline (dox)-inducible Mesp1 gene (A2lox.Mesp1) were differentiated as embryoid bodies for 5 days in the absence (-) or presence (+) of dox from day 2 to day 4. Flk1+Tie2+ endothelial cells were purified by cell sorting for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
