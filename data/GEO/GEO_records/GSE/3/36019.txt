TITLE
Gene expression profiles in lymph nodes from ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Pandemic H1N1 influenza A Human infection leads to symptoms ranging from mild to severe with lower respiratory complications observed in a small but significant number of infected individuals. Microarray analysis of the lymph nodes from ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009 shows intense gene upregulation during days 3 and 5 post-infection, and followed by marked downregulation during days 7 and 14 post infection. Gene expression profiles during the upregulation phase show intense chemokine activity, cell replication and activation of the lymphocyte-related signaling pathways.
