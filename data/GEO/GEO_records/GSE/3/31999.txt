TITLE
RNA-sequencing of left and right atrial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The right and left atria have different susceptibilities towards developing arrhythmias, with left atrial arrhythmias more commonly observed.  To study potential underlying causes of this difference between the two upper chambers of the heart, four human left-right atrial pairs were subjected to whole-genome expression analyses via next generation sequencing of small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and polyA enriched mRNAs.  Using a paired sample design, significant differences in gene expression were found between the left and right atria in both the poly-A and small RNA fractions.  Hsa-miR-143 was the most highly expressed miRNA in the atria as quantified by RNA-seq.  Gene expression differences established during development are retained into adulthood including that of PITX2 and BMP10.  In addition ten novel non-coding RNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the left and right atrias .

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA and miRNA expression differences between the left and right atria from matched patient samples.  The title pattern is as follows (mRNA/miRNA)_tissue_patient.
