TITLE
Response of young and aged Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular events that underline skeletal physiology during aging we catalogued the profile of gene expression in ex vivo cultured MSCs derived from 3 and 15 month old rats and challenged with dexamethasone (Dex). RNA retrieved from these cells was analyzed using Affymetrix Gene Chips to compare the effect of Dex on gene expression. Keywords: age effect, treatment
