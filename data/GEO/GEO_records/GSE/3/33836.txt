TITLE
extracellular calcium chelation experiment_P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) schizonts treated with EGTA and ionomycin vs P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) reference RNA pool

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Calcium is a universal second messenger molecule which plays a significant role in several biological processes. Presence of calcium sensors (calmodulins) and calcium-dependent protein kinases in Plasmodium species suggests an important role of calcium-dependent signaling pathways in the regulation of cellular processes in the malaria parasites. Evidence for extracellular calcium chelation of the control Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages treated with the calcium ionophore EGTA ans later with ionomycin has been presented here.
