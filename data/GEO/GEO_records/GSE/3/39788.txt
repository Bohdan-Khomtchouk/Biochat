TITLE
Mapping of Three Genetic Determinants of Susceptibility to Estrogen-Induced Mammary Cancer within the Emca8 Locus on Rat Chromosome 5

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We are using the ACI rat model of 17beta-estradiol induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms through which estrogens contribute to breast cancer development; identify and functionally characterize the genetic variants that determine susceptibility; and define the hormone-gene-environment interactions that influence development of mammary cancer in this physiologically relevant rat model. Female ACI rats are uniquely susceptible to development of mammary cancer when treated continuously with physiologic levels of 17beta-estradiol. Induction of mammary cancer in female ACI rats occurs through a mechanism that is largely dependent upon estrogen receptor-alpha. Interval mapping analyses of progeny generated in intercrosses between susceptible ACI rats and resistant Brown Norway (BN) rats revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL), designated Emca3 (Estrogen-induced mammary cancer) through Emca9, each of which harbors one or more genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility. Genes that reside within Emca8 on RNO5 and were differentially expressed between 17beta-estradiol treated ACI and ACI.BN-Emca8 congenic rats were identified as Emca8 candidates.

DESIGN
Two groups of 17beta-estradiol treated female rats were compared. Five ACI and five BN.ACI-Emca8 rats were treated with 17beta-estradiol for 12 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from the mammary glands of these animals, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). Significantly differentially expressed genes were found between these groups.
