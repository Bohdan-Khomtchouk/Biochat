TITLE
microRNA profiling in renal cell carcinoma subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal cell carcinoma is the most common neoplasm of the adult kidney. A few subtypes of RCC include papillary RCC (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chRCC) and the benign oncocytoma tumor. In some cases, distinguishing between the RCC subyptes is difficult. We performed a mircroRNA (miRNA) microarray to determine differential miRNA expression between pRCC, chRCC, and oncocytoma.

DESIGN
We performed a miRNA microarray on 10 tumor samples of each papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC), and oncocytoma.
