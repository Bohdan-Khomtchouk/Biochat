TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse uterine tissue from progesterone receptor-Cre knockout of Dicer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial-stromal interactions in the uterus are required for normal uterine functions such as pregnancy, and multiple signaling pathways are essential for this process. Although Dicer and microRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in several reproductive processes, the specific role of Dicer and miRNA in uterine development is not known. To address the roles of miRNA in the regulation of these key uterine pathways, we generated a conditional knockout (cKO) of Dicer in the postnatal uterine epithelium and stroma using progesterone receptor (PR)-Cre. These Dicer cKO are sterile with small uteri, which demonstrate significant defects including absence of glandular epithelium and enhanced stromal apoptosis, beginning at postnatal day 15 with expression of Cre and deletion of Dicer. Although these mice had normal serum steroid hormone levels, critical uterine signaling pathways, including progesterone-responsive genes, Indian hedgehog signaling, and the Wnt/Beta-catenin canonical pathway, were dysregulated at the mRNA level.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling data from pools of Dicer cKO and control uteri groups, at 15 days. two group comparison
