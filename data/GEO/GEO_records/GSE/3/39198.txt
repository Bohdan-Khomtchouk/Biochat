TITLE
Genome-scale methylome profiling of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation was analyzed in a large cohort of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCC/PGL). Consensus clustering identified 3 stable clusters significantly associated with expression subgroups, gene mutations, and clinical parameters.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from 145 fresh frozen PCC/PGL and 3 normal adrenal medulla samples were hybridized to Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation BeadChips.
