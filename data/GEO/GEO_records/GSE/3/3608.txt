TITLE
Renal medullary genes in salt-sensitive hypertension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Substitution of chromosome 13 from Brown Norway BN/SsNHsd/Mcw (BN/Mcw) rats into the Dahl salt-sensitive SS/JrHsd/Mcw (SS/Mcw) rats resulted in substantial reduction of blood pressure salt sensitivity in this consomic rat strain designated SSBN13. In the present study, we attempted to identify genes associated with salt-sensitive hypertension by utilizing a custom, known-gene cDNA microarray to compare the mRNA expression profiles in the renal medulla (a tissue playing a pivotal role in long-term blood pressure regulation) of SS/Mcw and SSBN13 rats on either low-salt (0.4% NaCl) or high-salt (4% NaCl, 2 wk) diets. Keywords: Dahl S rat; blood pressure; kidney; consomic rats
