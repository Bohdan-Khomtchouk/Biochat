TITLE
Acid Stress Increases Gene Expression of  Proinflammatory Cytokines in Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Metabolic acidosis exacerbates chronic kidney disease, in part, by stimulating renal endothelin production. To determine if acidosis alters expression of other genes, we examined the effect of exposure of MDCK cells to pH 7.4 and pH 7.0 for 24 hours on gene expression using a canine derived microarray.  Exposure to this pH stress for 24 hours led to increased expression of 278 genes (2.2% of the transcriptome) by at least two fold and 60 of these (21%) were upregulated by more than 3 fold. On the other hand, 186 genes (1.5% of the transcriptome) were down regulated by at least two fold and 16 of these (9%) were down regulated by 3 fold or more.  Ten percent of the genes upregulated by at least three fold encode proteins that are  pro-inflammatory cytokines, including colony stimulating factor 2, chemokine ligand 7, chemokine ligand 2 0, chemokine ligand 8, and interleukin 1Î±. Two others encode metallopeptidase . The most highly upregulated gene encodes a protein, lubricin, shown to be important in preventing cartilage damage and in tissue injury or repair.Upregulation of four genes were confirmed by qPCR. Housekeeping genes were not increased.

DESIGN
There were a total of three biological replicates, each containing one control (incubated at pH 7.4) and one acidic (pH 7.0) sample, whose RNA were extracted on different dates. Microarray studies performed on these six samples were done in duplicate.
