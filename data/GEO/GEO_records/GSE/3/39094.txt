TITLE
Colon tissue of Il10-/- mice monoassociated with Escherichia coli NC101 or Escherichia faecalis OG1RF (PAMM-073 array)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed that interleukin-10 knockout (Il10-/-) mice injected with azoxymethane (AOM) and monoassociated with E. coli NC101, but not E. faecalis OG1RF, develop tumors. Histologic inflammation is not different in mice monoassociated with either bacterium. The goal of this experiment is to assess inflammatory cytokine levels in colonic tissue of these mice.

DESIGN
4 germ-free Il10-/- mice were assayed and used as controls. 4 E. coli and 4 E. faecalis monoassociated mice were experimental samples.
