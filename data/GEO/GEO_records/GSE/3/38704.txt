TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by RORgamma in Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed significant growth inhibition of melanoma tumor in RORγ-/- mice, suggesting an important role for the T helper 17 cell (TH17) pathway in tumor immunity. Though RORgamma t (RORγt) plays a critical role in the development of IL-17-secreting Th17 cells, the role of other genes remained an open question. To explore the expression of unknown genes with anti-tumor properties, gene expression analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Sorted naïve TH cells (CD4+CD25-CD62Lhigh) from RORc+/+ and RORc-/-mice were differentiated under TH17 polarizing conditions. After 4 days, cells were harvested, RNA was isolated and gene expression analysis was performed.
