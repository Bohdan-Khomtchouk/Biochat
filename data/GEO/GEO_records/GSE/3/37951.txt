TITLE
Acute host transcriptonal response to r1918 influenza and r1918 influenza containing the NS1 gene from A/Texas/36/91 in A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The “Spanish influenza” of 1918 claimed an unprecedented number of lives, yet the determinants of virulence for this virus are still not fully understood. Here, we used functional genomics and an in vitro human lung epithelial cell infection model to define the global host transcriptional response to the eight-gene 1918 virus. To better understand the role of the 1918 virus NS1 gene, we also evaluated the host response to fully reconstructed 1918 and reassortant 1918 virus containing the NS1 gene from A/Texas/36/91 (a seasonal isolate of human influenza virus).

DESIGN
A549 cells were infected with either recombinant 1918 influenza, a chimeric virus that contained seven genes from recombinant 1918 and the NS1 from A/Texas/36/91 (Tx/91), or mock. Cells were harvested for microarray analysis at 2, 6, and 24hr following infection.
