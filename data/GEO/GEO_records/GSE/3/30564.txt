TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in lymph nodes and vaccination site in mice vaccinated with adenovirus and MVA mixed formulations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in lymph nodes and site of injection (intradermal) after vaccination with adenovirus (Ad), modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) or a mixed formulation of Ad+MVA. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that co-administration of two viral vectors induce a differential gene expression in the site of vaccination (dermis) and the draining lymph nodes that ultimately influences the protective ability of a vaccine against pre-erythrocytic malaria.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the vaccination site (dermis) and lymph nodes after vaccination with adenovirus, MVA or Ad+MVA mixed co-administration after 6h and 24h (ear biopsies) and 9h, 24h and 72h for lymph nodes. Differential gene expression was assessed between vaccinated and non-immunized mice. Four ear biopsy samples did not pass quality control, and are not included in this submission.
