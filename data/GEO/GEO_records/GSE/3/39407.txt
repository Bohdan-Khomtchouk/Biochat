TITLE
Transcriptional profile of sustained ligand-activated preconditioning in pre- and post-ischemic myocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of left venticular myocardium following morphine-induced sustained ligand activated preconditioning (SLP). Results provide insight into the molecular pathways affected by morphine-induced SLP in the pre- and post-ischemic heart.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated ventricular myocardium subjected to 5 days of morphine induced sustained ligand activated preconditioning (SLP) compared to placebo control ventricular myocardium, tissue collected pre- and post-ischemia (n=6/group).
