TITLE
MJAY analysis of vestibular macula RNA obtained from Bronx waltzer and control mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The spontaneous mutant Bronx waltzer (bv) mouse line is characterized by deafness and balance defect. We located the bv mutation to the Srrm4 gene which encodes a regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We found that Srrm4 is expressed in balance and hearing organs (i.e. in the vestibular maculas and the cochlea). Srrm4 is also expressed in the central nervous system including the cerebellum. To identify potential splicing defects in bv/bv mice, we analyzed RNA samples from the vestibular maculas and cerebellums of bv/bv mice and control (bv/+) littermates, using mouse exon junction microarrays (MJAY). In this dataset, we include probe-set level data obtained from vestibular macula samples. The processed data represent probe-set intensities that have been normalized to gene expression levels (Inorm). Inorm was calculated using batch-corrected data as well as data that were not corrected for a batch effect.

DESIGN
7 total samples were analyzed: vestibular maculas from 4 heterozygous (bv/+) and 3 homozygous (bv/bv) mouse embryos at E16.5.
