TITLE
Differential expression of miRNA in stretched rat alveolar epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cyclic stretch of alveoli is characteristic of mechanical ventilation, and is postulated to be partly responsible for the lung injury and inflammation in ventilator induced lung injury. We propose that miRNAs may regulate some of the stretch response and, therefore, hypothesized that miRNAs would be differentially expressed between stretched and unstretched rat alveolar epithelial cells (RAECs).
