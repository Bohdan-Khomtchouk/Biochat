TITLE
Expression Profiles of HepG2 cells treated with following oxidants: 100µM menadione, 200µM TBH or 50µM H2O2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by 100µM menadione, 200µM TBH or 50µM H2O2 after treatment for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24h.

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24h hours of exposure to 100µM menadione, 200µM TBH or 50µM H2O2 and medium without compound. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 126 arrays.
