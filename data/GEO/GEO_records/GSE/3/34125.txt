TITLE
Expression data from murine beta thalassemia erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study analyzes gene expression in beta-thalassemic fetal liver erythroblasts in the Th3 murine model. FACS-purified wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous stage-matched erythroblasts from E14.5 fetal livers are compared.

DESIGN
We used FACS to purify CD71+Ter119+FSChigh matched populations from E14.5 fetal livers of wild-type, Th3/+, and Th3/Th3 embryos
