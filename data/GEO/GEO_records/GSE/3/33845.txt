TITLE
dcEF-regulated gene expression of human lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Highly metastatic cancer cells have been observed to move directionally in response to direct current (dc) electric fields (EFs) of physiological strength. The phenomenon, which is called electrotaxis or galvanotaxis, suggests the involvement of physiological EF in cancer metastasis. To explore this conjecture, we compared the influence of dcEF on gene expressions of a highly invasive (CL1-5) and a low invasive (CL1-0) lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Gene expression of human lung cancer cells with (experimental samples) or without (control samples) dcEF stimulation in physiological strength was analyzed. Two cell lines, CL1-0 and CL1-5, were treated with the same condition and compared in this study. Each condition has three biological replicates for each cell line.
