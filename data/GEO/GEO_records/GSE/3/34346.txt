TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of physiological pathways in a generalist herbivore: responses to different host plants and plant structures by the cotton bollworm (CBW) Helicoverpa armigera [DifferentHost]

ORGANISM
Helicoverpa armigera

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing gut tissue from fifth instar larvae exposed to six different diets, namely cotton fruit or boll (B), tobacco flower bud (TFB), bean pod (BP), chick pea fruit (CKPF), pinto bean-based artificial diet (PB) and wheat-based artificial Lepidoptera diet (BIO). The generalist lepidopteran herbivore Helicoverpa armigera can feed on more than 87 plant species belonging to 48 families. However, life table studies on different crops have revealed that cotton and corn are the most suitable hosts of this pest and tomato, hot pepper and tobacco are suboptimal.  It is believed that generalists owe their success to the deployment of various members of multigene families of detoxicative and digestive enzymes, a strategy that may also be responsible for rapid evolution of insecticide resistance.  However studies of generalist adaptations have been limited to specific genes or gene families, and an overview of how these adaptations are orchestrated at the transcriptional level is lacking. We compared the transcript profiles of larval guts in response to differentially suitable hosts and towards two different artificial diets commonly used for laboratory rearing of this species, using a two-color alternating loop design microarray experiment.

DESIGN
Two-color alternating loop design. Biological replicates: 4 (10 individuals per replicate). 24 samples total.
