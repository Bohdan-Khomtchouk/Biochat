TITLE
Copy number variation profiling of gastric tissues: Cancer Samples vs. Matched Adjacent Noncancerous Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number variation profiling of gastric tissues comparing gastric cancer tissues with matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. Goal was to determine the effects of chromosomal imbalances on gene expression and carcinogenesis or progression.
