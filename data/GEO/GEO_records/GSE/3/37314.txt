TITLE
Androgen receptor-independent function of FoxA1 in prostate cancer metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FoxA1 has been shown critical for prostate development and prostate-specific gene expression regulation. In addition to its well-established role as an AR pioneering factor,several studies have recently revealed significant AR binding events in prostate cancer cells with FoxA1 knockdown. Furthermore, the role of FoxA1 itself in prostate cancer has not been carefully examined.  Thus, it is important to understand the role of FoxA1 in prostate cancer and how it interacts with AR signaling. To address these questions, we generated engineered LNCaP cells with  FoxA1 knockdown using shRNA or siRNA, 22RV1 cells with stable FoxA1 knockdown and PC3M cells with FoxA1 stable overexpression.  We performed microarray analysis of these cells.
