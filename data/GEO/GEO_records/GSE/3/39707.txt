TITLE
Zebrafish whole embryos at 36 hpf treated with DMSO or 5uM 11,12-EET

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In our previous study, we found zebrafish embryos treated with 5uM 11,12-EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) had increased stem cell marker, runx1, expression in the AGM. EET also induced ectopic runx1 expression in the tail. To systematically study how EET regulates gene expression, we performed microarray analysis on EET-treated embryos. Zebrafish whole embryos were synchronized at fertilization. Embryos were grown at 28 degree overnight. 25 embryos per group were treated with DMSO or 5uM 11,12-EET starting from 24 hpf (hour post fertilization) until 36 hpf at 28 degree. The triplicates were from three different clutches of embryos, and split into DMSO v.s. EET for each clutch.

DESIGN
EET vs. DMSO
