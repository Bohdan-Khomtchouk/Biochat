TITLE
Influence of RNA Labeling on Expression Profiling of MicroRNAs

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Several technical parameters are now being optimized for microRNA expression profiling experiments, but the finite amount of total RNA available continues to bottleneck clinical investigations. We used microarrays to determine the influence of the labeling reagent on total RNA requirements and data quality.
