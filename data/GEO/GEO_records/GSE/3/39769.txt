TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures in testis for plin1-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the effect of plin1 on gene expression during testis development. Testis of day 21, day 40, and day 60 in plin1-null mice and wild type mice were analyzed. Expression of a list genes (including cyp51, prm1, tnp2) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the influence of plin1 on testis development.

DESIGN
plin1 knockout alteration gene expression in mice testis was measured at different development phases: day 21 meiosis phase, day 40 puberty phase, and day 60 mature phase. There independent experiments were performed at each time (d21, d40, d60).
