TITLE
Expression data from normal human and unstable angina patient.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
20 patients with unstable angina were divided into patient group by using coronary angiography. The sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were enrolled as control group. Venous bloods were collected for extracting RNA.

DESIGN
We used the Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 genechip produced by Affymetrix to detail the global gene expression in blood sample from normal human and unstable angina patient.  1 control and 2 test samples.
