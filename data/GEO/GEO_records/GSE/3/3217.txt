TITLE
Gene expression profiling in skeletal muscle after the intramuscular administration of a pharmaceutical vehicle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of this work was to identify genes with a variable expression profile during the course of a skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration damage in pig. Using cDNA microarrays and repeated measurements performed in the same ten piglets, the expression profile of 1651 genes was investigated at 0, 6 and 48 hours, then 7 and 21 days after the induction of a local iatrogenic muscle damage. The main variations in gene expression were seen within the first 2 days after the induction of the muscle damage. However, among the 81 theoretically possible patterns of gene expression profiles, only 14 were found to occur. Finally, from the whole data analysis, eight genes with the best discriminant power have been highlighted from 2 patterns of gene expression profiles: two of those genes were up regulated at 6 hours whereas the remaining 6 genes were up regulated toward the end of the muscle damage kinetic.
