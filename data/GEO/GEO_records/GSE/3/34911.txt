TITLE
Characterization of T-rapamycin cells by gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of CD4+ T cells cultured in vitro in presence of IL-2, IL-4, Rapamycin for 12 days Sources tested: Day 0 CD4+ T cells (6 samples), Day 6 T-rapamycin cells (6 samples), Day 12 T-rapamycin cells (6 samples)

DESIGN
3 time points were compared: day 0 (cells before start the culture), Day 6 and Day 12 (cells at the end of the culture)
