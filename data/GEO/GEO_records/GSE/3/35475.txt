TITLE
Identification of DNA methylation differences correlated with transcriptional divergence between humans and chimpanzees in chromosomes 21 and 22

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While some studies have reported gene expression differences between humans and chimpanzees, the mechanisms underlying such changes remain poorly understood.  To address this issue, we examined, by MeDIP-chip, DNA methylation patterns of peripheral blood cells from age- and sex- matched human and chimpanzee individuals.  Our analysis identified some differentially methylated regions between the two species and suggests that changes in DNA methylation pattern are involved in the diversification of transcriptome during evolution.
