TITLE
Derivation of rat induced pluripotent stem cells that share similarities with embryonic stem cells using a transposon system

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells have attracted enormous attention due to their vast potential in regenerative medicine, pharmaceutical screening and basic research. The majority of prior established rat IPS cells were generated from somatic cells by retroviral and lentiviral transduction with expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc and using chemical inhibitors of key differentiation pathways. A major difficulty in the application of this technology is the efficient delivery of reprogramming factors and the long-term maintenance of properties of stem cells. Here, we employed the PiggyBac (PB) transposon carrying four 2A peptide-linked reprogramming factors for generating rat IPS cells. These stable rat IPS cells are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, teratoma formation, expression characteristic pluripotency markers, developmental potential, and germline transmission. Transcriptional profiling of the IPS cells revealed both pathways in common with ES cells from rat and unique signaling pathway to our cells, including Wnt, TGF and Notch. The cell lines and information obtained in this study will accelerate our understanding of the molecular regulation underlying germline pluripotency and pave the way for exploration of cell-based therapies using the rat.

DESIGN
To compare the gene expression profiling between rat IPS cells and ES cells to show if the rat IPS cells had been reprogrammed into pluripotent status like rat ES cells at the gene expression level.
