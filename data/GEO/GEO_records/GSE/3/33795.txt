TITLE
P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) schizonts untreated control vs P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) reference RNA pool

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Calcium is a universal second messenger molecule which plays a significant role in several biological processes. Presence of calcium sensors (calmodulins) and calcium-dependent protein kinases in Plasmodium species suggests an important role of calcium-dependent signaling pathways in the regulation of cellular processes in the malaria parasites. Evidence for the transcriptional response of control Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages not treated with the calcium ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin has been presented here.
