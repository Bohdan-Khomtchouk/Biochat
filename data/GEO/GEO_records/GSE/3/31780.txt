TITLE
Mouse kidney arteriolar smooth muscle cells derived from the renin cell lineage: control vs. forskolin treatment to induce renin expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of mouse kidney arteriolar smooth muscle cells (aSMCs) of the renin lineage comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with forskolin to induce renin expression.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: control untreated aSMCs vs forskolin treated aSMCs; Biological replicates: control 3, treated 3; independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
