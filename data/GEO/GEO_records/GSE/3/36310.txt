TITLE
Tissue specific Pol II Chip-Seq in the early fly embryo

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to idetify paused promoters in vivo, we performed tissue specific Pol II Chip-seq using mutant embryos for the dorsal gradient. We used two population of cells, either dorsal ectoderm cells (gd7 embryos) or mesodermal cells (Toll10b) embryos.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for Pol II in various Drosophila embryos
