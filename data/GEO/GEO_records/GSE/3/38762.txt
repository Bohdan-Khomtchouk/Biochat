TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling In Murine Retina Neovascularization Models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to find out the vital genes during retinal neovascularization (RNV), we set up OIR (oxygen-induced retinopathy; induced with 75%Â±2% oxygen) and wild-type C57BL/6J murine models. We observed the retinal vascular growth process daily both in OIR and wild-type mice through retinal flat-mount, and isolated total retinal RNA at different time points (P8, P9, P12, P13, P30) both in OIR and wild-type mice for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
At least three different retinae were accessed at each time point for observing the retinal vascular growth process. Ten neural retinae from five mice were harvested and pooled into one sample for gene expression analysis. Three biological replicates were used for each time point. Dye-swaps were performed.
