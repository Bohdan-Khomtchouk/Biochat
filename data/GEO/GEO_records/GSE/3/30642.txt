TITLE
Mouse Macrophage Cells: Control vs. Burkholderia pseudomallei infected cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse macrophage cells comparing control untreated cells with macrophage cells infected with Burkeholderia pseudomallei.  Goal was to determine the effects of bacterial infection on global macrophage gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, macrophage vs. infected macrophage cells.
