TITLE
LPS treatment of RAW2647 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are central players in the immune response and manifest divergent phenotypes to control inflammation and innate immunity. Signaling factors are traditionally recognized as the stimuli governing macrophage functions. In recent years, metabolism’s importance has been reemphasized as critical signaling and regulatory pathways of human diseases and processes, ranging from cancer to aging, often converge on metabolic responses. In this study, we assessed metabolic features that play critical roles in macrophage function. We constructed a genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line, an oft-used in vitro model. We determined immunomodulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (e.g., glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (e.g., tryptophan and vitamin D3) were amongst the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms linked critical suppressive effectors were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for nucleotide synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate how metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation can be identified by analyzing multi-omic data of LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our predictions. Our study demonstrates metabolism’s role in regulating macrophage activation may be greater than previously anticipated.

DESIGN
The RAW 264.7 (ATTC) cell line was stimulated for 24 hours with LPS. Treated cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS and harvested for high-throughput analyses. Labeled cDNA was prepared as described (Jones et al. 2010). A mixture Cy3-labeled control cDNA and Cy5-labeled were hybridized to Agilent Mouse GE 4x44K v2 Microarray (Agilent Technologies) and processed. Image analysis and intra-chip normalization were performed with Feature Extraction 9.5.3.1 (Agilent). Data were analyzed with MeV (tm4.org) or with custom python scripts
