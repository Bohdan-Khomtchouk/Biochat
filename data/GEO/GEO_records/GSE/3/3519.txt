TITLE
Molecular Conservation of Zebrafish and Human Liver Tumors.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish has been advocated as a cancer model, but little is known about the molecular similarities between zebrafish and human tumors. Comparative analysis of microarray data from zebrafish liver tumors with those from four human tumor types revealed molecular conservation at various levels between fish and human tumors. This approach provides a useful strategy for identifying expression signature that is strongly associated with a disease phenotype. Keywords: Diseased vs normal.
