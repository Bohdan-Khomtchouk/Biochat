TITLE
Ethanol-response genes and their regulation

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The nematode shows responses to acute ethanol exposure that are similar to those observed in humans, mice, and Drosophila, namely hyperactivity followed by uncoordination and sedation. We used in this report the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to identify and characterize the genes that are affected by ethanol exposure and to link those genes functionally into an ethanol-induced gene network. By analyzing the expression profiles of all C. elegans ORFs using microarrays, we identified 230 genes affected by ethanol. While the ethanol response of some of the identified genes was significant at early time points, that of the majority was at late time points, indicating that the genes in the latter case might represent the physiological consequence of the ethanol exposure. We further characterized the early response genes that may represent those involved directly in the ethanol response. These genes included many heat shock protein genes, indicating that high concentration of ethanol acts as a strong stress to the animal. Interestingly, we identified two non-heat-shock protein genes that were specifically responsive to ethanol. glr-2 was the only glutamate receptor gene to be induced by ethanol. T28C12.4, which encodes a protein with limited homology to human neuroligin, was also specific to ethanol stress. Finally, by analyzing the promoter regions of the early response genes, we identified a regulatory element, TCTGCGTCTCT, that was necessary for the expression of subsets of ethanol response genes.
