TITLE
Immune related gene expression comparison between human CD14+ HLA-DR-neg/low MDSC vs CD14+ HLA-DR-high control monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) is a heterogeneous population of cells that can negatively regulate T-cell function. As opposed to murine MDSC, which are characterized as Gr-1+CD11b+ cells, human MDSC are not so clearly defined due to lack of specific markers. Our lab has previously identified a new subset of MDSC as CD14+HLA-DR-neg/low cells from PBMC. CD14+HLA-DR-neg/low MDSC not only suppress proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion of autologous T cells, but also induce CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells that are suppressive in vitro, whereas the counterpart CD14+HLA-DR-high monocytes donâ€™t have the effect. In this study, we compare the immune-related gene expression between CD14+HLA-DR-neg/low MDSC and CD14+HLA-DR-high monocytes to better characterize the difference between these two populations and to find new potential specific marker for human MDSC.

DESIGN
PBMC were isolated from fresh blood healthy donor by density centrifugation. CD14+ cells were isolated by AutoMACS CD14 microbeads using a AutoMACS (Miltenyi), and then stained with CD14 and HLA-DR antibodies. MDSC and monocytes control cells were sorted as CD14+ HLA-DR-neg/low and CD14+HLA-DR-high cells respectively.  The sorted two populations were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped to the company on dry ice for RNA isolation and further microarray.
