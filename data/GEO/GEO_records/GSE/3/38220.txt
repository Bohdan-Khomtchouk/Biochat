TITLE
Response of Porphyromonas gingivalis to nitrosative stress

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of P. gingivalis cells comparing cells grown in anaerobic conditions to cells grown in anaerobic conditions and exposed to nitrite and to GSNO.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, anaerobically vs. anaerobically exposed to nitrosative stress cells. Biological replicates: 1 independently grown and harvested bacterial cells for each nitrosative exposure tested.  Four technical replicates for each experiment.
