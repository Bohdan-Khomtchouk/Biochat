TITLE
Comparative genomic analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans of JP2 and non-JP2 genotypes using a pan-genome microarray

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

SUMMARY
To assess the performance of our custom-designed pan-genome microarray and characterize the differences in gene content between JP2 and non-JP2 genotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans.

DESIGN
Comparative genomic hybridization reactions were carried out to assess the performance of our pan-genome microarray by using genomic DNA of 11 previously sequenced Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains (I23C, SCC1398, ANH9381, HK1651, D7S-1, D11S-1, I63B, SCC393, D18P-1, SCC2302, and D17P-2). The microarray was subsequently used for comparative genomic hybridization of 6 strains  of JP2 (S067, A26, G111-1, G121-2, D41S-1, and HK1651) and 6 strains non-JP2 (I23C, SCC1398, ANH9381, ATCC29524, 194, and G104-2) genotypes of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Two biological duplicates were carried out for each strain.
