TITLE
Expression analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans wild type (JP2) vs. Mlc deletion mutant both grown aerobically and anaerobically

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651

SUMMARY
The goal of this analysis is to define the aerobic and anaerobic regulons for the transcription factor Mlc (Makes Large Colonies) in the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The objectives were met by comparing the mRNA profile of a wild type strain, JP2, to that of an isogenic mutant deleted of the Mlc gene. Both strains were grown aerobically and anaerobically. The results show that Mlc is involved in the regulation of dozens of genes in both growth conditions.
