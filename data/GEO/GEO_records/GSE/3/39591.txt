TITLE
Tumoral transcriptome profiling of tPTEN-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
tPTEN-/- mice display a deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene specifically in T cells (cross PTEN flox/flox x lck-Cre). They develop T cell lymphoma with a primary thymic tumor and invasion of most organ at late stage of the disease.

DESIGN
Gene profiling was performed on whole tumors (ST3 stage 3 invasive lymphoma) and normal thymocytes (wt) using Affymetrix-MoGene-1_0-st-v1 chips.
