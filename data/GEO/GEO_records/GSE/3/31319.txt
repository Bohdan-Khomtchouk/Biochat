TITLE
Murine Myoblast C2C12 Cells: Control vs. Mybbp1a Knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse myoblast cells comparing control vs. Mybbp1a knockdown. Stable clones of C2C12 cells harboring control or Mybbp1a-targeting shRNA were established and further pooled for analysis. Goal was to determine, based on the effects of Mybbp1a depletion on global gene expression, candidate downstream target genes of Mybbp1a, a putative transcriptional co-repressor.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. Mybbp1a knockdown C2C12 cells (mixed stable clones). Biological replicates: 2.
