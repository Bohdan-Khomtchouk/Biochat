TITLE
Development of miRNA expression signatures of MEFs deficient in a ER stress mediator ATF6b for tunicamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further development of our miRNA expression approach to ER stress, we have employed miRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify ER stress-responsible ones.   Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in a ER stress mediator ATF6b were treated with tunicamycin for 12 or 24 hrs. miRNAs responsible for tunicamycin-treatment for 12hrs in ATF6b-dependent manner were extracted. Among them, expression of three miRNAs (miR-15b, miR-20b, miR-92a) was quantified in the RNA samples from  the same as the microarray by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in a ER stress mediator ATF6b were treated with 2ug/mL tunicamycin for 12 or 24 hrs. Two independent experiments were performed at each time (untreated, 12 or 24 hrs). miRNAs responsible for tunicamycin-treatment for 12hrs in ATF6b-dependent manner were extracted.
