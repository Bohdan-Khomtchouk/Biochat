TITLE
Gene expression profiling of oral cancer cell lines with or without AzC treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To genome-wide screening for the genes whose expression are responsible for the promoter DNA methylation, we performed the cDNA microarray with oral cancer cells before and after a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine (AzC), treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from four oral cancer cell lines before or after AzC treatment.
