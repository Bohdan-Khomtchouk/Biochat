TITLE
Transcriptome Atlases Of Mouse Brain Reveals Differential Expression Across Brain Regions And Genetic Backgrounds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assessed steady-state transcription in whole brain and two more specific brain regions. Studied the impact of strain genetic background on expression levels. In addition, we also studied the effects of acute clozapine exposure on gene expression in mouse brain.

DESIGN
We analysed brain samples from adult male mice (forebrain, hindbrain and whole brain) contrasting the effects of strain (C57BL/6J versus NOD/ShiLtJ) and acute drug treatment vehicle) with four mice per cell (16 mice in total).
