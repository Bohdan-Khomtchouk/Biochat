TITLE
Langerhans dendritic cell differentiation and TGFbeta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes with a potential role in Langerhans dendritic cell differentiation, progenitor cells from human cord blood were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip U133Plus 2.0 microarray profiling

DESIGN
Human CD34+CD45Rahi hematopoietic progenitor cells were cultured for 2 days in GM-CSF, FLT3L, SCF and TNFa before TGFbeta was added or not. RNA was analyzed at 0h, 6h and 24h relative to addition of TGFbeta. Total RNA from 6 independent donors was isolated and combined into two separate pools (A and B), each containing RNA from 3 different donors.
