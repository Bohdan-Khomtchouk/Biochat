TITLE
mRNA decapping factors and the exonuclease Xrn2 function in widespread premature termination of RNA polymerase II transcription

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a function of human mRNA decapping factors in control of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Decapping proteins Edc3, Dcp1a and Dcp2 and the termination factor TTF2 co-immunoprecipitate with Xrn2, the nuclear 5'-3' exonuclease  torpedo that facilitates transcription termination at the 3' ends of genes. Dcp1a, Xrn2 and TTF2 localize near transcription start sites (TSSs) by ChIP-Seq. At genes with 5' peaks of paused pol II, knockdown of decapping or termination factors, Xrn2 and TTF2, shifted polymerase away from the TSS toward upstream and downstream distal positions. This re-distribution of pol II is similar in magnitude to that caused by depletion of the elongation factor Spt5. We propose that coupled decapping of nascent transcripts and premature termination by the  torpedo  mechanism is a widespread mechanism that limits bidirectional pol II elongation. Regulated co-transcriptional decapping near promoter-proximal pause sites followed by premature termination could control productive pol II elongation.

DESIGN
RNA pol II (GSE30895: GSM766171), Xrn2, TTF2 and Dcp1a were localized by ChIP-Seq in HeLa cells. RNA pol II was localized in control HEK293 cells and cells infected with lentiviruses expressing a scrambled control shRNA (scr), and shRNAs targeting the following proteins: Xrn2, TTF2, Xrn2+TTF2, Edc3, Dcp1a, and Dcp2.
