MOG-encoding DNA vaccines ameliorate EAE and display neuroprotective effects in treated mice summary

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vaccination with naked DNA encoding myelin basic protein represents a promising therapeutic strategy in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we assessed the potential of vaccination with a DNA construct coding for the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an important candidate autoantigen in MS, to induce tolerance and protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Herein, we demonstrated that MOG-DNA vaccination reduced the clinical and histopathological signs of EAE when administered in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Further mechanistic experiments revealed that the protective effects of MOG-DNA vaccines were associated with a reduction of antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 cellular immune responses and expansion of regulatory T cells in periphery, and up-regulation in the central nervous system of genes encoding neurotrophic factors and proteins involved in remyelination. These results may set the rationale for the use of MOG-based DNA vaccines to induce tolerance in MS patients.

DESIGN
We analyzed brain and spinal cord samples from five treated and five control mice
