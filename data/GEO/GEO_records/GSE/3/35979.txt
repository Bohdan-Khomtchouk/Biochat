TITLE
Gene expression data from IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation of mice lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway condition with a strong genetic and inheritability component, as siblings and first-degree relatives of those with the disease are often affected. For our studies, we used a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of allergic airway inflammation induced by IL13. In this model, IL13 is conditionally overexpressed in the mouse lung when treated with doxycycline. Upon IL13 induction, these mice showed inflammatory cell infiltration, pronounced emphysema, increased pulmonary compliance, lung volume enlargement, mucus metaplasia, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins in the lung. We performed gene expression microarray to examine the changes in gene expression during IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation.

DESIGN
The CC10-rtTA-IL13 transgenic (TG) and wildtype (WT) mice were treated with doxycycline for seven days. Mice were euthanized and the left upper lobes from all mice were removed for RNA extraction using the TRIzol method.
