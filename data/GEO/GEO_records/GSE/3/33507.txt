TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of 7 tissues of S. lycopersicum and 2 of its closely related wild ancestor S. pimpinellifolium

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of 7 tissues of commercial tomato (S. lycopersicum cv MoneyMaker) and its wild red-fruited ancestor (S. pimpinellifolium LA0722) genotypes performed to assess expression level of tomato transcriptome and to aid whole genome annotation. Sequencing of fruit at 3 different developmental stages will help to assess gene regulation through ripening.
