TITLE
Expression data from injected mice overexpressing TFEB specifically in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of transcription factor EB (TFEB) overexpression on the liver transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip hybridization experiments on injected mice overexpressing TFEB specifically in the liver.

DESIGN
For the analysis of the injected mice overexpressing TFEB, total RNA was extracted from the liver of three mice. RNA extracted from the liver of 3 not-injected mice was used as a control.
