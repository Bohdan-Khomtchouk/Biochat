TITLE
Deep subcutaneous adipose tissue (dSAT) vs. superficial subcutaneous adipose (sSAT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In addition to total body fat, the regional distribution and inflammatory status of enlarged adipose tissue are strongly linked to metabolic and cardiovascular complications of obesity. We recently showed that the severity of liver non-alcoholic histopathology in obese subjects increased with the amounts of macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), while no relation was found with the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). In the abdominal region, SAT is anatomically divided into superficial (sSAT) and deep (dSAT) layers. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these distinct compartments differentially contribute to hepatic alteration in obesity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from two different strata of human adipose tissue of 8 subjects.
