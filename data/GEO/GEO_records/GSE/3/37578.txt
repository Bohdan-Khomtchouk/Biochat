TITLE
Epigenetic alterations of a DNMT3B-mutant ICF patient at base-pair resolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is associated with mutation of the DNA methyl-transferase DNMT3B, resulting in a reduction of enzyme activity. Aberrant expression of immune system genes and hypomethylation of pericentromeric regions accompanied by chromosomal instability were determined as alterations driving the disease phenotype. However, so far only technologies capable of analyzing single loci were applied to determine epigenetic alterations in ICF patients. In the current study, we performed whole-genome bisulphite sequencing to assess alteration in DNA methylation at base-pair resolution.

DESIGN
Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing was performed to assess alteration in DNA methylation of one ICF patient and one healthy control sample at base-pair resolution.
