TITLE
Array CGH analysis of human colorectal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The concept of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal cancers (CRCs) is widely accepted, though the timing of its occurrence and its interaction with other genetic defects early during carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Our aim was to uncover the molecular evolution of CIMP CRCs through integrative analysis of endoscopic, histological and molecular signatures in precancerous and malignant colorectal lesions.

DESIGN
A total of 84 endoscopically obtained human colorectal tumor was analyzed using Agilent CGH microarray. Copy number aberration was compared with clinicopathological features and DNA methylation status.
