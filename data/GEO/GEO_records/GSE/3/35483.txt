TITLE
Profiling DNA copy number alterations of myxofibrosarcomas with NimbleGen array CGH chips

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterized by a wide histological spectrum, myxofibrosarcoma ranges from deceptively bland-appearing lesions to frankly pleomorphic sarcomas, representing a suitable model to elucidate the molecular aberrations in multistep disease progression. To explore cancer-associated genes of myxofibrosarcoma, ultrahigh-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used to profile DNA copy number alterations in myxofibrosarcoma tumor samples and cell lines.

DESIGN
Along with normal reference DNA, 12 tumor samples and 3 cell lines (NMFH-1, OH931, and NMFH2) of human myxofibrosarcoma were extracted for genomic DNAs, which were subjected to manufacturer's (NimbleGen, Inc.) outsourcing service of DNA labeling, hybridization, and normalization of data obtained from 385K or 720K oligonucleotide array CGH chips.
