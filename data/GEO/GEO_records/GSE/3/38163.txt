SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly ( ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track displays a chromatin state segmentation for each of nine human cell types ( ). A common set of states across the cell types were learned by computationally integrating ChIP-seq data for nine factors plus input ( ) using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In total, fifteen states were used to segment the genome, and these states were then grouped and colored to highlight predicted functional elements.
