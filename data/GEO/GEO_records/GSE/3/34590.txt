TITLE
The Enterococcus faecalis V583 transcriptional profile during survival within macrophages

ORGANISM
Bacillus anthracis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E. faecalis V583 during intracellular survival compared to V583 grown to mid-log phase (OD 600 = 0.05) in THB + 1% glucose. In this study we report the complete intracellular E. faecalis V583 transcriptome following infection of RAW264.7 macrophages.  During intracellular survival, approximately 45% of the V583 genome was differentially regulated including numerous genes involved in the oxidative stress, heat shock and SOS responses.  We observed that the E. faecalis-containing phagosome was limited for glycolytic substrates, nucleotides, amino acids and numerous ions necessary for growth and protein function.   Approximately 35% of the genes differentially regulated during survival within macrophages were of hypothetical/unknown function, suggesting that the V583 response to phagocytosis involves many previously unstudied loci.  Here, we provide the first comprehensive study elucidating the transcriptional response of E. faecalis to phagocytosis, which may provide new targets for future studies.â€ƒ
