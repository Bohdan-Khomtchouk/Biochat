Transcription Factor Binding Sites by ChIP-seq from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale

ORGANISM
Mouse ENCODE

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Philip Cayting ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Each experiment is associated with an input signal, which represents the control condition where immunoprecipitation with non-specific immunoglobulin was performed in the same cell type. For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for TF binding (Signal), along with sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding, as identified by the PeakSeq algorithm (Peaks). The sequence reads, quality scores, and alignment coordinates from these experiments are available for download. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
