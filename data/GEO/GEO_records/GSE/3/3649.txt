TITLE
Individuality and variation in gene expression patterns in human blood.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We carried out a survey of the variation in gene expression patterns in the blood of healthy individuals, by using cDNA microarrays.  Our results revealed a surprising consistency in these patterns, but also evidence of distinct patterns of interindividual and temporal variation.  Some features of variation in the expression patterns were associated with differences in the cellular composition of the blood sample, with gender, age, and time of day.  These results expand our understanding of human variation and hematological physiology and provide a genome-wide molecular portrait of a healthy human tissue. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
