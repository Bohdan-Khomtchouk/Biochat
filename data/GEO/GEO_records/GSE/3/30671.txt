TITLE
Comparison of Differences in Mouse Mammary gland gene expression data at POSTNATAL DAY 70 in Akt1wildtype versus Akt1-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Akt1, a serine-threonine protein kinase member of the PKB/Akt gene family, plays a critical role in the regulation of several cellular processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we utilized Akt1+/+ and Akt1Â¬-/- C57/Bl6 female mice to demonstrate that Akt1 is required for normal mammary gland postnatal development and homeostasis. Akt1 deficiency resulted in severely delayed postnatal mammary gland growth as well as a significant decrease in the number of terminal end buds during puberty. Adult Akt1-/- mammary glands exhibited significantly fewer alveolar buds coupled with a significant increase in epithelial cell apoptosis compared to their wild-type counterparts. Microarray analysis revealed that Akt1 deficiency resulted in several altered gene expression changes and biological processes in adult mammary glands, including organismal development, cell death, and tissue morphology. Of particular importance, a significant decrease in expression of Btn1a1, a gene involved in milk lipid secretion, was observed in Akt1-/- mammary glands by both microarray and RT-PCR validation.

DESIGN
wild type mammary glands from 3 mice and Akt1-deficient mammary glands from 3 mice were analyzed for differences in gene expression at postnatal day 70
