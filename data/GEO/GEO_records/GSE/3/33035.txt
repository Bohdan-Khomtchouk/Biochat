TITLE
argR1-ahrC mutant compared to D39 wild-type in Streptococcus pneumoniae in CDM + 10 mM arginine

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
Comparison of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 argR1-ahrC mutant compared to D39 wild type in CDM with 10 mM arginine to define the regulons of the ArgR1 and AhrC regulators under this condition. Details described in Kloosterman TG and Kuipers OP. ArgR1 and AhrC Mediate Arginine-Dependent Regulation of Arginine Acquisition- and Virulence Genes in the Human Pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. JBC 2011

DESIGN
One condition design comparison of two strains including a dye swap
