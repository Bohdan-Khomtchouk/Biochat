TITLE
The effect on gene expression by the knockdown of lincRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect on gene expression by lincRNAs, we knocked down three lincRNAs and evaluated the gene expression by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in Hep3B cells transfected with siRNAs targeting the indicated lincRNAs or negative control siRNA and infected with adenovirus expressing p53 (Ad-p53) or LacZ (Ad-LacZ).
