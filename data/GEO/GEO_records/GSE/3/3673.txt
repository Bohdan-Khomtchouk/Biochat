TITLE
Comparison of testes gene expression of D. melanogaster species and their hybrids

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Males hybrids from the crosses between species of the D. simulans clade are steriles as the females are fertiles. Hybrid male sterility is due to severe defects in spermatogenesis and phenotypic differences are observed between the different hybrids involving D. simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana. In this study we are comparing gene expression in the testes of hybrids involving the female D. simulans and the males D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana, or D. sechellia to the gene expression in species testes. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization
