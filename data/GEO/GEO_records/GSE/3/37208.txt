TITLE
Effect of CTHRC1 knockdown on gene expression of HCCLM3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) has been found to be up-regulated in many human solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the changes of gene expression by comparing CTHRC1-siRNA and Scramble-siRNA control in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM3, which has high expression levels of CTHRC1.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression was assessed by Affymetrix microarray experiments for 2 samples: CTHRC1-siRNA-treated HCCLM3 cells and Scramble-siRNA-treated HCCLM3 cells.
