TITLE
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis on microarray data from subregions of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) basal ganglia

ORGANISM
Taeniopygia guttata

SUMMARY
Similarities between speech and birdsong make songbirds advantageous for investigating the neurogenetics of learned vocal communication; a complex phenotype likely supported by ensembles of interacting genes in cortico-basal ganglia pathways of both species. To date, only FoxP2 has been identified as critical to both speech and birdsong. We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis on microarray data from singing zebra finches to discover gene ensembles regulated during vocal behavior. We found ~2,000 singing- regulated genes comprising 3 co-expression groups unique to area X, the basal ganglia subregion dedicated to learned vocal-motor behavior. These contained known targets of human FOXP2 and potential avian targets. We validated novel biological pathways for vocalization. Our findings show that higher-order gene co-expression patterns, rather than expression levels, molecularly distinguish area X from the ventral striato-pallidum during singing. The previously unknown structure of singing-driven networks enables prioritization of molecular interactors that likely bear on human motor disorders, especially those affecting speech.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 2 basal ganglia sub-regions (area X & ventral striato-pallidum (VSP)) of 27 adult male zebra finches that sang different amounts of song over a 2hr period in the morning. 18 birds were allowed to sing freely, 9 birds were discouraged from singing by the presence of an investigator and those that sang fewer than 10 song motifs were considered “non-singers”.
