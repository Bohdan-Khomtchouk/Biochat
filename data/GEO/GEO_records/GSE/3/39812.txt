TITLE
Tryptamine Serves As a Proligand of the AhR Transcriptional Pathway, and the Activation Is Dependent of Monoamine Oxidases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we show that physiological concentrations of tryptamine (TA) lead to induction of cytochrome P4501A1 transcription through an AhR-dependent mechanism. In addition, we show that activation of the AhR by TA requires a functional monoamino oxidase system, suggesting that TA acts as an AhR proligand possibly by converting to a high-affinity AhR ligand.

DESIGN
RNA seq was performed from Hepa cells treated with FICZ or TA by SciLifelabs.
