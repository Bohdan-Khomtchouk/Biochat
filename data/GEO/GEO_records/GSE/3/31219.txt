TITLE
Single-cell copy number varation detection: blastomeres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detection of genomic rearrangements from a single cell instead of a population of cells is an emerging research technique with important applications in the study of human fertility, constitutional chromosomal disorders, and tumor progression. Here, we develop a method to improve the detection of single-cell genome-wide copy number variation. Additional information about the blastomeres can be found in GSE11663.

DESIGN
At this study,  14 amplified single blastomere DNA samples derived from 3-day-old and 4-day-old human embryos were analyzed by Agilent 244K array CGH.  For these single cell Agilent 244K array CGH analyses: non-amplified genomic DNA extracted from the blood of a Klinefelter patient (XXY) was used as a reference sample. As a validation, the corresponding non-amplified genomic DNA samples were analyzed by 250K Nsp I SNP arrays (platform GPL3718 and GSE11663).
