TITLE
Gene expression in Drosophila treated with P. nigrum, pyrethrin or P. nigrum plus pyrethrin

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to assess the effect of a synergistic combination of natural pyrethrin and an ethylacetate extract of Piper nigrum seeds (a botanical insecticide).  This effect was compared to the effects of P. nigrum or pyrethrin used alone.  Due to the synergistic nature of the mixture, it was predicted that gene expression profiles in this treatment would reflect this effect. Keywords: insecticide response, stress-response
