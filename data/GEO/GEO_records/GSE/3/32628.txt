TITLE
Molecular profiling of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and actinic keratoses from organ transplant recipients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is markedly increased in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) compared to the normal population. Next to sun exposure, the immunosuppressive regimen is an important risk factor for the development of SCC in OTRs. Various gene mutations (e.g. TP53) and genetic alterations (e.g. loss of CDKN2A, amplification of RAS) have been found in SCCs. The aim of this genome-wide study was to identify pathways that are consistently involved in the formation of SCCs and their precursor lesions, actinic keratoses (AKs). To perform the analysis in an isogenic background, RNA and DNA were isolated from normal (unexposed) epidermis, benign  AK, and SCC from each of 15 OTRs. Hierarchical cluster analysis of mRNA expression profiles showed SCC, AK and epidermal samples to separate into three distinct groups. Several thousand genes were differentially expressed between epidermis, AK and SCC; most upregulated in SCCs were genes related to hyperproliferation and stress markers, such as keratin 6 (KRT6), KRT16 and KRT17. Matching to oncogenic pathways revealed activation of downstream targets of RAS and cMYC in SCCs and of NFkappaB and TNF already in AKs.

DESIGN
Patients were selected from the group of OTRs that are regularly seen at the dermatology clinic of the Leiden University Medical Center. Patients with clinically suspected SCC were informed on the study and after informed consent was obtained, fresh frozen samples were obtained from SCCs (n=15), AKs (n=14) and NS (n=13). RNA was isolated and gene expression profiles were obtained using HumanWG-6 v2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). The normalized expression data was analyzed for differences in expression between SCC, AK and NS, at single-gene level but also at geneset level.
