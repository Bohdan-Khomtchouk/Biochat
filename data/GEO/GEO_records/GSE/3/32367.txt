TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by GLIPR1 in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 (GLIPR1) and its mouse counterpart, Glipr1 are downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and other malignant cell lines, owing partly to methylation in the geneâ€™s regulatory region. Loss of Glipr1 function predisposed mice to tumorigenesis. Restoration of GLIPR1 expression in prostate cancer cells and other malignant cells led to growth suppression and/or apoptosis. Here we show that restoring GLIPR1 expression in PCa cells leads to downregulated c-myc and cell cycle-related c-myc target genes, leading to the inhibition of cell cycle progression.

DESIGN
DNA microarray (Illumina HumanHT-12) Prostate cancer cells were transduced with adenovirus-mediated GLIPR1 or control lacZ, grown in complete medium for 24 hours, synchronized by serum starvation for 24 hours, followed by serum restimulation for 30 min. RNA was prepared and subjected to DNA microarray analysis.
