TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human iPSC generated from pathogenic LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation bearing patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic mutations on leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. The Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation on LRRK2 gene is a relatively common cause of familial Parkinson's disease in Caucasian population. In this study, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from LRRK2 (G2019S) bearing patient fibroblasts by cell reprogramming. We performed global gene expression profiling of LRRK2 (G2019S) heterozygous and homozygous patient iPSC lines, and the corresponding fibroblast lines they originated from. An age-matched wildtype human fibroblast line and H1 human embryonic stem cell (ESC) line were used as controls.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression profiling was done to:  (1) Compare global gene expression differences between wildtype fibroblasts and fibroblasts from patients bearing homozygous and heterozygous LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation;  (2) Compare global gene expression differences between wildtype iPSC and iPSC generated from LRRK2 (G2019S) homozygous and heterozygous patients; (3) Check that all iPSC generated from wildtype and patients fibroblasts are in fact similar to human pluripotent ESC.
