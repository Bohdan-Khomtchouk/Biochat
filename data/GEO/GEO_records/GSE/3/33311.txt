TITLE
Modification of genes expression in the somatolactotrope GH4C1 cell line in presence of the dominant negative mutant POU1F1(R271W)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The anterior pituitary-specific transcription factor POU1F1 (also called PIT-1) was initially identified and cloned as a transactivator of PRL, GH and TSHÃŸ subunit genes. Different studies indicated that POU1F1 could also have other functions in these cells. The identification of new targets of this factor could be useful to obtain a better understanding of these functions. Gene expression microarray assays were used to detect genes that have their expression modified in somatolactotrope GH4C1 cells by the expression of a dominant negative form of POU1F1, POU1F1(R271W).

DESIGN
Lentiviral vectors containing the transgene of interest under the control of the PGK promoter (pGK-POU1F1(R271W)-IRES-EGFP, or pGK-EGFP used as controls) were generated. After lentiviral transfer in GH4C1 cells were grown in regular medium for 4 days then cells were harvested and total RNA was purified.
