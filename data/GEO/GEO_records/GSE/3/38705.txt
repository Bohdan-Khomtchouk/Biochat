TITLE
Macrophage samples from the HMDP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes involved in regulation of inflammatory responses and gene-environemnt interactions, in macrophages from a set of mouse inbred strains termed the HMDP.  The HMDP is a genetically diverse mapping panel comprised of classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild type mice. The RMA values of genes were used for genome wide association as described in Bennett et al Genome Research 2010.

DESIGN
GWAS for expression in primary macrophages of mouse inbred strains. Macrophages were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), oxidized lipids (OxPAPC) or control treatment conditions.
