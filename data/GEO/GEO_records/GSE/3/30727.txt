TITLE
Comparison of exon-wise expression profiling between normal and cancer tissues of human stomach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancers account for the fourth most frequent cancer death worldwide. Although many differential gene expression profiles are reported for gastric cancers, their variation at the post-transcriptional level has not been provided yet. In this study, we compared the gene expressions of normal stomach vs. stomach cancer in an exon-wise manner and compared alternatively spliced transcripts. The RNA from normal and cancer tissues of gastric cancer patients were subjected to Exon 1.0 ST microarrays.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of RNAs from normal and cancer tissues of human stomach by exon array. We analyzed 30 pairs of normal-cancer stomach tissues using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by the Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool.
