TITLE
Expression data from Bone-Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSC) from Follicular Lymphoma patient (FL) or Healthy Donor (HD).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) could be committed toward a functional lymphoid-like stroma by a combination of TNFalpha (TNF) and Lymphotoxin alpha1/beta2 (LT) (Am√©-Thomas et al Blood 2007). Bone marrow and lymph node stromal cells support FL malignant cell recruitment and growth in particular after comittment to a lymphoid-like differentiation in vitro. In addition, more than 70% of FL patients exhibit a bone marrow involvment at diagnosis. We delineate using Affymetrix U133+2.0 microarrays the gene expression profile of BM-MSC obtained  from FL patients (FL-MSC) and age-matched healthy donors (HD-MSC) in order to identify a specific FL-MSC signature. In addition, we used Affymetrix microarrays to define the gene expression signature of lymphoid-like stromal cells obtained from HD-MSC by treatment with TNF/LT in vitro. This TNF/LT signature was then used to interpret the gene expression profile of FL-MSC.

DESIGN
GEP was performed on 10 BM-MSC from FL patients and 6 from healthy donors, treated or not with TNF(10 ng/mL)/LT(100ng/mL)
