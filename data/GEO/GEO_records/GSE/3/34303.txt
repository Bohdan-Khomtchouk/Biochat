TITLE
A Global Transcriptome Analysis of BMSC Senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be expanded by serial passage, but expansion is limited by cell senescence.Â  The nature of changes associated with BMSC serial passages was assessed. Transcriptome analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage samples from 5 subjects revealed 2193 differentially expressed genes; those highly expressed in early passage cells were overrepresented in skeletal system development, embryonic morphogenesis, tube morphogenesis, etc, while those highly expressed in the late passage BMSCs were overrepresented in nucleosome assembly; chromatin assembly, DNA packaging, etc. 57 BMSC samples from 7 donors were further analyzed for the transition from an early to late passage; 155 genes were highly correlated with BMSC senescence and a set of 24 genes was predictive of BMSCs lifespan. The change from an early to a late passage molecular signature occurred between passage 3 and 5. In contrast, senescence associated beta-galactosidase staining began to increase after passage 6 or 7 and colony formation efficiency began to fall after passage 7. These data indicated that the onset of molecular changes associated with BMSC passage varied among individuals and preceded changes in commonly used indicators of BMSC senescence. The set of 24 BMSC lifespan predictive genes will be useful in assessing the quality of clinical BMSC products.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling on serial passages of BMSCs from 7 healthy donors (09FC20, 09FC37, 09FC43, 09FC44, 09FC45, 09FC49, and W10003).
