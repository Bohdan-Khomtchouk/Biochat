TITLE
ARID-DNA interactions are required for promoter occupancy by SWI/SNF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Every known SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex incorporates an ARID DNA binding domain-containing subunit.  Despite being a ubiquitous component of the complex, physiological roles for this domain remain undefined.  Here we show that disruption of ARID1a-DNA binding in mice results in embryonic lethality, with mutant embryos manifesting prominent defects in the heart and extraembryonic vasculature.  The DNA binding defective mutant ARID1a subunit is stably expressed and capable of assembling into a SWI/SNF complex with chromatin remodeling activity, but promoter occupancy by ARID1a-containing, SWI/SNF complexes (BAF-A) is impaired.  Depletion of ARID domain-dependent, BAF-A associations at THROMBOSPONDIN 1 (THBS1) led to the concomitant upregulation of this anti-angiogenic protein.  Using a THBS1 promoter-reporter gene, we further show that BAF-A directly regulates THBS1 promoter activity in an ARID domain-dependent manner.  Our data not only demonstrate that ARID-DNA interactions are physiologically relevant in higher eukaryotes, but also indicate these interactions can facilitate SWI/SNF binding to target sites in vivo.  These findings support the model wherein cooperative interactions among intrinsic subunit-chromatin interaction domains and sequence-specific transcription factors drive SWI/SNF recruitment.
