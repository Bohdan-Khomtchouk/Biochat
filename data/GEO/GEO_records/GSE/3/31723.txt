TITLE
Sex-biased expression in Drosophila willistoni

ORGANISM
Drosophila willistoni

SUMMARY
We performed mRNA sequencing of samples isolated from the heads, thoraxes, and abdomens of males and females of Drosophila willistoni to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the sexes.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression levels in females and males
