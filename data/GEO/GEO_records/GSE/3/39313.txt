TITLE
The role of FGF21 in aging and aging-related diseases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging and aging-related diseases represent an increasing burden on modern society.  Thus, drugs that retard the aging process are highly desirable.  Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is a hormone secreted by the liver during fasting that elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response.  Among its effects, FGF21 induces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity and blocks somatic growth.  Here we show that transgenic overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice without reducing food intake or affecting AMP kinase or mTOR signaling or NAD metabolism.  Transcriptomic analysis suggests that FGF21 acts primarily by blunting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway in liver.   These findings raise the possibility that FGF21 can be used as a hormone therapy to extend lifespan.

DESIGN
Liver, epididymal fat and gastrocnemius muscle RNA expression profiles were compared between C57Bl/6J ad libitum, fasted, and calorically restricted mice, as well as between FGF-21 transgenic and their wild-type C57Bl/6J controls.
