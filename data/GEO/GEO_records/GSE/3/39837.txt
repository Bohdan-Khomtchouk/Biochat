TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Six2 and b-catenin in mesenchymal nephron progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Self-renewing undifferentiated nephron progenitors express Six2, a transcription factor that is required for their maintenance as undifferentiated progenitors. Differentiation of nephron progenitors is triggered by Wnt/b-catenin signaling. In order to understand how Six2 and Wnt signaling counteract each other, we performed ChIP-seq of Six2 and b-catenin in mesenchymal nephron progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Nephron progenitors were FACS-isolated from BAC transgenic Six2GFPcre-positive embryonic kidneys at E16.5. For Six2 ChIP, freshly FACS isolated Six2+ cells were used. For b-catenin ChIP, FACS isolated Six2+ cells were aggregated by centrifugation at 850g for 5min and incubated in 10%FBS/DMEM containing 4uM BIO for 24hrs.
