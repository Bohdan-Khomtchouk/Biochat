TITLE
Expression data from odontogenic tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to elucidate the cellular origin of ameloblastoma and keratocystic odontogenic tumour, neoplasms believed to arise from dental epithelial cells, by carrying out a genome-wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 27 fresh tumour samples of 15 conventional intraosseous ameloblastomas and 12 sporadic keratocystic odontogenic tumours, and 8 control samples were hybridized on AffymetrixÂ® GeneChip Human Genome U 133 Plus 2.0 arrays. The key findings were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) and immunohistochemistry.
