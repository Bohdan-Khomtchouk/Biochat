TITLE
Genome wide profiling of RNA polymerase III in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome wide mapping of RNA polymearase III binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under normal growth and nutrient starved condition using ChIP-seq. Chromatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) was performed for FLAG tagged version of pol III subunit RPC128 after crosslinking the log-phase cells with formaldehyde. MOCK and IP DNA was sequenced and coverage of pol III was calculated at each base of the genome.

DESIGN
RPC128-FLAG ChIP-seq single end seqquencing on Illumina GAII. 2 replicates of IP samples and 1 MOCK sample. Done in under normal growth and nutrient deprivation (4 hours).
