TITLE
Ketogulonigenium vulgare cells: co-culture mode vs. mono-culture mode

ORGANISM
Ketogulonicigenium vulgare WSH-001

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of K. vulgare cells co-cultured with Bacillus megaterium compared to K. vulgare mono-cultured cells. Differentially expressed genes in co-cultured and mono-cultured K. vulgare cells were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the mechanisms of B. megaterium stimulating K. vulgare propagation on global gene expression.
