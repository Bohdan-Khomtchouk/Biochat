TITLE
Expression data from Ly-6C- and Ly-6C+ Naive CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The naive CD4 T cell compartment is heterogeneous. Ly-6C- and Ly-6C+ Naive CD4 T cells were compare by microarrays.

DESIGN
Ly-6C- and Ly-6C+ Naive CD4 T cells were purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
