TITLE
Pathways identified by toxicogenomics analysis reveal the size and dose independency of silica particles-induced toxicity in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding the interactions of nanostructures with biological systems is essential to nanotoxicological research. Using a microarray-based toxicogenomics approach at early stage, this study investigated the relationship between particle size and toxicity of silica particles (SP) with diameters of 30, 70, and 300 nm (SP30, SP70, and SP300) as well as the mechanism of injury in mice.

DESIGN
Two experiments with SiO2 particles of different sizes were considered in mice. One was aimed to investigate the dose-response relationship of SP70 toxicity at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg (experiment 1), and the other set to study the size-response relationship of SP-induced toxicity using SP30, SP70, or SP300 (experiment 2). In experiment 2, two dosages each of SP30, SP70, and SP300 were performed. One was 10 mg/kg at three particle sizes, and the other was toxic doses of the three particle sizes, i.e., 10 mg/kg for SP30, 40 mg/kg for SP70, and 200 mg/kg for SP300. The toxic doses of the three particle sizes of SP were decided on the basis of the results of histopathological examinations and serum biochemical analysis in our previous study.n = 5
