TITLE
Gene expression in the chronic ethanol-treated rat liver during liver regeneration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on liver repair and regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx). Rats were fed a liquid diet containing 36% of total calories derived from ethanol for 5 weeks; corresponding pair-fed calorie-matched controls were fed diets in which ethanol calories were replaced either by carbohydrate or by fat. After 5 weeks, rats were subjected to 70%  PHx and liver samples were collected at 1, 6 and 24h after the surgery. The excised liver samples at t=0 served as within-animal controls. We used Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 STÂ  arrays to obtain global gene expression data from each liver sample (n=4 replicate rats, 72 arrays total).

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in the chronic ethanol-fed (EtOH) and carbohydrate control pair-fed (CHO) liver prior to (control) and 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after partial hepatectomy (PHx).
