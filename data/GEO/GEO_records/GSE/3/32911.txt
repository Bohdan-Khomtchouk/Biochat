TITLE
Compound C prevents the unfolded protein response during glucose deprivation through a mechanism independent of AMPK and BMP signaling.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inhibiting the unfolded protein response (UPR) can be a therapeutic approach, especially for targeting the tumor microenvironment. We found that compound C (also known as dorsomorphin) prevented the UPR and exerted enhanced cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation. The UPR-inhibiting activity of compound C was not associated with either AMPK or BMP signaling inhibition.

DESIGN
To induce the UPR, we treated HT1080 cells for 18 hours under ER stress conditions by adding 10 mM 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) to culture medium. UPR inhibitors (compound C, versipelostatin and phenformin) were added just before 2DG was added in medium. Total 8 samples were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
