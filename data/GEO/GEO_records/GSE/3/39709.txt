TITLE
Identification of Ligands for the human gamma-delta TCR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T cells bearing gamma delta T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) function in lymphoid stress surveillance. However, the contribution of gamma delta TCRs to such responses is unclear. Here we found that the TCR of a human V gamma4Vdelta5 clone directly bound endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which allowed gamma delta T cells to recognize both endothelial cells targeted by cytomegalovirus and epithelial tumors. EPCR is a major histocompatibility complexâ€“like molecule that binds lipids analogously to the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d. However, the V gamma4Vdelta5 TCR bound EPCR independently of lipids, in an antibody-like way. Moreover, the recognition of target cells by gamma delta T cells required a multimolecular stress signature composed of EPCR and costimulatory ligand(s). Our results demonstrate how a gamma delta TCR mediates recognition of broadly stressed human cells by engaging a stress-regulated self antigen.

DESIGN
2E9 is an antibody that blocks gd-TCR recognition of human cells that are the targets of the clone LES. 2E9 also stains cells that are targeted by LES. Therefore, to identify the TCR ligand expressed by 2E9-positive cells, Gene Expression was compared in two cell lines that stain with 2E9 (K562 and U937) versus two cell lines that do not (Hutu80 and Huh7).
