TITLE
The effect of androgen deprivation on human prostate xenograft tumor LuCaP35

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen deprivation is a standard of care front-line therapy for human prostate cancer, however, majority of patients will eventally develop resistance to androgen deprivation. In this study, using a human prostate cancer xenograft model -LuCaP35, we examiend the gene expression changes after castration.

DESIGN
We compare the gene expression of 5 LuCaP35 xenografts from non-treated mice (Control), and 5 androgen-deprived LuCaP35 xenografts from castrated mice (Castration).
