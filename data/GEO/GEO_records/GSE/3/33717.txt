TITLE
PDGF-BB modulates hematopoiesis and tumor angiogenesis by inducing erythropoietin production in stromal cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling system contributes to tumor angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. Here, we show PDGF-BB markedly induces erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA and protein expression by targeting the PDGFR-beta+ stromal and perivascular compartments. In mouse tumor models, PDGF-BB-induced EPO promotes tumor growth via two mechanisms: 1) paracrine stimulation of tumor angiogenesis by directly inducing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, sprouting and tube formation; and 2) endocrine stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis leading to increased oxygen perfusion and protection against tumor-associated anemia. Similarly, delivery of an adenovirus-PDGF-BB to tumor-free mice markedly increases EPO production and hematopoietic parameters. An EPO blockade specifically attenuates PDGF-BB-induced tumor growth, angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. At the molecular level, we show that the PDGF-BB-PDGFR-beta signaling system activates EPO promoter via in part transcriptional regulation of ATF3 by possible association with c-Jun and SP1. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of PDGF-BB-induced tumor growth, angiogenesis and hematopoiesis.
