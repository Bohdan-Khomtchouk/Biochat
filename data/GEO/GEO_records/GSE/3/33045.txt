TITLE
Comparison of miRNA profile in body fluids (plasma and bronchoalveolar fluid cytology)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective is to obtain miRNA representative signatures both in plasma and bronchoalveolar cell fraction that could serve as biomarker in respiratory diseases. The identification of new less invasive biomarkers is necessary to improve the detection and prognostic outcome of respiratory pathological processes. The measurement of miRNA expression through less invasive techniques such as plasma and serum have been suggested to analysis of several lung malignancies including lung cancer. These studies are assuming a common deregulated miRNA expression both in blood and lung tissue. The present study aimed to obtain miRNA representative signatures both in plasma and bronchoalveolar cell fraction that could serve as biomarker in respiratory diseases.

DESIGN
we have compared circulating plasma miRNA with the bronchoalveolar cell fraction-derived miRNA patterns from 10 patients with several lung disease using a RT-qPCR assay.
