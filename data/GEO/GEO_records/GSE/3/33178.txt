TITLE
Widespread Generation of Alternative UTRs Contributes to Sex-specific RNA Binding by UNR

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Upstream of N-ras (UNR) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation and stability by binding to sites generally located in untranslated regions (UTRs). In Drosophila, sex-specific binding of UNR to msl2 mRNA and the non-coding RNA roX plays key roles in the control of X-chromosome dosage compensation in both sexes. In order to investigate broader sex-specific functions of UNR, we have identified its RNA targets in adult male and female flies by high-throughput RNA binding and transcriptome analysis. Here we show that UNR binds to a large set of protein-coding transcripts and to a smaller set of non-coding RNAs in a sex-specific fashion.

DESIGN
Two replicates of UNR IP were performed in D.melanogaster adult males and females, and enrichment in either sex was compared with IgG IP as control. To correlate sex-specific UNR binding with sex-specific transcription and splicing we performed RNA-Seq experiments in males and females.
