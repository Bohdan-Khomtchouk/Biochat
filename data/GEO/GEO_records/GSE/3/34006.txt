TITLE
Role of Adenosine 2A Receptors (A2AR) on regulatory T cells (Tregs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) is expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs), but the functional significance is currently unknown.  We compared the gene expression between wild-type (WT) and A2AR knockout (KO) Tregs and between WT Tregs treated with vehicle or a selective A2AR agonist.

DESIGN
FACS-sorted GFP positive Tregs from WT or A2AR KO FoxP3GFP mouse spleen and lymph nodes were incubated 18 hr with vehicle (DMSO), a separate set of WT Tregs were incubated with the selective A2AR agonist ATL1222 10 nM (Dogwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for 18 hr prior to RNA isolation.
