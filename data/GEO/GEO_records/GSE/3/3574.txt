TITLE
A DNA integrity network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A network governing DNA integrity was identified in yeast by a global genetic analysis of synthetic fitness or lethality defect (SFL) interactions. Within this network, multiple functional modules or mini-pathways were defined according to their common patterns of global SFL interactions and available protein-protein interaction information. Modules or genes involved in DNA replication, DNA replication checkpoint signaling, and oxidative stress response were identified as the major guardians against lethal spontaneous DNA damage, efficient repair of which requires the functions of the DNA damage checkpoint signaling and multiple DNA repair pathways. This genome-wide genetic interaction network also revealed potential roles of a number of genes and modules in mitotic DNA replication and maintenance of genomic stability. These include DIA2, NPT1, HST3, HST4, and the CSM1/LRS4 module (CSM1m). Likewise, the CTF18 module (CTF18m), previously implicated in sister chromatid cohesion, was found to participate in the DNA replication checkpoint. Keywords: dose response
