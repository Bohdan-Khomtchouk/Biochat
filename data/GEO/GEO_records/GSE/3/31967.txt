TITLE
Jarid1b targets genes regulating development and is involved in neural differentiation [expression array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The H3K4me2/3 histone demethylase Jarid1b (Kdm5b/Plu1) is dispensable for embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal, but essential for ESC differentiation along the neural lineage. During neural differentiation, Jarid1b depleted ESCs fail to efficiently silence lineage-inappropriate genes, specifically stem and germ cell genes. Our results delineate an essential role for Jarid1b-mediated transcriptional control during ESC differentiation.

DESIGN
Control (LKOScr) or Jarid1b knockdown (LKOJarid1b) mouse ES cells were used.Each experiment was performed in triplicates.
