TITLE
R. sphaeroides pRKPcrZ vs. R. sphaeroides pRK4352 under low oxygen conditions

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of R. sphaeroides pRKPcrZ compared to control R. sphaeroides pRK4352 under low oxygen conditions. In this study we compared the transcriptome of a PcrZ over-expression strain to a control strain. PcrZ is the first small non-coding RNA, which is involved in the complex regulatory network of photosynthesis gene regulation in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. It counteracts the formation of photosynthetic complexes in a redox dependent manner.
