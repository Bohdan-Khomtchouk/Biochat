TITLE
Using DNA methylation to detect dysplasia/early neoplasia in Barrett's carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysplasia and early cancer are hard to detect in endoscopic biopsies and hence this study was carried out to evaluate the biomarker potential of DNA methylation to detect dyspasia and early cancer in Barrett's esophaghus patients. Bisulfite converted genomic DNA was hybridized onto Illumina 27k methylation arrays.

DESIGN
22 Barrett's esophagus (BE) and 2 Duodenum vs. 24 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)
