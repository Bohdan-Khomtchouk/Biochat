TITLE
H1.4K34ac ChIP-sequencing in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The linker histone H1 is a key player in chromatin organization, yet our understanding of the regulation of H1 functions by posttranslational modifications is very limited. We provide here the first functional characterization of H1 acetylation. We show that H1.4K34 acetylation (H1.4K34ac) is mediated by GCN5 and is preferentially enriched at promoters of active genes, where it stimulates transcription by increasing H1 mobility and recruiting a general transcription factor. H1.4K34ac is dynamic during spermatogenesis and marks undifferentiated cells, such as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and testicular germ cell tumors. We propose a model for H1.4K34ac as a novel regulator of chromatin function with a dual role in transcriptional activation.

DESIGN
Examination of H1.4K34ac in the MCF-7 cell line by ChIP-Seq - two replicates of H1.4K34ac IP as two sequencing runs used to produce 1 BED file, one control IP sample.
