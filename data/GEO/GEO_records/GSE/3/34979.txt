TITLE
Array-based CGH analysis of ccRCC derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
arrayCGH profiling of 10 cell lines derived from clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma The goal of this study was to make a detailed genomic profile of these cell lines, including aCGH, miRNA expression, and mRNA expression profiles. The miRNA and mRNA expressiion profiles are submitted to GEO separately. One paper is in preparation to link the miRNA expression data with the arayCGH data. For mRNA expression data see GEO Series accession number GSE20491.

DESIGN
CGH arrays used to analyse 10 cell lines
