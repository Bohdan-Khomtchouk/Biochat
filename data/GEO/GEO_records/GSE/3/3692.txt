TITLE
The Study of Gene Expression Profiles of KG-1 Cells Treated with Antrodia Camphorata Extracts using cDNA microarray.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antrodia Camphorata is well known in Taiwan as a folk medicinal fungus with anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we used a human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG-1, as the experimental model and constructed a high-throughput gene screen integrated platform by using a combination of herbal identification, UV-VIS spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and DNA microarray technology. Based on this science-based platform, we developed a practical quantitative method and also established an organic/inorganic chemical fingerprint for the herbal materials. In the mean while, the global gene expression patterns of the KG-1 cells treated with various A. camphorata mycelia extracts (water and methanol extracts) were compared. Furthermore, several possible biological responses and relevant marker gene would be identified by our high-throughput integrated platform. Keywords: KG-1 treated with AC extracts for 4 days, cDNA microarray, biomarker selection.
