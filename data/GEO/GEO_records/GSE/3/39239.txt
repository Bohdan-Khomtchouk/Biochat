TITLE
Comparison of Apis mellifera workers and queens brain development at fourth instar larvae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
In Apis mellifera, the female eggs can develop into workers or queen depending on the diet offered during early development. The outputs of the developed honeybee females are two morphs with particular morphological traits and related physiology. The differential feeding regime experienced by the queen and the worker larvae of the honeybee Apis mellifera shapes a complex endocrine response cascade that ultimately sets up differences in brain morphologies. Herein we report on aspects of  brain morphogenesis during larval development and the brain gene expression signature of fourth instar larvae (L4) of both castes, a developmental stage characterized by the greatest differences in juvenile hormone (JH) titers between castes Using results from the hybridization of whole genome-based oligonucleotide arrays with RNA samples from brain of  fourth instar larvae  honeybees of both castes we present a list of differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Analysis used one dye-swap combination to compare workers and queens brain development at fourth instar larvae when juvenile hormone titers is  higher in queens.
