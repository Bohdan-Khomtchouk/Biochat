TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse splenic macrophages and CD8+ and CD8- conventional dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The close functional relationship between macrophages and dendritic cells has long been recognised. Here, we have examined the gene expression profiles of splenic macrophages and the splenic resident dendritic cell subsets, and demostrate that macrophages and DC show different gene expression profiles. Further, we show that the DC subsets are closer to one another in gene expression profile than they are to macrophages. We here identify a list of differentially expressed genes between the DC subsets, and between DC and macrophages

DESIGN
Splenic macrophages, CD8+ and CD8- cDC were analyzed
