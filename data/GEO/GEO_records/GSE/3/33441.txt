TITLE
Expression data from cynosure (cyn) mutant and its CYNOSURE (CYN) wild-type at before flowering and 5 days after pollination stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To assess further the role of CYN in relation to integument morphogenesis, gametophytic cell fate specification, embryogenesis and endosperm development, we compared the expression profiles between the cyn mutant and wild-type at two different stages(before flowering and 5 days after pollination stage) of ovule development by microarray analysis. Specifically, we confirmed significant changes of up- or down-regulation in some genes required for several biological processes, such as  auxin efflux & polarity & cell differentiation, flower and embryonic development, signal transduction.These results supported that MADS protein CYN could function both as a transcriptional activator and repressor, directly and/or indirectly interacted with dozens of potential target genes (including MADS or non-MADS transcription factors) involved in developmental and hormonal pathways.
