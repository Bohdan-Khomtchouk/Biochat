TITLE
Great Ape Copy Number Variation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intra-specific polymorphism in copy number is documented in many organisms, including human and chimpanzee, but very little is known for other great apes. This study aims to provide CNVs data for orangutan, gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee, and compare the CNV patterns among these species, as well as with human CNVs and segmental duplications from public databases.
