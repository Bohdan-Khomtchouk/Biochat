TITLE
HIV Infection and Antiretroviral Therapy Have Divergent Effects on Mitochondria in Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exploratory microarray analysis identified significant changes in gene expression in adipose tissue.  These included changes in genes regulating lipid and steroid metabolic processes and electron carrier activity in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Additional genes involved in metabolic processes and mitochondrial function were found to be up-regulated in the adipose tissue of HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative controls.

DESIGN
To identify differential gene expression in different tissues (PBMC, muscle, adipose tissue) between HIV patient groups (HIV negative, HIV positive with ART, HIV positive without ART).
