[E-MTAB-460] Sanger_zebrafish_sequencing

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Abstract: Paired-end sequence data has been generated using polyA selected RNA from a range of zebrafish tissues using the Illumina Genome Analyzer.  Study description: Zebrafish total RNA was extracted from adult tissue, then polyA selected. After fragmentation and reverse transcription Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared. Paired-end sequence runs were performed with 76 base reads on the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
