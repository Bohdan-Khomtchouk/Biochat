TITLE
Impact of FOXA1 over-expression on progestin signalling in transformed normal breast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide gene expression profiling of response to synthetic progestin ORG2058 in AB32 cells, a PR positive clone of the MCF-10A cell line, was determined after lentiviral transduction with an expression construct encoding human FOXA1. Cells were treated for 6h or 24h with 10nM ORG2058 or vehicle, 48h after transduction with the FOXA1 construct or empty vector control. Gene expression was measured in total RNA my Illumina whole genome gene expression array.

DESIGN
Duplicate monolayer cultures of AB32 cells transduced 48h with pCDH-CMV-FOXA1-EF1-copGFP virus or negative control empty vector pCDH-CMV-mcs-EF1-copGFP virus were treated 6h or 24h with 10nM ORG2058 or 0.1% ethanol vehicle control. Cells were harvested for total RNA isolation and each sample was labelled and hybridized to a single Illumina human whole genome microarray, resulting in three replicate datasets for each of four conditions. Data were analysed separately and combined to give a mean signal intensity for each array probe.
