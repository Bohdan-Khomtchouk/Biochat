TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer Docetaxel-resistant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Docetaxel is the standard first line therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients. Here we generated models of Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells to study the molecular pathways that drive the acquisition of resistance to this therapy. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the acquisition of Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
Parental Docetaxel-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and 22Rv1) and selected Docetaxel-resistant cells (DU145-DR and 22Rv1-DR) were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were analyzed in triplicates in order to increase the resolution of expression profiles.
