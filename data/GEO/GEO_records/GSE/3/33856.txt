TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings:early light regulated gene expression in Ler wildtype versus eid3 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana Ler wildtype and eid3 (empfindlicher im dunkelroten Licht 3) mutant seedlings in darkness and 45 min after a red-light pulse.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana Ler wildtype and eid3 mutant seedlings were grown on 1/2 MS Agar plates covered with filter paper for 4 days in darkness after induction of germination with 2 h red light. Samples were either treated with 2 min red light (30 Âµmol/m2s) or kept in darkness and harvested after additional 45 min in darkness. 3 biological replicas were used for each of the 4 experimental conditions.
