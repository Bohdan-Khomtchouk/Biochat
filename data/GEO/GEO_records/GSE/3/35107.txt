TITLE
microRNA profiling of fetal liver and adult bone marrow pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the NanoString mouse nCounter miRNA expression platform to compare the miRNA expression profiles of pro-B cells sorted from fetal liver and adult bone marrow in order to gain insight into changes in miRNA expression during B cell ontogeny.

DESIGN
Fetal liver and adult bone marrow cells were harvested and FACS sorted for pro-B cells (B220+CD43+IgM-veCD19+CD24+). Total RNA was extracted and used for sample preparation and hybridization per manufacturer's instructions.
