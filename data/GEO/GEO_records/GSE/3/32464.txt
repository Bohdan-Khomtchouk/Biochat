TITLE
Global gene expression analysis in murine iPS cells derived with mouse and human Nanog orthologs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nanog null neural stem (NS) cells were reprogrammed to naive pluripotency in 2i/LIF conditions with mouse (m) Nanog and human (h) Nanog. Global gene expression in resulting iPS cells was compared to embryonic stem (ES) cells and nanog null NS cells.

DESIGN
Murine iPS cells derived with mouse nanog iPS and human nanog iPS and then compared to embryonic stem cells and nanog null neural stem cells (3 replicates each).
