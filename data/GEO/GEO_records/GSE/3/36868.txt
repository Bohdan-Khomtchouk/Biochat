TITLE
Simvastatin treated Lymphoblastoid Cell lines from Cholesterol and Pharmacogenomics (CAP) Trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Statins reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol.  To identify novel pathways that modulate statin response, we assessed the influence of simvastatin exposure on expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) associations across the genome in 480 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).  Cell lines were derived blood samples collected ant entry visit from participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenomics (CAP) trial, who underwent a 6 week 40mg/day simvastatin trial. We identified 4590 cis-eQTLS that were independent of treatment status (FDR=1%) and six cis-eQTLS for which there was evidence of an interaction with treatment (FDR=20%).  Genotypes and Phenotypes derived from these indivudals are available through dbGaP (Accession Number).  eQTL results are available at:

DESIGN
Dataset consists of 960 expression beadarrays (Illumina HumanRef-8v3) representing  paired samples derived from 24-hour exposures of 480 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to 2 micromolar simvastatin acid or control buffer.
