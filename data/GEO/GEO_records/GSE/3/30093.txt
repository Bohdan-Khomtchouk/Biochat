TITLE
Analysis of the effect of auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-AOPP on the gene expression profile (whole plant)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Recently, 2-aminoxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (L-AOPP) had been demonstrated to possess an inhibitory activity against IAA biosynthesis but the molecular basis of the action was unclear. To investigate the function of L-AOPP in relation to Auxin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis to investigate function of 2-aminoxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (L-AOPP) in relation to inhibition of auxin biosynthesis.  Then L-AOPP (final concentration is 50 μM) was added to tubes and seedlings were incubated for additional 3 hours. To investigate effects on L-AOPP treatment, IAA (1 μM) or IPyA (100 μM) were added to the medium 1 hour after L-AOPP was added.
