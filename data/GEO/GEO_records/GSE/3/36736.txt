TITLE
Genome wide transcriptional profiling of BEAF-32 in wing imaginal tissues of wildtype and mutants [expresion array]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The mutants in BEAF-32 gene in Drosophila caused the Neoplastic growth. In order to understand the rold of BEAF-32 insulator function in  regualtion of gene expression we used the imagial tissue as a model to assay the transcriptional changes. The Imagianl tissues were disected in the icecold PBS and Total RNA was prepared using RNaeasy ( qiagen ) kit. This is followed by cDNA synthesis using Oligo dT. Transcriptional changes assayed with two biological replicates and two experimental replicates

DESIGN
Two biologial replicates and two experimental replicates were prepared in an independent experiments. Each cDNA samples were labeled with Cy3 due and hybridised and scaned as per manufactures instructions at Florida state university Nimblegen fecility.
