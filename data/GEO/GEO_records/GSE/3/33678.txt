TITLE
Gene expression profile changes in brains of VSV-infected wild-type and Ifit2 knockout mice at 6 days after infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vesicular stomatitis virus replicates with marked effciency in Ifit2 knockout mouse brains late after infection (6 days after intranasal inoculation), compared to wt brains. Changes in gene expression, especially of interferon-stimulated genes, between late in infection (at 6 d p.i.) compared to early during infection (2 d p.i.) were examined in comparison to wild-type.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from mouse brains of wt or Ifit2 knockout mice at 6 days after infection, compared to RNA from 2 days after infection.
