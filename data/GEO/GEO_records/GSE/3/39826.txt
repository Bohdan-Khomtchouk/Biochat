TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiling of the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666.1 and normal primary tonsillar epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have performed comparative gene expression profiling of primary tonsil epithelial cells with the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666.1 using a human gene array.

DESIGN
Differences in cellular gene expression was compared using RNA isolated from C666-1 cells and primary tonsil epithelial cells grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (performed in triplicate). RNA isolated from each sample was processed according to the Genechip WT sense target labelling protocol. 1Î¼g of RNA was hybridised to human gene 1.0 ST array chips.
