SUMMARY
Genomic and gene expression profiling identifies two major gene/genomic circuits operating in urothelial carcinoma

DESIGN
146 primary bladder cancer tumor samples were analyzed on BAC array containing ~32 000 BAC clones. Arrays were produced at the Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University (SCIBLU).
