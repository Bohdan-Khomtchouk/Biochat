TITLE
Global transcriptional profiles response to strain variation and medium change for validamycin overproduction

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular basis of validamycin overproduction at the transcriptional level, the transcriptomes of strain 5008 and TL01 cultivated in Yeast extract-Malt extract-Glucose (YMG) and rice-peanut cake based industrial (IND) fermentation medium were compared by microarray analysis.
