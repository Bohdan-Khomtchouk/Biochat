TITLE
Gene Expression data from Mouse C57bl6 Bone marrow derived macrophages infected by the promastigote form of Leishmania major parasite (P) or Killed parasite (Kp) during a time course of infection [C57bl6]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional signatures of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) at different times after infection with promastigotes of the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used to analyse global changes in gene transcripts to generate a pool of genes that was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) and a fold change cut-off of 1.5 in at least one of the five infected samples versus non-infected samples.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates for each biological condition (Non infected " NI " , infected with lived parasite " P " or " heat inactivated parasite " Kp " ) at 1h (T1), 3(T3), 6(T6), 12 (T12) and 24hours (T24) were performed. The Non infected (NI) at 0 hour (T0) biological condition were used as an additional control.
