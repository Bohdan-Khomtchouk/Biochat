TITLE
Gene Expression from diabetic ischemic limbs in WT and p75KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was carried out to characterise the different responses of diabetic and non-diabetic WT and p75KO mice to ischemia

DESIGN
C57BL/6J-p75NTR-/- (p75KO) and p75NTR+/+ (WT) littermates were bred starting from breeding pairs.  Six to seven week old male p75KO and WT mice were made diabetic using streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg in 0.1mol/l citrate buffer pH4.5 i.p. per day for 5 days or left normoglycemic by STZ buffer injections. One or three months after diabetes induction, anesthetized mice underwent unilateral hindlimb ischemia by permanent ligation and electro-coagulation of the proximal end of femoral arteries. At the same time, full thickness wounds were created in the thigh dorsal skin of both legs using a sterile 5-mm-wide biopsy punch. Samples for  gene expression analysis were taken from the wounds three days later.
