TITLE
Identification and Characterization of the Human Leiomyoma Side Population as Putative Tumor Initiator Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of the female genital tract, and is the main cause of hysterectomy in 25-30% of affected women. Nevertheless, knowledge about stem cells initiating these common uterine tumors remains scarce. The side population method has been used to identify different somatic stem cells in the human body. In this context, our study explores the hypothesis that human leiomyoma side population cells could be the putative somatic stem cells responsible for leiomyoma's initiation and formation. We isolated, identified and characterized the side population cells from human leiomyomas which implies no commitment to the myometrial lineage at the molecular level, differential cloning efficiency under hypoxic conditions and provides a leiomyoma stem cells gene profile. Based on their cloning efficiency ability, we also established two cell lines (MyoSP1-2) with a normal karyotype under hypoxic conditions. The phenotype analysis supported their mesodermal commitment as assessed by the positive expression of typical mesenchymal markers, such as CD90, CD105, and CD73, and by the absence of hematopoietic stem cell markers like CD34 and CD45. At the mRNA level, we also confirmed their undifferentiated status (OCT-4+, NANOG+, DNMT3B+, GDF3+) and mesenchymal lineage commitment as demonstrated by their ability to differentiate in vitro into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. Finally, we demonstrated the functional capability of Myo cell lines (MyoSP1-2) to form human leiomyoma-like tissue after injecting this subset of cells either under the kidney capsule or in the subcutaneous tissue in the NOD-SCID mice model.

DESIGN
4 replicates each of leiomyoma side population (SP) cells and leiomyoma total fraction (FT) cells were analyzed.
