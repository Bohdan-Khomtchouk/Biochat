TITLE
Leaf gene expression profile of rice during sunrise

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed at regular interval during the sunrise period to understand the changes of transcriptional program in the rice plant grown under natural field conditions in response to solar radiation.
