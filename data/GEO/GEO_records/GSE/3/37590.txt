TITLE
Natural genetic variation in yeast longevity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A quantitative genetic analysis of the yeast replicative life span was carried out by sampling the natural genetic variation

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from 39 recombinant lines from a cross between strains S96 and YJM 789.
