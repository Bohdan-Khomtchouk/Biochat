TITLE
Expression data from 5 human cell lines exposed to IR (5 Gy)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular response to DNA damage is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing undue cell death or cancer formation. The DNA damage response (DDR), most robustly mobilized by double-strand breaks (DSBs), rapidly activates an extensive signaling network that affects numerous cellular systems, leading to cell survival or programmed cell death. A major component of the DDR is the widespread modulation of gene expression. We analyzed transcriptional responses to ionizing radiation (IR) in 5 human cell lines to elucidate the scope of this response and identify its gene targets. According to the mRNA expression profiles most of the responses were cell line-specific. Data analysis identified significant enrichment for p53 target genes and cell cycle-related pathways among groups of up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively.

DESIGN
Expression profiles were measured using affymetrix chips in IR- irradiated G361 cells and their time-matched untreated controls. Time points recorded were 0, 3 and 6 hrs. IR dose: 5 Gy Expression profiles were measured using affymetrix chips in IR- irradiated HepG2 cells and their time-matched untreated controls. Time points recorded were 0, 3 and 6 hrs. IR dose: 5 Gy Expression profiles were measured using affymetrix chips in IR- irradiated TK6 cells and their time-matched untreated controls. Time points recorded were 0, 3 and 6 hrs. IR dose: 5 Gy Expression profiles were measured using affymetrix chips in IR- irradiated U2OS cells and their time-matched untreated controls. Time points recorded were 0, 3 and 6 hrs. IR dose: 5 Gy Expression profiles were measured using affymetrix chips in IR- irradiated BJ cells and their time-matched untreated controls. Time points recorded were 0, 3 and 6 hrs. IR dose: 5 Gy
