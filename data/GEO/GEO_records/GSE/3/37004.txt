TITLE
m6A mapping in mouse RNA (mouse liver and human brain)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach, m6A-seq, for high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape, based on antibody-mediated capture followed by massively parallel sequencing

DESIGN
Identification of m6A modified sequences in mouse liver and human brain
