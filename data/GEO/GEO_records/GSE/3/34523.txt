TITLE
BT474 tumors in the presence or absence of SHP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The first bona fide PTP proto-oncogene was the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11), an ubiquitously expressed PTP that transduces mitogenic, pro-survival, cell fate and/or pro-migratory signals from numerous growth factor-, cytokine- and extracellular matrix receptors. In malignancies, SHP2 is hyperactivated either downstream of oncoproteins or by mutations.We provide analysis of the breast cancer cells BT474 grown as xenografts in the presence or absence of SHP2 for 30 days.

DESIGN
The HER2-postive breast cancer cell line BT474 was transduced with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector expressing a CTRL miR or SHP2 miR1 or SHP2 miR2. Cells from each group were injected in imuunodeficinet mice and after tumor development, the knockdown of SHP2 was induced for 30 days in vivo. At day 30, tumors were dissected and RNA isolated for gene expression analysis.
