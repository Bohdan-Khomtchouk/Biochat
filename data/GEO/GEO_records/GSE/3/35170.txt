TITLE
Expression data from U87-2M1 glioma cells transduced with baculoviral control decoy vector or baculoviral miR-10b decoy vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA-10b may target numerous genes in gliomagenesis. The target genes of miR-10b may differ according to the cellular context. We used microarray analyses to determine the phenotypic effects and gene targets of miR-10b by silencing miR-10b in invasive U87-2M1 glioma cells.

DESIGN
Early passage U87-2M1 cells treated with the baculoviral control decoy vector or miR-10b decoy vector were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on microarray
