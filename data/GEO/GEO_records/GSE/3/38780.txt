TITLE
Expression data of normal human extraocular muscle and strabismic human extraocular muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human strabismic extraocular muscles (EOMs) differ from normal EOMs in structural and functional properties, but the gene expression profile of these two types of human EOM has not been examined. Differences in gene expression may inform about causes and effects of the strabismic condition in humans. Our samples are from human strabismic patients undergoing corrective surgery, and from human organ donors with no history of EOM disease. Microarray analysis showed that 604 genes in these samples have significantly different expression. Expression was predominantly up-regulated in genes involved in extracellular matrix structure and down-regulated in genes related to contractility.

DESIGN
We used four normal samples and four strabismic samples. Three normal samples were from independent donors. One normal sample was a different piece of the same EOM from one of the 3 donors. All four strabismic samples were independent samples.
