TITLE
Global analysis of genome, transcriptome and proteome reveals the response to aneuploidy in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extra chromosome copies markedly alter the physiology of eukaryotic cells, but the underlying reasons are not well understood. We created human trisomic and tetrasomic cell lines and determined the quantitative changes in their genome, transcriptome and proteome in comparison to their diploid counterparts.

DESIGN
Aneuploid cell lines derived from HCT116 and RPE-1 cell lines were compared to their diploid counterparts; per study, 3 biological replicates have been performed.
