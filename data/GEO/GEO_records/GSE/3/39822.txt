TITLE
Post-transcriptional regulation by Alu within mRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An extrachromosomal replication system was established to examine the perturbation of Alu-carrying genes in response to elevated Alu RNAs in the opposite direction. The null hypothesis is that the Alu-carrying RNA duplex cannot trigger subsequent post-transcriptional regulation, manifesting a random perturbation of expression levels.

DESIGN
Comparing HEK293 cells transfected and not-transfected with pDR2-Alu vectors.
