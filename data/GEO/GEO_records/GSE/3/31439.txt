TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Human Supragingival Dental Plaque Microbiome from 19 Twin Pairs with and without Dental Caries

ORGANISM
human oral metagenome

SUMMARY
The study aims to assess gene expression in plaque samples collected from twin pairs that are both concordant and discordant with respect to dental Caries diagnosis.   File Naming Conventions are as follows:    Patient ID : 4 digit identifier    Diagnosis : Caries Negative(CN) or Caries Positive(CP)    Type of Twin: Monozygotic(MZ)or Dizygotic(DZ)    Pair to xxxx: 4 digit twin identifier maps to the Patient ID    E.g: 2126_CP_MZ_PairTo_2125_fastqc - 2126 is a caries positive patient and pairs to monozygotic twin pair 2125. Plaque samples from twin pairs that are both concordant and discordant with respect to dental Caries diagnosis are enriched for bacterial messenger RNA to study the gene expression differences in the samples.
