TITLE
Expression data from primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to define the genes associated with PCNSL patient survival. Expression profiling was performed on 34 PCNSLs. A gene classifier was developed.

DESIGN
Thirty-four PCNSL patients were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
