TITLE
Analysis of the early transcriptome signature of infection of primary endothelial cells by Nipah virus vs. Nipah virus deleted for the expression of non-structural C protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic, negative strand RNA paramyxovirus that has recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious human disease. To study the poorly-understood role of nonstructural NiV proteins in NiV pathogenesis, we generated recombinant viruse lacking the expression of accesory NiV C protein (NiV∆C).

DESIGN
To analyse the molecular basis of NiV∆C attenuation we have used the gene microarray approach to study early changes of gene expression in infected primary human endothelial cells, which is a major cellular target of human NiV infection. We performed microarray gene expression profiling of NiV infected HUVEC cell (2 replicates), of uninfected HUVEC cell (2 replicates) and of NiV∆C infected HUVEC cell (2 replicates).
