TITLE
cDNA array 6800 genes (NIB) - HaCaT J10 3h - 0.5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huamn HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured to confluence (day10). Differentiated confluent cells were irradiated at 0.5 Gy or 2 Gy. RNA from irradiated cells was compared to RNA from non-irradiated reference cells in a dye-swap hybridization procedure 3 h after irradiation. Keywords = Human keratinocytes, gamma irradiation Keywords: dose response
