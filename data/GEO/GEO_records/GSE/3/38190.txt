TITLE
Comparative gene expression in the human limbus, conjunctiva and cornea

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To date, there is no specific marker for limbal epithelial stem cells. The identification of a marker that is expressed in the limbal epithelium but not in the cornea or conjunctiva epithelium has been a growing need. To search for limbal-specific marker(s), we performed preferential gene profiling in the limbus in direct comparison to that in the cornea and conjunctiva using microarray technique.

DESIGN
This study consisted of gene expression profiles comparing the limbus to the  cornea and conjunctiva.
