TITLE
Rice indica genome tiling experiments

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcribed regions of indica rice genome. A series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays that represent sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the chromosome were used to measure transcriptional activities. A total of  838,816 36mer oligonucleotide probes, positioned every 46 nt on average, were designed to interrogate the indica genome, respectively. The probes were synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of approximately 389,000 probes per slide. The arrays were hybridized with fluorescence-labeled cDNA reverse-transcribed from equal amounts of four selected poly(A)+ RNA populations, namely, seedling roots, seedling shoots, panicles, and suspension cultured cells of the respective rice subspecies.
