TITLE
The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins. (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Bacteroides

SUMMARY
Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are impacted by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans, and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks prior to, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks following consumption of a commercially-available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied prior to and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains.

DESIGN
73 samples total.  Evaluation of changes in a model community's metatranscriptome over time after exposure to a consortium of 5 fermented milk product (FMP) strains (40 samples); evaluation of the gene expression of the FMP strains in other in vitro conditions, including MRS medium (B. animalis subsp. lactis only, 4 samples) and a commercial FMP fermentation (all 5 strains, 6 samples); evaluation of the gene expression of native human microbiomes before and after the consumption of a commercial FMP (23 samples).
