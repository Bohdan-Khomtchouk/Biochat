TITLE
NaJAZh regulates a subset of defense responses against herbivores and counteracts developmental necrosis in Nicotiana attenuata plants

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of JAZh after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae.

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and irJAZh plants was measured at 2 hour after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae. Three independent experiments were performed with wild type plants and three independent experiments were performed with irJAZh plants. A total of 480 genes were identified as more the 2 fold differentially regulated in irJAZh plants compared to wild type plants.
