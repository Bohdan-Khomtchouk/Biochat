TITLE
miRNA profile of exosomes released from PC-3 cells compared to parent cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are any differences in miRNAs in exosomes secreted from the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and in parent cells, as well as to investigate whether there are any differences in miRNAs in cell lysates from PC-3 cells and the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1.
