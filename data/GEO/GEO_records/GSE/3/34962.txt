TITLE
Epigenetic profiling of WT and Ezh2-null MLL-AF9 murine leukemic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for H3K27me3 followed by Solexa sequencing in WT and Ezh2-null leukemic cells from primary and secondary recipients.

DESIGN
Leukemic cells from primary and secondary recipients of MLL-AF9-transduced WT and Ezh2-null cells were sorted for GFP and YFP expression and analyzed by Chip-Seq.
