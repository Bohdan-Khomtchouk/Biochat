TITLE
Expression data from wheat following Hessian fly larval attack.

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The Hessian fly (HF, Mayetiola destructor) is a biotrophic insect that interacts with wheat on a typical gene-for-gene basis. Identification of the genes which are differentially expressed during wheat-HF interactions may provide critical information to better understand the plant resistance mechanisms. Microarray analyses of transcripts, including those encoding various lipases, lipid transfer proteins, enzymes involved in oxylipin synthesis, and enzymes involved in wax and cutin synthesis, revealed that the abundance of many of these transcripts increased rapidly in resistant plants after HF attack, but did not change in susceptible plants. We conducted the genome-wide transcriptional analysis of gene expression to identify the genes from wheat plants which were differentially express during compatible and incompatible wheat-Hessian fly interactions at 6, 12, and 24 hrs.

DESIGN
Two wheat lines “Molly” and “Newton” were used in the experiment. Molly contains R gene H13 and have incompatible interaction with Hessian fly larvae whereas Newton is susceptible and has compatible interaction with Hessian fly larvae. Total RNA was extracted from larval feeding site which is 1.5-2 cm of the second leaf sheath and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Tissues were collected at three time points (6, 12, and 24 hr) after the Hessian fly egg hatching. The data obtained from each treatment were compared with the uninfested control within each wheat line under identical conditions.
