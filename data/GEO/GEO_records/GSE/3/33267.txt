TITLE
SCL005: icSARS CoV Urbani or icSARS deltaORF6 infections of the 2B4 clonal derivative of Calu-3 cells - Time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to compare transcriptomics of 2B4 cells (clonal derivative of Calu-3 cells) infected with either icSARS CoV or the icSARS deltaORF6 mutant.

DESIGN
Calu-3 cells were infected with either icSARS CoV or the icSARS deltaORF6 mutant at MOI of 5.0.  Cells samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 54, 60 or 72h post infection. Each infected sample was done in triplicate. (Triplicates are defined as 3 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates.)There are triplicate time-matched mock for each time point from the same cell stock as rest of samples. Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the mock infections. The NIAID Systems Virology Center
