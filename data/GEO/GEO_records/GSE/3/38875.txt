TITLE
Expression evolution in gene groups: Inferring non-neutral regulatory change in pathways from transcriptional profiling data

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces bayanus

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptomes of four Saccharomyces species, as well as pairwise hybrids between three of the species with S. cerevisiae

DESIGN
For pairwise comparisons between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and each of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, and S. bayanus, we performed 3'-end RNA-seq on RNA from each parent species and each interspecific hybrid.
