TITLE
Clostridium difficile CD630E JIR8094: growth 10h with 0.5% glucose in TY vs growth 10h in TY

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
transcriptionnal profiling of a C. difficile strain JIR8094 comparing growth 10h in 0.5% TY medium with growth 10h in TY medium

DESIGN
two-conditions experiments, 0.5% glucose TY for 10h vs TY for 10h, 4 biological replicates for each condition, in an indirect design using a 8h TY RNA preparation as Reference
