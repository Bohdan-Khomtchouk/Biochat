TITLE
comparison of mRNA expression among rat hepatoma cell lines with different metastatic ability

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To reduce cancer mortality, understanding of mechanisms of cancer metastasis is crucial. We have established 6 rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, which exhibit differing metastatic potential to the lung after inoculation into the tail veins of nude mice. Micorarray analysis of 4 kinds of HCC cells and rat normal liver tissue was performed to find a potent molecular target for prevention of cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
By the microarray analysis, mRNA expression was compared among two low-metastatic rat HCC cell lines (C5F and C6) and two high-metastatic rat HCC cell lines (N1 and L2) as well as non-treated rat liver tissue (as a reference sample).
