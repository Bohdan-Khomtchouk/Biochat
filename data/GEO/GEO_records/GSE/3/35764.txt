TITLE
Polyphenols protection against fructose overload

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To decipher the beneficial effects of Polyphenols on health, healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups and were submitted to either a red grape polyphenol rich extract supplemented diet (PP) or a placebo diet (PCB) during 8 weeks. Then they were submitted to a fructose load (3g/kg Fat Free Mass/day) during 7 days. Muscle biopsies were taken before the protocol, 8 weeks after PP or PCB diet and after the 7 days fructose load. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes regulated by fructose and to identify the mechanism of action of Polyphenols.

DESIGN
Healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups and were submitted to either a red grape polyphenol rich extract supplemented diet (PP) or a placebo diet (PCB) during 8 weeks. Then they were submitted to a fructose load (3g/kg Fat Free Mass/day) during 7 days. Muscle biopsies were taken before the protocol, 8 weeks after PP or PCB diet and after the 7 days fructose load. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes regulated by fructose and to identify the mechanism of action of Polyphenols. Ten biological replicates were processed for PP diet, nine for PCB diet.
