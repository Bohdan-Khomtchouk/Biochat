TITLE
Study of Cj0667 function in Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter

SUMMARY
In order to study the function of the Campylobacter jejuni Cj0667 gene, a series of experiments were carried out. Two strains were constructed: a Cj0667 knockout strain and a strain with a second copy over-expressing Cj0667 from an fdxA promoter. The transcriptomes of these were all compared to the wild-type strain. The arrays are all from RNA isolated in mid-exponential growth.
