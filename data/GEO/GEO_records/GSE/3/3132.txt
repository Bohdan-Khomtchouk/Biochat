TITLE
SSH-PCR dehydrated supraoptic nucleus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The magnocellullar neurons (MCNs) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus are the principle source of the neuropeptide hormone vasopressin (VP), which has a crucial role in osmoregulation. Physiological activation of the SON by dehydration results is a massive release of VP from stores in posterior pituitary axon terminals into the general circulation. By binding to V2-type receptors located in the kidney, VP decrease the amount of water lost in urine. Osmotic activation of the SON is accompanied by a dramatic morphological and functional remodelling. We have sought to understand the mechanistic basis of this plasticity in terms of the differential expression of genes. To identify such genes, we adopted a completely unbiased and global approach based on Suppressive Subtractive Hybridisation-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SSH-PCR) Using this method, we generated a library of clones putatively differentially expressed in control vs dehydrated SON. In order to rapidly screen this library, 1152 of these clones were subjected to microarray analysis, resulting in the identification of 459 differentially expressed clones, 56 of which were sequenced. Many of these clones are expressed sequences that are new to science. Four of these were shown by in situ hybridisation (ISH) to be significantly up- or down-regulated in the SON following dehydration. These genes may represent novel effectors or mediators of SON physiological remodelling. Keywords: dehydrated, SON, clone
