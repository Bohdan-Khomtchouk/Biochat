TITLE
Microarray analysis of the migrating human CD4+ T cell population from the spleen of humanized mice in response to treatment with Teplizumab or hIg

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes expressed by cells that leave the spleen, the spleens were harvested from untreated reconstituted humanized mice (N=4) and a single cell suspension was prepared . The cultures were treated with either teplizumab (anti human CD3 hOKT3g1(Ala-Ala))  or hIg for 18 hrs in vitro. Splenocytes were also harvested 18 hrs after reconstituted mice (N=4) were treated with teplizumab in vivo. The humanized mice used where NOD/SCID IL2gc-/- (NSG) reconstituted with human CD34+ at birth.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained form sorted human CD4 splenocytes 18 hours post treatment. Comparsons were made between the treatment groups.
