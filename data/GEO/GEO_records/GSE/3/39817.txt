ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The medial and cardiac lobes of the right lung and whole right lung of (initially) 10-12 week old C57BL/6 mice were transcriptome profiled at days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 post left pneumonectomy, with day 0 being pre-pneumonectomy, and an additional day 56 post sham surgery to control for 8 week aging post left pneumonectomy.
