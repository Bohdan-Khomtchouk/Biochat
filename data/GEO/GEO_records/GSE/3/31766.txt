TITLE
Defl1 knockdown gene expression in Zebrafish 12.5 hpf embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on tail bud stage morphants and stage-matched control injected embryos in order to determine any global gene expression changes occurring as a result of defbl1 knockdown.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates per treatment on single dye Agilent Array
