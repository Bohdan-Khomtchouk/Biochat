TITLE
Characterization of exosomes from highly metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma line: ASML and a CD44v kd of ASML based on their miRNA content

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing the miRNA profile of exosomes from ASML vs ASML CD44v kd pancreatic adenocarcinoma line revealed that the expression level of 33 from the 40 most abundant miRNA differed significantly between ASMLwt and ASML-CD44vkd exosomes
