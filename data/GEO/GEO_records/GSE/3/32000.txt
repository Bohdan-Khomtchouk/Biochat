TITLE
Expression data from granulocytic MDSC cultured with T cells in the absence of IFNgamma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid derived Suppressor cells (MDSC) are heterogenous popluation of cells consists of two major subsets namely the monocytic Gr-1dull/int. and granulocytic (Gr-1high). These distinct two subsets use different mechanism to inhibit T cell response. In addition, how the function of these subsets is regulated is not known yet. The Gr-1dull/int. MDSC are suppressing T cells through IFNg dependent nitric oxide dependent manner. However, the exact suppressive mechanism of Gr-1high MDSC is not clear. Here we studied the role of a cytokine IFNg on the suppressive function of Gr-1high MDSC by comparing the gene expression of Gr-1high cells cultured alone versus those cultured with T cells which donot produce IFNgamma.

DESIGN
CD11b+Gr-1high cells were purified from the splenocyte of CT-26 colon tumor bearing mice. The purified CD11b+Gr-1high MDSCs were cultured with IFNg-/- antigen specific T cells and re- sorted after 48h and RNA was extracted and gene expression was analyzed using topic-defined PIQORTM Immunology Microarrays.
