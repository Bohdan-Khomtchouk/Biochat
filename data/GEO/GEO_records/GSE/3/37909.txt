SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Georgi K. Marinov (data coordination/informatics/experimental), Diane Trout (informatics) Brian Williams (experimental)). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). RNA-seq is a method for mapping and quantifying the transcriptome of any organism that has a genomic DNA sequence assembly (Mortazavi et al., 2008). RNA-seq is performed by reverse-transcribing an RNA sample into cDNA, followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing, which was done here on the Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The transcriptome measurements shown on these tracks were performed on polyA selected RNA ( ) from total cellular RNA ( ). PolyA-selected RNA was fragmented by magnesium-catalyzed hydrolysis and then converted into cDNA by random priming and amplified. Paired-end 2x100 bp reads were obtained from each end of a cDNA fragment. Reads were aligned to the mm9 human reference genome using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009), a program specifically designed to align RNA-seq reads and discover splice junctions de novo.
