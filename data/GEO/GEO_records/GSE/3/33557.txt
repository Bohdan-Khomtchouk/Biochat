TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of Wnt signalling in human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comprehensive expression analysis of Wnt signaling genes was performed in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and tissue specimens using TaqMan low density arrays. The effect of DNA methylation on gene expression was investigated using DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR. Tissue specimens from a range of disease states were used to represent the stepwise progression of prostate cancer, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), histologically benign epithelium adjacent to tumor (HB), pre-invasive high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and primary localized tumors categorized into low- and high-grade disease. Fifteen Wnt signaling related genes were idenified with significantly altered expression in prostate cancer; the majority of which were upregulated in tumors. Notably, histologically benign tissue from men with prostate cancer appeared more similar to tumour (r=0.76) than to BPH (r=0.57) (P < 0.001). Overall, the expression profile was highly similar between tumors of high (≥7) and low (≤6) Gleason scores. Pharmacological demethylation of PC-3 cells reactivated 38 genes (≥2-fold); 40% of which inhibit Wnt signaling.
