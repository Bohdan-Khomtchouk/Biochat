TITLE
QTL-region-specific microrrays reveal differential expression of signaling pathways associated with the liability for the inverted teat defect

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The inverted teat defect is an inherited disorder characterised by the failure of teats to protrude from the udder surface. The number and identity of relevant genes are unknown. Simultaneously, 1,587 probe-sets were screened, of which some 1,000 had present calls and were analysed for differential expression between mesenchymal and epithelial tissue of three categories of teats, i.e. normal teats of non-affected (NN) and affected animals (AN) and inverted teats (AI) of the later.

DESIGN
RNAs of mesenchymal and epithelial teat tissues of 5 non-affected and 5 affected animals were hybridized to custom-designed application-specific array.
