TITLE
Meta-analysis of global transcriptomics of Quercetin and Tannic acid exposed C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Recent research has highlighted that the polyphenols Quercetin (Q) and Tannic acid (TA) are capable of extending the lifespan of C. elegans. To gain a deep understanding of the underlying molecular genetics, we analyzed the global transcriptional patterns of nematodes exposed to Quercetin or Tannic acid concentrations that are non-effective (in lifespan extension), lifespan extending or toxic.

DESIGN
The global transcriptome was compared in wild type nematodes raised in the presence of 0, 50, 100, and 200 µM Quercetin (Q) or 0, 100, 200, and 300 µM Tannic acid (TA).
