TITLE
Overexpression of cSki in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Human cSki was overexpressed using MIGR1 retrovirus in sorted murine Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells. Cells were infected and cultured for 2 days after infection prior to isolation of GFP+ve cells and microarray. GFP+ve MIGR1 and cSKI cells were compared. Each sample represents an independent infection with either cSki or MIGR1

DESIGN
Comparison of GFP+ve LKS+ infected with MIGR1 and cSki
