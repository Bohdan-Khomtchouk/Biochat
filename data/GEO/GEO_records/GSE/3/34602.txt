TITLE
Expression data from 3 gamma-secretase or mock-treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified recurrent NOTCH1 mutations in 12% of MCLs. 2 out of 10 tested MCL cell lines (Rec-1 and SP-49) were sensitive to inhibition of the NOTCH pathway by gamma-secretase inhibition. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptional targets of NOTCH signaling in MCL.

DESIGN
3 MCL cell lines (Mino, Rec-1, SP-49 treated with Mock or 1 micromolar compound E for 24 hours, in duplicate.
