TITLE
Comparative analysis of 10 week and 5 week Bitransgenic mice (LH mouse crossed with MMTV-neu mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes that may facilitate early steps of ErbB2/Neu-mediated mammary tumorigenesis, we performed comparative microarray analysis of 5- and 10-week bitransgenic mammary glands (LHxMMTV-neu) in triplicate. Keywords: transgenic mouse, erbB2, MMTV-neu, HER2, mammary tumor, breast cancer
