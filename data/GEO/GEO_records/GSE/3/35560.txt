TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of transgenic ALK^F1174L/MYCN vs. MYCN tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ALK^F1174L mutation is associated with intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib and cosegregates with MYCN in neuroblastoma. In this study, we generated a mouse model overexpressing ALK^F1174L in the neural crest. Comapred to mice expressing ALK^F1174L or MYCN alone, combined expression of the two aberrations led to development of neuroblastoma with a shorter latency and higher penetrance. Here, we evaluated the transcriptional profiles of MYCN-driven neuroblastomas with or without the expression of ALK^F1174L to determine the pathogenic consequences of the ALK^F1174L/MYCN interaction in neuroblastoma.

DESIGN
10 mice were analysed in this study. Five ALK^F1174L/MYCN tumors were compared with five MYCN tumors. Total RNA was extracted, samples were labeled and processed using the Agilent Low Input Quick Amp two color Cy3(sample) and Cy5 (mouse reference) labeling kit and hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression arrays.
