TITLE
Expression data from human cancer cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to profile gene expression of NCCIT cells to study the link between epigenetic modifications and gene transcription.

DESIGN
Extract total RNA to examine gene expression of NCCIT cells in the undifferentiated and differentiated states.
