TITLE
Microarray analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the Hsp90 mutant hsc82-W296A

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Altered mRNA levels of HBT1 were observed in S. cerevisiae cells expressing hsc82-W296A compared to WT HSC82. We conducted microarray analysis to determine the extent of other changes in that strain.
