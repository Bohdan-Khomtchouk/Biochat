TITLE
Analysis of differential genetic expression by moderate-carbohydrate restriction diet with calorie restriction mimetic multiple phytochemicals (MCDmp) using a transgenic liver cancer model developed by a simple hydrodynamic transfection method.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed survival analysis of control and MCDmp groups, and explored underlying tumor suppression mechanisms after dietary intervention, focused on alterations in the energy-dependent signaling pathways, and global gene expression differences on cDNA microarray study.

DESIGN
Five- week- old male C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed control diet (control group, LabDiet, Brentwood, MO, USA) or MCDmp formula (Treat group) in a specific pathogen free zone. All procedures were approved by the institutional animal use and care committee. Following a preliminary feeding of each diet formula for two week, HrasG12V / shp53 / GFP4 gene containing transposon vector were injected into mouse tail vein by hydrodynamic injection method. After 4 weeks of diet supplementation, all mice were sacrificed. Mouse liver tissue was excised for microarray analysis.
