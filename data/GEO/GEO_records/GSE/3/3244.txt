TITLE
Muscle Satellite Cells: MyoD and p53 genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle satellite cells are a self-renewing pool of stem cells that give rise to daughter myogenic precursor cells in adult skeletal muscle. Published and preliminary data indicated that MyoD and p53 genes are involved in satellite cell differentiation. We would like to know what downstream genes of both transcription factors are affected in satellite cell-derived myoblasts (MyoD-/-, p53 -/-). Keywords: other
