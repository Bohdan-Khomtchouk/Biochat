Cockayne syndrome (CSB) fibroblasts

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder with progeroid features. Although the genes responsible for CS have been implicated in a variety of DNA repair- and transcription-related pathways, the nature of the molecular defect in CS remains mysterious. We sought to define this defect by expression analysis of cells lacking functional CSB, a SWI/SNF-like ATPase that is responsible for most CS cases. Keywords: primary disease rescue
