TITLE
Effects of plasmids transfection on the RO82_W1 human thyroid cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identifiy cellular pathways modified by RO82_W1 cell transfection with PRC, ERRalpha or PRC+ERRalpha plamids relative to transfection with PGl3 plasmid

DESIGN
In duplicate, cells transfected with PRC, ERRalpha or PRC+ERRalpha plamids during 48h compared to PGl3 treated cells
