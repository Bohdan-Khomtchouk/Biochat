TITLE
Transcriptome-Wide Binding Sites for Components of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Non-poly(A) termination Pathway: Nrd1, Nab3 and Sen1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report here the transcriptome-wide distribution of yeast Rpb2, Sen1, Nrd1 and Nab3 binding sites. These data sets provide highresolution definition of non-poly(A) terminators, identify novel genes regulated by attenuation of nascent transcripts close to the promoter, and demonstrate the widespread occurrence of Nrd1-bound 3'-antisense transcripts on genes that are poorly expressed. In addition, we show that Sen1 does not cross-link to many expected ncRNAs but surprisingly binds to pre-mRNA transcripts suggesting a role in 3' end formation and/or termination.

DESIGN
Six samples by adaptation of PAR-ClIP procedure
