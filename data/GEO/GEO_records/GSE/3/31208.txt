TITLE
Expression data of MCK conditional frataxin knock-out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Frataxin deficiency in human is the cause of Friedreich's ataxia (FA), a lethal neuro- and cardio-degenerative disease. Knock-out (KO) mice of this mouse model of FA exhibit classical cardiomyopathy of the patients. The onset of FA phenotypes in the KO mice is approximately 6-7 weeks of age. This genearray analysis was conducted to examine the changes in gene expression in the heart of KO mice relative to their wild-type (WT) littermates at 4- and 10-weeks of age. At 10-weeks of age, the KO mice begin to die from severe cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN
RNA from the heart of four female 4-week-old MCK littermates (two WT and two KO) and four female 10-week-old MCK littermates (two WT and two KO) was extracted and hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
