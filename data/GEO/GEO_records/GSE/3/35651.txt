TITLE
Gene expression profile of ATF6a and ATF6b knockout mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the role of ATF6a and ATF6b in non-canonical endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway, we have employed whole genome  microarray expression profiling to identify the genes regulated by ATF6s. WIild type or, ER stress mediators,ATF6a or ATF6b-knockout mice were treated with 3% DSS for 3days. Genes responsible for DSS in each mediator-dependent manner were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology. Among them, expression of three cell structure-related genes (Muc2, Muc3, Muc4) was quantified in the RNA samples from another mice treated with DSS by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Colitis was induced with 3% DSS, 36,000-50,000 M.W. (MP Biomedicals,) in the drinking water for 3 days. Genes responsible for DSS treatment in each mediator-dependent manner were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology in GeneRanker program of Genomatix platform.
