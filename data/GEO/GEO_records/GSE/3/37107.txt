TITLE
Genome-wide transcription analysis of whole blood prior to rituximab treatment in relation to clinical response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cell depletion therapy is efficacious in RA patients failing on TNF blocking agents. However, approximately 40-50% of the rituximab-treated RA patients have a poor response. We investigated wheter baseline gene expression levels can discriminate between clinical nonresponders and responders to rituximab

DESIGN
Whole blood total RNA is isolated from PAXgene tubes obtained prior to start of rituximab treatment
