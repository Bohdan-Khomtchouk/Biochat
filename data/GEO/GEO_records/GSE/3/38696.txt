TITLE
Gene expression in mouse germinal center light zone and dark zone B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays of gene expression in mouse germinal center light zone and dark zone B cells sorted according to the expression of cell surface molecules CD83 and CXCR4 We used microarray data to identify genes differentially expressed by B cells in the light and dark zones of germinal centers from mouse skin-draining lymph nodes 12 days after subcutaneous immunization with NP-OVA in alum.

DESIGN
Germinal center B cells (B220+CD38-CD95+) were sorted from immunized mouse lymph nodes into light zone (CXCR4hi/CD83lo) and dark zone (CXCR4lo/CD83hi) populations, from which RNA was extracted
