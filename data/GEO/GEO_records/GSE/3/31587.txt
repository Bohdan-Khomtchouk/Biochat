TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler accession) phytochrome phyABCDE quintuple mutant and phyABDE quadruple mutant in response to red light, and their comparison to WT expression data

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Phytochromes are red/far-red light photoreceptors. We sought to test at the transcriptomic level if Arabidopsis mutants lacking all phytochromes (from phyA to phyE), or just retaining trace levels of phyC, had transcriptional response to red light exposure.

DESIGN
phyABCDE and phyABDE mutants were grown for 4 days in darkness (D), or under continuous red light at 50 µmol m-2 s-1 (R50), or in darkness followed by 2 hr of red light exposure on day 4 (DR2h). Differentially expressed genes of the mutants in response to red light were compared to those of wild type obtained previously {Hu et al. (2009) Molecular Plant, 2: 166-182}. Three biological replicates were employed for dark and Rc-grown samples, and 2 biological replicates for DR2h samples, thus 8 samples were used for each mutant genotype. It needs to be pointed out that 5 of the 6 WT samples (from WT-D-2 to WT-R50-2) had previously been deposited with GEO accessions GSM226267, GSM226268, GSM226269, GSM226278 and GSM226279. Their cRNA samples were synthesized and labeled with the Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis kits (One-cycle target labeling and control reagents). They are included in this series of study for convenient comparison, with newly assigned accessions from GSM784837 to GSM784841. The more recent GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix) was used to synthesize and label aRNA for one new WT sample (WT-D-1)(GSM784836) and all mutant samples.
