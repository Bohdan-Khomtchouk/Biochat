TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiles from mature gonad tissues of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus Thynnus in the Gulf of Mexico

ORGANISM
Thunnus thynnus

SUMMARY
The aim of this investigation was to compare transcription profiles from the ovaries and testes of mature T. thynnus to establish sex specific variations underlying their reproductive physiology.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, testis vs ovarian tissue. Biological replicates 4 male testes and 4 female ovaries.
