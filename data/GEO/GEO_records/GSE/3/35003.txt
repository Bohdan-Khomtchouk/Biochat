TITLE
Gene expression in control and cilia deleted growth plate chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proliferative zone chondrocytes were microdissected from control and Ift88-deleted growth plates to determine gene expression profiles regulated by primary cilia.

DESIGN
Four total samples were analyzed. Two biological replicates of proliferative zone chondrocytes microdissected from control mice and two biological replicates from Ift88 deleted (Col2aCre;Ift88fl/fl) mice. Control and experimental mice were in the Bl/6 background.
