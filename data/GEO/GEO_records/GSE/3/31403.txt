TITLE
Clinically Relevant Subsets Identified by Gene Expression Patterns Support a Revised Ontogenic Model of Wilms Tumor: A Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Favorable Histology WTs (FHWT) are genetically heterogeneous and the pathogenesis for the majority is not known; therefore,  we sought to identify and characterize distinctive subsets within FHWT and to place each subset within their clinical and developmental context.
