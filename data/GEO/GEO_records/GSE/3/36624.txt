TITLE
defenses mechanism in response to cold stress-PI4kinases and Long-chain bases kinases in response to cold stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-10_froid - defenses mechanism in response to cold stress - Role of PI4 kinase and Long-chain bases kinases in response to cold stress - Plantlets of wild type and mutant were grown vitro for 14 days in a growth chamber (80% humidity, 80 micro Enstein without photoperiod). The 15th day, plantlets were transferred at 4°C or 12°C during 4 hours (80 micro Enstein) for the cold stress.

DESIGN
14 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
