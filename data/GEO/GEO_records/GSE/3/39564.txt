SUMMARY
Transducin-like enhancer protein 1 mediates estrogen receptor binding and transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells

DESIGN
TLE1 silenced breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines or control siRNA in the presence of Estrogen or a vehicle. MCF-7 cells were hormone-depleted for 3 d and treated with 100 nM estrogen (or vehicle) for 6 h. There were six biological replicates for each of the four different groups.
