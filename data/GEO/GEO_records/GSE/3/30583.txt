TITLE
Expression data from rice leaves treated or not with fungal elicitors and high-throughput pyrosequencing of endogenous small RNAs from Oryza sativa

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from rice was used to identify distinct miRNAs that are responsive to elicitors from the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. [Expression profiling by array] We used microarrays to determine the expression behaviour of target genes for elicitor-regulated miRNAs. [High throughput sequencing] High-throughput sequencing of rice small RNAs was performed in two different tissues, leaves and roots, and two different time point of elicitor treatment, 30' and 2h Amplicons were prepared by 5´and 3´adaptor ligation in which the 5'-adaptor contained a 'barcode' consisting of a 4-nucleotide identifier sequence for each sample. The libraries containing unique barcodes were combined and subjected to pyrosequencing (454 Life SciencesTM, Roche)
