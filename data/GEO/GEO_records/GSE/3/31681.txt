TITLE
Human cumulus cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cumulus cells (CCs) are biologically distinct from other follicular cells and perform specialized roles, transmitting signals within the ovary and supporting oocyte maturation during follicular development. The Affymetrix 3â€™ IVT express protocol was used to prepare cRNA (one-cycle amplification) with a starting concentration of 100 ng of total RNA To compare groups of CCs at different stages of oocyte nuclear maturation, a Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was performed.

DESIGN
CC samples were issued from oocyte at germinal vesicle (CCGV), stage metaphase I (CCMI) and stage metaphase II (CCMII)
