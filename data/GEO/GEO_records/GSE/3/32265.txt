TITLE
Gene-expression changes resulting from loss of the mTORC1 component Raptor in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-enriched populations (HSPC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of mTORC1 in murine hematopoiesis by conditionally deleting the Raptor gene in murine hematopoietic stem cells. We observed mutliple alterations evoked by Raptor loss in hematopoiesis and profiled gene-expression alterations induced by raptor loss in Flt3-Lin-Sca1+cKit+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor enriched cell populations, 5 weeks post Raptor deletion.

DESIGN
Flt3-Lin-Sca1+cKit+ cells were flow sorted from mice containing homozygous floxed alleles for exon 6 of the Raptor gene in the presence (MT group) or absence (WT group) of the MxCre transgene, which was induced with injections of mice with pIpC 5 weeks before cell isolation.
