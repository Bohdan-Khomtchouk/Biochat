TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood  - blood draws at Pre and Post time points of Allergen inhalation challenge (PAX.NGR and EDTA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine differential gene expression in peripheral blood of asthmatic individuals undergoing allergen inhalation challenge, post-challenge compared to pre-challenge

DESIGN
Blood was collected immediately prior to, and two hours after challenge The 8 PAXgene non-globin reduced (PAX.NGR) samples were combined with 10 EDTA samples (n=9) for one analysis (PAX.NGR+EDTA) comparing gene expression in whole blood between pre and post challenge using the following covariates: tube type, sex, age, PC20 at pre-challenge, and FEV1 after onset and 2h post challenge and the RNA integrity number. Preprocessing and filtering were applied to the PAX.NGR+EDTA dataset using the Factor Analysis for Robust MicroArray Summarization (farms) package in R The Linear Models for MicroArrays (limma) package was used to determine differential gene expression using a Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 5%.
