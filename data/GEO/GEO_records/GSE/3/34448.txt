SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Piero Carninci ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track shows 5' cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) tags and clusters in RNA extracts ( ) from different sub-cellular localizations ( ) in multiple cell lines ( ). A CAGE cluster is a region of overlapping tags with an assigned value that represents the expression level. The data in this track were produced as part of the ENCODE Transcriptome Project. Release 2 has three new downloads only files per experiment (Clusters, TSS Gencode 7 and TSS HMM) and four new cell lines (A459, AG04450, BJ and SK-N-SH_RA). Release 1 on hg19 contained the original data on hg18 ( ) that was remapped and indicated in this release as Generation 0 since that data had no replicates. If there is both old and new generation data available for a particular experiment, only the new generation data is displayed and the older data is available for download. The new data for this track was done with a different process and has standard replicate numbers. The replicate labeling in the genome browser view is a counter indicating the total number of replicates submitted. The producing lab has replicate numbers that correspond to their internal bio-replicate numbering. Where these two numbering systems conflict, both are listed in the long label of the specific track.
