TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis suggests novel therapeutic targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns in tissue from control individuals is similar to non-ulcerated tissue from afflicted individuals, whereas marked differences were observed in ulcerated materials. Gene expression differences in ulcerated tissues provide clues to potential treatment options.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between normal tissue from control individuals and ulcer and non-ulcer tissue from afflicted individuals.
