TITLE
Genome-wide enrichment of Gcn5 and H3K18/H4K16 acetylation under physiological change of stress adaptation and stress recovery

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The data provide information of Gcn5 enrichment, H3K18 and H4K16 acetylation level and Histone H3 density  for 5 different physioloigcal conditions during stress adpatation and stress recovery  (normal growth, during stress adaptation, after stress adaptation, under stress recovery, after stress recovery) in yeast. The purpose of the study is to understand how histone acetyltransferase HATs (Gcn5) apply it is function in gene regulation by changing global or local histone acetylation level under different physiological conditions.

DESIGN
Gcn5 enrichment, H3K18 and H4K16 acetylation level and Histone H3 density are mearured and compared to input signal for 5 different physioloigcal conditions (normal growth, during stress adaptation, after stress adaptation, under stress recovery, after stress recovery). Replicates are used.
