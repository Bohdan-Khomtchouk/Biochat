TITLE
Immortalized clonal brown, beige and white adipose cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brown fat generates heat via the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1, defending against hypothermia and obesity. Recent data suggest that there are two distinct types of brown fat: classical brown fat derived from a myf-5 cellular lineage and UCP1-positive cells that emerge in white fat from a non-myf-5 lineage. Here, we report the isolation of “beige” cells from murine white fat depots.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of the differentiated clonal inguinal and interscapular adipocytes in the presence of forskolin (10microM). These samples were profiled using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays, 26 samples in total.
