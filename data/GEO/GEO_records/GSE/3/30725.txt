TITLE
hcf-1(-) transcriptional profiling

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify genes regulated by HCF-1 in a daf-16-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Samples from young adult worms were hybridized to Agilent microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in hcf-1(pk924)/daf-16(mgDf47);hcf-1(pk924) and compared to hcf-1(pk924)/N2 arrays.
