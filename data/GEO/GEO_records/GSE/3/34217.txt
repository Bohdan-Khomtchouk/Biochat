TITLE
Expression profile of miR-17-92a-MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1 transduced P14 CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During acute viral infections, effector CD8+ T cells differentiate into memory precursors or short-lived terminal effectors. miR-17-92a over-expression skews CD8+ effector cells to the terminal differentiation. We used microarray to identify the genes that are differentially expressed caused by miR-17-92a over-expression.

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells from P14 TCR transgenic mice were infected with miR-17-92a-MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1 vector and transfer to C57BL6 recipients. Chimeras were infected with LCMV Armstrong. Thy1.1+ miR-17-92a-MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1 transduced P14 cells and Thy1.1- non-transduced P14 cells were sorted by FACS. RNA was extracted from samples, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
