TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Ler), ebs and shl-2 mutants grown in SD conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed a tranascriptomic analysis of Ler, ebs and shl-2 plants in order to reveal targets whose transcription is regulated by EBS and SHL.

DESIGN
The analysis was performed in WT plants (Ler), as well as mutants plants in which the expression of EBS and SHL was previously shown to be null, namely ebs and shl-2 mutant. To perform this study, plants were grown for 18 days under short days (SD) conditions (8h light, 16h darkness) in MS solid media. Three independent biological samples were hybridized separately.
