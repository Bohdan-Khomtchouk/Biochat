TITLE
Expression analysis of D. melanogaster selected for contrasting life histories

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Study of transcriptome level changes in Drosophila melanogaster populations with divergent reproduction and lifespan patterns

DESIGN
A 120 chip study using mRNA recovered from unmated female fruit flies 35 generations after selection for contrasting life history traits. The study includes samples from five age classes and two tissues of flies derived from three replicated populations.
