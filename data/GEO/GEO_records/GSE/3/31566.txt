TITLE
Pre-miR-375_A549 vs. Pre-miR-NC#2 (Ambion) _A549

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the functional significance of ASH1-inducible miR-375 in terms of biologic phenotypes of ASH1-positive lung cancer cells. To this end, we conducted genome-wide expression profiling analysis of miR-375-transfected A549 cells.
