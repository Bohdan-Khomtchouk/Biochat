TITLE
Transcriptional programs activated by exposure of human prostate cancer cells to androgen.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgens are required for both normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis.  We used DNA microarrays, representing approximately 18,000 genes, to examine the temporal program of gene expression following treatment of the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP with a synthetic androgen.  We observed statistically significant changes in levels of transcripts of more than 500 genes.  Many of these genes were previously reported androgen targets, but most were not previously known to be regulated by androgens.  The androgen-induced expression programs in 3 additional androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell lines, and in 4 androgen-independent subclones derived from LNCaP, shared many features with those observed in LNCaP, but some differences were observed.  A remarkable fraction of the genes induced by androgen appeared to be related to production of seminal fluid and these genes included many that play roles in protein folding, trafficking, and secretion.  Prostate cancer cell lines retain features of androgen responsiveness that reflect normal prostatic physiology. These results provide a broad view of the effect of androgen signaling on the transcriptional program in these cancer cells, and a foundation for further studies of androgen action Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
