TITLE
MicroRNA expression in subcutaneous and visceral fat of beef steers fed different high or low fat diets

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are a class of molecular regulators found to participate in numerous biological processes, including adipogenesis. However, whether dietary changes impact on microRNA (miRNA) in ruminants has not been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the dietary effect on miRNA expression in subcutaneous (backfat) and visceral fat depots (perirenal fat) from beef steers fed with different diets containing high or low fat levels. Fat tissues were collected from 16 Hereford x Aberdeen Angus cross bred steers (15.5 month old) fed high fat diet (5.85% fat, n=8) or control diet (1.95% fat, n=8). Total RNA from each animal was subjected to miRNA microarray analysis using a customized Agilent miRNA microarray containing 672 bovine miRNA probes. Expression of miRNAs was not equally detected under two diets; 169 miRNAs were commonly expressed while 75 were diet specific. The number of miRNAs detected per animal under high fat diet was higher than those fed control diet (p= 0.037 in subcutaneous fat and p= 0.002 in visceral fat).. Further qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of some miRNAs was highly influenced by diet (miR-19a, -92a, -92b, -101, -103, -106, -142-5p, and 296) or fat depot (miR-196a and -2454). Our results revealed that the miRNA expression can be influenced by types of fat tissues or diet, suggesting that miRNAs may regulate bovine adipogenesis when diet alters.

DESIGN
In this study, a total of 32 adipose tissue samples were analyzed by microRNA microarrays, being 16 subcutaneus (backfat) and 16 visceral (perirenal fat) fat depots were collected from 16 animals (Control diet = 8) (High fat diet = 8).
