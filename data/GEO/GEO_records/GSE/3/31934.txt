TITLE
To examine the expression of Sulf1 and Sulf2, as well as other glycan-related genes, in human Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs compared to normal lung samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis to examine glycan-related gene expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulf1 and Sulf2) remove 6-O sulfate groups from heparan sulfate intra-chain sites on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, and modulate the functions of many growth factors and morphogens including FGF, Wnt and TGF-beta. Works from our laboratory have shown that TGF-beta 1 induces Sulf1 and Sulf2 expression in a cell-type specific manner in the lung, specifically Sulf1 in lung fibroblasts and Sulf2 in type II alveolar epithelial cells. Interestingly TGF-beta 1-induced Sulf1 and Sulf2 in turn modulate TGF-beta 1 function in culture.

DESIGN
The aim of this study is to examine the expression of Sulf1 and Sulf2 as well as other glycan-related genes (heparan biosynthetic enzymes, TGF-beta, FGF and Wnt signaling pathway components) in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs compared to normal lung samples. We will examine gene expression in triplicate samples from RNA of total lung homogenates from IPF and control (normal) lungs
