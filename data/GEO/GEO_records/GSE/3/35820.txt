TITLE
Expression Analysis of Macrodactyly

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrodactyly is a rare family of congenital disorders characterized by the diffuse enlargement of 1 or more digits. To date, no genes or loci have been implicated in the development of macrodactyly.  In this study, we performed the first transcriptional profiling of macrodactyly tissue.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from tissue samples from 4 macrodactyly patients and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
