TITLE
Effects of Cellular Senescence on Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we analyzed the effect of cellular senescence on the transcriptome of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC; alternatively named mesenchymal stromal cells) from bone marrow. Human MSC were isolated from femoral heads of non-osteoporotic donors after total hip arthroplasty.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from human bone marrow according to the previously described protocol (Noth et al., 2002, J Orthop Res, 20/5, 1060-1069) under agreement of the local Ethics Committee of the University of WÃ¼rzburg. Bone marrow was obtained of femoral heads after total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis and/or hip dysplasia. MSC were replated after reaching 70-90% confluence until they entered state of cellular senescence.  RNA samples of control cells were taken from passage 1 or passage 2.
