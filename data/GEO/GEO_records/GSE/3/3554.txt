TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Retinal Gene Expression in the DBA/2J Model of Glaucoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The DBA/2J mouse is a model for secondary angle-closure glaucoma due to iris atrophy and pigment dispersion, which ultimately leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). We sought to correlate changes in retinal gene expression with glaucoma-like pathology by performing microarray analysis of retinal RNA from DBA/2J mice at 3 months before disease onset, and at 8 months, after IOP elevation. Methods: IOP was monitored monthly in DBA/2J animals by Tono-Pen and animals with normal (3 months) or elevated IOP (8 months) were identified. RNA was prepared from 3 individual retinas at each age, and the RNA was amplified and used to generate biotin-labeled probe for high density mouse Affymetrix arrays (U430.2). A subset of genes was selected for confirmation by quantitative RT-PCR using independent retina samples from DBA/2J animals at 3, 5 and 8 months of age, and compared to retinas from C57BL/6J control animals at 3 and 8 months. Results: There were changes in expression of 68 genes, with 32 genes increasing and 36 genes decreasing at 8 months versus 3 months. Upregulated genes were associated with immune response, glial activation, signaling and gene expression, while down-regulated genes included multiple crystallin genes. Significant changes in 9 upregulated genes and 2 downregulated genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, with some showing changes in expression by 5 months. Conclusions: DBA/2J retina shows evidence for glial activation and an immune-related response following IOP elevation, similar to what has been reported following acute elevation of IOP in other models. Keywords: retina, glaucoma, DBA/2J, elevated intraocular pressure
