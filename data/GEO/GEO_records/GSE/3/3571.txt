TITLE
Comparison of neural stem cell lines overexpressing Nurr1 to clonal controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 has been shown to be critical for the development of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Consequently, the development of ES cells overexpressing Nurr1 has raised hope for the development of cell replacement therapies for Parkinson's Disease to replace degenerated dopaminergic neurons.  However, the molecular consequences of Nurr1 on gene expression in these cells remain unknown.  To address this, stable, clonal, c17.2 neural stem cell lines were established that overexpressed the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (clone 42 & clone 48) or parental control cell line (puroB & puroD, respectively). Keywords: genetic modification
