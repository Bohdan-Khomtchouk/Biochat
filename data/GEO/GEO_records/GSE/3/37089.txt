TITLE
The influence of retinoic acid on immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HumanHT-12v4 microarray of cells in proliferation and differentiation conditions treated with or without 2 uM retinoic acid

DESIGN
Cells were treated with or without 2 uM retinoic acid, in proliferation (KSFM + 5 ng/ml EGF + 50 ug/ml bovine pituitary extract) and differentiation (DMEM/F12 + 10 ng/ml EGF + 10% FBS) media
