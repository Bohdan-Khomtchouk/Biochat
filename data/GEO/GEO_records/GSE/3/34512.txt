TITLE
PBEF Knockdown in HMVEC-LBI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study employed Affymetrix GeneChips to profile transcriptome of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with PBEFsiRNA to gain insight into transcriptional regulations of PBEF on the endothelial function. We isolated and labeled mRNAs from PBEF siRNA transfected HMVEC-L and hybridized them to Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 plus 2. Differentially expressed genes and canonical pathways were analyzed. Expressions of selected genes were validated by RT-PCR or western blotting. Several important themes are emerged from this study. First, PBEF induces the upregulation and downregulation of multiple genes in the endothelium. Expression of 373 genes were increased and 64 genes decreased by at least 1.3 fold in the PBEFsiRNA treated group compared to the control group of PBEFscRNA treated HMVEC-L. Second, the microarray results confirmed some previous reports of PBEF mediated gene expressions in some pathways but provided a more complete repertoire of molecules in those pathways. Third,  most of affected canonical pathways or differentially expressed genes in PBEF siRNA treated HMVEC-L over their controls  have not previously been reported to be PBEF-responsive. Our first transcriptome analysis of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells treated with PBEFsiRNA has provided important insights into the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in HMVEC-L cells by PBEF. Further in-depth follow-up analysis of the transcriptional regulation reported in this study may shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying PBEF mediated endothelial functions and dysfunctions in the physiology and the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions, cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease and provide new leads of therapeutic targets to those diseases.

DESIGN
6 sample microarray study - 3 replicates of the PBEF knockdown and 3 replicates of the SC RNA.
