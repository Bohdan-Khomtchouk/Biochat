TITLE
HSC-3 cells (control) vs. HSC-3-5 cells [tongue]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HSC-3-5 cells, which drived from human HSC-3 cells via transwell invasion assay was high invasive.Tumor cells were injected into the tongue of SCID mice. After 1 week, transcriptional profiling of human HSC-3 tumor comparing with high invasive HSC-3-5 tumor.  Goal was to determine the effects of invasion on global HSC-3-5 gene expression during tumor metastasis.

DESIGN
HSC-3 and HSC-3-5 oral cancer cells were respectively injected into the tongue of SCID mice. After 1 weeks, total RNA was respectively extracted from the tumor tissue on tongue of SCID mice for gene expression profiling during metastasis. Briefly, two-condition experiment,HSC-3 vs. HSC-3-5 cells.
