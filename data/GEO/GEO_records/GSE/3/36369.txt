TITLE
DNA methylation contributes to natural human variation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation analysis using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform (Illumina) of 96 Caucasian American, 96 Han Chinese American and 96 African American LCL samples determined differences in terms of differentially methylated sites. Importantly, the observed differences were confirmed in primary blood samples of 10 healthy Caucasian, 10 African American (GSE36064) and 10 Asian individuals. Genes associated to differentially methylated site suggest an influence of DNA methylation on phenotype differences. Interestingly, methylation differences could be partially traced back to genetic polymorphisms.
