TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of target genes for the systemic lupus erythematosus-associated transcription factors IRF5 and STAT4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IRF5 and STAT4 are strongly associated with human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we identified more than 7000 target genes for IRF5 and STAT4 in stimulated PBMCs. Contrarily, without stimulation IRF5 seemed to be inactive, and STAT4 only showed low levels of transcriptional regulatory activity.

DESIGN
Target genes of IRF5 and STAT4 were identified in human PBMCs with or without stimulation using ChIP-Seq.
