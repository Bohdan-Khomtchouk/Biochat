TITLE
[E-MTAB-831] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch VI

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing. This is batch VI, which targets annotations from Gencode 6 (November 2010) as well as transcript models predicted by the Ensembl Genebuild group based on the Illumina Human BodyMap 2.0 data.
