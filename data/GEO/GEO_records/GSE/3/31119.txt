TITLE
Expression profiling of mmi1 delta cells, using tiling microarray in S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We used tiling microarrays to identify up-regulated genes in mmi1 delta cells. Because these cells grow very poorly due to misexpression of mei4 gene, we combined mmi1 delta mutation to a partial deletion of mei4. Cells carrying only mei4 partial deletion were also analyzed in our transcriptomics to verify that variations observed in mmi1 delta cells are not due mei4 mutation.

DESIGN
RNA levels from S. pombe cells with only mei4 partial deletion (SPV481) or with mei4 partial deletion in combination with mmi1 delta deletion (SPV903) were compared to wild type cells (SPV8), using Affymetrix S. pombe Tiling 1.0FR microarrays. Two biological replicates were analyzed for each experiment.
