TITLE
Role of the ArcAB two-component system in oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S

SUMMARY
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium  is  a  Gram-negative  bacterium,  facultative anaerobe and  intracellular  pathogen  that  causes  enteric  fever  in  mice.  Once  orally  ingested, Salmonella  invades  and  traverse  the  mucosal  intestinal  epithelia,  where  it  is  phagocytized  by specialized  cells  including macrophages,  dendritic  cells  and  neutrophils. Within  these  cells,  the bacterium is kept in a compartment termed Salmonella containing vacuole where it is exposed to different adverse conditions including nutrient deprivation, acid pH, reactive oxygen (ROS) as well as nitrogen (RNS) species and low oxygen levels. Among the signals encountered by the bacteria, oxidative stress is one of the main challenges that it has to overcome in order to survive. In this context,  the OxyR  and SoxRS  proteins  are  the most  studied  regulators  involved  in  response  to ROS.  However,  in  the  past  years  growing  evidence  suggests  that  the  ArcAB  two-component system might play a key  role  in modulating gene expression  in response  to  ROS.  Furthermore,  the  global  regulator  ArcA  is  required  for  the  resistance  of Escherichia  coli, S.  Enteritidis and Typhimurium to hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2), however, the ArcA regulon under oxidative stress conditions remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this work was to demonstrate that ArcAB regulates the expression of genes in response to hydrogen peroxide and determine the ArcA regulon under this condition. To achieve this, we evaluated transcriptomic changes in strain 14028s, âˆ†arcA in response to H2O2.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from three biological replicates of wt and arcA mutant cultures exposed or unexposed to 1.5 mM hydrogen peroxide for 20 min in LB medium.
