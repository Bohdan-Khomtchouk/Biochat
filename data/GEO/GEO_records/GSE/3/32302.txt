TITLE
Genome-wide maps of polyadenylation sites in OPMD-model and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied deep-sequencing based technique, 3'-Seq, to obtain comprehansive maps of poly-A sites in OPMD-model mice expressing trePABPN1(A17) mutant and control mice

DESIGN
Examination of poly-A sites in control and OPMD-model mice (in two ages: 20 weeks and 12 months)
