TITLE
LAP2beta-induced change in gene expression in gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knock-down or overexpression of LAP2beta regulated migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vivo and in vitro studies. To investigate the underlying mechanism for LAP2beta-regulated migration and invasion, we compared the gene expression changes between the mock cells and the stable cells.
