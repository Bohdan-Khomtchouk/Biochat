TITLE
Prostate cancer specific gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify prostate cancer-specific gene expression, we have employed whole cDNA microarray expression profiling between benign prostate hypertrophy and prostate cancer. We performed needle biopsy of patients with prostatic hyperplasia who were suspected as prostate cancer for minor high level (4.0-10 ng/ml). As a result of needle biopsy, we used the tissue of patients with prostatic hyperplasia that prostate cancer was denied for cDNA microarry analysis. Furthermore, we also performed needle biopsy of patients that prostate cancer should have been strongly suspected because of high PSA. Needle biopsies were performed after we obtained informed consent from patients with the document approved from the Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile was determied in each of normal prostate samples and prostate cancer samples. Then the profiles were compared between normal prostate samples and prostate cancer samples.
