TITLE
Seedling transcriptome sequencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC founder accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have sequenced messenger RNA isolated from seedling tissue for 19 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (with biological replication).  The 19 accessions for which RNA-Seq reads were collected have served as the founders for the MAGIC lines, a high-resolution recombinant inbred line mapping resource.  RNA sequencing data was used to examine differential gene expression among the accessions.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in seedling tissue carried out using biological replicates.
