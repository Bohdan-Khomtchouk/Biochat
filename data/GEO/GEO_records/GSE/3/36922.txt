TITLE
PatE in transcriptional activation of acid-resistance pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain EDL933

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
An experiment to identify the downstream targets of PatE, a prophage encoded AraC-like transcriptional regulator, in transcriptional activation of acid-resistance pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain EDL933 using deletion and complementation strains (Delta3 and Delta3_1, respectively).
