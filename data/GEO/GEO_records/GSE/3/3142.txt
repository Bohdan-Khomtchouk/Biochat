TITLE
Molecular signatures in skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hair follicle matrix, outer root sheath, dermal papilla cells and melanocytes and a dermal fraction enriched in fibroblasts were FACS isolated from 4d backskins.  Targets from two biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Mouse Genechip 430A arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of cell-type specific genes. Keywords: cell type comparison
