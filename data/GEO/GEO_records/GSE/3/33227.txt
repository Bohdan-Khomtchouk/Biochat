TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in C2C12 myoblast cells and myotubes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We did ChIP-seq with anti- H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 antibodies in both C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes

DESIGN
Examination of 6 different histone modifications in 2 cell types.
