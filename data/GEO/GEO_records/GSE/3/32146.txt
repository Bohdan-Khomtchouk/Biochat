TITLE
DNA methylation in a discovery cohort of colon mucosa samples from individuals with Crohns' disease or ulcerative colitis and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and normal colon mucosa samples. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 482,421 CpGs in colon mucosa samples. Samples came from 10 Crohn's disease affected, 4 ulcerative colitis affected, and 10 normal individuals. One ulcerative colitis sample was assayed before and after treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and mesalamine.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 25 samples were hybridized to the  Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1
