TITLE
Worms spun in centrifuge at elevated g values

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Worms spun at higher than normal g values for 4 days on 20G centrifuge vs. worms kept at 1 X G. Both are mixed stage cultures. A stimulus or stress experiment design type is where that tests response of an organism(s) to stress/stimulus. e.g. osmotic stress, behavioral treatment Physical Characteristics: worms kept at increased g values for 4 days (x g value)
