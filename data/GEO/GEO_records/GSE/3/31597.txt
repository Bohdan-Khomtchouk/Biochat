TITLE
Changes in gene expression profile during the growth on ethanol in Acetobacter aceti

ORGANISM
Acetobacter aceti NBRC 14818

SUMMARY
Time-dependent transcriptome change in the A. aceti cells during growth on ethanol was determined by NimbleGen Eukaryotic Expression array (4x72K).

DESIGN
Acetobacter aceti NBRC14818 was cultivated in the medium containing ethanol in Erlenmeyer flask with rotary shaking. Total RNA was extracted when optical density at 600 nm was 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, or 1.2. The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
