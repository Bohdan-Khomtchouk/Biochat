TITLE
RNA-seq characterization of Physarum macroplasmodia

ORGANISM
Physarum polycephalum

SUMMARY
We report a novel approach for studying the transcriptomic changes during cell differentiation, using Physarum as a model

DESIGN
3 samples examined: starved plasmodium, starved plasmodium collected 2 hours after photoinduction, and starved plasmodium collected 6 hours after induction
