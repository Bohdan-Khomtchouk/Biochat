TITLE
Cytokinesis signals truncation of the PodJ polarity factor by a cell cycle-regulated protease

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Supporting data for Chen et al., " Cytokinesis signals truncation of the PodJ polarity factor by a cell cycle-regulated protease " The microarray component of this work seeks to identify genes whose expression is controlled by the Caulobacter crescentus DivJ-PleC-DivK system. Keywords: time course, mutant/wild-type comparisons
