TITLE
PCR array of inflammatory cytokines and receptors in mouse lungs with NF-kappaB RelA mutant in alveolar epithelial cells during pneumococcal pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A murine model of RelA mutated throughout the alveolar epithelium was generated. Mice were anesthetized and intratracheally instilled with 106 CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 into the left lung lobe. Mice were euthanized after 15 hours after instillation, and left lung lobes were collected to isolate RNA.  We used SABioscience Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors PCR Array to evaluate whether the expressions of lung cytokines and receptors during pneumococcal pneumonia are dependent on alveolar epithelial NF-κB RelA or not.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. RNA were collected from six different mouse lungs in each genotype (wild-type and alveolar epithelial RelA mutant). Equal amount of RNA (200ng) was pooled from six different mouse lungs, and 1μg of total RNA (1.2μg) was used to the PCR array.
