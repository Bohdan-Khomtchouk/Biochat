TITLE
Induction of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes in Neurospora crassa by cellodextrins

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa OR74A

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling with next-generation sequencing methods demonstrated that a Neurospora crassa mutant with the three most highly expressed beta-glucosidase genes deleted had a transcriptional response to cellobiose similair to that of wild type N. crassa exposed to cellulose.

DESIGN
N. crassa was pregrown in Sucrose and transferred to Avicel (cellulose), Cellobiose, Sucrose or media with no carbon added.  Biological triplicates used to identify differentially expressed genes in WT on Avicel.  Single libraries for mutant strains identify which genes show similair expression on cellobiose as in the WT on cellulose.
