TITLE
Genome-wide Ifh1p occupancy at the OX growth phase and RC quiescent phase of the yeast metabolic cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We found ribosomal transcription factor Ifh1p is dynamically acetylated and phosphorylated in response to nutrient cues. ChIP-seq data revealed dynamic binding to ribosomal genes (RP) during the OX growth phase of the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) when RP genes are highly induced, and weaker binding in the RC quiescent-like phase. Besides RP genes, our ChIP-seq data also reveals binding of Ifh1p to non-RP genes such as translation factors and metabolic genes.

DESIGN
Examination of Ifh1p binding over two timepoints of the YMC (OX, RC) using Input as the control.
