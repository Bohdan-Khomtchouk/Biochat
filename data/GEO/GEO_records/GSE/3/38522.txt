TITLE
Comparison of osmotic stress related gene expression in Col-0, sid2-1 single, wrky54wrky70 double and wrky54wrky70sid2-1 triple mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To explore the possible cause for the enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress exhibited by wrky54wrky70 double mutant, we have used Agilent Arabidopsis (V4) Gene Expression Microarray to characterize the effect of these mutations under the osmotic stress treatment. In addition to wild type and wrky54wrky70 double mutant, sid2-1 single and wrky54wrky70sid2-1 triple mutant were also included in the microarray experiment. When comparing to untreated control samples, 58 genes were identified as representatives to show the different expression level among different mutants under the 15% PEG6000 treatment for one day. Expression of six genes (RAB18, LTI78, KIN1,NCED3,P5CS1 and PRODH) from this gene list were quantified by qRT-PCR, confirming the suppressed induction in wrky54wrky70 double mutant under the osmotic stress.

DESIGN
Osmotic stress induced gene expression in Col-WT, sid2-1 single, wrky54wrky70 double and wrky54wrky70sid2-1 triple mutants was measured after exposure to 15% PEG6000 treatment for one day. For each array, three labeled aRNA sample were hybridized and three biological replicates for each sample with dye swaps were made.
