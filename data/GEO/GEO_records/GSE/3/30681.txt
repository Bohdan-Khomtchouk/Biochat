TITLE
Expression analysis of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (Wt) and delta-pst mutant grown in K10T-1 medium

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1

SUMMARY
Whole genome gene expression study comparing Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (Wt) relative to a delta-pst mutant (deletion of the pstSCAB operon) that consitutively expresses the Pho regulon Mutants used in this study are further described  in Monds, R.D.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two independent wild-type cultures of wild type strain Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and two independent cultures of  Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 delta pst mutant (deletion of the pstSCAB operon). Each chip measures the expression level of 5733 open reading frames (ORFs) genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (Refseq: NC_007492) with twenty 60-mer postive match (PM) probes per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
