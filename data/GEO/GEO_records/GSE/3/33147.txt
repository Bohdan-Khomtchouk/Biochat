TITLE
Expression data from laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli on lactate or glycerol

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Laboratory adaptive evolution experiments were conducted using serial passage of E. coli in M9 minimal medium supplemented with either 2 g/L of lactate for 60 days or 2 g/L of glycerol for 44 days.  7 parallel evolution strains were generated for growth on lactate and 7 parallel evolution strains were generated for growth on glycerol. Affymetrix arrays were used to study the time-course change in gene expression from unevolved E. coli (day 0) to a midpoint evolved strain (day 20) and evolutionary endpoints
