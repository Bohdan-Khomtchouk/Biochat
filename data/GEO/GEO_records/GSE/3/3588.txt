TITLE
Insights into Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension revealed

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The results of this study identified a number of pathways potentially important for the amelioration of hypertension and renal injury in SS-13BN/Mcw rats, and these results generated a series of testable hypotheses related to the role of the renal medulla in the complex mechanism of salt-sensitive hypertension. Keywords: time course, microarray; 11ÃŸ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; glucagon receptor; extracellular matrix; apoptosis
