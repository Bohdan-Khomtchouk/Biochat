TITLE
Role of Per2 in the control of liver glycogen metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Per2 in glucose metabolism in-vivo we used mice bearing a targeted gene mutation in the Per2 gene (Per2brdm) and thus unable to express a functional Per2 protein. Mice were hosted in our standard mouse facility in a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle. Wt and Per2brdm mice were fed with either standard chow diet or high-fat diet for 24 weeks and analyzed for glucose homeostasis. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed on mice food deprived for 7 hours. For pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) mice were fasted for 14 hours. Glucose levels were measured over 12 hours starvation time-courses during the light and the dark phase. Fed and fasting blood glucose and hepatic glycogen content were measured over different circadian time-points. To investigate the role of Per2 in the control of liver gene expression we performed DNA-microarray analysis of RNA preparations from liver of Per2brdm and WT mice.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNA from liver of four different Per2brdm and WT mice. Mice from the same cohort were sacrificed after 8 hours of starvation. After normalization we performed a fold change comparison selecting probes with a p value < 0.05.
