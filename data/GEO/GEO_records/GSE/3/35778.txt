TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dorsal skin gene expression of control and K14-cre:Gab1fl mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes regulated by Gab1 mediated signaling in hair cycle initiation

DESIGN
Total RNA from dorsal skin of control mice was compared to K14-cre; Gab1fl conditional mutant mice
