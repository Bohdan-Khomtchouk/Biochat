TITLE
Gene expression profiles of induced pluripotent stem cells from centenarians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from centrenarians by retroviral transduction of primary human fibroblasts. To show the similarity between 201B7 iPSC and 100-1 #16 iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cells from centenarian),  this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated  201B7 iPSC, and 100-1 #16 iPSCs were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.
