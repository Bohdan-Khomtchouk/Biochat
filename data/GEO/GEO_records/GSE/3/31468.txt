TITLE
Caulobacter strains ET163 and ET166 vs. CB15N (wild-type)

ORGANISM
Caulobacter crescentus CB15

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the expression profiles of inversion strains ET163 and ET166 to that of wild-type.  To this end we performed transcriptional profiling of Caulobacter crescentus swarmer cells from strains ET163, ET166, and CB15N (WT).
