TITLE
Metabolic features of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts: Control vs. UV treatment.

ORGANISM
Cryptosporidium parvum

SUMMARY
Global gene expression in C. parvum environmental stage (oocysts) and the oocysts treated with UV comparing control untreated ones. Goal was to uncover the metabolic features in oocysts and the oocysts treated with UV.

DESIGN
two-condition experiment, UV treatment vs. UV untreatment; two time points, 0.5h and 5h. Each time point, two Biological replicates(1, 2) with two technique replicates(1-1,1-2 ; 2-1, 2-2).
