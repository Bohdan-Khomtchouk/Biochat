TITLE
Identification of endoderm-specific genes in mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The foregut definitive endoderm is the precursor of many tissues including the liver, pancreas, thyroid, lungs, trachea and oesophagus. However, networks and pathways involved in the early development of the definitive endoderm of mammals are not well studied. To identify genes with potential roles in the early development of the foregut definitive endoderm in mouse embryos, we performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profile of foregut endoderm and non-endodermal tissues from early somite-stage mouse embryos.

DESIGN
ARC/s embryos at 4- to 5-somite stages were collected and the anterior intestinal portal was isolated by digestion with trypsin and pancreatin and mechanical dissection. Ectoderm and mesoderm tissues were dissected from the head folds and the heart, and combined as the non-endoderm tissues for comparison of gene expression profiles. RNA was extracted from 15-20 pooled samples of endoderm or ectoderm plus mesoderm cells and subjected to two rounds of linear amplification and labelling according to standard methods (Affymetrix). The amplified products were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse MOE430 GeneChips. The experiment was performed twice. RNA amplification labelling, hybridization and scanning were performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility. GC-RMA data normalization and further analysis were performed using GenePattern software.
