TITLE
Whole genome sequencing of murine induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cell clones

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole genome sequencing was performed on several murine iPS cell clones (and their parental cells) from each of three independent reprogramming experiments. Hundreds of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected in each clone, with an average of 11 in coding regions. Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0ST arrays were used to compare expression patterns in MPSVII iPS lines, and embryo-derived MPSVII ES cells. Unsupervised hierarchal clustering analysis showed that the iPS clones and ES cell lines clustered randomly, suggesting that their global patterns of gene expression are highly similar. Taken together, our data suggest that most of the genetic variation in iPS cell clones is not caused by reprogramming, but is rather a consequence of cloning individual cells, “capturing” random mutations that preexisted in the single cells that were reprogrammed. These mutations can sometimes contribute to reprogramming “fitness”, thus providing a selective advantage for rare cells when they overexpress reprogramming factors.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from a murine disease model (Mucopolysaccaridosis type VII- MPSVII) were used. Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0ST arrays were used to compare expression patterns in MPSVII iPS lines, and embryo-derived MPSVII ES cells. Expression patterns in four separate iPS clones were compared to MPSVII ES cells.  Control hybridization was performed with B6 Blu ES cells and MEFs.
