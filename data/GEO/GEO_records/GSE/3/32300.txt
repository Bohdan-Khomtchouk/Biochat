TITLE
MicroRNA expression in chronic rhinosinusitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence suggests that CRS is a heterogeneous group of sinus disorders involving overlapping but distinct disease entities.The factors leading to different CRS phenotypes remain enigmatic. The role of miRNAs in the regulation of immunological and inflammatory processes is beginning to emerge.Thus, we examined microRNAs expression profiles  in eosinophilic CRSwNP adn CRSsNP. Compared with controls, 31 differentially expressed miRNAs (30 downregulated and 1 upregulated miRNAs) in eosinophilic CRSwNP and 4 differentially expressed miRNAs (2 downregulated and 2 upregulated miRNAs) in CRSsNP were indentified. Real time RT-PCR was subsequently performed to verify the miRNA microarray result.
