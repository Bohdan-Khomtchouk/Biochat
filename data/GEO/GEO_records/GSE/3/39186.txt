TITLE
Effect of TET1 and TET3 overexpression on the transcriptome of HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared TET1 and TET3 overexpressing cells to uninduced cells with endogenous levels of the respective transcript to determine global gene expression changes.

DESIGN
TET1 overexpression, TET3 overexpression
