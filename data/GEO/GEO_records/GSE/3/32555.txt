TITLE
To study gene expression differences in various dermal equivalents prepared by the individual's laboratory

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have prepared tissue engineered self assembled dermal equivalents with high similarity to the human dermis (skin).

DESIGN
We have manipulated the culture conditions to prepare dermal equivalents with varying amounts of hyaluronic acid and potentially other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). We are interested in using array technology to determine which genes responsible for carbohydrate and GAG (and if available protein/glycoprotein) synthesis are being either up-or down-regulated in these constructs as compared to a Normal base construct.
