TITLE
CPG stimulation for Gene Expression of mutated B-CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim is to identify the differential gene expression profile of mutated B-CLL stimulated with CPG

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, CPG-stimulated B-CLL mutated vs. Unstimulated B-CLL mutated . Biological replicates: 8 unstimulated replicates, 8 CPG-stimulated replicates. Reference design;
