TITLE
Genomic aberrations of high-grade and low-grade gliomas from Chinese patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We carried out the analyses of chromosome variations between low-grade  and high-grade gliomas in Chinese population. We found out the differences in chromosomes, cytobands, genes, pathways and GO functions.

DESIGN
To identify the glioma tissue-specific genomic alterations and compare the genomic variations between low-grade and high-grade gliomas.
