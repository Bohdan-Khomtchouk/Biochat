TITLE
ccpA Chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip of JIR8094 (CD630E) WT strain and a ccpA mutant after 6h of growth in TY

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile 630

SUMMARY
Comparison of ccpA Chromatine immunoprecipitation on chip using 2 strains : JIR8094 (CD630E) wild type strain and a ccpA mutant after 6h of growth in TYG. This experimental procedure was designed to investigate the consensus binding site, CRE, of pleiotropic regulator ccpA.
