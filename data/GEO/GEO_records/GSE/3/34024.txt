TITLE
Angiogenesis gene expression upon Notch activation in human vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VSMCs were cultured on Jag1 or IgG-coated plates as described above. RNA was extracted using RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Reverse-transcription PCR was done with RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was run on a TaqMan Low-Density Array, human angiogenesis panel (Applied Biosystems , Cat#4378725), amplified on a 7900 HT Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Angiogenesis gene expression was screened for human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells that were plated for 18 hours on either Notch ligands (Jag1 or Jag2) as compared to appropriate IgG controls (IgG1 or IgG2).
