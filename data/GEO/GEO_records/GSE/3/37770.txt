TITLE
smallRNA profiling of THP1 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of smallRNA in THP1 (human monocytic leukemia) cell line in order to correlate miRNA activity with target abundance.

DESIGN
THP1 smallRNA profiles were generated in triplicates by deep-sequencing in Illumina HiSeq2000.
