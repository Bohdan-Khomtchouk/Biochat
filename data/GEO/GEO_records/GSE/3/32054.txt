TITLE
Generation of feederless iPS cell from human cord blood cells using Sendai virus (SeV) vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34+ fraction of cord blood (CB) cells can be reprogrammed on pronectinF-coated dish in serum free medium using Sendai virus (SeV) vector carrying reprogramming factors OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. human ES cell-like colonies came to merge around 18 days after SeV infection on pronectin-coated dish in human ES cell medium supplemented with bFGF under normoxic culture (20% O2). After passages, dish like-shape colonies were seeded on pronectinF-coated 96 well-plate in a single cell and cultured in N2B27 based medium supplemented with LIF, FK, MAPKi, GSKi in hypoxic culture condition (5% O2) for cloning purpose. Emerged dome shape colonies were collected and cultured in human ES cell medium supplemented with bFGF under normoxic culture (20% O2) again. Dish shape and human ES cell-like colonies derived from single cell were picked up for further appraisal of reprogrammed cells such as expression of pluriotencyâ€“related molecules. Reprogrammed cells can be maintained for more than 20 passages without differentiation.

DESIGN
We investigated that gene expression profile of generated feederless human iPS cells from cord blood cells using temperature sensitive sendai-virus vector.
