Transcriptome of 3 developmental stages of Colletotrichum graminicola during infection of Zea mays leaf sheaths

ORGANISM
Colletotrichum graminicola

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of 3 developmental stages of Colletotrichum graminicola during infection of Zea mays leaf sheaths

DESIGN
3 biological replicates per stage. The three stages are: pre-penetration appressoria (PA), early biotrophic phase (BP), and the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy (NP). Each biological replicate of the first stage, the pre-penetration appressoria, was sequenced to a 2-fold greater depth due to its lower representation in the samples.
