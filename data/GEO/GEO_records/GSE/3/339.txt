TITLE
Splenic Dendritic Cell Subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The functional relationships and properties of different sub-types of dendritic cells (DC) remain largely undefined. We used a global gene profiling approach to determine gene expression patterns among murine splenic CD11c high DC subsets in an effort to better characterise these cells. Keywords: equivalent probe
