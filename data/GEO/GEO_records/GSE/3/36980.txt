TITLE
Expression data from post mortem Alzheimer's disease brains

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecular pathological alterations in AD brains, we performed interspecies comparative microarray analyses using RNAs prepared from postmortem human brain tissues donated for the Hisayama study and hippocampal RNAs from the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) Three-way ANOVA of microarray data from frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus with presence/absence of AD and vascular dementia, and sex, as factors revealed that the gene expression profile is most significantly altered in the hippocampi of AD brains. Comparative analyses of the brains of AD patients and a mouse model of AD showed that genes involved in non-insulin dependent DM and obesity were significantly altered in both, as were genes related to psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer’s disease.

DESIGN
We prepared RNA samples from the gray matter of frontal and temporal cortices and hippocampi derived from 88 postmortem brains, among which 26 cases were pathologically diagnosed as having AD or an AD-like disorder. High-quality RNA (RIN≧6.9) samples were subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST platform, and only those results that passed examinations for quality assurance and quality control of the Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were retrieved. In total, we obtained gene expression profiles from the following samples: 33 frontal cortex samples, among which 15 were from AD patients; 29 temporal cortex samples, among which 10 were from AD patients; 17 hippocampus samples, among which seven were from AD patients
