TITLE
Expression data from pig uterus in response to embryos at blastocyst satge and oocytes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The maternal tract plays a critical role in the success of early embryonic development providing an optimal environment for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Preparation of this environment requires an intimate dialogue between the embryo and her mother. To advance our understanding of the process by which a foreign blastocyst is accepted by the maternal endometrium and better address the clinical challenges of infertility and pregnancy failure, it is imperative to decipher this complex molecular dialogue. The objective of the present work is to define the local response(s) of the maternal tract towards the embryo during the earliest stages of pregnancy.

DESIGN
In order to identify the uterine gene expression modified in the presence of the embryo when compared to the oocyte we used a novel model that eliminated genetic variability. Using laparoscopic insemination one oviduct was inseminated with spermatozoa and the contralateral oviduct was injected with diluent. This model allowed us to obtain samples from the oviduct and the uterine horn containing either embryos or oocytes from the same sow. Uterine horn pig samples containing embryos at blastocyst stage and and their contralateral uterine horn containing oocytes from individual sows were collected for RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates were performed (n= 3 sows) and a total of 6 arrays were used for microarrays study (3 arrays for uterine horn samples containing embryos (inseminated-side) and 3 arrays for samples containing oocytes (non-inseminated side).
