TITLE
Gene expression analysis using the ureters of normal and ureteritis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of ureters of idiopathic ureteritis mice. The B cell functions associated genes were upregulated in the diseased ureters compared to nomal ureter. These results provide a basical information of molecular pathology in idiopathic ureteritis.

DESIGN
In the study, the normal ureter (n=3) and diseased ureter (n=3) were used. The total RNA sample of each group was collected to 1 sample, 36,142 genes expressions were compared between these groups.
