TITLE
ChIP-seq study of BEAF binding in four Drosophila spcies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Insulators are considered as chromosome organizers. BEAF, one of the insulator proteins, is highly conserved in Drosophila speies but also limited to Drosophila spcies. BEAF associates with TSS of active genes. Comparative study of BEAF binding landscapes in four Drosophila species reveals BEAF association with gene pairs, and the results suggest the role of gain or loss of BEAF binding during the speciation of Drosophila species.

DESIGN
DNA sample from ChIP for BEAF and input are collected for each of four Drosophila species
