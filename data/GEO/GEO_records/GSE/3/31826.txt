TITLE
Methylation analysis of samples from a phase II clinical trial of decitatbine in combination with carboplatin in patients with recurrent, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of blood and biopsy samples from recurrent, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer patients before and after treatment of decitabine in combination with carboplatin. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in PBMC (14 paired samples), tumor (8 paired samples) and ascites (6 paired samples).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 56 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
