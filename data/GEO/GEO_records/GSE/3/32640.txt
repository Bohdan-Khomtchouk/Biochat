TITLE
Uterus and placenta gene expression at 10.5 days of pregnancies in control (B6 mice) and R3 IRCS mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
R3 IRCS have a 6 Mb fragment of mouse chromosome 1 originating from Mus spretus; they display a increase rate of embryonic mortality

DESIGN
Eight samples corresponding to two pools of three placentas, three uterus for the two strains (B6 and R3 IRCS) were hybridized on a four-quadrant Nimblegen expression array (two tissues x two types of mice x 2 duplicates)
