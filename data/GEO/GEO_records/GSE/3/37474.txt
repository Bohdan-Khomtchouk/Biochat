TITLE
Dexamethasone induced gene expression changes in the human trabecular meshwork

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One of the undesirable side effects of glucocorticoid use is the potential development of elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. The precise mechanisms through which steroid use induces ocular hypertension are unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression changes induced by steroids in the human trabecular meshwork and the underlying sclerocorneal tissue.

DESIGN
The anterior segment of five pairs of adult human donor eyes were maintained in a profusion organ culture system.
