TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in differentiated human primary keratinocytes depleted for MLL2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary keratinocytes were depleted of MLL2 by siRNA and induced to differentiated for 2 days by addition of Calcium

DESIGN
Primary normal human keratinocytes were transfected with MLL2 or scrambled control siRNA using RNAi max (Life Technologies). 24 hours post transfection medium was raised to 1.8mM calcium to induce differentiation.  Cells were collected 48 hours later.
