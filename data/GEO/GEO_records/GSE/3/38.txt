ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of BY4716(isogenic to S288c) and a wild isolate collected by R. Mortimer.  Each strain was grown in culture 6 independent times and RNA from each culture was isolated.  Each of these RNA samples was subjected to a dye-swap pair of arrays (except the " RM11 " sample, which only got one array).  All arrays used the same pool of reference BY4716 sample.  In sample titles, " BY " alone signifies the reference sample and all other strings represent independent cultures.  All sample titles are of the form S1-S2.  S1 indicates the sample whose signal was read as channel 1 (Cy5 labeling, fluorescence at 635 nm) and S2 as channel 2 (Cy3, 532 nm). Keywords: repeat sample
