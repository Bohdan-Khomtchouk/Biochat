TITLE
FNR- vs WT in anoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella

SUMMARY
Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen that infects the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. In the host, S. Typhimurium encounters a wide range of oxygen concentrations going from oxic conditions in the stomach to near anoxic conditions in the distal sigmoid colon-rectal junction. In Escherichia coli, FNR (Fumarate Nitrate Reductase) is one of the main regulatory proteins involved in oxygen sensing and in controlling the transcription of the genes required for the aerobic/anaerobic transition.. However, the role of FNR in S. Typhimurium is largely unknown. To assess its role in S. Typhimurium, we constructed an FNR-   mutant (NC983) in the pathogenic wild-type (WT) strain, ATCC14028s. Keywords: FNR, Salmonella, anaerobic, virulence
