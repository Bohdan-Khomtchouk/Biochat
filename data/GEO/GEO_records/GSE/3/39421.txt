TITLE
small RNA sequencing of the M.truncatula rdr6.1 mutant

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
The rdr6.1 missense allele was found by TILLING in EMS mutagenized plants  of Medicago truncatula. To analyse the impact of this point mutation on small RNA populations, we sequenced small RNA from two sibling lines carrying the mutation and the corresponding wild-type plants.

DESIGN
libraries from two sibling lines carrying the rdr6.1 mutation and the corresponding wild-type plants
