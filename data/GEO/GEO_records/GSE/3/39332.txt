TITLE
Chromosomal analysis of products of conception

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results of an unbiased series of 2833 fresh products of conception samples (in conjunction with maternal blood samples for comparison)  that were tested using a 300K Illumina SNP array.  we report on the rate and type of whole aneuploidies, UPD, partial aneuploidies, copy number variants found in our series as well as the rate of maternal cell contamination vs. true fetal results. 2833 consecutive fresh products of conception samples and corresponding maternal and/or paternal blood samples were analyzed using a SNP array plus informatics algorithms for the purpose of detecting causal chromosome abnormalities.  Hypothesized advantages of using SNP microarray with Parental SupportTM informatics over the traditional standard G-banded karyotyping include:  direct testing without need for cell culture, faster turn-around time, low failure rate, the ability to detect or rule out maternal cell contamination (MCC), and the detection of small segmental changes, uniparental disomy (UPD) and parent of origin of any aneuploidies.  Results showed a 22% MCC rate. In the 78% of samples with true fetal results, 60% had abnormalities with single aneuploidy being the most common.  Separate evaluation of the samples to determine the resolution of the SNP array with informatics showed the ability to detect copy number variations (CNVs) as small as 1 MB or less, with 1.4% of samples revealing a clinically relevant microdeletion or duplication.

DESIGN
2833 fresh products of conception samples were analyze using no controls, no replicates, and no reference samples.
