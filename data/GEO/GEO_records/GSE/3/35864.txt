TITLE
The National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium Brain Gene Array: Two types of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Finding the differences in gene expression in three regions of the brain, basal ganglia, white matter, and frontal cortex, in normal, HIV infected, HIV infected with neurocognitive impairment, and HIV infected with both neurocognitive impairment and encephalitis patients.

DESIGN
Twenty-four human subjects in four groups were examined A) Uninfected controls; B) HIV-1 infected subjects with no substantial neurocognitive impairment (NCI); C) Infected with substantial NCI without HIV encephalitis (HIVE); D) Infected with substantial NCI and HIVE. RNA from neocortex, white matter, and neostriatum was processed with the AffymetrixÂ® array platform.
