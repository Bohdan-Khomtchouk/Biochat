TITLE
miR-206 modulates the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy of mdx mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In response to skeletal muscle injury, adult myogenic stem cells, known as satellite cells, are activated and undergo proliferation and differentiation to regenerate new muscle fibers.  The skeletal muscle-specific microRNA, miR-206, is up-regulated in satellite cells following muscle injury, but its role in muscle regeneration has not been defined.  Here we show that skeletal muscle regeneration in response to cardiotoxin injury is impaired in mice lacking miR-206.  Loss of miR-206 also accelerates and exacerbates the dystrophic phenotype of mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  MiR-206 promotes satellite cell differentiation and fusion to form multinucleated myofibers by suppressing a collection of negative regulators of myogenesis.  Our findings reveal an essential role for miR-206 in satellite cell differentiation during skeletal muscle regeneration and as a modulator of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

DESIGN
total RNA obtained from TA muscle of  mdx and 3 miR-206 KO; mdx mice at 3 months of age.
