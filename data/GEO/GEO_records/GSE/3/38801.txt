TITLE
Essential roles for chromatin protein L3mbtl2 in pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the impact of L3mbtl2 on genome wide mRNA expression microarray analysis was carried out in L3mbtl2 knock out ES cells and wild type ES cells. The same analysis was also carried out in knock out cells infected with L3mbtl2-F vector and a control vector.

DESIGN
Experiment to study targets of L3mbtl2 in C57bl6/129 hybrid ES cells. 4 samples: wild type, L3mbtl2 knock out, L3mbtl2 knock out rescue and rescue with empty vector
