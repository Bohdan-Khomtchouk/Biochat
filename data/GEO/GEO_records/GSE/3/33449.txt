SUMMARY
Endothelial cell (EC) Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation upregulates the expression of inflammatory mediators and of TLR2 itself, and modulates important endothelial functions, including coagulation and permeability. We defined TLR2 signaling pathways in ECs, and tested the hypothesis that TLR2 signaling differs in ECs and monocytes. We found that ERK5, heretofore unrecognized as mediating TLR2 activation in any cell type, is a central mediator of TLR2-dependent inflammatory signaling in HUVEC, primary human lung microvascular ECs and human monocytes. Additionally, we observed that whereas MEK1 negatively regulates TLR2 signaling in EC, MEK1 promotes TLR2 signaling in monocytes. We also noted that activation of TLR2 led to the upregulation of intracellularly expressed TLR2 and inflammatory mediators via NF-κB, JNK and p38-MAPK. Finally, we found that p38-MAPK, JNK, ERK5 and NF-κB promote the attachment of human neutrophils to lung microvascular EC that were pretreated with TLR2 agonists. This study newly identifies ERK5 as a key regulator of TLR2 signaling in ECs and monocytes, and indicates that there are fundamental differences in TLR signaling pathways between EC and monocytes.
