TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of fluorescence-activated sorted Mesp-GFP-labeled B7.5 founder trunk ventral cell lineage cells from Ciona intestinalis

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
The Ciona heart progenitor lineage (TVC, trunk ventral cells) is first specified by Fibroblast Growth Factor/Map Kinase (FGF/MapK) activation of the transcription factor Ets1/2 (Ets). For this analysis, B7.5 lineage cells were labeled with the Mesp-GFP reporter. In the first experiment, we targeted a dominant-negative form of the sole Ciona FGF receptor (FGFRdn) to the B7.5 lineage using the Mesp enhancer (Mesp-FGFRdn). In the second experiment, we targeted a dominant repressor form of Ets1/2 to the B7.5 lineage using the Mesp enhancer (Mesp-EtsWRPW). This construct is designed to repress Ets1/2 target gene transcription and has previously been shown to abolish TVC induction.

DESIGN
We employed whole-genome microarray analysis of sorted B7.5 lineage cells to identify primary FGF:MapK:Ets1/2 target genes.
