TITLE
Comparative analysis of bacterial transcriptome using DNA microarray and next generation sequencing technologies

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Validation of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 transcriptome profile using RNA sequencing (direct cDNA sequencing and 3'-UTR sequencing) in comparison with DNA microarray as a reference platform.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on total RNA and enriched mRNA of L. plantarum WCFS1 grown in CDM or MRS media. Samples were hybridized in a loop design, hybridizing each sample twice, once for each dye This Series represents the DNA microarray experiments only.
