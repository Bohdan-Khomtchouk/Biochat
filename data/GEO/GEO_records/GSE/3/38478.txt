TITLE
Evolutionary principles of modular gene regulation in Yeasts

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Comparative time-series expression analysis of growth curves through carbon depletion in the ascomycete yeasts.

DESIGN
Each of the following species-specific, growth curve derived samples competitively hybed to their own mid-log samples: lag phase, late log, diauxic shift, post-shift, plateau.
