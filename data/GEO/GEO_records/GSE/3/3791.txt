TITLE
Gene Expression Comparison of First Passage vs. Primary Human and Mouse Retinal Sphere Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pigmented portion of ciliary epithelium in the adult mammalian eye harbors mitotically quiescent retinal sphere cells, which are capable of self-renewal and differentiating into retinal neurons when assayed in vitro; however, very little is known about the molecular mechanism controlling the proliferation and differentiation of these adult retinal stem cells or their molecular resemblance to mutipotent stem/progenitor cells during early eye development. This experiment studies the gene expression of first passage and primary human and mouse retinal sphere cells. Keywords: other
