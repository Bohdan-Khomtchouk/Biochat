TITLE
MYC binding in human B cells (P493-6) and ESC (H9)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myc plays important roles in cancer and stem cell biology including reprogramming adult cells to pluripotent stem cells. We have indentified a core set of Myc target genes in human B-cells and embryonic stem cells by genome wide ChIP-on-chip and transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
A total of 8 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) samples were generated from P493-6 cells (5 using 1 of 2 MYC antibodies and 3 using anti rabbit IgG. A total of 6 ChIP samples were generated from undifferentiated H9 hES cells (3 using anti c-Myc and 3 using anti rabbit IgG.
