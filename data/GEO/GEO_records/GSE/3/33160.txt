TITLE
Regulatory network underlying the adaptive physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under urinary tract-like conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most frequent pathogen dominant in complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). To unravel the adaptation strategies of P. aeruginosa to the conditions in the urinary tract and to define the underlying regulatory network an artificial growth system mimicking the conditions in the urinary tract was established.  Transcriptome analyses were used to investigate the physiological status of P. aeruginosa under this conditions.
