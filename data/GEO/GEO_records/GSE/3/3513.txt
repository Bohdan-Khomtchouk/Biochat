TITLE
In situ-synthesized novel microarray optimized for mouse stem cell and early developmental expression profiling: Part2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas were pooled within 3 litters and total RNA was extracted. Fluorescently-labeled, linearly-amplified cRNA targets were prepared from the RNA samples and compared on a novel microarray design to validate the system. A " self-versus-self " experimental design was used to assess the false-positive rates in the system. The in situ-synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform contains approximately 22,000 DNA features, and was designed to detect transcripts from the entire NIA cDNA clone collection. Keywords: self vs self design
