TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for short-segment Hirschsprung trios

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Finding gene associations in rare diseases is frequently hampered by the reduced numbers of patients accessible. Conventional gene-based association tests rely on the availability of large cohorts, which constitutes a serious limitation for its application in this scenario. To overcome this problem we have used here a combined strategy in which a functional association study (pathway-based analysis) has been conducted to prioritize candidate genes in a Spanish cohort of 53 trios of short-segment Hirschsprung's disease that have been further validated in a larger population of 146 trios. The study revealed a strong association of 10 gene ontology (GO) modules related to signal transduction and its regulation, enteric nervous system (ENS) formation and other HSCR-related processes to the disease. A total of 10 new loci among the preselected candidates were found to be significantly associated to HSCR. This approach, based on the study of functionally-related gene sets, requires of lower sample sizes and opens new opportunities for the study of rare diseases.

DESIGN
DNA derived from peripheral blood was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® 500K mapping arrays. In total, 53 trios were analyzed consisting of affected child and their unaffected parents.
