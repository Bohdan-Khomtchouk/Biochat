TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression patterns comparing various pluripotent stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels of whole transcripts obtained from two WA09 ES cell cultures, two dermal fibroblast cultures, two lines each for L-iPSCs, F-iPSCs and LF-iPSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from WA09 ESCs, the dermal fibroblasts from which all iPSCs in the microarray study were derived, two F-iPSC clones, two L-iPSC clones and two LF-iPSC clones on day 100-120 were compared.
