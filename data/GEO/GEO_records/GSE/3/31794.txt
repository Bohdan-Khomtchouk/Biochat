TITLE
Factors influencing in vivo deposition of histone variants H3.1 and H3.3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishment of a proper chromatin landscape is central to genome function. Here, we explain H3 variant distribution by specific targeting and dynamics of deposition involving the CAF-1 and HIRA histone chaperones. Impairing replicative H3.1 incorporation via CAF-1 enables an alternative H3.3 deposition at replication sites via HIRA. Conversely, the H3.3 incorporation throughout the cell cycle via HIRA cannot be replaced by H3.1. ChIP-seq analyses reveal correlation between HIRA-dependent H3.3 accumulation and RNA pol II at transcription sites and specific regulatory elements, further supported by their biochemical association. Remarkably, the HIRA complex shows unique DNA binding properties and depleting HIRA increases DNA sensitivity to nucleases. We propose that protective gap-filling of naked DNA by HIRA leads to a broad distribution of H3.3, and HIRA association with Pol II ensures local H3.3 enrichment at specific sites.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide localization of two histone H3 variants.
