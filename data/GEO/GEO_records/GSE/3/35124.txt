TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles among Nrf1 liver-specific conditional knockout, Nrf2 knockout and Keap1 knockdown mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Nrf1-dependent and Nrf2-dependent genes in the liver, we examined the gene expression profiles of Nrf1 Alb-CKO, Nrf2 knockout and Keap1 knockdown mouse livers by microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from Nrf1dN/-::Alb-Cre, Nrf1dN/+, Nrf2-/-, Nrf2+/+, Keap1KD/- and Keap1KD/+ mouse livers were used for the microarray analyses.
