TITLE
Two types of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and -negative (ER-) breast cancer will be compared with glycan structure analyses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ER+ve and ER-ve breast cancers tend to show different patterns of metastasis, with ER+ve tumours having a propensity to metastasize to the bone while ER-ve tumours tend to induce visceral metastasis. Glycans can play an important role in metastasis through their interactions with glycan binding proteins. Moreover we, and others have also shown that expression of particular tumor-associated glycoforms of the mucin MUC1, allows it to interact with lectins of the immune system. We now have data showing differences in the level of expression of some glycosyltransferases in ER+ve and ER-ve of breast cancer suggesting the expression of different O-linked glycoforms.

DESIGN
RNA will be isolated from ER+ve and ER-ve primary breast cancers supplied by the Guy’s and St Thomas’ Research Breast Tissue Bank. Tumor tissue will be macro-dissected from thick cryostat sections by visual comparison with a representative H & E section. We will verify the level of expression of ER and document the expression of ST3Gal-I and ST6GalNAc-II by RT-qPCR. We have already isolated RNA from a number of tumours and shown we can obtain RNA of good quality with a RNA integrity number, as measured with an Agilent Bioanalyser, of > 4.5 Since there is likely to be variability among primary tumors, ideally we analyzed of 10 ER negative and 9 ER positive tumours.
