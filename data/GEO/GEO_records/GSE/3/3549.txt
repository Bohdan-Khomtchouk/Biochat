TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for BAF155 on Human Hela S3 Cells

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
BAF155 ChIP-chip performed on Human Hela S3 Cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaced every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts).  Goal is to identify binding sites for BAF155. Keywords = Transcription Factor Binding, BAF155, ChIP-chip, Human, Genome Tiling Arrays Keywords: ChIP-chip
