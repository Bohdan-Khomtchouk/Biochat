TITLE
Gene expression profiles uncover molecular classifiers for the prediction of progression-free survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: results of a DASL assay from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibits heterogeneous clinical outcomes even in tumors of the same stage and with similar pathological characteristics. A substantial number of patients with DLBCL still fail to be cured despite recent improvements in therapy. In this study, we used formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples for microarray gene expression profiling to develop robust prognostic profiles for DLBCL.

DESIGN
We performed a retrospective microarray gene expression profiling study of FFPE from a cohort of DLBCL patients using the whole genome cDNA mediated Annealing, Selection and Ligation (WG-DASL) assay. After removing poor-quality samples, data from 164 patients were used for statistical analyses to develop and validate a prognostic gene expression signature using a gradient lasso and leave-one-out cross-validation process.
