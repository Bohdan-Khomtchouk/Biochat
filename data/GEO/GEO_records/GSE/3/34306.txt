SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in regulating gene expression by interacting with cis regulatory DNA elements associated with their target genes. Recent surveys have examined the DNA binding specificities of most Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors but a comprehensive evaluation of their data has been lacking. Results: We analyzed in vitro and in vivo TF-DNA binding data reported in previous large-scale studies to generate a comprehensive, curated resource of DNA binding specificity data for all characterized S. cerevisiae transcription factors. Our collection comprises DNA binding site motifs and comprehensive in vitro DNA binding specificity data for all possible 8 bp sequences. Included in this database is DNA binding specificity data for 27 TFs independently generated by PBM analysis in this current study. Investigation of the DNA binding specificities within the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) and VHR transcription factor families revealed unexpected plasticity in TF-DNA recognition: intriguingly, the VHR transcription factors, newly characterized by protein binding microarrays in this study, recognize bZIP like DNA motifs, while the bZIP transcription factor Hac1 recognizes a motif highly similar to the canonical E-box motif of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. We identified several transcription factors with distinct primary and secondary motifs, which might be associated with different regulatory functions. Finally, integrated analysis of in vivo transcription factor binding data with protein binding microarray data lends further support for indirect DNA binding in vivo by sequence-specific transcription factors.
