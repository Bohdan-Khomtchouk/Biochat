TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of porcine muscle Biceps femoris (BF) exposed to a single bout of endurance exercise

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Acute physical exercise elicits changes in gene expression in skeletal muscles to promote metabolic changes and to repair exercise-induced muscle injuries. Here, we investigated the impact of a single bout of running exercise until exhaustion on global transcriptional profiles in porcine skeletal muscles. Using a combined microarray and candidate gene approach, we identified a suite of genes that are differentially expressed in muscles during post-exercise recovery. Thus, several members of the heat shock protein family and proteins associated with proteolytic events were significantly up-regulated, suggesting that protein breakdown, prevention of protein aggregation and stabilization of unfolded proteins are important processes for restoring cellular homeostasis. We also detected an up-regulation of genes, which have been reported to be associated with muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, possibly reflecting an activation, differentiation and fusion of satellite cells to facilitate repair of muscle damage. In addition, exercise increased expression of the nuclear hormone receptors, which regulates metabolic functions associated with lipid, carbohydrate and energy homeostasis. Finally, we observed an unanticipated involvement of long non-coding RNA transcripts, which have been implicated in RNA processing and nuclear retention of adenosine-to-inosine edited mRNAs. These findings expand the complexity of pathways affected by acute contractile activity of skeletal muscle, contributing to a better understanding of the molecular processes that occur in muscle tissue in the recovery phase.

DESIGN
Gene expression study of the porcine muscle Biceps femoris in regard to exercise, pigs allowed to rest for 0 hours, 1 hour and 3 hours after exercise were compared with pigs that had not been exercising, using in-house printed porcine two-colour oligonucleotide microarrays.
