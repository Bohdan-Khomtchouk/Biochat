TITLE
Expression data from clone sorted tumor endothelial subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Competitive interactions between emerging blood vessels determine the clonogenic contribution to developing vascualture. Using a multi-color cre reporter, CD31+CD45-VeCad+ clones were isolated and analyzed for expression differences.

DESIGN
Tamoxifen labeled CD31+, CD45-VeCad+ tumor endothelial cells were isolated by FACS for analysis from separate tumors. The most frequent clone was compared to the least frequent clone between and across tumors.  The strain of mice is C57BL/6.
