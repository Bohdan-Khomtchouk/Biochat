TITLE
Expression data from 0dpa ovules of GhHD-1 silenced and over-expression transgenic cotton lines

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fibres are specialised trichomes that extend from the seedcoat. To date only a few genes directly involved in the differentiation of these epidermal cells have been identified. We have identified a HD-ZIP transcription factor, GhHD-1, expressed in trichomes and early fibres that might play a role in cotton fibre initiation. Here we characterise GhHD-1 from G. hirsutum and show, using reporter constructs and qRT-PCR, that they are expressed predominantly in epidermal tissues during early fibre development and in other tissues bearing epidermal trichomes. GhHD-1 silencing caused reduced trichome formation and delayed the timing of fibre initiation whereas constitutive over-expression of GhHD-1 increased the number of fibres initiating on the seed, but did not affect leaf trichomes. Expression of GhHD-1 in transgenic cotton silenced for different fibre MYBs suggest that in ovules it acts downstream of GhMYB25-like. Microarray analysis of silencing and over-expression lines of GhHD-1 indicated that it potentially functions through a WRKY transcription factor and calcium-signalling pathway genes that are shared with some biotic stress reactions. Microarray analysis of 2 biological replicates each of GhHD-1 silenced and over-expression transgenic lines relative to wild-type were used to identify downstream targets of this transcription factor during early fibre development.
