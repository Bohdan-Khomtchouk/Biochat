TITLE
Kinesin-associated RNA: RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Kinesin IP vs RNA from Aplysia CNS

ORGANISM
Aplysia californica

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling is used to identify ESTs found in RNA co-immunoprecipitated from Aplysia CNS with antibodies against Aplysia Kinesin Heavy Chain (ApKHC) RNA derived from Aplysia CNS served as control in the opposite channel. Custom Aplysia EST array to probe the samples was designed and ordered from Agilent.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment; four biological replicates for each condition were reciprocally hybridized on each two-color array
