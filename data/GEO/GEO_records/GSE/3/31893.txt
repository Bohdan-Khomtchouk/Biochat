TITLE
OsMADS29 regulates the degradation of the nucellus and the nucellar projection during rice seed development

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify the downstream genes of OsMADS29, a genome-wide analysis of the gene expression profiles in the nucellar projection cells of ZH11 and A-OsMADS29 was performed. Hybridization with the microarray and subsequent analysis showed that a total of 1318 genes displayed altered expression (at least 2-fold) under suppressed OsMADS29 expression. Among the altered genes, 492 were up-regulated, and 826 were down-regulated.

DESIGN
The ZH11 and A-OsMADS29 (line2 and line14) were growth in the same condition.Then maternal nucellar projection cells of their seeds at 3 DAF (day after flowering) were fixed and obtained by LCM (laser capture microdissection), and total RNA was extracted and amplified from two independent biological samples.
