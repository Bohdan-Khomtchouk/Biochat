TITLE
ChIP-chip of RNA Polymerase (RNAP) and RpoD in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip analysis of RNAP and RpoD binding to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosome demonstrated a high degree of overlap between RNAP and RpoD binding and provided us with important insights into the global distribution of these factors. Furthermore this data was correlated with information on the location of 1873 transcription start sites identified by RNA-Seq technology, thereby providing a detailed transcriptional map of Salmonella Typhimurium.
