TITLE
Identification of natural diterpenes as inducers of resistance to bacterial wilt disease in tobacco, tomato, and Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum invades a broad range of plants through roots, resulting in wilting of the plant, but no effective protection against this disease has been developed. Two R. solanacearum resistance-inducing compounds were biochemically isolated from tobacco and identified as sclareol and cis-abienol, diterpenes. When exogenously applied to their roots, these diterpenes induced resistance to R. solanacearum in tobacco, tomato, and Arabidopsis plants without exhibiting any antimicrobial activity. Structure-activity correlation analysis of sclareol-related compounds revealed that the hydroxyl group at the eighth carbon position is responsible for the activity for inducing resistance. Microarray analysis identified many sclareol-responsive Arabidopsis genes, such as those encoding or with role in ABC transporters, biosynthesis and signaling of defense-related signal molecules, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Sclareol-induced R. solanacearum resistance was partially compromised in Arabidopsis mutants defective in the ABC transporter AtPDR12, the MAPK MPK3, and ethylene and abscisic acid signaling pathways. Transgenic tobacco plants in which NtPDR1, a tobacco homolog of AtPDR12, was silenced exhibited also reduced resistance. These results suggest that multiple host factors are involved in resistance to R. solanacearum induced by sclareol and its related compounds and that these compounds can be used to protect crops from bacterial wilt disease.

DESIGN
Genes that were preferentially expressed in Arabidopsis roots 2 hours after treatment with sclareol were explored. The microarray analysis was performed in triplicate.
