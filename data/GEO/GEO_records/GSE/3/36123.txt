TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in VAV1-/- versus VAV1+/+ bone marrow (BM)-macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression profiles in VAV1-/- versus VAV+/+ BM-macrophages , respectively. A distinct expression profile in VAV1-/- versus VAV1+/+ (wild-type) BM-macrophages  allows to resolve molecular mechanisms.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained froms BM-macrophages of VAV1+/+ and VAV1-/- mice
