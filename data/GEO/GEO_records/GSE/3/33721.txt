TITLE
Mouse peritoneal macrophages at 3.5 or 48 hours, 0,0.5 or 5 μg/ml Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2),gene expression array, two independent biological replicates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LECT2 is a liver derived cytokine and involved in many pathologic conditions, especially in immune regulation. To better understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of LECT2 in immune response, mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mouse peritonaeum. After treatment with 0, 0.5 or 5 μg/ml of LECT2 for 3.5 or 48 hours, gene expression profile in mouse peritoneal macrophages was measured using gene expression array. Results showed that LECT2 treatment led to the enhancement of cytokines secretion and phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages.

DESIGN
Gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages  isolated from mouse peritonaeum were measured after exposure to 0,0.5 or 5 μg/ml LECT2 for 3.5 or 48 hours using  gene expression array. Two independent experiments were performed using different mice for each experiment for gene expression array analysis.
