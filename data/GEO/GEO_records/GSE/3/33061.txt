TITLE
Sequentially acting Sox transcription factors in neural lineage development [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report sequential binding but unique functions of different Sox transcription factors during distinct stages of neural differentiation We used microarray to examine the molecular function of Sox3 in neural progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Over-expression of Sox3 under Nestin-promoter in neural progenitor cells. Cells are transgenic for GFP in Sox1 locus and were FACS sorted to obtain pure populations.
