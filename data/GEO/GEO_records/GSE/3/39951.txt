TITLE
Biofumigation effects of wild Brassica oleracea on beneficial soil invertebrates

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to identify the transcriptional changes between wild Brassica oleraceae lines (Winspit) and 2 cultivated lines (purple sprouting broccoli and savoy cabbage) that show different biofumigation phenotypes. Fully expanded leaves were compared from 8 week old plants.
