TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type and delta_dasR mutant of Streptomyces coelicolor grown in soil amended with chitin

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
Genome-wide microarray analysis was performed using RNA extracted from soil cultures of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in the presence or absence of chitin. The vast majority of genes in chitin and amino sugar metabolism, as well as many other genes for carbon and energy, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, were differentially expressed in response to addition of chitin. Moreover, the gene expressions of eight gene clusters for secondary metabolites were also significantly up-regulated in the chitin amended soil. To reveal the role of a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator, DasR, which has been reported to be involved in regulation of chitin metabolism, antibiotic production and morphological differentiation, the gene expression patterns of wild type and dasR mutant in soil amended with chitin were compared by microarray analysis. The dasR mutation resulted in up-regulation of four antibiotic gene clusters and down-regulation of chitin metabolism.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA extracted from soil cultures of Streptomyces ceolicolor A3(2). A whole genome microarray of S. coelicolor (NimbleGen Custom Prokaryotic Gene Expression 72K 4-plex Arrays) was designed and manufactured by Roche (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI). Each array contained four sets of 8 sequence-specific 60-mer probes per gene corresponding to 7825 genes from the S. coelicolor A3(2) genome.
