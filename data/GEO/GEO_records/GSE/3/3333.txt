SUMMARY
To understand better the mechanisms controlling the balance between proliferation and self-renewal or growth suppression and differentiation during myelopoiesis we have utilized a cell line model that is responsive to myelopoietic cytokines and suited to large-scale gene-profiling. In addition to characterising differential growth or differentiation responses induced by Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) respectively, we increased the power of this study by monitoring global gene expression changes in response to signalling from two activated mutant GM-CSF receptors which display differential signalling and leukaemogenic activity. A factorial time-course design generated a substantial and powerful dataset and linear modelling identified the expression changes associated with continued proliferation, differentiation or leukaemic signalling. We focussed on the changing transcription factor profile and defined a set of novel genes with potential to regulate myeloid growth and differentiation. We identified gene expression patterns associated specifically with the leukemic GM-CSF receptor mutant and have shown that these overlap with events associated with the FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) frequently observed in AML. Such commonalities may be a key to leukaemic receptor signalling and could provide new targets for myeloid leukaemia therapies. Keywords: time course, factorial design, cell line comparison, cytokine receptor, linear modelling
