TITLE
Androgen Receptor (AR) targets in a cell line from the mouse proximal caput epididymus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sequence data represent a profile of AR network targets in proliferating and non-proliferating P17 cells without cross linking AR to DNA prior to purification. P17 cells were derived from the mouse epididymal cell line PC1 by genetic modification to express a tagged wild type mouse AR cDNA (N-TAP-mAR). N-TAP-mAR allows purification of multi-protein complexes and their genomic targets with FLAG antibody coupled magnetic beads under native conditions.

DESIGN
comparison of AR targets in proliferating versus non-proliferating cells using the PC1 WT cell line (not expressing a tagged AR) as a negative control.
