TITLE
WRKY type transcription factor OsWRKY28 overexpression effect on rice leaves 48 h after Magnaporthe Oryzae infection

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsWRKY28, a WRKY type transcription factor. Results provide insight into the role of OsWRKY28 in the defense signaling against rice blast fungus.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in wild-type and OsWRKY28 overexpressing rice leaves infected with or without Magnaporthe Oryzae was analyzed using one-color method with three biological replicates.
