TITLE
Human SW480 cells: Untreated vs H2O2 Treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip tilling array comparing untreated human SW480 cells vs SW480 cells treated with 2mM H2O2 for 30min.  Exposing cells to the reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, recruits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to damaged chromatin. DNMT1 becomes part of a complex(es) containing DNMT3B and members of Polycomb Repressive Complex 4. The goal was to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment on chromatin, including changes in histone modifications and binding patterns of chromatin-associated proteins.

DESIGN
[Agilent-014706]: Two-condition: untreated SW480 cells (U) vs  H2O2 treated SW480 cells (T).  Five-mark: SIRT1, gamma-HA2X, DNMT1, DNMT3B, and EZH2. [Agilent-014707]: Two-condition: untreated SW480 cells (U) vs  H2O2 treated SW480 cells (T).  Five-mark: SIRT1, gamma-HA2X, DNMT1, DNMT3B, and EZH2. [Agilent-026595]: Two-condition: untreated SW480 cells (U) vs  H2O2 treated SW480 cells (T).  Five-mark: SIRT1, gamma-HA2X, DNMT1, DNMT3B, and H3. [Agilent-027811]: Two-condition: untreated SW480 cells (U) vs  H2O2 treated SW480 cells (T).  Four-mark: H3, 3MeK4H3, AcK16H4, and 3MeK27H3.
