TITLE
Novel Transcriptome Profiling Analyses Demonstrate that Selective PPARg Modulators Display Attenuated and Selective Gene Regulatory Activity in Comparison with PPARg Full Agonists

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted extensive transcriptome profiling studies to characterize 70 SPPARgMs and seven PPARg full agonists in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and a subset of these ligands in adipose tissue of diabetic db/db mice. In both cases, the SPPARgMs generated attenuated gene regulatory responses, and their gene expression signatures were more enriched in metabolic pathways that are likely to mediate anti-diabetic efficacy than those of PPARg full agonists. More importantly, our profiling results demonstrated that in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and db/db mice, SPPARgMs regulate the expression of anti-diabetic efficacy-associated genes to a greater extent than that of adverse effect-associated genes, while PPARg full agonists regulate both gene sets proportionally.

DESIGN
We conducted 10 independent batches of profiling experiments. Within each batch, drug treatment and pool of vehicle controls were hybridized to the Agilent two channel microarray. Generally 2-3 biological replicates for each condition.
