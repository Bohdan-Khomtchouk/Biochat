TITLE
High Myc activity is an independent negative prognostic factor for diffuse large B cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated to which extend aberrant c Myc activity plays a functional role in other aNHL and whether it is independent from MYC translocations. Based on a combined microarray analysis of human germinal centre (GC) B cells transfected with c Myc and 220 aNHLs cases, we developed a ‘c Myc index’. This data set contains expresssion profiles from Germinal center B-cells transfected with control or Myc expression vectors. The corresponding lymphoma gene expression profiles are included in the series with GEO accession GSE4475.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of germinal center B-cells extracted from human tonsils with and without ectopic expression of Myc.
