TITLE
Analysis of the Arabidopsis shoot meristem transcriptome during floral transition identifies distinct regulatory patterns and an LRR protein that promotes flowering

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced cDNA synthesized from mRNA from 3 time points of a time course of Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristems. Plants were grown two weeks in short days (time point +0LD) and then exposed to long days for 1 day (time point +1LD) and 3 days (time point +3LD). Meristem cells were collected using laser capture microdissection, to generate a meristem-specific time course of gene expression in the early stages of floral induction. The experiment was done in three biological replicates (called A, B, and C). Some repetitions of sequencing on a few samples (technical replicates) were also done

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in shoot apical meristems at 3 time points from the stage of vegetative meristem to the stage of a transition meristem, before the formation of floral meristems.
