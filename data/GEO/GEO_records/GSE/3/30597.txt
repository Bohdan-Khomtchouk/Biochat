TITLE
Opposing effects of estrogen and Runx2 on breast cancer cell proliferation: identification of a reciprocally-regulated gene signature with clinical prognostic value.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of reciprocal modulation of Runx2 and E2 signaling in BCA. Our objective was to investigate whether the interaction between estrogen and Runx2 signaling in breast cancer (BCa) could help refine an estrogen-responsive gene signature with improved prognostic value.

DESIGN
MCF7/Rx2dox BCa cells conditionally expressing Runx2 upon doxycycline treatment were treated with estradiol and/or doxycycline to induce Runx2, and global gene expression was profiled to define genes regulated by estradiol, Runx2, or both.
