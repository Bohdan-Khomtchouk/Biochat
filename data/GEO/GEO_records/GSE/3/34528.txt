TITLE
Suppression of Progenitor Differentiation Requires the Long Non-Coding RNA ANCR [HG-U133_Plus_2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse processes, yet a potential role for lncRNAs in maintaining the undifferentiated state in somatic tissue progenitor cells remains uncharacterized. We used transcriptome sequencing and tiling arrays to compare lncRNA expression in epidermal progenitor populations versus differentiating cells. We identified ANCR (anti differentiation ncRNA) as an 855 bp lncRNA down-regulated during differentiation. Depleting ANCR in progenitor-containing populations, without any other stimuli, led to rapid differentiation gene induction. In epidermis, ANCR loss abolished the normal exclusion of differentiation from the progenitor-containing compartment. The ANCR lncRNA is thus required to enforce the undifferentiated cell state within epidermis.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To establish the global gene regulatory effects of ANCR depletion, total RNA was isolated in biologic duplicate from cells in different conditions and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus arrays.
