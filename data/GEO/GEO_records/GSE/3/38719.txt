TITLE
Identify the downstream targets of Stat3 by using an engineered mouse ES cell line treated with GCSF and LIF plus PD0325901

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify downstream targets of Jak/Stat3 pathways without being distracted by differentiation signalings from MEK/ERK pathway, we exploited a engineered B6 cells, which stably stably expressing a chimeric receptor (GRgp-Y118F). The chimeric receptor can induce the phosphorylation of Stat3 by GCSF without activating the MEK/ERK pathway. To mimic the effect of GCSF, the chimeric B6 cells were also treated with LIF plus a selective MEK chemical inhibitor, PD0325901, to induce LIF/Jak/Stat3 but MEK/ERK pathways.

DESIGN
mESCs starved in serum free growth medium for 6hrs were treated with GCSF or with LIF plus PD0325901 for 1hr, after which total RNA was extracted for analysis.
