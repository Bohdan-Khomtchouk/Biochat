TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, to obtain a complete registry of genetic lesions in MDS and to identify novel therapeutic targets, we performed SNP array analysis and whole exome analysis for novel mutations using high-throughput sequencing technologies. In whole exome analysis, paired CD3-positive T cells were used as a normal control. By comparing sequences in tumors and paired T cells, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9 %, including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels). The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3 % of all detected mutations (N = 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by SNP array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays was performed for 29 MDS or related neoplasms and paired 29 germline samples.
