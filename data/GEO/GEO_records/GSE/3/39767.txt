TITLE
Expression data from OsRP1L1-overexpressing plant leaf in japonica rice (cv. Ishikari-shiroge (I-S))

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A novel rice NBS-LRR gene was cloned and overexpressed to explore its function in bacterial blight (BB) resistance. Due to its similarity to the Rp1 gene in maize (Zea mays), it was designated as OsRP1L1. We used microarrays to detail the global reprogram of gene expression in OsRP1L1-overexpressing plants.
