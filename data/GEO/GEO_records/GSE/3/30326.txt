TITLE
Virus-induced inflammatory gene networks underlying asthma exacerbations in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global patterns of gene expression was profiled in nasal lavage samples obtained from asthmatic children during an acute Picornavirus-induced exacerbation and 7-14 days later. Gene coexpression network analysis and prior knowledge was employed to reconstruct the wiring diagram of the underlying gene networks.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of paired samples obtained during the acute exacerbation and 7-14 days later from 16 asthmatic children.
