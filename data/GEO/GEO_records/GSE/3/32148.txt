TITLE
DNA methylation in peripheral blood from individuals with Crohns' disease or ulcerative colitis and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and normal peripheral blood samples. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 482,421 CpGs in peripheral blood samples. Samples came from 17 Crohn's disease affected, 11 ulcerative colitis affected, and 20 normal individuals. Within these samples were three twin sets discordant for Crohn's disease and three twin sets discordant for ulcerative colitis.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridized to the  Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.1
