TITLE
Cross-species meta-analysis of regulatory networks of the Pax5 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of chicken Pax5 deficient DT40 B cell line to investigate the targets of Pax5 which is required for B-cell differentiation Used in cross-species comparison to investigate evolutionarily conserved regulatory circuits in B cell development

DESIGN
Pax5 deficient DT40 B cells (3 biological replicates) were compared to DT40 wild-type cells (3 biological replicates).
