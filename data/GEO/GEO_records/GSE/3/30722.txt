TITLE
Profiling proteome-scale antibody responses to M. tuberculosis proteins in TB suspect's sera

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in a continuum of ill-defined, clinical manifestations with stable latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and severe active disease at the ends.  Identifying different states of infection is of importance to tuberculosis (TB) control since risk of developing active disease varies among different asymptomatic states while infectiousness varies among patients with different bacterial burden.  We investigated changes in proteome-scale antibody responses during disease progression in a non-human primate model of tuberculosis.  We probed M. tuberculosis proteome microarrays with serial sera collected from three infection-outcome groups (active, reactivation, and latent).  We found that each infection outcome is associated with characteristic changes in the antibody levels and number of antigenic targets, which suggested an association between antibody responses and bacillary burden.  Additional proteome-scale serological profiling of > 400 human TB suspects established that antibody responses are positively associated with bacterial load.  Thus tuberculosis-specific antibody levels and number of antigenic targets increases with disease progression.
