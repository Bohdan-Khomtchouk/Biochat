TITLE
Meta-analysis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Gene Expression Defines a Variant Subgroup and Identifies Gender Influences on Tumor Biology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma comprises two dominant subtypes, ccA and ccB, with gender disparity providing additional disease information. A third minor subgroup has distinct expression profiles consistent with von Hippel-Lindau wild type status and displays variant histology features.

DESIGN
44 new tumor samples and six large, publicly available, ccRCC gene expression databases were identified that cumulatively provided data for 480 tumors for metaanalysis via meta-array compilation.
