TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of immortalized human fibroblasts in response to alpha-particle radiation and the radiation induced bystander effect

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bystander effect from ionizing radiation consists of cellular responses generated from unirradiated cells to the irradiation of their neighbors. The bystander effect can lead to DNA damage and genomic instability in the affected cells. This non-targeted effect of radiation has received attention due to its potential implications for cancer therapy and radiation protection. Although studied extensively, a complete understanding of its molecular mechanism is the subject of ongoing research. While many studies have targeted specific factors which are suggested to be involved in the bystander effect, few have looked at whole genome gene expression in bystander cells. Furthermore, even fewer studies have looked at the expression in noncancerous human cell lines. In this study we have used a genome-wide microarray approach to investigate transcriptional responses in irradiated and bystander immortalized human fibroblasts following 0.1 Gy α-particle irradiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from F11hTERT fibroblasts irradiated with 0.1 Gy α-particles and bystander fibroblasts receiving medium from control (sham irradiated) and irradiated cells (0.1 Gy). RNA was isolated 4, 8 and 26 h after irradiation.
