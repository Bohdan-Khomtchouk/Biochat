TITLE
The frequency of antigen-specific T cells is regulated by self-specific non-clonal neighbors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to repeatedly mount successful immune responses against a wide range of pathogens, vertebrates must maintain sufficient numbers of diversely specific T cells over a long time. The cellular principles ensuring this are not clear. We show that the density of an antigen-specific T cell population is regulated by neighboring T cells not specific for the same antigen. Their activity is nevertheless T cell specific, due to the shared recognition of a self-peptide. Such regulation was sufficient to prevent autoimmune arthritis even in a lymphopenic model system without other regulatory T cells. This homeostatic strategy, based on the specific recognition of unique sub-threshold ligands, avoids excessive loss of bystander specificities during multiple immune responses, preserving the valuable diversity of the T cell repertoire.

DESIGN
Ten of the centi-pools selected from screening that showed very high or no " deletor " activity against 5C.C7 T cells were analyzed for gene expression patterns that may correlate with their activity. The reference sample consisted of RNA from Mouse T cells (Na√Øve, Memory, and Tolerant) that were mixed in equal proportion.
