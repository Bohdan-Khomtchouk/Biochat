TITLE
Comparison of Bacillus subtilis wild type and cshA mutant at exponential versus stationary phase

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Comparison of Bacillus subtilis wild type and cshA mutant at exponential versus stationary phase. Detailed description (other than provided below) of growth conditions, RNA preparation, cDNA synthesis and hybridization conditions can  be found in the submitted paper.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis 168 wild type and its cshA derivative strain were grown in CSE-Glu medium and cells were harvested at mid exponential (OD600 ~0.8) and early stationary phase (OD600 ~2.2-2.4).  For both time points, 4 biological replicates were used and 2 were mixed after cDNA labeling, resulting 2 slides for both exponential and stationary phase. Dye swaps are included in both experiments.
