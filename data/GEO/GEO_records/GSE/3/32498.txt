TITLE
Gene expression of wild-type and Ppar-beta null primary keratinocytes, with and without infection with an activated Hras retrovirus, with and without the Ppar-beta specific ligand GW0742

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression profiles were observed in response to Hras in either wild-type or Ppar-beta null primary keratinocytes and differentail gene edxpression profiles by GW0742 were only found in wild-type keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Primary keratinocytes from wild-type and Ppar-beta null mice were either mock infected or infected with an Hras encoding retrovirus and treated with or without 1 uM GW0742 for 24 hours.
