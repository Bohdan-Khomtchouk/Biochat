TITLE
Profile of testicular polysomal gene expression regulated by Gonadotropin Regulated Testicular RNA helicase in adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The down-regulation of known genes concerned with spermatogenesis at polysomal sites in GRTH KO and their association with GRTH in WT coupled with early findings of minor or unchanged total mRNAs and abolition of their protein expression in KO, underscore the relevance of GRTH in translation. Studies showed the association of GRTH bound polysome genes with the ubiquitin-proteasome-heat shock protein signaling network pathway and NFÎºB/TP53/TGFB1 signaling networks were derived from the differentially expressed gene analysis.

DESIGN
Microarray differential gene expression analysis was performed using polysome-bound RNA isolated from testes of wild type (WT) and GRTH KO mice.
