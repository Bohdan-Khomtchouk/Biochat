TITLE
ws vs clca2/35a2/352.7-Root molecular responses of nitrate transporter mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra10-04_roots - ws vs clca2/35a2/352.7 - What are the transcriptional adaptations induced by genetically modifying vacuolar nitrate transport - Plants were grown for 12 days after germination in vertical Petri dishes onto a 2mM NO3 medium (derived from Armengaud et al 2004) in long days (16h light at 65 ÂµE). Samples consisted of pooled roots from at least 30 to 50 plants per sample. The experiment has been repeated 4 times (exp IFX1-IFX3-CPLA2-CPLA3)and samples were harvested around 11h in the morning (ie 3h after illumation).

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - gene knock out, genotype comparison, normal vs transgenic comparison
