TITLE
C elegans N2 Late embryo input control

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Input lanes for ChIP-seq analysis of elements that specify nucleosome positioning and occupancy, control domains of gene expression, induce repression of the X chromosome, guide mitotic segregation and genome duplication, govern homolog pairing and recombination during meiosis, and organize chromosome positioning within the nucleus.

DESIGN
Control sample from late embryo N2 worms.
