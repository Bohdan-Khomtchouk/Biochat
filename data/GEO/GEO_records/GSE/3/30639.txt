TITLE
Evolution of gene expression during long term coexistence in a bacterial evolution experiment

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to study the evolution of gene expression in two bacterial ecotypes that coexisted for more than 35000 generations of experimental evolution in an extremely simple environment
