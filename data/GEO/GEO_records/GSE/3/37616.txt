TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA expression analysis of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma by next generation deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression, are frequently aberrantly expressed in human cancers. Next-generation deep sequencing technology enables genome-wide expression profiling of known miRNAs and discovery of novel miRNAs at unprecedented quantitative and qualitative accuracy.   Deep sequencing was performed on 22 fresh frozen clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), 11 non-tumoral renal cortex (NRC) samples and 2 ccRCC cell lines (n=35). The 22 ccRCCs patients belonged to 3 prognostic sub-groups, i.e. Those without disease recurrence, with recurrence and with metastatic disease at diagnosis
