TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression profiling of the rice root system based on developmental stages and tissue types

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The root system is a crucial determinant of plant growth potential because of its important functions, e.g., acquisition of water and nutrients, structural support, and interaction with symbiotic organisms. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of root development and functions is therefore necessary for improving plant productivity, particularly for crop plants including rice. As an initial step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the root system, we performed a large-scale transcriptome analysis of the rice root via a combined laser microdissection and microarray analysis approach.
