TITLE
Identification of novel candidate oncogenes in chromosomal region 17p11.2-p12 in human osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
in 25% - 30% of all OS cases the chromosome region 17p11.2-p12 is aberrant. Using SNP array in conjunction with expression microarrays we try to identify genes which can be classified as oncogens or are in someway benificial to the survival of the tumor.

DESIGN
To identify minimal significant amplified region(s) that is(are) aberrant in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, with a special emphasis on but not limitied to chromosome region 17p11.2-p12
