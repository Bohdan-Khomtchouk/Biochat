TITLE
Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bone marrow microenvironment in Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (LGLL) patients has been unexplored for itâ€™s role in the development of cytopenias, which lead to complications resulting in the most prominent causes of morbidity and mortality. We used microarrays on primary mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) cultures isolated from bone marrow aspirates from LGLL patients to identify genetic programs that may lead to the observed profibrotic and extrinsically senescent phenotype.

DESIGN
Isolated primary MSC cultures were maintained under reduced oxygen conditions (2%).  All cultures displayed trilineage pluripotency (adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis).  For comparison, normal MSC cultures in early passage (p2-3; same number of population doublings as the LGLL MSCs) and later passage (p7-9; same time spent in culture as the LGLL MSCs) are included.
