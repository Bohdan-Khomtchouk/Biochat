TITLE
The RDE-10/RDE-11 complex triggers RNAi induced mRNA degradation by association with target mRNA in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms for target mRNA degradation in C. elegans undergoing RNA interference (RNAi) are not fully understood.  Using a combination of genetic, proteomic and biochemical approaches, we report a divergent RDE-10/RDE-11 complex that is required for RNAi in C. elegans.  The RDE-10/RDE-11 complex acts in parallel of nuclear RNAi.  Association of the complex with target mRNA is dependent on RDE-1 but not RRF-1, suggesting that target mRNA recognition depends on primary but not secondary siRNA.  Furthermore, RDE-11 is required for mRNA degradation subsequent to target engagement.  Deep sequencing reveals a 5-fold decrease in secondary siRNA abundance in rde-10 and rde-11 mutant animals, while primary siRNA and micro-RNA biogenesis is normal. Therefore, the RDE-10/RDE-11 complex is critical for amplifying the exogenous RNAi response. Our work uncovers an essential output of the RNAi pathway in C. elegans.

DESIGN
21-24nt small RNA were purifed from different C. elegans strain populations that underwent sel-1 RNAi
