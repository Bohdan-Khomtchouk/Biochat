TITLE
Nanoarchaeum equitans small RNA analysis

ORGANISM
Nanoarchaeum equitans

SUMMARY
We report the profiling of small RNAs from Nanoarchaeum equitans by high-throughput sequencing. Over 16 million Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads were mapped to the 490,885-nucleotide small genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans. The mapping allowed the identification of highly abundant C/D box sRNAs and crRNAs in an organism that has to import its nucleotides from Ignicoccus hospitalis. The precursor tRNA halves of trans-spliced tRNAs were identified.

DESIGN
Analysis of small RNA from one sample of Nanoarchaeum equitans.
