TITLE
Thalidomide in Total Therapy 2 Overcomes Inferior Prognosis of Myeloma with Low Expression of the Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene NR3C1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Because dexamethasone remains a key component of myeloma therapy, we wished to examine the correlation of baseline and relapse expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 with other clinical features.  Experimental Design:  We investigated the clinical impact of gene expression profiling (GEP)â€“derived expression levels of NR3C1 in 351 patients with GEP data available at baseline and in 130 with data available at relapse, among 668 subjects accrued to Total Therapy 2 (TT2).

DESIGN
The effect of the expression of NR3C1 at baseline (previously published under GSE2685) and at relapse was analyzed  in the context of treatment (thalidomide vs. no thalidomide) and other clinical parameters.
