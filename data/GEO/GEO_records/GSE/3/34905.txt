TITLE
Differential gene expression caused by Dicer knockout in small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dicer knockout cause lipid metabolism dysregulation in small intestine. Analyses of transcriptomics and proteomics reveal key enzymes affected by Dicer knockout.

DESIGN
Conditional knockout of Dicer in adult mice
