TITLE
Host gene expression response to Toxoplasma gondii infection is not different between RH∆ku80 and RH∆ku80∆rop5 parasites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The normally virulent type-I RH parasite is rendered avirulent when lacking ROP5. The avirulent phenotype is a consequence of interaction with the host innate immune system. We sought to understand if ROP5 alters host gene expression in order to escape host defenses. We saw no gene expression differences between host cells infected with wt (RH∆ku80) or RH∆ku80∆rop5 parasites. We have included uninfected HFF samples that were harvested in parallel with the infected samples.

DESIGN
Host gene expression in response to infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Two independent samples per sample type. Three sample types: HFF infected with RH∆ku80, HFF infected with RH∆ku80∆rop5, and uninfected HFF.
