TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in olfactory epithelium from Atf5+/+ and Atf5-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have found that the expression pattern of Atf5 is highly restricted to the olfactory system, strongly suggesting that Atf5 is an olfactory sensory neuron-specific transcription factor. To test this possiblity, we compared gene expression profiles in olfactory epithelium (septa and turbinates) from Atf5+/+ and Atf5-/- mice.

DESIGN
Olfactory septa and turbinates were dissected from Atf5+/+ and Atf5-/- P0 pups from different litters (n=3 for each genotype) and pooled into a single sample. Three independent samples were prepared for each genotype.
