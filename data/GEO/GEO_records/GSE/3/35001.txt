TITLE
Transcription Profiling of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells overexpressing the GHSROS gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to compare the gene expression pattern of stable, polyclonal cells overexpressing the candidate non-coding gene GHSROS to vector-only (empty pTargeT vector) cells.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of MDA-MB231 cells transfected with the gene GHSROS or empty vector.
