TITLE
gene expression profiling in CD69 positive blood cells selected from Healthy blood Donors and HTLV-1-infected patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify difference in gene expression between activated /CD69+ blood cells selected from HTLV-1-infected patient displaying HAM-TSP disease (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis), compared to healthy blood donor /HD (biological sample providers: Dr. Antoine Gessain, Pasteur Institute Paris and Etablissement Fran√ßais du Sang)

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression profiling of Immune cells selected on the marker of early activation, CD69, by the use of MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec), from 10.106 blood cells of two healthy blood donors and two HAM/TSP patients
