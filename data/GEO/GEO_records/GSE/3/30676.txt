TITLE
Profiling of Jurkat T cells activated with CD3, CD28 and PMA at 1 and 8 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T lymphocytes are orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Na√Øve T cells may differentiate into the Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTreg phenotype, depending on environmental co-stimulatory signals. In order to identify the genes and pathways involved in differentiation of Jurkat T cells towards Th1 and Th2 subtypes we performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of Jurkat T cells stimulated with various stimuli an pathway inhibitors

DESIGN
Jurkat T cells were treated with CD3/CD28 and CD3/PMA and CD28/PMA. RNA was isolated after 1 and 8 hrs stumalation.
