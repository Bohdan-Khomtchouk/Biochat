TITLE
DMSO control and DZNep treated MOLM-14 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrated that 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), a histone methyltransferase inhibitor, induce robust apoptosis in AML cells through increased ROS production and ER stress. We identified a core gene signature including TXNIP, a major redox control molecule which is crucial in DZNep-induced apoptosis.

DESIGN
MOLM-14 cells were treated with DMSO and DZNep 2 ÂµM for 24 hours
