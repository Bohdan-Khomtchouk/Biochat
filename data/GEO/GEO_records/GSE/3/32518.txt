TITLE
Expression data from paired matched breast cancer Fine needle aspiration (FNA) or Core needle biopsies (CBX)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired FNA and CBX specimens were prospectively collected from 37 breast cancers before any systemic therapy during a biomarker discovery study at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We identified 293 probe sets overexpressed in core biopsies; these included five highly  coexpressed gene clusters (metagenes) corresponding to immune functions and extracellular  matrix components. We compared gene expression profiles of pairs of fine-needle (stroma-poor) and core-needle (stroma-rich) biopsies from 37 cancers to identify stroma-associated genes

DESIGN
Pre-treatment paird matched FNA and CBX from primary tumors were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to afymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
