TITLE
The human pancreatic islet transcriptome: impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used RNA-seq to identify transcripts, including splice variants, expressed in human islets of Langerhans under control condition or following exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). A total of 29,776 transcripts were identified as expressed in human islets. Expression of around 20% of these transcripts was modified by pro-inflammatory cytokines, including apoptosis- and inflammation-related genes. Chemokines were among the transcripts most modified by cytokines. Interestingly, 35% of the genes expressed in human islets undergo alternative splicing as annotated in RefSeq, and cytokines caused substantial changes in spliced transcripts. Nova1, previously considered a brain-specific regulator of mRNA splicing, is expressed in islets. 25/41 of the candidate genes for type 1 diabetes are expressed in islets, and cytokines modified expression of several of these transcripts.

DESIGN
5 human islet of Langerhans preparations examined under 2 conditions (control and cytokine treatment)
