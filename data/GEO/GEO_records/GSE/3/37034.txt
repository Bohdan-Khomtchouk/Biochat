TITLE
Rapid evolution in fungal reproductive genes as revealed by evolutionary analyses of expressed sequence tags in Neurospora

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Neurospora intermedia is a heterothallic filamentous ascomycete. In this study we use microarray technology to study the difference in gene expression between vegetative growth and early reproductive development.
