TITLE
Gene expression profiling of generated Erlotinib-resistant (ER) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeted therapies have provided advantages to cancer patients, but these therapies are limited by differential responses and developed resistance. To discover mechanisms of resistance, we developed drug-resistant cell lines and have their gene expressions profiled and compared.

DESIGN
HCC827 cells, which were initially sensitive to Erlotinib treatment, are subjected to Erlotinib treatment. Two clonal populations that resistant to Erlotinib resulted.
