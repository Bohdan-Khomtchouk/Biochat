TITLE
Expression data of the Dongjin and osbzip58-1 mutants in the immature endosperm at 9 DAF

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsbZIP58 is a regulator of starch synthesis in rice endosperm. T-DNA insertion null mutants of this gene showed a white belly phenotype indicating an altered starch composition and content. We further investigated how reduction of OsbZIP58 gene expression caused these changes by analyzing the transcriptomes in the immature endosperm at 9 DAF of the wild-type and osbzip58-1 mutants by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
9 DAF endosperm of Dongjin (wild type) and osbzip58-1 were used to compare the gene expresion, and three independent biological replicates for each material.
