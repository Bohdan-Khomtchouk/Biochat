TITLE
Gene expression profiles during the development of compensated or decompensated hypertrophy during pressure overload

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We recently introduced a modification of the established monocrotaline (MCT) model for pulmonary hypertension (PH) and subsequent right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, which allows for the selective induction of either a compensate or decompensated RV hypertrophic phenotype within four weeks after a single subcutaneous MCT injection. Both doses of 30 or 80 mg/kg body weight lead to an intermediate phase of compensated RV hypertrophy (day 14-19), while the former dose leads to a stable compensated phenotype (HYP) and the latter dose progresses towards decompensated ventricular hypertrophy and RV failure (CHF) around day 25-28 (Buermans et. al, Physiological Genomics 2005). This model provides the unique opportunity to characterize the development of either hypertrophic phenotype during the very early stages after imposition of RV pressure overload remodeling, well before phenotypical differences have become apparent. This experiment series describes gene expression profiles, generated by spotted oligonucleotide microarrays, to characterize and compare the expression of ~4800 genes from the RV of HYP, CHF and time matched control rats at 10, 19 and 25 days after injections. RV samples were hybridized against a common reference pool, prepared from total RNA isolated from the interventricular septum wall from animals at day 19 and 25.
