TITLE
Genome-wide identification of PIF3-binding sites and direct-target genes of PIF3 transcriptional regulation in skotomorphogenesis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Dark-grown seedlings exhibit skotomorphogenic development. Genetic and molecular evidence indicates that a quartet of Arabidopsis Phytochrome (phy)-Interacting bHLH Factors (PIF1, 3, 4 and 5) are critically necessary to maintaining this developmental state, and that light activation of phy induces a switch to photomorphogenic development by inducing rapid degradation of the PIFs. Here, using combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, we have identified genes that are direct targets of PIF3 transcriptional regulation, and we provide evidence that the quartet collectively regulate these genes by shared, direct binding to the target promoters in promoting skotomorphogenesis.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates data of PIF3-binding sites were collected by comparing the parallel ChIP samples from transgenic seedlings overexpressing Myc-epitope-tagged PIF3 (35S:PIF3-5xMyc, P3M) in pif3-3 null mutant background and the wild-type (WT) control.
