TITLE
The differences of the transcriptional profile between wide-type maize and transgenic ZmPIS maize (drought tolerance) by the assay of digital gene expression profile data

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of transcriptome in mazie plants. The ZmPIS gene coding PtdIns synthase from maize with a maize ubiquitin promoter was transferred into maize. The transgenic ZmPIS maize showed enhanced drought tolerance compared to non-transgenic maize. The differentially expressed genes between wide-type maize and transgenic ZmPIS maize were detected by the assay of digital gene expression profile and real time RT-PCR datas. The results displayed that the overexpression of ZmPIS resulted in the expression levels changes of a large number of genes including genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolic pathway, photosynthesis metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, aminoacid metabolism and genes coding transcription factors.

DESIGN
Examination of The differences of the transcriptional profile between wide-type maize and transgenic ZmPIS maize and analysis of the network regulated by the ZmPIS gene
