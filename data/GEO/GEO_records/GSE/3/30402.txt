TITLE
Hybridization of Burkholderia multivorans D2095 and D2214 genomic DNA

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315

SUMMARY
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) comprises opportunistic bacteria infecting hosts such as cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bcc long-term infection of CF patient airways has been associated with emergence of phenotypic variation. Here we studied two Burkholderia multivorans clonal isolates (D2095 and D2214) displaying different morphotypes from a chronically infected CF patient in order to evaluate traits development during lung infection. Since the custom array described in platform GPL13356 was based on Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 genome, here we performed a DNA-DNA hybridization to determine which probes of the array hybridize with our test genomes
