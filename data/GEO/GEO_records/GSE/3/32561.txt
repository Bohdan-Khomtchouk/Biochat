TITLE
Investigating the impact of heterologous expression of the Micrococcus luteus FabH on global transcription in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a E. coli fatty acid overproducing strain with or without heterologous expression of the M. luteus FabH.  The strain expressing M. luteus FabH produces more methyl ketones. This study will be further described in Goh, E.B.,  E.E.K. Baidoo, J.D. Keasling, and H.R. Beller. Engineering of bacterial methyl ketone synthesis for biofuels.

DESIGN
A 11 microarray study using total RNA recovered from six separate control cultures of Escherichia coli K-12 DH1 fatty acid overproducing strain with empty vector and five separate cultures of test strain, Escherichia coli K-12 DH1 fatty acid overproducing strain with vector overexpressing M. luteus FabH.  Each chip measures the expression level of 4,254 genes from Escherichia coli K-12  with eight 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with 2-fold technical redundancy.
