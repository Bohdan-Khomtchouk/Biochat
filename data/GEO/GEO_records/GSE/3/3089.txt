TITLE
Transcriptional outputs of the Caenorhabditis elegans forkhead protein DAF-16

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To identify DAF-16-dependent transcriptional alterations that occur in a long-lived C. elegans strain, we used cDNA microarrays and genomic analysis to identify putative direct and indirect DAF-16 transcriptional target genes. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
