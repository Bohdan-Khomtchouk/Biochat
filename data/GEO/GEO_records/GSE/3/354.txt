TITLE
cDNA array 2304 genes (OSPE) - HaCaT J10 24h - 0.5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human keratinocytes were cultured to confluence (day 10). Differentiated confluent cells were irradiated at 0.5 and 2 Gy. RNA from irradiated cells was compared to RNA from non-irradiated reference cells in a dye-swap procedure 24 h after irradiation. Keywords = Human keratinocytes, gamma irradiation Keywords: dose response
