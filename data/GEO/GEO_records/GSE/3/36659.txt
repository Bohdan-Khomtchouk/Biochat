TITLE
sphingo-1-Identification of Sphingolipid regulated genes in cold stress response.  Sphingolipids regulated genes.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-05_sphingolipids-cold - sphingo-1 - The cold choc response seems to be partly triggered by Sphingolipid species. To date no gene response as been associated to sphingolipid signaling pathway in plant. Our aim is to identify among the cold induced genes the ones regulated by sphingolipids and to try to define a sphingolipid pathway specific group of genes. - 7ml of 5 days-old cells suspensions were incubated in presence of different sphingolipid pathway inhibitors, 30 min to 2 hours depending in the coumpound (all were resuspended in DMSO and control were done with DMSO). Then a 30 min cold choc was applied before cells were harvested and frozen in cold nitrogen. RNA were then extracted. FB1 and DMS were from Alexis , Myr from Cayman, TSP from matreya.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
