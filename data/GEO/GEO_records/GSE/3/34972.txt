TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One of the long-standing goals in the field has been to establish a culture system that would allow maintenance of HSC properties ex vivo. In the absence of such system, the ability to model human hematopoiesis in vitro has been limited, and there has been little progress in the expansion of human HSCs for clinical application. To that end, we defined a mesenchyml stem cell co-culture system for expansion of clonally multipotent human HSPCs that are protected from apoptosis and immediate differentiation, and retain the HSPC phenotype. By performing a genome-wide gene expression analysis of purified HSPCs isolated at different stages of co-culture, we asked at the molecular level, to what degree hematopetic stem cell properties can be preserved during culture. This temporal gene expression data from in vivo derived- and ex vivo expanded human HSPCs will serve as a resource to identify novel regulatory pathways that control HSC properties, and to develop clinically applicable protocols for HSC expansion.

DESIGN
Human CD34+ fetal liver cells were co-cultured on a subclone of OP9 stomal cells (OP9M2 sublemented with supportive cytokines (see below)). To distinguish between molecular changes acquired over prolonged culture versus immediately after exposure to culture, gene expression in isolated CD45+CD34+CD38-CD90+ HSPCs was assessed after 12 hours, 2 weeks and 5 weeks in culture. Cultured CD45+CD34+CD38-CD90+HSPCs were compared to freshly isolated CD45+CD34+CD38-CD90+HSPCs and their more differentiated CD45+CD34+CD38+CD90- downstream progenitor cells.
