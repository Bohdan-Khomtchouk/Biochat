TITLE
Analysis of temporal gene expression responses during TNBS-induced colitis development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To obtain insight into the complex traits underlying the local pathophysiological response to the repeated colitis inductions with TNBS, whole genome gene expression was performed on RNA isolated from the distal colon tissue of 5 mice/timepoint

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated from the distal colon of TNBS colitis mice (isolated on day  9, 14, 16, 21, 23, and 28) was compared to those healthy control mice
