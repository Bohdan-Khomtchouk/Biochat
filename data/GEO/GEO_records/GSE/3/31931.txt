TITLE
Interferon-gamma/TNF-treated human corneal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our experiment is to compare Glyco-gene expression by interferon-gamma/TNF-treated human corneal epithelial cells also treated either with cell communication glycoprotein 'lacritin' or negative control deletion construct 'C-25 lacritin'.  In a newly developing story, lacritin but not C-25 protects human corneal epithelial cells from INFG/TNF-induced cell death.  This expression array will help work out the mechanism of protection to complement phosphoblotting and shRNA approaches currently underway.

DESIGN
Lacritin targets its coreceptor 'syndecan-1' in lacritin-dependent cell proliferation and secretion. Lacritin appears to be important in human 'dry eye' and in promoting corneal epithelial cell survival in the presence of inflammatory cytokines.
