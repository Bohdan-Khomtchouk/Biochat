TITLE
Deep-sequencing of total RNA from manually dissected wild-type Arabidopsis embryos at the globular stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This dataset provide deep-profiling of the embryonic transcriptome of total RNA at the globular stage in Arabidopsis. Embryos were derived from a cross between Col0 (mother) and Ler (father). Embryos were manually dissected ensuring no contamination with maternal seed coat or endosperm. For details on the method, see PMID: 21620136.

DESIGN
1 sample: cross between Col0 and Ler
