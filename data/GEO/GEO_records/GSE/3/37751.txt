TITLE
Molecular Profiles of Human Breast Cancer and Their Association with Tumor Subtypes and Disease Prognosis (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study identified DNA methylation patterns that were associated with tumor subtypes, disease outcome, and distinct metabolome and gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
This study performed a large scale DNA methylation (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip [HumanMethylation450 15017482 v.1.1], N=73), gene expression (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [HuGene-1_0-st], N=108), and metabolome (Metabolon, Inc. Durham, NC) analysis of fresh-frozen human breast tumors from African-American and European-American patients from the greater Baltimore area, Maryland (US), with survival follow-up.
