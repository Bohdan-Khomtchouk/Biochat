TITLE
Salmonella wild type and mutant sdiA in LB and 2mM indole

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type and deletion of the sdiA regulator-encoding gene grown to OD600=1 in LB alone or in LB supplemented with 2mM indole. The goal is to determine Salmonella response to indole and to define the SdiA-regulated genes in these conditions.
