TITLE
Effect of miR-144/miR451 expression on TC-1 lung epithelial cell responses to influenza infection for 24 hours [RT-PCR]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Antiviral responses must be regulated to rapidly defend against infection while minimizing inflammatory damage, but the mechanisms for establishing the magnitude of response within an infected cell are not well understood. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate protein levels by binding target sequences on their cognate mRNA. We profiled microRNA expression in the lungs of mice infected for 24 h with Influenza A/PR/8/34 to identify microRNAs that may regulate host response to influenza infection.

DESIGN
Mice were infected intranasally with 10e5 pfu Influenza A/PR/8/34. Lungs were isolated after 24 hours and total RNA extracted using Trizol. Equivalent quantities of RNA from 3 infected mice were pooled.
