TITLE
Time-course gene expression profiles of gefitinib-sensitive or -resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells stimulated with EGF, in the presence or absence of gefitinib, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), induces substantial clinical responses for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells harboring EGFR activating mutations, but most of them invariably develop resistance. By generating a gefitinib resistance (PC9GR) from a human NSCLC-derived drug sensitive cell line (PC9), we studied differences of transcription dynamics between them by the aid of a computational decoupling of hidden regulatory signals from time course gene expression profiles. Given a collection of transcription factors (TFs) and their regulatory targets, the method captured temporally-synchronized shifts in evolving expression of target genes sharing each TF regulatory  unit, and drew underlying regulatory signals. The analysis identified sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) as a key regulatory agent that facilitates the maintenance  of drug tolerance, involving transcription controls of a G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor whose expression was specifically elevated in PC9, but in turn, reduced in PC9GR

DESIGN
Gefitinib-resistance cell line (PC9GR) was established derived from lung adenocarcinoma cell line PC9. PC9 cells and PC9GR cells were treated with the four different conditions, control (No treatment), EGF-treatment, gefitinib-treatment, and both gefitinib and EGF-treatment. In each condition, the gene expression was measured at 26 time points during 24 hrs.
