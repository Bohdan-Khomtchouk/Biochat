Gene expression profile of small airway epithelium of normal non-smokers and normal smokers

SUMMARY
The earliest morphologic evidence of changes in the airways associated with chronic cigarette smoking is in the small airways. To help understand how smoking modifies small airway structure and function, we developed a strategy using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and brushing to sample the human small airway (10th-12th order) bronchial epithelium to assess gene expression (Affymetrix HG-U133A array) in phenotypically normal smokers (n=6, 24 Â± 4 pack-yr) compared to matched non-smokers (n=5). Compared to samples from the large (2nd to 3rd order) bronchi, the small airway samples had a higher proportion of ciliated cells, but less basal, undifferentiated, and secretory cells. The small, but not large, airway samples included Clara cells, a cell found only in the small airway epithelium, and the small, but not the large, airway epithelium expressed genes for the surfactant apoproteins. Despite the fact that the smokers were phenotypically normal, analysis of the small airway epithelium of the smokers compared to the non-smokers demonstrated up- and -down-regulation of genes in multiple categories relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), including genes coding for cytokines/innate immunity, apoptosis, pro-fibrosis, mucin, responses to oxidants and xenobiotics, antiproteases and general cellular processes. In the context that COPD starts in the small airways, these changes in gene expression in the small airway epithelium in phenotypically normal smokers are candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent the onset of COPD.
