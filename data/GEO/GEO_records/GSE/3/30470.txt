TITLE
Gene expression correlated with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity rating scales in Tourette syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity are the primary behaviors associated with Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Previous studies proved that peripheral blood gene expression signature could mirror central nervous system disease. This study determined if gene expression in blood correlated with inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity rating scales and/or both in subjects with Tourette syndrome (TS).

DESIGN
Whole blood was collected from each subject, and RNA was isolated from the blood of 21 un-medicated TS subjects, gene expression measured on Affymetrix human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays
