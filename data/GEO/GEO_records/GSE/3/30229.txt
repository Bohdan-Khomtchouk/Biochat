TITLE
Peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles are predictive of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling and semi-supervised classification of blood samples from a case-control study of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in peripheral blood. Samples included peripheral blood samples from 92 incident cases of HNSCC and 92 control subjects.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 184 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
