TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse mammary tumorspheres, mammospheres, and mammospheres induced to differentiate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumorpsheres and mammospheres were used to propagate mouse breast tumor-initiating cells and their normal stem/progenitor counterparts, respectively.  Mammospheres induced to differentiate were used to model the more differentiated cells of the mouse mammary gland. We used microarrays to find differentrially expressed genes between tumorspheres, mammospheres, and mammospheres induced to differentiate

DESIGN
Primary cells were isolate from either mouse mammary glands (FVB/N) or mouse mammary tumors and placed in stem cell media (MMTV-Neu [N2O2].  Spheres were passaged every 7 days for 3-5 passages and harvested for RNA isolation
