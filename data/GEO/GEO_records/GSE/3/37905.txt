TITLE
Expression data from transgenic Nicotiana tabacum expressing a variant of coat protein and movement protein from Tobacco mosaic virus

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Transgenic expression of viral proteins in natural host plants is a useful simplified system with the potential to understand the individual effect of each viral component. Transgenic expression of movement  (MP) and a variant from coat protein (CPT42W) in tobacco, a TMV natural host, produces severe morphological changes, altered miRNAs accumulation and poor fertility. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes caused by the co-expression of TMV capsid and movement proteins in Nicotiana tabacum comparing two isogenic lines MPxCPT42W  and mpxcpT42W* (a line with both transgenes spontaneously silenced and with normal phenotype).
