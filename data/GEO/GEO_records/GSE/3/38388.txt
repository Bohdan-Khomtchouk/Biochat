TITLE
miRNA profiling in HIV-1 latently infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Herein expression trends of host miRNA were measured in HIV-1 latently infected and persistent replication cells, as well as the control cells. HIV-1 latency infection was established by infecting CEM-SS lymphocytes with HIV-1 Bru strain. After selection and long-term culture, the chronically infected cell showed the characteristics of latency definition: 1. The provirus was intergrated in to the host genome.2. No viral expression could be detected during culture.3 .Cell stimulators, such as TNFa,PMA, etc, reactivate the viral expression. As expected, miRNA trend was different in HIV-1 latency when compared to the control or HIV-1 replication. A subset of miRNAs is enriched in HIV-1 latency model. The observation reinforces the concept of active HIV-1 interplay with host small RNAs that modulate HIV-1 infection mode.
