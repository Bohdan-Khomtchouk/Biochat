TITLE
Expression profiles of X-ray responsive miRNA in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA that regulates the expression of its target genes by interacting with the complementary sequence of the target mRNA molecules. Recent evidence has shown that genotoxic stress induces miRNA expression, but the target genes involved and role in cellular responses remain unclear. We examined the role of miRNA in the cellular response to X-ray irradiation by studying the expression profiles of radio-responsive miRNAs and their target genes in cultured human cell lines. We found that expression of miR-574-3p was induced in the lung cancer cell line A549 by X-ray irradiation. Overexpression of miR-574-3p caused delayed growth in A549 cells. A predicted target site was detected in the 3'-untranslated region of the enhancer of the rudimentary homolog (ERH) gene, and transfected cells showed an interaction between the luciferase reporter containing the target sequences and miR-574-3p. Overexpression of miR-574-3p suppressed ERH protein production and delayed cell growth. This delay was confirmed by knockdown of ERH expression. Our study suggests that miR-574-3p may contribute to the regulation of the cell cycle in response to X-ray irradiation via suppression of ERH protein production.
