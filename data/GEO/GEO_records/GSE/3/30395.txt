TITLE
Identification of Arabidopsis Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA regulated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) is a crucial regulator of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Recentily RDR2 was reported to regulate expression of long intergenic noncoding RNAs. Here we used ATH lincRNA v1 expression arrays to compare lincRNA expression in inflorescence tissues of rdr2-1 and WT. Among the 4,634 lincRNAs detected we found that more than 34% of them were differentially expressed, including 676 lincRNAs that were up-regulated and 890 down-regulated in rdr2-1.

DESIGN
Inflorescences(Col-0) x Inflorescences(rdr2-1), 3 biological replicates.
