TITLE
Two replicates of mRNA from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves 24 hours post infection with Botrytis cinerea

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Two samples from a larger study of the effect of Botrytis cinerea infection on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. These two samples also form part of an investigation of the sequence dependancy of DNA and RNA fragmentation within ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments

DESIGN
Two technical replicates from the 24 time point of a time series
