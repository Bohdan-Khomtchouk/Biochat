TITLE
Comparative genomics of Helicobacter pylori strains associated with different clinical outcome

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
In this study, a whole-genome CombiMatrix Custom oligonucleotide tiling microarray with 90000 probes covering six sequenced Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) genomes was designed and utilized for comparative genomic profiling of eight unsequenced strains isolated from patients with different gastroduodenal diseases in Heilongjiang province of China. Since significant genomic variation were found among these strains, an additional 76 H. pylori stains with different clinical outcomes isolated from various provinces of China were further tested by PCR to demonstrate this distinction. We observed several highly variable regions among strains of gastritis, gastric ulceration and gastric cancer. They are involved in genes associated with bacterial type I, type II and type III R-M system as well as in a virB gene neighboring the well studied cag pathogenic island. Previous studies have reported the diverse genetic characterization of this pathogenic island, but it is conserved in the strains tested by microarray in this study. Moreover, a number of genes involved in the type IV secretion system related to DNA horizontal transfer between H. pylori strains were identified based on the comparative analysis of the strain specific genes. These findings may provide new insights for discovering biomarkers for prediction of gastric diseases.
