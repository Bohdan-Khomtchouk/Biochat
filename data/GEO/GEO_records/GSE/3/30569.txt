TITLE
Metabolic switching in Streptomyces coelicolor wild type, time series under glutamate depletion condition

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
During the lifetime of a fermenter culture, the soil bacterium S. coelicolor undergoes a major metabolic switch from exponential growth to antibiotic production. We have studied gene expression patterns during this switch, using a specifically designed Affymetrix GeneChip and a high-resolution time-series of fermenter-grown samples. This time series was conducted using medium leading to glutamate depletion and the cultivation conditions as published in Nieselt et al. BMC Genomics 2010, performed with the Streptomyces coelicolor wild type strain M145E.
