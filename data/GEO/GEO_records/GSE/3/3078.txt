TITLE
C2C12 transcriptome changes in response to hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In muscle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation increases with strenuous activity, chronic unloading, and inflammatory stimuli; skeletal muscle function is very sensitive to ROS; and there are redox-sensitive signaling pathways. Using myogenic cell cultures, we asked whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces adaptive changes in skeletal muscle gene expression. H2O2 downregulated or failed to induce antioxidant or apoptotic genes in the myotubes. Instead, H2O2 changed the expression of genes for cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes, and upregulated inflammatory mediators. Finally, H2O2 had a mostly inhibitory effect on the expression of many transcription factors. The results indicate that mild oxidative stress may induce an adaptive response in skeletal muscle without antioxidant upregulation or apoptosis.
