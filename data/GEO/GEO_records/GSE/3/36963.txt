TITLE
Expression data from 11-day-old antisense BoEMF2.1 broccoli

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
EMF2 genes play an important function in inhibiting reproductive programs during vegetative stage of plant development. We knocked down the expression of endogenous EMF2 genes in broccoli by introduing a 35S::antisenseBoEMF2.1 contruct. The transgenic broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2s showed aberrant phenotypes during development. We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression and to identified genes misexpressed in broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2 genes
