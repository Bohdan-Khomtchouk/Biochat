TITLE
Deactivation of Hepatic Stellate Cells during Liver Fibrosis Resolution in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of mouse hepatic stellate cells was characterized under the following conditions: Quiescent (isolated from normal mouse liver) and reverted (isolated from mouse liver treated with 4 injections of carbontetrachloride followed by 45 day rest period) Affymetrix Mouse 1.0ST  gene expression measurements were used to characterize the transcriptomic basis in quiescent hepatic stellate cells, isolated from normal liver, and reverted hepatic stellate cells, isolated from liver treated with 4 injections of CCl4 followed by a 45 day rest period.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mouse hepatic stellate cells was characterized under the following conditions: A. Quiescent control hepatic stellate cells (n=4). B. Reverted hepatic stellate cells (n=4).
