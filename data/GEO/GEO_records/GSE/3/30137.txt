TITLE
p53-dependent transcription program in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to obtain a global picture regarding regulation of p53 in liver cells we used HepG2 hepatoma cells.We created two isogenic sub-cultures of HepG2 cells with altered expression of p53. HepG2 cells were infected with a retroviral vector harboring either small-hairpin RNA targeting p53 (termed HepG2sh-p53) or a non relevant small-hairpin RNA (termed HepG2sh-con).

DESIGN
Cells were treated with two different p53 stimulators - Nutlin and AICAR
