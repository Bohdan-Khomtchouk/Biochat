TITLE
Genome-wide changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue expression in HIV negative adults after 2 weeks of zidovudine or stavudine with lamivudine.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As controversy remains as to the exact mechanisms by which the thymidine-analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (AZT) and stavudine (d4T) induce subcutaneous adipose tissue toxicity, we used microarrays to dentify patterns of gene expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue that change as a result of exposure to these drugs for 2 weeks.

DESIGN
Paired RNA samples (baseline and week 2), isolated from the adipose tissue of HIV-uninfected healthy adults randomized to 6 weeks of either AZT/ lamivudine (3TC) or d4T/ 3TC were analysed by microarray.
