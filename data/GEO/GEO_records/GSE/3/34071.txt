TITLE
Expression data of Normal versus Mutant MPS VII C3H mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray to detect pathway differences in the various brain regions in a monogenic in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( MPS VII ), a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease A number of changes revealed unexpected system and process alterations, such as upregulation of the immune system with few inflammatory changes (a significant difference from the closely related MPS IIIb model), down-regulation of major oligodendrocyte genes even though white matter changes are not a feature histopathologically, and a plethora of developmental gene changes.

DESIGN
94 samples, no replicates, made up of half normals and half MPS mutant mice for the MPS VII mutation backcrossed on a C3h-heouj background
