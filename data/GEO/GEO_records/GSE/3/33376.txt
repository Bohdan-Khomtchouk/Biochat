TITLE
Rapid Transcriptome Changes Induced by Excess Chromium in Rice Roots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Chromium (Cr) is a non-essential metal for normal plants and is toxic to plants at high concentration. In spite of many previous studies having been conducted on the effects of Cr stress, the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of action of Cr remain poorly understood. In this study, the transcriptome at the early of Cr (VI) stress were assayed in rice roots. To gain more insight into these cellular responses, we analyzed whole-genome transcriptome of rice expose to Cr (VI) for 1 and 3 h. Analysis revealed 1,261 and 267 up and down-regulated genes by Cr (VI). Cr (VI) stress triggered changes in transcript levels of genes related to secondary metabolism process, biosynthetic process, specially jasmonic acid biosynthetic process, response to abiotic stress, specially response to toxin, transcription regulator activity, specially transcription factors activity. The most predominant transcription factor families were WRKY, AP2/ERF, NAC, C2H2, MYB. In addition, many protein kinase, including eight MAPKKK, two CDPK, and one MAPK, showed significant increase in transcriptional level under Cr (VI) stress. Molecular mechanisms for the excess Cr(VI) in rice roots

DESIGN
Comparison of mock control and rice seedlings treated with 200 Î¼M Cr(VI); Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 Cr(VI)-treated replicates.
