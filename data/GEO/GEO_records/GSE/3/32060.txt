TITLE
Widespread regulation of translation by elongation pausing in heat shock

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq and ribosome footprinting libraries of mouse 3T3 and human 293T cellsrelated to Shalgi et al.  2013

DESIGN
36bases paired-end RNA-seq, and ribosome footprinting libraries for: 3T3 cells - Control, 8 hours of mild heat shock (42) and 2 hours of severe heat shock (44) - in replicates, as well as 3T3 cells treated by mild followed by severe heat shock. In addition, 3T3 cells treated with Hsp70 inhibitor VER-155008 (Massey et al. 2010), and 293T cells transfected with Hspa1a or GFP, before and after 2 hours of severe heat shock.
