TITLE
Effects of the JADE-HBO1 complex on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that 499 genes are up-regulated and 457 are down-regulated in response to over-expression of JADE1, while 397 genes are up-regulated and 385 are down-regulated after HBO1 knock-down.

DESIGN
For each condition - HBO1 siRNA treatment or JADE1 over-expression - two biological replicates were analyzed in duplicate.
