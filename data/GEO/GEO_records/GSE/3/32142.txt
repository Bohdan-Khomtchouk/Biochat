TITLE
Silencing of HAI-1 in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SAS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the role of hepatpcyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) in cancer, we analyzed effect of HAI-1 silencing on gene expression profiles of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SAS. We used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against HAI-1 mRNA. We constructed retroviral vectors which showed stable and significant silencing effects on HAI-1 genes of SAS. Microarray data of the expression profiles of duplicated experiments of HAI-1-knockdown SAS with that from the control cell are shown.

DESIGN
HAI-1-knockdown SAS and the control cell were proceeded to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The experiment was repeated respectively  (HAI-1KD_1, HAI-1KD_2, HAI-1con_1, and HAI-1con_2).
