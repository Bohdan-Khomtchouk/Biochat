TITLE
Transcriptome profile on epileptogenic zones of patients with neocortical epilepsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used expression microarray to establish a transcriptome on epileptogenic zone versus irritative zone from removed brain tissues of patients affected with intractable neocortical epilepsies. Our results showed that expression profiling of a total of 30,968 human genes in 10 patients brain samples.

DESIGN
A total of 10 patients were recruited in this study. Mean age and period of intractable neocortical epilepsy were 19.8±2.5 and 13.7±2.3 years, respectively. After clinical evaluatng by EEG, SPEC, MRI, and v-EEG, patients were performed with surgical removal of epileptogenic zone and irritative zone. Removed surgical samples were obtained snap-frozen on dry ice for total RNA extraction commissined to Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan. RNA samples were evaluated using Human OneArray TM with 30,968 human genome probes.
