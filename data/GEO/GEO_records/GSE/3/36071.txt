TITLE
Effect of costimulation on microRNAs levels in human naïve CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA transcriptional profiling of human naïve CD4 T cells comparing cells that saw no activation, only anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to identify microRNAs specifically upregulated by CD28-mediated costimulation.
