TITLE
Expression data from BMDC cells with or without Sendai virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral and microbial pathogens. BMDC is critical for innate immunity. To investigate the complicated net signaling after virus invasion, we did a cDNA microarray analysis of BMDC with or without Sendai Virus infection. We used microarrays to find proteins that upregulated by Sendai Virus infection and investigated if these proteins had functions in regulating Sendai Virus induced signaling pathway.

DESIGN
BMDC cells are seperated from C57BL6 mice, infected with Sendai Virus or not,cultured and harveseted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
