TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis plants that overexpress green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-LOV kelch protein 2 (GFP-LKP2)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
LKP2 belongs to a group of blue light receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana. We performed DNA microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression levels are altered in LKP2-overexpressing plants. Agilent's Whole Arabidopsis Genome Oligo Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
Comparison between 35S:GFP overexpressing- and 35S:GFP-LKP2 overexpressing- plants (Yasuhara et al. 2004) was performed.
