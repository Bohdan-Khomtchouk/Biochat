TITLE
Epigenome analysis of saliva samples from alcohol users

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of saliva DNA from 197 alcohol dependent subjects. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in saliva samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
