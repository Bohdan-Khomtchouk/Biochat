TITLE
Genomic transcriptional profiling identifies candidates genes for successful aging

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The inbred LOU/C/Jall rat is currently described as a model of successful aging. These rats have a longer healthy median lifespan than other strains, do not develop obesity, diabetes, or tumor and more importantly they do not show cognitive decline with aging. This is the first study to examine gene expression changes in the inbred LOU/C/Jall rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Microarray data from LOU/C/Jall rats aged of 5 months were compared to the one measured in rats aged of 26 month. We have identified a set of 15 genes in the hippocampus and 70 genes in the frontal cortex that could be grouped into several clusters of similar expression profiles and that are involved in biological functions, namely regulation of plasticity, inflammatory response, metabolic, catabolic and homeostatic processes, and transcription. Genes were mainly up-regulated in aged brain.

DESIGN
Gene expression profil in hippocampus and cortex frontal of LOU/C/Jall rats strain. Rats were 3 and 26 months old.
