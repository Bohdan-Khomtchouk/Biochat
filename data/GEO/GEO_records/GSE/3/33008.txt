TITLE
Differential Gene Expression Profile in Bovine Blastocysts Resulting from Hyperglycemia Exposure during Early Cleavage Stages

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
IVP blastocysts exposed to hyperglycaemia during early phase of development, i.e from zygote to 8-16 cells stages. Genes expression analysis is done at day 7.5 (7 days of embryo culture).

DESIGN
Total RNA form glucose treated blastocysts (4 replicates of 10 embryos each) and control treated blastocysts (4 replicates of 10 embryos each) were compared on a 2-color micro-array design and dye swap.
