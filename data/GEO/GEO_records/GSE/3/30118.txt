TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of non small cell lung cancer in North East India

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the genes differentially expressed in non small cell lung carcinoma associated with prevalent risk factor such as smoking and betel quid chewing in high-risk north eastern Indian population. The tumor biopsies and matched normal tissue from distant site were collected in RNA later, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until processed. Data of clinicopathologic parameters were obtained from patients’ clinical and pathologic report. Institutional human ethics committee approved the study.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from tumor biopsies and matched normal of five patients. Total RNA from normal tissue from three patients was pooled in one slide and normal tissue from another two patients was pooled in another slide. Individual slide were used for each tumor samples.   Isolation Kit: RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen)   Scanner Used: AFFYMETRIX, 428 Array
