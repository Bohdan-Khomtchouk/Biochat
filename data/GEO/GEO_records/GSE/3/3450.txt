TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for TAF II p250 on Human Hela S3 Cells

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
TAF II p250 ChIP-chip performed on Human Hela S3 Cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts).  Goal was to identify TAF II p250-binding sites. Keywords = Transcription Factor Binding, TAF II p250, ChIP-chip, Human, Genome Tiling Arrays Keywords: ChIP-chip
