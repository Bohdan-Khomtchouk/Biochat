TITLE
Androgen-Responsive microRNAs in mouse Sertoli Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although decades of research have established that androgen is essential for spermatogenesis, androgen’s mechanism of action remains elusive. This is in part because only a few androgen-responsive genes have been definitively identified in the testis. Here, we report that microRNAs—small, noncoding RNAs—are one class of androgen-regulated trans-acting factors in the testis. Specifically, by using androgen suppression and androgen replacement in mice, we show that androgen regulates the expression of several microRNAs in Sertoli cells. Our results reveal that several of these microRNAs are preferentially expressed in the testis and regulate genes that are highly expressed in Sertoli cells. Because androgen receptor–mediated signaling is essential for the pre- and postmeiotic germ cell development, we propose that androgen controls these events by regulating Sertoli/germ cell–specific gene expression in a microRNA-dependent manner.
