TITLE
DNA methylation alterations in response to pesticide exposure in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of DNA from K562 cells treated with three commonly used pesticides and control (EtOH). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in DNA samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip. 7 pesticides were used.
