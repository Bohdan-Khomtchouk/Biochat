TITLE
Assessment of Ex Vivo Prostaglandin pathway activation in HSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transplantation with low numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), found in many of the publically accessible cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) units, leads to delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates, and early mortality in many patients.  A chemical screen in zebrafish identified the prostaglandin compound, 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), to be a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.  We hypothesized that an ex vivo modulation with dmPGE2 prior to transplantation would lead to enhanced engraftment by increasing the “effective” dose of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in cord blood.  A phase I trial of reduced-intensity double UCB transplantation was performed to evaluate safety, rates of engraftment and fractional chimerism of dmPGE2 enhanced UCB units.  To explore potential causes of the lack of enhanced efficacy in the first cohort, we characterized HSCs to determine whether the prostaglandin pathway was being activated under the ex vivo incubation conditions (4°C, 10µM dmPGE2, 60 minutes).  Incubation conditions were identified (37°C, 10µM dmPGE2, 120 minutes) that maximize the activation of the prostaglandin pathway by dmPGE2 in human CD34+ cells.

DESIGN
Isolated human CD34+ from umbilical cord blood were incubated ex vivo in Stem Span media with 10uM 16,16-dmPGE2 or DMSO.  Two treatment conditions were evaluated (4 deg C for 1 hour, 37 deg C for 2 hours) with either 3 or 7 biological replicates at each condition.  Total RNA was isolated post incubation and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays for pathway activation.
