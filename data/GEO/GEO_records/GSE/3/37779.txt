TITLE
The effect of HO-1 overexpression on microRNA transcriptome in NCI-H292 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to determine the effect of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) overexpression on microRNA transcriptome in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NCI-H292). Since the cells of different HO-1 genotypes were used (cells are after retroviral transduction with empty vector with normal level of HO-1 or retroviral transduction with vector harboring HO-1), it is possible get the comprehensive answer which microRNAs are regulated by HO-1.

DESIGN
Confluent NCI-H292 cells that contain EV-ctrl or overexpressing HO-1.  Pool of reference cells are cells  untreated and treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-Î± for 6 hours before RNA isolation.  The samples are biological triplicates - three independent experiments were performed at different time points for all cell lines. Total number of the presented samples is 6.
