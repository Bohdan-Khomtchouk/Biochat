TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells after hnRNP L knockdown (versus luciferase control), including cycloheximide treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP L, followed by cycloheximide treatment to eliminate NMD. Supplementary files GSE37561_activated_exon.txt and GSE37561_repressed_exon.txt list exons predicted to be activated and repressed by hnRNPL, respectively.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of hnRNP L (luciferase) knockdown samples
