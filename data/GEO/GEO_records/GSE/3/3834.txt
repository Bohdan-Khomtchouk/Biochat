TITLE
Profiling of ER+ BrC cells with and without estradiol in both cell cultures and xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated DNA microarray based gene expression profiles from three estrogen receptor a (ERa) positive breast cancer cell lines stimulated by 17ÃŸ-estradiol (E2) in vitro over a time course, as well as from MCF-7 cells grown as xenografts in ovariectomized athymic nude mice with E2 supplementation and after its withdrawal. Keywords: Cell line and xenograft comparisons
