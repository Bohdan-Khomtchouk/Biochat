TITLE
Developmental trajectories of gene expression reveal candidates for diapause termination, a key life history transition in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella

ORGANISM
Rhagoletis pomonella

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray experiment comparing differential expression across a developmental and metabolic trajectory of diapause termination.

DESIGN
Six phenotypes representing 6 developmental time points, four replicate individuals for each phenotype, four competitve hybridizations for each of six phenotypic comparisons. Each individual was hybridized up to 3 times, each in a separate phenotypic comparison. Phenotypes: 24Fridge = early diapause (24 hours after transfer from fridge to 24C) LateDia =  late diapause (2 weeks after transfer from fridge to 24C) Break24 = 24 hours after initial metabolic rate increase Break48 = 48 hours after initial metabolic rate increase Plat = in the metabolic rate plateau PostPlat = in the final, exponential phase of metabolic rate increase
