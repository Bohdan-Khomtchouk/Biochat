TITLE
Profiling of mucosal derived bovine ab and gd T cells during Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium enterocolitis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
gd T cells have an important yet incompletely defined role in inflammation associated with a variety of infectious and autoimmune conditions.  To better understand the precise roles of gd T cells relative to ab T cells in a specific infection, we utilized Salmonella Enterica Serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infection in cattle as it is a leading cause of disease in cattle and closely approximates S. typhimurium-induced enterocolitis in humans.  To best represent phenotype and gene expression changes occurring in the gut mucosa early in S. typhimurium infection, gd and ab T cells were collected directly from the mesenteric lymphatic ducts and analyzed by FACS or immediately sorted and processed for microarray analysis.  Gene expression profiles were compared at intervals during infection within T cell subsets.  The majority of gene expression changes in both subsets occurred 48 hours after infection.  In response to S. typhimurium infection there was an increase in expression of several genes in gd T cells which were indicative of activation, proliferation and innate function, whereas in ab T cells gene expression changes suggested a lack of S. typhimurium-specific response.  This work represents the first focus on gene expression trends in tissue-derived T lymphocytes in an in vivo model that is highly relevant to human S. typhimurium-induced enterocolitis.
