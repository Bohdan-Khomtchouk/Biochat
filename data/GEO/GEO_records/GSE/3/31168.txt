TITLE
Genetic Landscape of Copy Number Alterations in Gastric Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA copy number profiling of gastric tumors and matched non-maligant samples. The affymetrix SNP6 array was used to obtain DNA copy number profiles in 193 gastric tumors and 98 matched gastric non-malignant samples.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA extracted from 193 gastric tumors and 98 matched gastric non-malignant (normal) tissues was hybridized on Affymetrix SNP6 genotyping arrays.
