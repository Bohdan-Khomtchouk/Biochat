TITLE
Genomic characterization of the MPNST

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare sarcoma that lacks effective therapeutic strategies. By characterizing recurrent gene copy number aberrations, we gain insight into the most altered pathways with the purpose of scanning possible therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
We conducted a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization profiling of two cohorts of primary MPNST tissue samples including 25 patients treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and 26 patients from Tianjin Cancer Hospital. All samples had at least 90% tumor content. Commercially available normal genomic DNAs were used as control.
