TITLE
DNA methylation screening identifies driver epigenetic events of cancer cell survival.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT116 wild type and with a genetic disruption of DNMT3B and DNMT1 (DKO). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. For this study, we used two DKO subclones, DKO8 and DKO1, which retain approximately 45% and 5% of the HCT116 wild type global DNA methylation levels, respectively

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 3 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
