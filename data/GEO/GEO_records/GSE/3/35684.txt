TITLE
Genome-wide identification and analysis of gene expression in BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, infected with rabies virus CVS-11 (Challenge virus standard)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in the present study was that rabies virus (RABV) infection affects the gene expression in microglial cells. Results provide important information that RABV infection led to alteration of gene expression in microglia.

DESIGN
A twelve-chip study was performed using total RNA isolated from RABV- or mock-infected BV-2 at 12, 24, or 48 hpi.
