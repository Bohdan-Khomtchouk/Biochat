TITLE
Expression data from volatile treated and insect damaged Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant volatiles can mediate plant-plant communication in the sense that plants attacked by herbivores can signal their unattacked neighbors of danger by emitting HIPVs. We call this the priming effect. Since the plant defense response is a systematic process involving numerous pathways and genes,to characterize the priming process, a time course study using a genome-wide microarray may provide more accurate information about the priming process. Furthermore, to what extent do the priming process and direct defense share similar gene expression profiles or pathways are also not clear. We used microarray to detect the priming effect of plant volatiles to healthy Arabidopsis thaliana, and the effect of direct leafminer feeding to Arabidopsis thalianas.
