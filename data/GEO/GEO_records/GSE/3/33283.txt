TITLE
Gene expression data in the brain of tadpoles [Rana pirica] exposed by larvae salamander.

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail. The objective of the present study was to use Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip to profile gene expression in the tail tissue by different predation threat.
