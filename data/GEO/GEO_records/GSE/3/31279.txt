TITLE
Decoding differentially regulated epithelial and stromal pathways in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes from dissected whole tissue and laser capture microdissected colorectal cancer tissue samples The analysis, in colorectal cancer tissues, of compartmental and whole tissue expression profiles as well as the significantly active pathways that were differentially deregulated between the epithelial and stromal compartments when compared alongside that of whole tissue dissection

DESIGN
Comparison of tumor epithelium vs normal epithelium; tumor stroma vs normal stroma and tumor whole tissue vs normal whole tissue
