SUMMARY
In order to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in renal carcinogenesis, and identify molecular targets for diagnosis and treatment, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles of 15 surgical specimens of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), compared to normal renal cortex, using a combination of laser microbeam microdissection (LMM) with a cDNA microarray representing 27,648 genes.

DESIGN
Tissue samples of surgically-resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and their corresponding clinical information were obtained from patients with written informed consent. The total of 15 cancer patients (6 women and 9 men; median age, 66; range, 36-75 years) that had been confirmed histologically as ccRCC were selected for this study. Two to three pieces of cancer tissue had been taken from each patient at the time of radical nephrectomy.  Normal tissue had been obtained from the distant region from cancer area in the resected kidney tissue. These samples were immediately embedded in TissueTek OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan), frozen, and stored at -80°C.  The frozen tissues were sliced into 8-μm sections using a cryostat (Sakura) and then stained with H & E for histological examination. We used LMM technology to collect pure populations of ccRCC cells as well as non-cancerous renal cortex.  A mixture of normal renal cortex cells in kidney tissues from 11 patients was prepared as a universal control. Experiments were performed using 6 sets of slides (slide set 1-6 corresponding to ID_REF 1-27648).
