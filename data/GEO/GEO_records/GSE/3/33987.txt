TITLE
Progression of Neuroblastoma Tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies have reported that metastatic tumor cells acquire genomic aberrations compared to those present in the primary due to an unstable genome. However, it is not clear if all malignancies follow a similar pattern. Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor of childhood. To examine how the neuroblastoma genome changes during tumor progression, we investigated chromosomal structural alterations across three tumors from a patient with hisg-risk neuroblastoma. The tumors included the primary tumor, one metastatis collected at diagnosis before any treatment, and a second metastatis collected during post mortem investigation. The recapitulated chromosomal structural alterations demonstrated that all three tumors had extensive chromosomal alterations involving virtually every chromosome. All tumors were aneuploid and shared many chromosomal alterations often seen in neuroblastoma. Despite some tumor to tumor structural variability, approximately 81-91% of the altered regions were shared among the three tumor genomes with primary tumor and pre-treamment metastatis being the most similar.

DESIGN
Three samples from one patient with high-risk neuroblastoma. Primary tumor plus two metastatic tumors. One of metastasis sampled at diagnosis, before any treatment, and second metastasis taken at autopsy.
