TITLE
Nimblegen 385K array CGH on NCI-60 cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NCI-60 cancer cell lines have been used for studying cancer pathogenesis and for drug discovery. This dataset adds to the growing number of datasets on various genomic platforms that have been made public on Cellminer ( )

DESIGN
61 cell lines (including PR:DU145 and its drug resistant derivative PR:RC01) were arrayed. Of these, 56 were done one time, four cell lines were done with either two or three replicates, and one cell line (LC:A549) was done with three replicates and two dye flips. Two color arrays were used, with Cy3 mostly used for sample and Cy5 for the reference pool of 6 normal male samples.
