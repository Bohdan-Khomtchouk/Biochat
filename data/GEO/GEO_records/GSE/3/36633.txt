TITLE
Analysis of differential genetic expression by dietary intervention using moderate-carbohydrate restriction diet supplemented with calorie restriction mimetic multiple phytochemicals extracts(MCDmp) in B16F10 xenografted mouse model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed survival analysis of control and MCDmp groups, and explored underlying tumor suppression mechanisms after dietary intervention, focused on alterations in the energy-dependent signaling pathways, and global gene expression differences on cDNA microarray study, or histone modification on ChIP-on-chip analysis.

DESIGN
Illumina arrays: Five- week- old male C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed control diet (control group, LabDiet, Brentwood, MO, USA) or MCDmp formula (Treat group) in a specific pathogen free zone. All procedures were approved by the institutional animal use and care committee. Following a preliminary feeding of each diet formula for one week, 1 × 106 B16F10 cells (suspended with 100 μl of PBS) were subcutaneously injected into the back of the mice. After 24 days of diet supplementation, all mice were sacrificed. Tumor tissue was excised for cDNA microarray.
