TITLE
Identification of ORB1 target genes using inducible overexpression system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify  genes associated to the  down-regulation TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) pathway in Arabidopsis. For this purpose, three independent amiR-tor lines (amiR-tor9, amiR-tor17 and amiR-tor 20) and EV lines 3 and 6 days after EST- or non-induction were used for expression profile analysis using Affymetrix microarray. Two weeks-old transgenic seedlings were transferred to MS plate with 20ÂµM estradiol to induce the overexpression of amiR-tor (consequently, repression of AtTOR levels) under the control of an estradiol-(EST) inducible promoter. Identically treated wild-type Col-0 and pER8 empty-vector (EV) transformed seedlings were served as controls. Seedlings were harvested after 3 and 6 (amiR-tor lines) days.
