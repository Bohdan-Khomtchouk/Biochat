TITLE
Genes affected upon dsRNA knockdown treatment for nbr/CG9247 in Drosophila DL1 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
nbr/CG9247 gene function regulates the length of the 3'end of miRNAs. Such 3'end heterogeneity of miRNAs may impact miRNA target gene silencing. To address this, we performed microarray analysis for genes altered upon nbr knockdown in Drosophila DL1 cells. This approach revealed a subset of genes upregulated upon nbr knockdown.

DESIGN
Five independent replicates of DL1 cells treated with control (dsRNA to renilla) or nbr (dsRNA RNA to nbr/CG9247) were collected 5 days after dsRNA bathing. Total RNA from from each replicate was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A portion of total RNA for each replicate was used to confirm the effect of nbr knockdown on one of the nbr-dependent miRNAs, miR-34, by small RNA northern.
