TITLE
Genomic aberrations predicts survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detailed genetic profiling of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) has shown that these tumors are characterized by large genetic heterogeneity with some genomic regions commonly affected by structural changes. Loss on chromosomes 3p and 14q, and gain on 5q and 7 are examples of alterations commonly reported in ccRCC. However, there is no consensus regarding the potential prognostic information carried by the identified alterations. We report on poorer outcome for patients with gain on 5q and 7, and loss on 9p, 9q and 14q. These aberrations were in addition found more frequently in metastasized tumors, suggesting that they are markers for advanced disease. Furthermore, the presence of â‰¥ 4 common aberrations was associated with decreased survival time. Shorter relative telomere length (RTL) has been associated with loss of chromosomal regions in ccRCC tumors, but we found no significant associations between tumor RTL and chromosomal deletions. However, significantly lower tumor-to-nontumor (T/N) RTL ratio was detected for patients with loss on 4q and 9p. Finally, we found a minimum region (MR) of genetic loss of 1.4 Mbp on chromosome 9p and this region contains only one gene, the tumor suppressor candidate 1 gene (TUSC1). TUSC1 has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis and our result further strengthens its role in tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Seventy-four ccRCC tumors and 22 paired normal kidney cortex and blood samples were genotyped on Illuminas HumanCytoSNP-12 bead chips.
