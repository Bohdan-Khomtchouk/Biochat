TITLE
Expression profiling in perinatal Ductus Arteriosus (DA) and Aorta (Ao).

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Compared the gene expression profiles of two contiguous vessels pre and post - birth, namely the Ductus Arteriosus (DA), committed to become a fibrous ligament, and the Aorta (Ao), which conversely takes on a permanent activity.  The effect of artificially enhanced O2 tension was analyzed in DA in the pre-birth condition. Keywords: Comparison gene expression
