TITLE
Expression profiling of aging liver in low-fat diet mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dietary interventions are effective ways to extend or shorten lifespan. By examining midlife hepatic gene expressions in mice under different dietary conditions, which resulted in different lifespans and aging-related phenotypes, we were able to identify genes and pathways that modulate the aging process. To determine how our dietary intervention-based transcriptomic approach for predicting aging-regulatory genes compares to more traditional approach of using age-dependent transcriptional changes, we examined the hepatic gene expression changes in LF-fed mice during aging at 4, 8, 13 and 21 months.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6J mice at 4 weeks of age were purchased from Shanghai Animal Co, Ltd. Mice were maintained under a 12-hour dark/light cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) at a temperature of 22 ± 3 °C in accredited animal facilities. Prior to the start of experiment, mice were maintained on a low-fat diet (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) for one week. Liver RNAs extracted from six male C57BL/6J mice of the same age were pooled at each age point to obtain an average microarray profile at 4, 8, 13 and 21 months.
