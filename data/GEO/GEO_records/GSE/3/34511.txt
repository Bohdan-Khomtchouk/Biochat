TITLE
mRNA profiling by androgen-induced tumor suppressor U19/EAF2 in the mouse prostate U19/EAF2 knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate potential mechanisms of U19/EAF2 action, we performed cDNA microarray analysis and identified 202 mRNA transcripts regulated by U19/EAF2 in the mouse ventral prostate. Of these transcripts, 167 are network eligible genes, with 63 associated with cancer and 24 with reproductive system diseases. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that U19/EAF2 knockout activates the RAS-BRAF-ERK signaling pathway, which is known to play important roles in carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
prostate wild type and U19/EAF2 knockout
