TITLE
Small RNA identification in Arabidopsis thaliana using modified MPSS

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Small RNAs play important regulatory roles in most eukaryotes but only a small proportion of these molecules have been identified. We sequenced more than two million small RNAs from seedlings and the inflorescence of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Known and new miRNAs were among the most abundant of the non-redundant set of more than 75,000 sequences, whereas more than half represented lower abundance small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that match repetitive sequences, intergenic regions, and genes. Individual or clusters of highly-regulated small RNAs were readily observed. Targets of antisense RNA or miRNA did not appear to be preferentially associated with siRNAs. Many genomic regions previously considered featureless were found to be sites of numerous small RNAs. Keywords: small RNA identification , modified MPSS
