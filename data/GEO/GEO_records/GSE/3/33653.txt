TITLE
Direct Recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) to Chromatin by Core Binding Transcription Factors (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play key roles in developmental epigenetic regulation. Yet the mechanisms that target PRCs to specific loci in mammalian cells remain incompletely understood. In this study, we show that Bmi1, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), binds directly to the Runx1/CBFbeta transcription factor complex. Genome-wide studies in megakaryocytic cells demonstrate considerable chromatin occupancy overlap between the PRC1 core component Ring1b and Runx1/CBFbeta and functional regulation of a significant fraction of commonly bound genes. Bmi1/Ring1b and Runx1/CBFbeta deficiency generate partial phenocopies of one another in vivo. We also show that Ring1b occupies key Runx1 binding sites in primary murine thymocytes and that this occurs via Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) independent mechanisms. Genetic depletion of Runx1 results in reduced Ring1b binding at these sites in vivo. These findings provide evidence for site-specific PRC1 chromatin recruitment by core binding transcription factors in mammalian cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq against Runx1, CBFb and Ring1b in L8057 cells (induced & uninduced with biological replicates) and thymocytes from control and Runx1 KO mice
