TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of neurotransmitter receptor and regulator genes in 4 week-old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mouse cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify cerebellar gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-060A) from SABiosciences. Mice used in this study were 4 week old males.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from whole cerebella of 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates. For this study, cerebella from 3 mice of each genotype were used and RNA from the cerebellum of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.  The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-060A).
