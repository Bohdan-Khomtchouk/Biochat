TITLE
Human naive CD4+ T cell activation transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene transcription underlying T cells activation during the first 24 hours after stimulation.

DESIGN
CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were sorted and cultured with different stimulatory conditions (Non-stimulated, anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) for different times (0 hours, 4 hours and 24 hours). 3 replicates for each condition were analyzed.
