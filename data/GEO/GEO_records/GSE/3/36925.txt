TITLE
Mouse primary osteoblasts treated with/without BMP2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate many aspects of skeletal development, including osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation, cartilage and bone formation, and cranial and limb development. Among them, BMP2, one of the most potent osteogenic signaling molecules, stimulates osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
We used cDNA microarrays to elucidate regulators of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation.
