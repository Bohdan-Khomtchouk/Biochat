TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to the overexpression of the Arabidopsis RKD4 gene

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis RWP-RK protein RKD4 is expressed specifically in early embryogenesis and triggers embryonic cell division sequences. We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to analyze the pattern of gene expression changes in response to induced ectopic expression of RKD4 in post-embryonic organs.

DESIGN
Plants of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible overexpression line and a control line were grown under normal conditions for 2 days and then treated with DEX for 1 day. RNA was extracted from two independent pools for each genotype.
