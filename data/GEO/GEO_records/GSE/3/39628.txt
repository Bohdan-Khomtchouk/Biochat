TITLE
Effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs) on MDS-derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further investigate the action mechanisms of decitabine (DAC), the molecular pathways regulated by DAC were explored using the gene expression profile of MDS-L cells treated with 4 nM DAC or DMSO for 7 days. Genes whose expression changed by more than 2.0-fold following drug treatment were defined as regulated genes. 956 genes were up-regulated and 461 genes down-regulated in MDS-L cells treated with DAC (4 nM) as compared with the control. Gene expression profiling suggested that DAC significantly affects various gene biogroups, including cellular movement, inflammatory response, hematological system development and function, hematopoiesis, and cell death.

DESIGN
Decitabine-induced gene expression in MDS-L cells was measured after 7 days exposure at dose of 4 nM. Three independent samples.
