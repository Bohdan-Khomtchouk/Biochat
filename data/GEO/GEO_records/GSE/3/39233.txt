TITLE
Placental PPARg-Regulated Genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Robust identification of placental PPARg target genes via mutliple PPARg-dependence criteria. Integration of differential expression data from Pparg-null, Rxra-null, Med1-nul and Ncoa6-null placentas and from WT and Pparg-null Trophoblast stem cells (TSC) differentiated for 2 or 4 days in the presence or absence of the PPARg agonist Rosiglitazone (Rosi).

DESIGN
[Placentas] Three pools of three WT placentas, each vs a litter-matched pool of three Pparg-null placentas Three pools of three WT placentas, each vs a litter-matched pool of three Rxra-null placentas Three pools of three WT placentas, each vs a litter-matched pool of three Med1-null placentas Three pools of three WT placentas, each vs a litter-matched pool of three Ncoa6-null placentas [Trophoblast stem cells (TSC)] Three independent WT TSC lines differentiated for two and four days in the presence or absence of Rosi vs two independent Pparg-null TSC lines differntiated for the same durations in the presence of Rosi
