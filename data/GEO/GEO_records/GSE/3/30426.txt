TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) immune response against Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3).

ORGANISM
Cyprinus carpio

SUMMARY
Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), also known as koi herpesvirus (KHV), is the aetiological agent of an emerging and lethal disease in common and koi carp. In this work we studied the immune response of two genetically different lines of common carp (Polish K and Polish R3) infected with CyHV-3 by immersion. The two carp lines presented a 20% difference in survival rate and, furthermore, significant difference in virus loads measured at day 3 post infection (p.i.). Microarray analysis revealed that 581 genes in line K (330 up-regulated, 251 down-regulated) and 107 genes in line R3 (77 up-regulated, 30 down-regulated), were at least 2-fold differentially expressed at day 3 p.i. compared to day 0. Genes which were at least 4-fold differentially expressed in both lines were selected as potential markers of an infection of common carp by CyHV-3. This group includes 17 up-regulated and only 1 down-regulated genes. In addition, microarray analysis revealed no significant differences in gene expression between line K and R3 at day 0. At day 3 p.i. there were, however, 76 genes that were at least 2-fold differentially expressed between the two lines. The kinetics of expression of T cell markers and selected cytokines indicate for higher activation of immune response in more resistant R3 line. Thus, our study revealed that differences in resistance to CyHV-3 between two carp lines can be correlated with differentially expressed immune-related genes.
