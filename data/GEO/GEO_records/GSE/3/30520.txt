TITLE
Chip-chip from mouse diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines with PU.1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PU.1, a transcriptional factor, is expressed in wide range of B cells from early to mature stage. To identify PU.1 direct targets in germinal center B cells, ChIP-chip ananlysis was done in three different GC-origin diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
PU.1 ChIP in two different cell lines (NFS201 and NFS202:high level of PU.1) and in one negative control cell lines(NFS205:negatvie for PU.1). Total three different samples. One sample per a set of two arrays (promoter1 and promoter2).
