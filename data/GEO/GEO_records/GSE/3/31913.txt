TITLE
Transcriptome Remodeling Associated with Chronological Aging in the Dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis

ORGANISM
Karenia brevis

SUMMARY
To gain an understanding of processes that underlie chronological aging in this dinoflagellate, a microarray study was carried out to identify changes in the global transcriptome that accompany the entry and maintenance of stationary phase up to the onset of cell death. The transcriptome of K. brevis was assayed using a custom 10,263 feature oligonucleotide microarray from mid-logarithmic growth to the onset of culture demise. A total of 2,958 (29%) features were differentially expressed, with the mid-stationary phase timepoint demonstrating peak changes in expression. Gene ontology enrichment analyses identified a significant shift in transcripts involved in energy acquisition, ribosome biogenesis, gene expression, stress adaptation, calcium signaling, and putative brevetoxin biosynthesis. The extensive remodeling of the transcriptome observed in the transition into a quiescent non-dividing phase appears to be indicative of a global shift in the metabolic and signaling requirements and provides the basis from which to understand the process of chronological aging in a dinoflagellate.

DESIGN
Twenty seven 900ml batch cultures of K. brevis were inoculated at a starting concentration of approximately 1000 cells/ml from mid-logarithmic stage starter cultures on day 0. Triplicate cultures were harvested every other day from day 2 to 18 and total RNA was extracted. One color arrays were then run on all biological replicates (n=3 at each timepoint) for days 4, 6, 10, 14 and 18.
