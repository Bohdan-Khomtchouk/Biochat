TITLE
Differential gene expression profile of y79 retinoblastoma cells in response to Anti - HMGA2 siRNA treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The differential gene expression study was conducted in the  Anti - HMGA2 siRNA treated Retinoblastoma cell (Y79). The transient transfection in Y79 cells were performed using Anti-HMGA2 siRNA . The concentration and the time of incubation  for the transfection was optimised to increase the silencing efficiency and reduce the off -target effects. After 48 hours of transfection the cells were collected and the whole genome cDNA microarray  was performed to interpret the differential gene expression regulated by HMGA2 in Y79 cells. The results of the microarray data has been validated.
