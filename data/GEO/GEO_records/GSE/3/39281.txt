TITLE
DNA copy number gain at 1q23.3 is associated with poor survival in metastatic bladder cancer [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is associated with multiple somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). We evaluated SCNAs to identify predictors of poor survival in patients with metastatic UC treated with platinum chemotherapy.

DESIGN
We obtained overall survival (OS) and DNA copy number data from UC patients in a Spanish discovery cohort and three validation cohorts. GISTIC was used to identify altered regions, and associations between copy number gains/losses and OS were determined by a Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for performance status and visceral disease The output files of the GISTIC 2.0 software are linked as supplementary files on Series record along with readme.txt file describing the contents of each file/column.
