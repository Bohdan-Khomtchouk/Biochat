TITLE
Retained heterodisomy is associated with high gene expression in hyperhaploid inflammatory leiomyosarcoma (Expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of inflammatory leiomyosarcoma (ILMS) and conventional leiomyosarcoma (LMS).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from frozen tumor biopsies (3 ILMS and 15 LMS) and hybridized onto Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. LMS_18b is the same sample as LMS_18a, analyzed at a different time point. LMS_18b data are not included in the final gene expression analysis; and therefore, there is no Sample data table. This sample was instead used in a previous analysis to show that a normalization method (the ComBat algorithm) was successful in removing batch effects and keeping biological variation.
