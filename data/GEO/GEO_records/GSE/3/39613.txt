TITLE
Transcriptomic landscape of developing Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell-derived tissues have wide potential for modelling developmental and pathological processes as well as cell-based therapy. However, it has proven difficult to generate several key cell types in vitro, including skeletal muscle. In vertebrates, skeletal muscles derive during embryogenesis from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Using PSM development as a guide to establish conditions for the differentiation of monolayer cultures of embryonic stem (ES) cells into PSM-like cells without the introduction of transgenes or cell sorting. We generated a high resolution transcriptome expression landscape along the PSM of the mouse embryo, by microdissecting consecutive fragment of the PSM along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo. We took advantage of the observation that during development of embryo, the antero-posterior spatial position of the tissue is directly correlated to its differentiation (time) stage, thus generating an expression time-course of presomitic mesoderm development.

DESIGN
Pre Somitic Mesoderm (PSM) were dissected into 7 pieces in Stage E8E9.5 Mouse embryo. The experiment was designed to have biological triplicate in each pieces. The PSM is a symmetric structure, left and right area were obtained from one embryo, another set of dissection was obtained from another embryo.
