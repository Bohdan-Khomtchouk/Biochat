TITLE
Characterization of expression changes in qin by tiling array

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Qin, a novel protein comprising amino-terminal E3 ligase and five carboxy terminal Tudor domains, silences transposons and ensures genome stability in the Drosophila germline by promoting antisene piRNA amplification via Aubergine:Ago3 Ping-Pong and preventing futile Aubergine:Aubergine interactions.

DESIGN
Extract total ovary RNAs, and using tiling array to test transposon as well as gene expression in wild-type and qin mutant flies. Three biological replicates are used.
