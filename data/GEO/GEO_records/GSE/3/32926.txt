TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of 8Br-cAMP treated human H295R adrenal cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 8Br-cAMP exposed H295R cells at different time points (10h-24h-48h) and different concentrations (50uM-100uM-300uM) with untreated solvent control cells (blanks) Analysed on a H295R custom microarray, referred to as platform GPL9718

DESIGN
common reference design (pool of control H295R cells of different experiments as reference RNA sample), 3 biological replicates
