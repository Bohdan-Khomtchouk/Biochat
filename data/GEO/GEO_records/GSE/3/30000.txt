TITLE
Reduction in membrane phosphatidylglycerol content leads to daptomycin resistance in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of Bacillus subtilis to daptomycin in wild-type and in a daptomycin resistant mutant.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis 168, WT (-DAP) vs. DapR1 (-DAP), WT (+DAP) vs. DapR1 (+DAP), DapR1 (+DAP) vs. DapR1 (-DAP). Each experiment was conducted at least twice using two independent total RNA preparations. For daptomycin untreated comparison between 168 WT and DapR1 mutant, DapR1 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 and WT was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555. For daptomycin treated experiments between WT and DapR1, DapR1 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 and WT  with Alexa Fluor 555. For treated vs. untreated DapR1, the DAP treated samples were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 and the untreated with Alexa Fluor 555. For dye swap, untreated DapR1 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 and DAP treated with Alexa Fluor 555.
