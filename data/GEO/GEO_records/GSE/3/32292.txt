TITLE
How post-translational modification of nitrogenase is circumvented in Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains that produce hydrogen gas constitutively

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris

SUMMARY
Characterization of post-translational modification of nitrogenase in Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains that produce hydrogen gas constitutively.

DESIGN
To characterize the effect of yeast extract as nitrogen source on gene expression under nitrogen fixing conditions, expression profiles of wild-type cells grown on either NF plus yeast extract and succinate and PM plus ammonium sulfate and succinate were compared using Affymetrix GeneChip. Using NF plus yeast extract and succinate media, transcriptome profiles of various mutants and wild-type cells were compared using glass spotted microarrays.
