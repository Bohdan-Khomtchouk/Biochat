TITLE
MCF10A-HER2/3 cells grown in 3D cultures in the presence or absence of SHP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The first bona fide PTP proto-oncogene was the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11), an ubiquitously expressed PTP that transduces mitogenic, pro-survival, cell fate and/or pro-migratory signals from numerous growth factor-, cytokine- and extracellular matrix receptors. In malignancies, SHP2 is hyperactivated either downstream of oncoproteins or by mutations.We provide analysis of the mammary epithelial cells MCF10A overexpressing human HER2 and HER3 and grown in 3D cultures for 15 days in the presence or absence of SHP2.

DESIGN
The human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector expressing a CTRL miR or SHP2 miR1 or SHP2 miR2. Cells from each group were grown in 3D cultures, and the knockdown of SHP2 was induced for 15 days. RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis.
