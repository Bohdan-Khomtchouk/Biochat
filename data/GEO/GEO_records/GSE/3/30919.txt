TITLE
Transcription-associated Loading and Translocation of Condensin II on Chromosome Arms in Embryonic Stem Cells (flavopiridol ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Condensin molecules are loaded onto the genome to mediate essential changes in chromosome condensation during mitosis, but it is not clear why there are two forms of vertebrate condensin that become differentially distributed on chromosomes.  We report here that condensin II, the form of condensin present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, functions specifically at active genes.  Condensin II is loaded at transcriptionally active promoters in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), migrates through these genes in a transcription-dependent fashion and accumulates in transcription termination regions.  Unlike cohesin, which is also loaded at active promoters, condensin II has little influence on transcription.  We conclude that condensin II is loaded and distributed across actively transcribed chromatin and thus serves to specifically condense this euchromatic portion of chromosomes during the cell division cycle.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq data for Condensin II and Cohesin in v6.5 ESCs treated or not with the RNA polymerase II elongation inhibitor flavopiridol, as well as data for the histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.
