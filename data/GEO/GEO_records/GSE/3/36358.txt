TITLE
Expression Data from International C.elegans Experiment 1st

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The effect of microgravity on gene expression in C.elegans was comprehensively analysed by DNA microarray. This is the first DNA microarray analysis for C.elegans grown under microgravity. Hyper gravity and clinorotation experiments were performed as reference against the flight experiment.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 100,000 worms of each experimental group
