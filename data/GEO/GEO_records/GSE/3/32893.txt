TITLE
Human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to A. alternata spores

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This present study is the first to investigate the global changes in host gene expression during the interaction of human bronchial epithelial cells and live Alternaria spores. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2-B) were exposed to spores or media alone for 24 hours. RNA was collected from three biological replicates/treatment and used to assess changes in gene expression patterns using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Interestingly, many cytokine/chemokine immune response genes were upregulated. Genes involved in cell death, retinoic acid signaling, TLR3, and interferon response pathways were also significantly upregulated.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for control (untreated cells) and treatment (5 x 10^5 A. alternata spores)
