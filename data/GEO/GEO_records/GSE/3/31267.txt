TITLE
Gene expression profiling of normal lung tissue adjacent to lung adenocarcinoma (ADCA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual variations in the transcriptional profile of normal lung tissue may reflect the lung ADCA patients’ predisposition to a specific clinical stage Associations between clinical outcome of cancer patients and the gene expression signature in primary tumors at time of diagnosis have been reported. To test whether gene expression patterns in the normal tissue surrounding the cancerous tissue might correlate with clinical stage, we compared transcriptome of normal lung samples of adenocarcinoma (ADCA) smoker patients of clinical stage I versus stage > I, and identified 55 differentially expressed genes. Eight out of 10 genes validated by quantitative real-time PCR confirmed statistical association with clinical stage, with 6 genes downregulated in high clinical stage patients, including the TMEM100 gene showing the best statistical association. Five of these 6 genes were also downregulated in lung ADCA tissue as compared to normal tissue. Functional studies in vitro indicated that four of them (SLC14A1, SMAD6, TMEM100, and TXNIP) inhibited colony formation when over-expressed by transfection in lung cancer cell lines, suggesting their potential tumor-suppressor activity. Our findings indicated that individual variations in the transcriptional profile of normal lung tissue may reflect the lung ADCA patients’ predisposition to a specific clinical stage.

DESIGN
The 120 RNA samples from normal lung were combined in 24 small pools, with 12 pools constituted by stage I patients and 12 pools by stage > I patients (5 samples per pool)
