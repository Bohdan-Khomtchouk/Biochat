TITLE
The P1 Transcription Factor Binding to the Genome

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To determine which of the genes differentially expressed between P1-rr and P1-ww pericarps were immediate (direct) targets of P1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using P1 polyclonal antibodies (alphaP1344) that recognize the non-conserved C-terminal region of P1 (Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2010), on pericarp chromatin.

DESIGN
Comparison of pericarp chromatin inmunoprecipitated material P-rr_14DAP (P1 expressed) vs P-ww_14DAP (P1 not expressed) to determine P1 direct targets
