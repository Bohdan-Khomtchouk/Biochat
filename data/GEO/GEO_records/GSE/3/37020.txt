TITLE
Epigenome analysis of smear cells from the uterine cervix consisting of 24 normals and 24 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (all HPV+)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in smear cells from the uterine cervix (liquid based cytology samples), obtained from 48 women. All women tested positive for the human papilloma virus (HPV+). Of the 48 samples, 24 were cytologically normal while the other 24 exhibited morphological transformation (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher - CIN2+).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
