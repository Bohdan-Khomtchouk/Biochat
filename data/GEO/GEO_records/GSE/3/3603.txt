TITLE
Microarray analysis  of in vivo inhibition of mir-122 with an antisense oligonucleotide.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Current understanding of microRNA (miRNA) biology is limited, and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibition of miRs is a powerful technique for their functionalization.  To uncover the role of the liver-specific miR-122 in the adult liver, we inhibited it in vivo using a 2â€™-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate ASO.  This microrarray experiment was used to identify changes in mRNA levels due to the inhibition of miR-122 that accompanied phenotypic observations of reduced cholesterol and triglycerides, increased fatty acid oxidation, and decreased fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis rates observed in hepatocytes. Keywords: single treatment vs. control
