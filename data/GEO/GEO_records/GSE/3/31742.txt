TITLE
DNA methylation data from human keratinocyte-derived iPS cells (N9) and ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation of early and late passaged keratinocyte-derived iPS cells were compared to ES cells. We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation in human keratinocyte-derived iPS cells and ES cells

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from human stem cells  and somatic cells and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
