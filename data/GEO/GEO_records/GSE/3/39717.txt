TITLE
Gene expression analysis of uveal melanoma tumor tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies have demonstrated two distinct classes of primary uveal melanoma tumors based on gene expression profiling.  This study compares the gene expression profiles of primary uveal melanomas collected from fresh frozen samples to those collected by fine needle aspiration biopsy.  Two matched metastatic samples were included to identify changes in gene expression profile with metastatic progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from tumor samples that were collected at the time of treatment.
