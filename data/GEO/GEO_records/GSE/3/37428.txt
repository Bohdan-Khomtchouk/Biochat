TITLE
Gene expression data from oncogene transformed murine prostate epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary prostate epithelial cell cultures were established from the VENTRAL prostates of FVB mice .  Cells were transduced with retroviral expression vectors encoding a single distinct oncogene (c-Myc, Ha-Ras (V-12), v-Src and NeuT, an activating mutant of ErbB2).   Individual colonies of oncogene-transduced cells were selected and characterized.  These cell lines demonstrate contact-independent growth characteristics in soft agar and in immune competent mice. To further characterize the molecular genetic signaling pathways regulated by specific oncogenes in prostate epithelial cells

DESIGN
mRNA was prepared from the oncogene transformed PEC cell lines, 12 samples(each oncogene has 3 lines) and 3 normal prostate epithelial cell controls in good condition.
