TITLE
RNA expression for ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain LY180 in the absence and presence of 15 mM furfural for 15 min

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
The data explore the transcriptional response of strain LY180 to 15 mM furfural under anaerobic fermentation conditions. The expression differences of oxidoreductase in LY180 are described.
