TITLE
Stump project -- mRNA fibroblasts; Volar versus non-volar acral skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in defining the gene signature of volar skin.

DESIGN
Dermal fibroblasts were expanded from punch biopsies of skin. We collected RNA from fibroblasts  of palms, backs of hand, soles and backs of feet and  submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 3 replicates of each site from distinct human donors were included; because of 1 failed sample(Palm_rep2), total of 11 samples analyzed
