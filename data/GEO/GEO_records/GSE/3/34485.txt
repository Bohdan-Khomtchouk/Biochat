TITLE
Microarray analysis of human bone metastases samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis with two different chip platforms, Affymetrix and Agilent, on bone metastasis samples from breast cancer patients with only bone metastases and metastases in bone and visceral organs.

DESIGN
We collected bone metastases biopsies from breast cancer patients with only bone metastases and metastases in bone and visceral organs. RNA was extracted from these samples and subjected to microarray analysis with the Agilent platform. Data were compared with a signsture obtained with the Affymetrix platform, to obtain a signature of differentially regulated genes between the two groups of patients This Series represents the Agilent data only. The Affymetrix data are provided in GEO Series GSE11078.
