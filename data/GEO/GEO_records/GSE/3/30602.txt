TITLE
[E-MTAB-315] RNA-seq of Drosophila S2 cells after RNAi knock-down of signal transduction components

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNAi of signal transduction components in Drosophila S2 cells We performed RNAi knockdown experiments on 15 different signal transduction components in Drosophila S2 cells and prepared RNA libraries from the poly-adenylated fraction of the RNA. SOLiD sequencing of strand-specific, barcoded transcriptome libraries yielded expression profiles allowing us to extract  common pathway signatures and indicated that Cka may function as novel regulator in Ras/MAPK signaling.
