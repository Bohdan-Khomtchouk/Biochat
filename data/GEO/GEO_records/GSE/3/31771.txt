TITLE
Gene expression in the mouse embryonic small intestine in the presence or absence of E-cadherin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared between E18.5 E-cadherin conditional knockout (cKO) small intestine and E18.5 control mouse small intestine.

DESIGN
E18.5 mouse small intestine was collected from control and E-cadherin conditional knockout mice. RNA was prepared.  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 gene arrays were used to interrogate gene expression.  Data was analyzed using dChip software.
