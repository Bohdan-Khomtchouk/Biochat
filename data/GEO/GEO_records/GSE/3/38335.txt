TITLE
JAK2 Naive and Persitent Murine BaF3 cells infected with MPLW515L

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Murine BaF3 cells infected with MPLW515L grown under either normal conditions (Naive) or in 0.8 uM INCB18424 for 4-6 weeks (Persistent). Naive and Persistent cells were then treated with either DMSO (Control) or 0.8 uM INCB18424 for 4 hours. Goal was to determine transcriptional changes conditioned upon sensitivity/resistance of BaF3 MPLW515L mutants to JAK1/2 specific inhibitor.

DESIGN
3 condition experiment consiting of: 1) Naive cells treated with DMSO (Control) , 2) Na√Øve cells treated with 0.8 uM INCB18424 for 4 hours (Acute) and 3) Persistent cells treated with 0.8 uM INCB18424 for 4 hours (Persistent). Biological replicates: 3 DMSO control replicates, 3 Acute replicates, 3 Persistent replicates.
