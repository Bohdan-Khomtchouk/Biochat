TITLE
Clostridium difficile strain 630 heat stress experiment

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile 630

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile strain 630 subjected to a clinically relevant heat stress (41°C ) and compared to unstressed cells (37°C ).  Heat stress was induced in biological triplicate broth cultures in the early exponential phase (D650nm=0.3) of growth and cells were harvested at late log phase (D650 = 1.1).  Goal was to determine effects of mild heat stress on gene expression.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, heat stressed vs. control. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 heat stressed replicates, with dye flip
