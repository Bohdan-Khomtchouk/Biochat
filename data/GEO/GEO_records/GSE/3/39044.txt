TITLE
Regulon of transcriptional regulator PA2449 in Pseduomonas aeruginosa PAO1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The putative trancriptional regulator PA2449 was found to be essential for both glycine/serine metabolism and the production of phenazines in P. aeruignosa PAO1. We examined the regulon controlled by PA2449 via microarray analysis between wild-type P. aeruignosa PAO1 and the PA2449-null mutant P. aeruginosa PW5126.  Both strains were obtained from the PA-two allele library (Univ. of Washington, Ref. Jacobs et al. 2003. PNAS 100, 14339).
