TITLE
miR-182 induced gene expression alteration in glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alteration following miR-182 transfection in glioma cells. We find a significant elevation of NF kappa B transcriptional targets.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from SNB-19 glioma cells transfected with miR-182 mimic oligo or miRNA mimic negative control 36 hours after transfection, two biological replications for each treatment.
