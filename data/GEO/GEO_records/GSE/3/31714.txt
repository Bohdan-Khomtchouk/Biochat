TITLE
Expression data from H2K mouse myogenic precursor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin cause muscular dystrophy. Current evidence suggests that the muscle wasting is related to defects in muscle progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. We obtained miRNA and mRNA expression data from wildtype and emerin-null cells and looked at gene expression differences between them.
