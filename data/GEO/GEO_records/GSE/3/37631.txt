TITLE
Human Pluripotent Cell Derived Endothelial Cell Characterization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ES or iPS Cells were differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs) defined by expression of CD31 (PECAM1) and CD144 (VE-Cadherin) on the cell surface. All ES or iPS derived ECs were greater than 90% double positive for these two markers. These in vitro derived ECs were compared to each other and to ECs from primary cell sources; arterial (aortic Ecs), venous (saphenous vein) and lymphatic.

DESIGN
ES and iPS cells were differentiated into Ecs using a directed differentiation protocol using sequential addition of growth factors to recapitulate endogenous differentiation (FGF, BMP4, Activin, VEGF). These ECs were grown until 21 days after the start of differentiation. Primary cells were obtained from a commercial vendor and grown to passage 3 to minimize cellular senescence and in vitro artifacts. The RNA was cleaned and DNAse digested on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was amplified, fragmented and labeled using NuGEN Technologies Applause Plus kits and the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled samples were then hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST GeneChips. The GeneChips were then washed and stained on Affymetrix 450 Fluidics Stations and scanned on an Affymetrix 3000 Scanner according to standard protocols.
