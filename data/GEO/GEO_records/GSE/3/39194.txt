TITLE
Effect of ATF4 overexpression on mRNA levels in differentiated C2C12 myotubes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATF4 is a bZIP transcription factor that that promotes skeletal muscle atrophy. The goal of these studies was to determine the effects of ATF4 overexpression on mRNA levels in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. For additional details see Ebert et al, Stress-Induced Skeletal Muscle Gadd45a Expression Reprograms Myonuclei and Causes Muscle Atrophy. JBC epub. June 12,2012

DESIGN
C2C12 myotubes were infected with adenovirus co-expressing eGFP and ATF4-FLAG.  Control myotubes were infected with adenovirus co-expressing eGFP and a transcriptionally inactive ATF4 construct (ATF4âˆ†bZIP).
