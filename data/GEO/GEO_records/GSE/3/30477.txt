TITLE
comparison of transcriptomes in mad mutants-Transcriptome analysis of miRNA action deficient mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs10-04_mad - comparison of transcriptomes in mad mutants - What gene sets are differentially expressed in mad mutants? - Seeds of GFP171.1 (parental line), mad1, mad2, mad3, mad6 and dcl1-12 were sterilized and germinated on Murashige/Skoog medium with 0.9% agar. Plates were stratified at 4C in the dark for 4 days. The plates were then transferred to a growth cabinet at 21C under a 16h light/8h darkness light regime, and the seedlings were harvested 18 days after transfer to the growth cabinet.

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - genotype comparaison
