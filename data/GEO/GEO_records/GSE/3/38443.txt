SUMMARY
Inflammatory conditions can contribute to tumor formation. However, any clear marker predicting progression to cancer are still lacking. The aim of our study was to analyze microRNA modulations accompanying inflammation-induced tumor development to determine whether these microRNA may jointly affect the expression of genes involved in cancer. For this purpose, we used the well-established azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis-associated cancer. We performed a microRNA microarray to establish microRNA expression profiles in mouse whole colon at early and late time points during inflammation and/or tumor growth. Chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis were associated with distinct changes in microRNA expression. Nevertheless, prediction algorithms of microRNA-mRNA interactions and computational analyses based on ranked microRNA lists consistently identified putative target genes that play essential roles in tumor growth or belong to key carcinogenesis-related networks or signaling pathways. Hence, inflammation, through microRNA, may affect unexpected genes or signaling pathways, thereby contributing to carcinogenesis. The present method can lead to the identification of novel genes or signaling pathways involved in cancer development.
