TITLE
gene expression profile after GGPPS deletion in sertoli cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GGPPS was the key enzyme of mevalonate metabolic pathway which was used to  synthesize the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). When we deletion the GGPPS in the sertoli cell and  the germ cell loss were found . We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after GGPPS deletion in sertoli cell and identified 1623 gene expression level change more than 2 times.

DESIGN
Primary sertoli cells from 3 days old of control and KO mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, every group primare sertoli cell were from  more than 30 mice.
