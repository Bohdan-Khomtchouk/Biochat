TITLE
The COLCATS study: Identification of an anti-apoptotic druggable target signature for the treatment of colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigates the correlation between gene overexpression and resistance to apoptosis and hyper-proliferative phenotype in colorectal cancer. We analyzed the transcriptome of a cohort of xenografted colorectal tumors and primary resected biopsies together with normal tissue datasets and identified a set of genes overexpressed in colon cancer. KEYWORDS: transcription-profile, colon, colon-cancer, xenograft

DESIGN
In total 203 samples (101 new samlpes plus 102 samples already on GEO) were analyzed, they represent 4 different types : colon cancer, colon cancer mouse xenograft, colon cancer cell line, and normal colon.
