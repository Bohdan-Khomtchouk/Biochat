TITLE
S100A4+ Stromal Cells from Normal Lung vs. Metastatic Lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of S100A4+ stromal cells at the gene expression level in physiological setting versus metastatic setting.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted S100A4+ stromal cells from normal lung of S100A4-GFP transgenic mice compared to FACS-sorted S100A4+ stromal cells from metastatic lung of 4T1 tumor-bearing S100A4-GFP transgenic mice.
