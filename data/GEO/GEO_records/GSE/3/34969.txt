TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Planarians after 6,000 Rads Irradiation

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify genes expressed in the proliferative cell population (neoblasts) of adult planarians.  Proliferating cells are rapidly and specifically eliminated following lethal irradiation.  Genes expressed by neoblasts, therefore, were expected to show decreased level of expression following 6,000 rads, relative to control animals.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from control (unirradiated) animals and from animals 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours following 6,000 rads irradiation.  Between three and five replicates were used for each sample
