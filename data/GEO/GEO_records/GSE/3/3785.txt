TITLE
Differential expression between mature zone of the olfactory organ and the dactyl of the walking legs, a taste organ

ORGANISM
Homarus americanus

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed and used to assess mRNA abundance differences between two of the lobsterâ€™s major chemosensory structures, the mature zone of the olfactory organ and the dactyl of the walking legs, a taste organ.  The 115 differences detected again emphasized the abundance of neurons in the olfactory organ, especially a cluster of mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal-associated proteins and cell adhesion molecules such as 14-3-3zeta, actins, tubulins, trophonin, Fax, Yel077cp, Suppressor of profilin 2, and gelsolin. Keywords: Differential expression
