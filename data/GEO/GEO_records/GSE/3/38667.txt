TITLE
Gene expression analysis in sensitive and tolerant Citrus rootstocks under chlorotic conditions

ORGANISM
Citrus

SUMMARY
Iron chlorosis is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting fruit trees and other crops in calcareous soils. The most evident symptoms are connected to a reduction in growth and yield and in the interveinal chlorosis of leaves.   A custom CombiMatrix 90K microarray was used to identify candidate genes involved in the citrus response to iron deficiency stress, comparing Tarocco Scirè orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] grafted on two different rootstocks, Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi × Poncirus trifoliata), high sensitive, and Carrizo citrange (C. sinensis × P. trifoliata), tolerant. RNA was extracted from roots of plants grown in two different soils, one volcanic (0% of active lime) used as control, and the other calcareous (10% of active lime).
