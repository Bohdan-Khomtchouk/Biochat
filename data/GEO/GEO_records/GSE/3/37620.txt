TITLE
Testosterone- and estrogen-induced genes in urogenital sinus mesenchyme

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine if testosterone (T) and estradiol-17 beta (E2) induced gene expression in mouse urogenital sinus mesenchymal (UGM) cells. When UGM grown in culture was treated with T+E2, numerous genes were increased and decreased compared to untreated controls. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to verify results of a subset of genes.

DESIGN
UGM cells were untreated or treated with T+E2 for 72hrs. One mouse gene expression array was used for each group.
