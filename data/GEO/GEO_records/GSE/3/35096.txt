TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic CD45+ immune cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to explore what molecular and cellular processes predicate the conversion from insulitis to diabetes. The transcriptional profiles of CD45+ immune cells collected from pancreas of a cohort of age-matched female mice, which were scanned by MRI to determine the risk of diabetes development.

DESIGN
A cohort of five females was MRI-scanned at 10 weeks of age, their pancreas was removed immediately after final imaging, and CD45+ cells were sorted from the dispersed tissue for microarray analysis of gene expression. Genes whose transcript levels were positively or negatively correlated with these  MRI signals were selected for further study. correlation between pancreatic gene expression and autoimmune diabetes development
