TITLE
E2F1 loss induces spontaneous tumour development in Rb-deficient epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The specific ablation of Rb1 gene in epidermis (RbF/F;K14cre) promotes proliferation and altered differentiation but does not produce spontaneous tumour development. These phenotypic changes are associated with increased expression of E2F members and E2F-dependent transcriptional activity. Here, we have focused on the possible dependence on E2F1 gene function. We have generated mice that lack Rb1 in epidermis in an inducible manner (RbF/F;K14creERTM). These mice are indistinguishable from those lacking pRb in this tissue in a constitutive manner (RbF/F;K14cre). In an E2F1-null background (RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mice), the phenotype due to acute Rb1 loss is not ameliorated by E2F1 loss, but rather exacerbated, indicating that pRb functions in epidermis do not rely solely on E2F1. On the other hand, RbF/F;K14creERTM;E2F1-/- mice develope spontaneous epidermal tumours of hair follicle origin with high incidence. These tumours, which retain a functional p19arf/p53 axis, also show aberrant activation of Î²catenin/Wnt pathway. Gene expression studies revealed that these tumours display relevant similarities with specific human tumours. These data demonstrate that the Rb/E2F1 axis exerts essential functions not only in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, but also in suppressing tumour development in epidermis, and that the disruption of this pathway may induce tumour progression through specific alteration of developmental programs.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between normal mouse skin, skin from transgenic RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- , E2F1-/-, and RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mouse, and carcinomas arising in the skin of RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mouse. All mice were treated with tamoxifen.
