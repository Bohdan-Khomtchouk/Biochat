TITLE
Nuclear Matrix Factor hnRNP U/SAF-A Exerts a Global Control of Alternative Splicing by Regulating U2 snRNP Maturation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear matrix associated hnRNP U/SAF-A protein has been implicated in diverse  pathways from transcriptional regulation to telomere length control to X inactivation, but the precise  mechanism underlying each of these processes has remained elusive. Here, we report hnRNP U as a  regulator of SMN2 splicing from a custom RNAi screen. Genome-wide analysis by CLIP-seq reveals that  hnRNP U binds virtually to all classes of regulatory non-coding RNAs, including all snRNAs required for  splicing of both major and minor classes of introns, leading to the discovery that hnRNP U regulates U2  snRNP maturation and Cajal body morphology in the nucleus. Global analysis of hnRNP U-dependent  splicing by RNA-seq coupled with bioinformatic analysis of associated splicing signals suggests a  general rule for splice site selection through modulating the core splicing machinery. These findings  exemplify hnRNP U/SAF-A as a potent regulator of nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in diverse gene  expression pathways.

DESIGN
Examination of hnRNP U regulated splicing in Hela cells with CLIP-seq (two biological replicates) and paired-end RNA-seq (control and hnRNP U knockdown)
