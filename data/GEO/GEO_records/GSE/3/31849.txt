TITLE
Genome-wide activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation regulates nervous system development and function [cultured cortical neurons]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine potential differences in activity-dependent gene expression, we analyzed mRNA expression in cultured neurons isolated from Wild-type vs MeCP2 S421A mice at 0 (unstimulated), 1 or 6 hours after membrane depolarization by exposure to high extracellular KCl (55mM) All mice were male littermates from one of three litters.

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from dissociated cortical cultures (E16+7DIV) isolated from  Wild-Type or MeCP2 S421A knock-in mice littermates. Cells were either left unstimulated or depolarized for 1 or 6 hours by addition of 55mM KCl to the media.  mRNA expression was analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 microarray platform.
