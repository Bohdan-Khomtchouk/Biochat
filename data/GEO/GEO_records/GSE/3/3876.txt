TITLE
Transcriptome analysis applied to survival of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 exposed to ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
The ionizing radiation (IR) dose that yields 20% survival (D20) of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is lower by factors of 20 and 200 than for Escherichia coli and Deinococcus radiodurans, respectively. Transcriptome analysis was used to identify the genes of MR-1 responding to 40 Gy (D20). We observed the induction of 170 genes and repression of 87 genes in MR-1 during a one-hour recovery period after irradiation. The genomic response of MR-1 to IR is very similar to its response to ultraviolet radiation (254 nm), which included induction of systems involved in DNA repair and prophage synthesis, and the absence of differential regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity which occurs in IR-irradiated D. radiodurans. Furthermore, strong induction of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes in MR-1 was observed. DNA damage may not be the principal cause of high sensitivity to IR considering that MR-1 encodes a complex set of DNA repair systems and 40 Gy IR induces less than one double strand break (DSB) in its genome. Instead, a combination of oxidative stress, protein damage and prophage mediated cell lysis during irradiation and recovery might underlie this organismâ€™s great sensitivity to radiation. Keywords: time course, stress response
