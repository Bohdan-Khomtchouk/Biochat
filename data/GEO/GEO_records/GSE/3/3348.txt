TITLE
Comparison of mammary glands of 16 wk old wild type and LH-overexpressing mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LH-overexpressing mice display elevated levels of mammogenic hormones and consequently develop spontaneous mammary tumors with a median latency of 41 weeks. Tumors occur in the absence of p53 mutations and in the presence of a seemingly functional p53 signaling pathway. At 16 weeks of age, no histological evidence of tumors is observed in these transgenic mammary glands; however, mammary cells do demonstrate centrosome amplification at this age suggesting that early tumorigenic processes may have occured. Thus comparison of the transcriptome of the mammary glands from 16 week old LH-overexpressing mice to that of wild type mice will provide insight into early events occuring in p53-independent hormone-induced tumorigenesis. Keywords: disease state analysis
