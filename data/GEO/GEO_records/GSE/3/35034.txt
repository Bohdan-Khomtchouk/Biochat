TITLE
Gene expression of human skin fibroblast cells derived from hypospadias patients in response to low-dose bisphenol A exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the molecular basis of the reproductive health effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on humans, a genome-wide screening was applied to identify novel targets of low-dose bisphenol A exposure in huamn skin fibroblast cells (hSFCs) derived from hypospadias patient children. Three hSFCs were collected at National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Japan. Gene expression profiles of hSFCs were measured at 24 hours after exposure to 10nM BPA, 0.01nM 17β-estradiol (E2) and 1nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Differentially expressed genes following chemical treatments were identified by unpaired Student’s t test with P values cut off by 0.05 and fold change of more than 1.2 and selected for the network generation and pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) program. As the result, 71 genes (42 downregulated and 29 upregulated), 814 genes (371 downregulated and 443 upregulated), and 824 genes (344 downregulated and 480 upregulated) were identified significantly differently expressed in response to BPA, E2, and TCDD, respectively. The network analysis indicated that the most associated network fuctions of genes genes with altered expression profile derived from microarray analysis were “Endocrine System Disorders, Gastrointestinal Disease, Genetic Disorder”, “Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Skeletal and Muscular System Development and Function, Cell Cycle”, and “Post-Translational Modification, Genetic Disorder, Hematological Disease” in response to BPA, E2, and TCDD, respectively.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 3 hSFCs derived from hypospadias patient children were measured at 24 hours after exposure to  10nM BPA, 0.01nM E2 and 1nM TCDD.
