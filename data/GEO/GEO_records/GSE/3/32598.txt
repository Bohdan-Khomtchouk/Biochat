TITLE
Highly efficient derivation of ventricular cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells with a distinct epigenetic signature

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The generation of sufficient numbers of mature ventricular myocytes for effective cell-based therapy is a central barrier for cardiac regenerative medicine. Here we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived from murine ventricular myocytes, and consistent with other reports of iPSCs derived from various somatic cell types, ventricular myocyte derived iPSCs (ViPSCs) exhibit a markedly higher propensity to differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes as compared to genetically-matched embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or iPSCs derived from tail-tip fibroblasts. Strikingly, ViPSC-derived cardiomyocytes form up to 99% ventricular myocytes suggesting that ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs may be a viable strategy to generate specific cardiomyocyte subtypes for cell-based therapies. The enhanced ventricular myogenesis in ViPSCs is mediated via increased numbers of cardiovascular progenitors at early stages of differentiation. In order to investigate the mechanism of enhanced ventricular myogenesis from ViPSCs, we performed global gene expression and DNA methylation analysis, which revealed a distinct epigenetic signature that may be involved in specifying the ventricular myocyte fate in pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from mouse ES cells,  tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs), ventricular myocytes (VMs), TTF-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (TiPSCs) and VM-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (ViPSCs).  Global gene expression profiling was performed using affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 gene arrays.
