TITLE
GAS gene expression from clinical samples

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
GAS strains were grown in THY broth to early exponential phase and RNA extracted.  Targets from two biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using the RMLgenechip.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes differentially expressed between strains. Keywords: repeat
