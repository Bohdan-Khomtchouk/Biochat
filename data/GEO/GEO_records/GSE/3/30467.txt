TITLE
Gene array analysis of embryonic vs adult hypothalamic NPY expressing cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes between two hypothalamic cell lines derived from adult and embryonic tissues. Both cell lines endogenously express the protein Npy (neuropeptide y) which is involved in feeding and reproductive processes. Results identify novel gene candidates that are implicated in the development of hypothalamic sub-poplulations.

DESIGN
Immortalized hypothalamic cell lines were created by overexpression of SV40 T-antigen from tissue sources derived from both embryonic and adult mice.  Triplicate plates of each cell line were grown to 70% confluence and RNA was harvested for microarray analysis.
