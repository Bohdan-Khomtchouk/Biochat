TITLE
Genomics of Estradiol-3-Sulfate Action in the Ovine Fetal Hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
In the fetal sheep during late gestation sulfoconjugated estrogens in plasma reach a concentration 40-100 times greater than unconjugated estrogens. The objective of the present study was to determine the genomics of estradiol-3-sulfate (E2S) action in the fetal brain. The hypothesis was that E2S stimulates genes involved in the neuroendocrine pathways in the hypothalamus that direct or facilitate fetal development at the end of gestation. Four sets of chronically-catheterized ovine twin fetuses were studied (gestational age: 120-127 days gestation) with one infused with E2S intracerebroventricularly (1 mg/day) and the other remained untreated (control). After euthanasia, mRNA samples were extracted from the 8 hypothalami, corresponding to the four treatment and four control fetuses. Microarray analysis was performed following the Agilent protocol for 1-color 8x15 microarrays, designed for Ovis aries.

DESIGN
A total of 4 sets of chronically-catheterized ovine twin fetuses were studied with one infused with estradiol-3-sulfate intracerebroventricularly (1 mg/day) for 7-12 days, using an osmotic mini-pump implanted in the fetus, and the other served as an untreated control.  The gestational age at the time of surgery was 120-127 days of gestation.  Twin fetuses were randomly assigned to the two groups at the time of surgery. After 7-12 days of infusion, twin fetuses of known gestational age (130 to 134 days) were euthanized and mRNA samples were extracted from the 8 hypothalami, corresponding to the four treatment and four control fetuses.
