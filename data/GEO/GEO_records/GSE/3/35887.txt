TITLE
Yeast Colony Differentiation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription profile of different layers from S.cerevisiae colonies in day 15 and day 20.

DESIGN
Lower layer (L-cells) vs upper layer (U-cells). 3 biological replicates for day 15 and two replicates for day 20 were used for the total of 4 and 3 technical replicates, respectively. Spotted oligonucleotide microarray slides contain double genome of S. cerevisiae. Dye-swap was performed in replicates
