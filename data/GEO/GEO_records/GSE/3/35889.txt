TITLE
Expression data from adult wild-type and zCdx1b transgenic zebrafish (3 months old)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Cdx2 has been suggested to play an important role in Barrett's esophagus (BE), or intestinal metaplasia (IM) in the esophagus. However, in vivo data have been lacking.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  investigate  whether  transgenic overexpression of zCdx1b, the functional equivalent of mammalian Cdx2 in zebrafish, may lead to IM of squamous epithelium in zebrafish A transgenic zebrafish system was developed by expressing zCdx1b gene under the control of zebrafish keratin 5 promoter (zK5p). zCdx1b expression in the esophageal squamous epithelium of transgenic zebrafish was analyzed by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR. Gene expression in the esophageal squamous epithelium of wild-type and transgenic zebrafish was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and confirmed by in situ hybridization.

DESIGN
The upper digestive tract tissue from 3 adult zebrafish (3 months old) was pooled as one sample. Three zCdx1b transgenic samples were used for microarray, and 2 wild type samples were used for control.
