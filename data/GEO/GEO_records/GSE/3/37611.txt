TITLE
Effect of small molecules on activated astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed an assay to test the neuroprotective properties of compounds using stem cell–derived motor neurons and astrocytes, together with activated microglia as a stress paradigm. Hit compounds were discovered and the transcriptional response on activated astrocytes cells was tested.

DESIGN
Neural stem cell (NSC)-derived astrocytes (AC) were activated with LPS and IFN-γ and treated with hit compound for 4 hr.
