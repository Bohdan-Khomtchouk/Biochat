TITLE
Autoantibodies are abundant in all human sera: a demographic characterization via protein microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human serum samples were probed onto human protein microarrays in order to ascertain the number and diversity of naturally ocurring self-reactive IgG autoantibodies.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 166 human serum samples were probed onto human protein microarrays in order to identify self-reactive IgG autoantibodies and study their number and diversity in variable donor demographics.  Microarray data were analyzed using several statistical programs, including Prospector v5.2, and autoantibodies with a relative fluorescence Z-factor value of greater than or equal to 0.4 were considered significant.
