TITLE
PCGF Homologs and RYBP Define Functionally Distinct PRC1 Family Complexes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The heterogeneous nature of mammalian PRC1 complexes has hindered our understanding of their biological functions. Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic and genomic analysis that uncovered six major groups of PRC1 complexes each containing a distinct PCGF subunit, a RING1A/B ubiquitin ligase, and a unique set of associated polypeptides. These PRC1 complexes differ in their genomic localization and only a small subset co-localize with H3K27me3. Further biochemical dissection revealed that the six PCGFâ€“RING1A/B combinations form multiple complexes through association with RYBP or its homolog YAF2, which prevents the incorporation of other canonical PRC1 subunits such as CBX, PHC and SCM. Although both RYBP/YAF2- and CBX/PHC/SCM-containing complexes compact chromatin, only RYBP stimulates the activity of RING1B toward H2AK119ub1, suggesting a central role in PRC1 function. Knockdown of RYBP in ES cells compromised their ability to form embryoid bodies, likely because of defects in cell proliferation and maintenance of H2AK119ub1 level.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiments of different PRC1 components were performed either on HA-tagged transgenic stable 293T-REx lines or on endogenous subunits using specific antibodies.
