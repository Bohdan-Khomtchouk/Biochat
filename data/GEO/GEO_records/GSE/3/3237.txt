TITLE
Role of antigenic drive in pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to assess the effect that eradication therapy and re-infection have on colonization densities and histopathology of BALB/c mice, 35 mice were divided into four groups (A-D): 12 mice were infected for the duration of the experiment (23 months, primarily infected group B), 8 mice were infected together with group B, but also received a two week triple therapy at 18 months post infection (TT treated group C) and 9 additional mice were infected and treated along with group C and subsequently re-infected one month after the start of triple therapy (re-infected group D). The final group of 6 mice received no treatment or infection (control group A). All mice were sacrificed at 23 months post initial infection; their stomachs were removed and subjected to histopathological and gene expression analysis. The reference for all arrays used in this study consisted of pooled cDNA extracted from stomachs of five age-matched uninfected control animals. Keywords: all pairs
