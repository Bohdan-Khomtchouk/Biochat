TITLE
RNAPolII ChIP to find differences between third instar salivary glands of WT and SuUR

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP was performed to identify regions of gDNA bound by RNA polymerase II in third instar salivary glands of Drosophila WT and SuUR mutants.  This demonstrated that RNAPolII does not localize to regions that are under-replicated in SuUR mutant third instar salivary glands.

DESIGN
Comparison of RNAPolII ChIP from third instar salivary glands relative to control IgG pulldown for two different Drosophila strains
