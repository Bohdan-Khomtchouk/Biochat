SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Gerstein Lab ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). The tracks show enrichment of RNA sequence tags generated by high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) and mapped to the human genome. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from polyadenylated RNA (polyA+) . PCR amplified, adapter ligated cDNA, 150-300nt long, was sequenced on an Illumina GA sequencer. Where designated, cell lines received specific treatments prior to RNA isolation. As indicated, K562 cells were treated with either interferon-a or interferon-g for 30 minutes or 6 hours. These experiments were carried out in conjunction with ChIP-Seq experiments on the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 in order to examine the effects that inducers of a specific transcriptional response might have on gene expression and on transcription factor binding site discovery. K562 cells were treated with a-amanitin in order to examine the effects of RNA polymerase II inhibition on RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription. This track shows expression data generated as confirmation of the SYDH TFBS ( ) tracks currently available on genome-preview. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
