TITLE
Early gene expression differences in inbred mice predict susceptibility to spontaneous pulmonary adenomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined if gene expression profiles differed between healthy (tumor-free) mice of strains that are known to have different pulmonary adenoma susceptibility (severity and frequency).

DESIGN
Three females of 11 week old mice of 9 (129S1/SvlmJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, C57L/J, DBA/2J, KK/HlJ, and MRL/MpJ) strains were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Each strain was compared to all other strains (36 unique comparisons total) to identify the most common differentially expressed probe sets among the population.  The most common probesets were then compared between strain groups (increased vs. decreased spontaneous pulmonary adenoma frequency and severity).
