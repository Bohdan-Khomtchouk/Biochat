TITLE
Caco-2 cell gene expression following co-culture with Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize how symbiotic bacteria affect the lolecular and cellular mechanisms of epithelial homeostasis, human colonic Caco-2 cells were co-culture with Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were hybridized on Affymetrix HG-U133A
