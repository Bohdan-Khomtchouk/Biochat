TITLE
Ribosome profiling of wild-type and loc1- cells in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed ribosome profiling of wild-type and loc1- cells.  We found that approximately 1500 genes exhibit increased translational efficiencies in the absence of Loc1, indicating that Loc1 is required for their translational repression.

DESIGN
Examination of translational efficiencies by comparing ribosome footprints and mRNA abundances in two different cell lines.
