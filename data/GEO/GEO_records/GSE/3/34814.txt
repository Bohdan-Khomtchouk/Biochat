TITLE
mRNA reponse to bleomycin instillation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of C57BL/6 mice challenged by intratracheal bleomycin instillation: mRNA expression profiles were established from lungs following a 14-days PBS or bleomycin administration.

DESIGN
One color -experiment with 1 strain of mice (C57BL/6) following a 14-days PBS or bleomycin administration (n=5), corresponding to a total of 10 samples.
