TITLE
Down-regulation of PAX2 affects ovarian cancer cell growth and migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PAX2 is one of nine PAX genes that regulate tissue development and cellular differentiation in embryos. PAX2 promotes cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, cell lineage specification, migration, and survival. In our previous study, we found that PAX2 is highly expressed in low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, but its expression in clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous cell ovarian carcinomas have not been studied. More importantly, the functional role of PAX2 in ovarian cancer is not known. Downregulation of PAX2 in PAX2-expressing ovarian cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and migration. This growth inhibition is due to the upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene G0S2 and subsequent induction of apoptosis. The PAX2 pathway thus represents a potential therapeutic target for PAX2-expressing ovarian carcinomas.

DESIGN
Knockdown PAX2 expression in these cell lines was achieved by lentiviral shRNAs targeting the PAX2 gene. PAX2 stable knockdown cells were characterized for cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and gene expression profiles.
