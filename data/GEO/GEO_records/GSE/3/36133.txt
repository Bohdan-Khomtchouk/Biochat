TITLE
Expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project is a collaboration between the Broad Institute, the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research and the Genomics Novartis Foundation to conduct a detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer models It consists of a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number, and massively parallel sequencing data from nearly 1,000 human cancer cell lines. All raw and processed data are available through an integrated portal on www.broadinstitute.org/ccle

DESIGN
The final cell line collection spans 36 cancer types. Representation of cell lines for each cancer type was mainly driven by cancer mortality in the United States, as a surrogate of unmet medical need, as well as availability.
