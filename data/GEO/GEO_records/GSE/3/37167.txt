TITLE
ChIP-chip from human liver cancer cells with HIF-2a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor HIF-2a play an important role in the tumor progress, the aim is to explore the target genes of HIF-2a in liver cancer cell line. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of HIF-2a together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that  HIF-2a directly activates many target genes.

DESIGN
Analyze the target genes in a liver cancer cell line MHCC97H
