TITLE
EZH2 mutations can be detected in 23% of PICALM-MLLT10 (CALM-AF10) positive acute leukemias

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interest focuses on genes encoding histone demethylases in hematologic malignancies, such as EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2). EZH2 mutations were recurrently observed in lymphomas and chronic myeloid malignancies, but data in acute leukemias are limited. We investigated 13 PICALM-MLLT10 (=CALM-AF10) rearranged acute leukemia predominantly of T-lineage (7 m/6 f; 6â€“53 years) by deep-sequencing for EZH2mut and identified 3 (23%) EZH2mut carriers: one splice site mutation in exon 14, while two patients had missense mutations in the D1 region of exon 5 which interacts with different DNA methyltransferase genes (but no DNMT3Amut was detected in the 13 PICALM-MLLT10-positive patients). In contrast, no EZH2mut was found in an independent cohort of 12 PICALM-MLLT10-negative T-ALL. Gene expression profiling revealed increased expression of genes with a role for transcription or intracellular transport processes in the PICALM-MLLT10-positive cases. The frequent occurrence of EZH2mut in PICALM-MLLT10-positive malignancies emphasizes a cooperative effect in acute leukemias.

DESIGN
29 patients analyzed with gene expression microarrays.
