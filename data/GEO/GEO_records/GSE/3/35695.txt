TITLE
The role of FOG-1 in GATA-1 transcriptional regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the role of FOG-1 in GATA-1 transcriptional regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation through expression of wild-type GATA-1 and the FOG-binding mutant of GATA-1 (GATA-1^V205G) in G1ME cells.

DESIGN
G1ME cells were derived from Gata1-null mouse ES cells and have both megakaryocyte and erythrocyte differentiation potential upon reconstitution of GATA-1 expression (Stachura 2006).  HA-tagged wild-type or mutant GATA-1 were expressed in G1ME cells grown in TPO via retroviral transductions.  The cells were sorted for GFP positivity 68 hours post-transduction and then were allowed to recover in normal growth medium for 4h.  Total RNA was then isolated using RNeasy kit from Qiagen 72 hours post-transduction.
