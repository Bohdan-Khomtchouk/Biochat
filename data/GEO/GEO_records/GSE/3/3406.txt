TITLE
Expression patterns in stress conditions of 4 closely related yeast species from the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We characterize the genome-wide transcription response of four related yeast species and two strains to equivalent environmental stresses. Keywords: Comparative analysis of gene expression across species.
