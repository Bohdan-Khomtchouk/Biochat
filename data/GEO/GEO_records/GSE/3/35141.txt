TITLE
DCK is frequently inactivated in acquired gemcitabine-resistant human cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the microarray-based expression profiles of the cells to identify genes associated with gemcitabine resistance

DESIGN
Using three set of parental and resistant cell lines, PK-9 and RPK-9, PK-1 and RPK-1, and PK-59 and RPK-59, we studied mRNA transcription levels by microarray analysis to see if there are any of the key molecules for development of acquisition of the GEM resistance.
