TITLE
EWS TC-71 cell lines: IGF-1R resistant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ewing's Sarcoma cell lines were made resistant to different IGF-1R drugs to investigate mechanisms and pathways modulated by the resistance.

DESIGN
EWS TC-71 cell line was exposed to increasing concentration to three different anti-IGF-1R drugs (HAb AVE1642, TKI NVP-AEW541,  HAb CP-751,871, cell lines named respectively as TC/AVE, TC/AEW or TC/CP) for at least six months. Expression profile of resistant cell variants was compared either singularly for each resistance or commonly vs. parental cell line. Two technical replicates for resistant variants and three biological replicated for parental cell were present.
