TITLE
Mating of the stichotrichous ciliate Oxytricha trifallax induces production of a class of 27nt small RNAs derived from the parental macronucleus

ORGANISM
Oxytricha trifallax

SUMMARY
Here we report that soon after mating of Oxytricha trifallax, abundant 27nt small RNAs are produced that are not present prior to mating. We performed next generation sequencing of these 27nt RNAs from various times after mating. Using sequence comparisons between macronuclear and micronuclear versions of genes, we found that this 27nt RNA class derives from the parental macronucleus, not the developing macronucleus. These small RNAs are produced equally from both strands of macronuclear nanochromosomes, but in a highly non-uniform distribution along the length of the nanochromosome, and with a particular depletion in the 30 nt telomere-proximal positions. Unlike the Tetrahymena scanRNAs, the Oxytricha macronuclear-derived 27mers are not modified by 2'O-methylation at their 3' ends.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNAs produced in Oxytricha trifallax during vegetative growth and at various timepoints during the mating process
