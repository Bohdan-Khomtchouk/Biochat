TITLE
Exposure of microaerobic Campylobacter jejuni to 10 micromolar NOC-5

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Two batch cultures of Wild-type C. jejuni NCTC 11168 were grown in 100 ml volumes of Mueller-Hinton broth in 250 ml baffled flasks. Microaerophilic conditions were generated using a MACS-VA500 microaerophilic work station (10 % Oxygen, 10 % Carbon dioxide, 80 % Nitrogen) from Don Whitley Scientific, Ltd which also maintained the growth temperature at 42 ºC. When mid-exponential phase was reached 0.010 mM NOC-5 & NOC-7 was added to one of the cultures. After a 15 minute exposure samples of both treated and untreated cells were harvested into phenol/ethanol to stabilize the RNA and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit (as recommended by the suppliers) prior to use in microarray analysis.
