TITLE
Expression profile of hemin induced erythroid differentiation, over-expressing and knocking-down GATA-1, EKLF and NF-E2 in K562s

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we profiled miRNA gene expression with the Illumina hybridization system in K562 cells induced by hemin and K562 cells with over-expressing or knocking-down GATA-1, EKLF or NF-E2 treatments.

DESIGN
To find differential expression miRNAs, we profiled miRNA gene expression with the Illumina hybridization system in untreated, hemin-treated 48h and 72h K562 cells. To define GATA-1, EKLF or NF-E2 directly targeted miRNA genes, a comprehensive analysis of TF induced miRNA gene expression changes was performed using over-expressing or knocking-down TFs in K562 cells and illumina miRNA profiling Beadchip system.
