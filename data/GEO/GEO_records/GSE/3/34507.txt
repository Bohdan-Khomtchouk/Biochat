TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for oral squamous cell carcinoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of genetic alterations. To identify genes responsible for OSCC development, we performed high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis and genome-wide gene expression profiling on OSCC tumors. These analyses identified " absent in melanoma (AIM2) " and " interferon-inducible gene 16 (IFI16), " mapped to the hematopoietic IFN-inducible nuclear proteins with 200-amino acid repeat (HIN-200) gene cluster in the amplified region of chromosome 1q23, with overexpression in OSCCs. AIM2 and IFI16 are cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA sensors for innate immunity and act as tumor suppressors in several human cancers. Knockdown of AIM2 or IFI16 in OSCC cells resulted in the suppression of cell growth and the induction of apoptosis, accompanied by the downregulation of NF-κB activation. Because all of the OSCC cell lines had impairment of p53 activity, wild-type p53 was introduced in p53-deficient OSCC cells, and as a result, the expression of wild-type p53 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis via suppression of NF-κB activity. Finally, the coexpression of AIM2 and IFI16 significantly enhanced cell growth in p53-deficient cells; in contrast, the expression of AIM2 and/or IFI16 in cells bearing wild-type p53 suppressed cell growth. Moreover, AIM2 and IFI16 synergistically enhanced NF-κB signaling in p53-deficient cells.  Thus, expression of AIM2 and IFI16 may have oncogenic functions in OSCC cells inactivating p53 system.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays was performed for 5 oral leukoplakia samples, 20 oral squamous cell carcinoma samples, and 8 oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.
