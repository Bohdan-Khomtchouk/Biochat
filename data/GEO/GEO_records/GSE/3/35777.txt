TITLE
A molecular mechanism for compartmentalization and silencing of chromatin domains at the nuclear lamina [Tiling Array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These are the tiling array data for the experiments describing LADs on murine chromosomes 5, 12, and 15 by Dam-ID, as determined by LMNB and EMD Dam tagging and detection experiments Supplemental Bed file contains GADA algorithm calls for genomic regions of chromosomes 5, 12 and 15 (-1= no lad, high confidence, 0=indeterminate, 1=LAD, high confidence)

DESIGN
2 experimental samples, both used the same 2 control CEL files (Dam_0519.CEL and Dam_0612.CEL provided at the foot of the Series record below). Also provided below are LMNA .CEL files. They were not processed as a comparison like for EMD and LMNB Samples in the scope of this study, but may be processed by users using the Tiling Array Software from Affy.
