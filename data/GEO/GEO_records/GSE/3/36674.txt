TITLE
Expression data for mouse hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Strain differences in gene expression in the hypothalamus of BXD recombinant inbred mice We used microarrays to evaluate genetic and sex-specific differences in gene expression in the hypothalamus

DESIGN
Hypothalamus was dissected from adult male and female mice and process for expression analysis
