SUMMARY
Profiling project of CRC patient material collected in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We focused on a set of 90 AJCC stage II patients that underwent intentionally curative surgery in the years 1997-2006 (AMC-AJCCII-90). Extensive medical records are kept from these patients and long-term clinical follow-up is available for the large majority. Both paraffin-embedded as well as fresh frozen tissue is available from all these patients for analysis.

DESIGN
Primary tumor resections from 90 AJCC stage II CRC patients, and matching normal colon tissue from 6 of these patients, are included in the study.
