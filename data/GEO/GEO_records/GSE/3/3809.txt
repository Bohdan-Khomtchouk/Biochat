TITLE
Gene expression profiling of livers from cafestol-fed APOE3Leiden mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unfiltered coffee markedly increases serum lipid levels in humans and mice. The responsible compounds are the fat-soluble diterpenes cafestol and kahweol. Cafestol is responsible for more than 80% of the effect on serum lipids and is the most potent cholesterol-elevating compound known in the human diet. Aim of these microarray studies was to identify novel genes and regulatory pathways determining the cholesterol raising effect of cafestol by genome-wide expression studies.
