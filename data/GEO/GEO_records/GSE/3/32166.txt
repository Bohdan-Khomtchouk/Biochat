TITLE
tnni2 Binding Genome Seqences

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq analysis of the potential accumulated binding sites on whole genome by wild-type tnni2 and tnni2 del175k mutant

DESIGN
The primary osteoblasts from Tnni2del175k/175k mice and wild-type littermates (n=3) were cultured for ChIP-Seq. ChIP and construct libraries were performed using the antibody against tnni2 (Santa Cluz Biotechnology) and conducted as previously described above. Illumina HiSeq 2000 is used for sequencing. Raw reads were aligned with the mouse reference 8 using Bowtie software and viewed with the IGV browser.
