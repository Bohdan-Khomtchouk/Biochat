TITLE
Analysis of differential gene expression during functional beta-cell maturation in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression is tested in FACS-sorted beta-cells from PDX1-GFP transgenic mice at different ages (E18.5, P1, P10 and adult)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from FACS-sorted beta-cells from PDX1-GFP transgenic mice at different ages (E18.5, P1, P10 and adult)
