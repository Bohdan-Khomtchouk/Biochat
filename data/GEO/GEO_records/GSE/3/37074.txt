TITLE
DNaseI Hypersensitivity by Digital DNaseI from ENCODE/University of Washington

ORGANISM
Mouse ENCODE

SUMMARY
This track is produced as part of the mouse ENCODE Project. This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide in mouse tissues and cell lines using the Digital DNaseI methodology (see below), and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel elements. For each experiment (tissue/cell type) this track shows DNaseI sensitivity as a continuous function using sequencing tag density (Signal), and discrete loci of DNaseI sensitive zones (HotSpots) and hypersensitive sites (Peaks).
