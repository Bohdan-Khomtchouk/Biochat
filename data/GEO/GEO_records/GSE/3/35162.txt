TITLE
FOSL1 as a candidate target gene for 11q12 rearrangements in desmoplastic fibroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of desmoplastic fibroblastoma (DF) and histologically similar tumors. FOSL1 is identified as a candidate target gene for the 11q12 rearrangments in DF.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 frozen desmoplastic fibroblastoma (DF) biopsies and hybridized onto Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. RNA from 6 myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), 6 desmoid fibromatosis (DFM), 5 solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and 17 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) were used as controls. The control dataset has been previously published and is available in the GEO database under Series accession GSE24369. The complete dataset representing: (1) the 3 desmoplastic fibroblastoma Samples and (2) the 34 control Samples from Series GSE24369 (re-processed using RMA), is linked below as a supplementary file.
