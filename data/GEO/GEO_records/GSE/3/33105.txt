TITLE
Ketogulonicigenium vulgare cells: Acid-stressed vs. Control

ORGANISM
Ketogulonicigenium vulgare WSH-001

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of K. vulgare cells, co-cultured with Bacillus megaterium, comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with pH 4.0 for 2 h. Differentially expressed genes in acid-stressed cells were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the mechanisms of K. vulgare in response to acid stress on global gene expression.
