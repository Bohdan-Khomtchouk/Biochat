TITLE
Expression data from human vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to minimally oxidized (mox) LDL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis (AT) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells, lipoproteins and fibrous tissue in the walls of arteries. AT is the primary cause of heart attacks and stroke and the leading cause of death in westernized countries. To date, the pathogenesis of AT is not well-defined. Studies have shown that the dedifferentiation of contractile and quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) to the proliferative, migratory and synthetic phenotype in the intima is pivotal for the onset and progression of AT. To further delineate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AT, we have analyzed the early molecular pathways and networks of SMC phenotype transformation as induced by the presence of minimally-oxidized LDL (moxLDL).

DESIGN
3 pooled samples were analyzed, one untreated control, one 3h after treatment, one 21h after treatment, no replicates
