TITLE
Gene expression profiles for onset and progression of Cyclosporin A-induced cholestasis in C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mechanism-based toxicogenomics (tgx) is used as a tool to identify markers reflective of the onset and progression of cholestasis in C57BL/6 mice using Cyclosporin A (CsA) as a model compound. Critical doses for tgx analysis were derived from a dose range finding study in which increase of serum cholesterol, total bile acids, and total bilirubin as well as induction of hepatocyte vacuolization 25 days upon repeated CsA administration through oral gavage were considered as critical effects. For tgx analysis to find early markers, livers of mice repeatedly treated with 3 mg/kg BW, 8.9 mg/kg BW, and 26.7 mg/kg BW for one, four, and eleven days were collected.
