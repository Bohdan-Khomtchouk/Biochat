TITLE
Transcription profiling of Basmati T-DNA insertional mutant lines

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to look for the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the same T-DNA cassette in three mutants of Basmati 370 with different phenotypes. The comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted individually and collectively for all three mutants.
