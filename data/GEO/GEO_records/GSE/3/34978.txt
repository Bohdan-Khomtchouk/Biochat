TITLE
Formaldehyde and Epigenetic Alterations: MicroRNA Changes in the Nasal Epithelium of Nonhuman Primates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We set out to test the hypothesis that formaldehyde inhalation exposure significantly alters miRNA expression profiles within the nasal epithelium of nonhuman primates. Here, cynomolgus macaques were exposed to 0, 2, and 6 ppm formaldehyde for 6 hours/day across two consecutive days. RNA was extracted from the nasal maxilloturbinate region, a direct target of formaldehyde inhalation exposure. Genome-wide miRNA expression levels were assessed using microarrays.
