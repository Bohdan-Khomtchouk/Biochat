TITLE
Early response of gene expression in the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) during the development of soybean meal induced enteritis

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
In the present study a 44k oligonucleotide salmonid microarray, qPCR and histology were used to investigate transcriptomic responses in the distal intestine during the first week of oral exposure to soybean meal in order to gain insight into early molecular response mechanisms. Intestinal tissue samples were taken on day one, two, three, five and seven after introduction of a soybean-containing diet and compared to a control group fed fishmeal.

DESIGN
Day 1, day 2, day 3, day 5 and day 7 (n=10 per condition) post-soybean meal feeding Atlantic salmon hybridized to common reference and compared against control (day 0 of SBM feeding). Tissue = distal intestine.
