TITLE
Expression data from patient iPSC and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of heart failure and transplantation worldwide. We used iPSCs to model this disease and compared gene expression change before and after gene therapy of cardiomyocytes derived from DCM-specific iPSCs. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of patient specific iPSCs, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and its response to gene therapy.

DESIGN
Skin fibroblasts and iPSCs derived from a family exhibiting familial dilated cardiomyopathy and H7 human ESCs were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.Global gene expression pattern were compared and analyzed. Cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs generated from this DCM family were treated with or without adenoriral Serca2a and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Global gene expression pattern were compared and analyzed.
