TITLE
Expression analysis of 52 glioma clinical samples (36 CIMP+ and 16 CIMP-) and 6 cell line samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumor pathogenicity but the molecular cause of G-CIMP is a fundamental question that is unresolved.  Here, we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), directly causes the G-CIMP in gliomas by remodeling the methylome.

DESIGN
In this study 52 glioma clinic samples (36 CIMP+ and 16 CIMP-) were analyzed. Parental IDH1 wild-type and IDH1 mutant cells were passaged 40 and passage 40 were cell line was sent for expression array.
