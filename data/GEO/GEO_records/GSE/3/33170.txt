TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in rat sarcomas and masenchymal stem cells (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the altered patways among sarcomas and MSCs, gene expression profiles were comared among rat osteosarcoma and malignant histiocytoma (MFH) to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from syngeneic origin. Several altered pathways have identified including down-regulation of Wnt, Cell adhesion, ECM interaction and up-regulation of Hedgehog, cell cycling pathways in rat sarcomas compared to MSCs.

DESIGN
Gene expression array analysis was perfromed for the samples of rat osteosarcoma COS1NR and malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH1NR cell lines, bothe established from chemically induced tumors in F344 rats by 4-HAQO, and rat mesenchymal stem cells freshly isolated from femur bone marrow of F344 rats.
