TITLE
Expression data from dietary restricted budding yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Dietary restriction (also known as caloric/calorie restriction; CR) extends the lifespan of species from all three eukaryotic kingdoms. The restriction of the diet interferes directly with the aging process by triggering a tightly controlled genetic program where specific sets of genes are either upregulated downreguled. We used microarray-technology to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the anti-aging effect of dietary restriction and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes.
