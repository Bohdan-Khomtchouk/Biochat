TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells after treatment with vorinostat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using high-density DNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene-expression profile of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-540 after tretament with the histone deactelyse inhibitor vorinostat. Kewitz et al., submitted

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-540 and hybridized with Affymetrix HG_U133A microarrays.
