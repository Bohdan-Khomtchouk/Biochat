TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of ligand-dependent progesterone receptor chromatin interactions in human breast cell lines using PR ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of progesterone are pleiotropic, resulting in diverse outcomes in a range of target tissues. Progesterone signalling is mediated through the nuclear progesterone receptor (PR) and to identify whether the cell specificity of the PR transcriptome arises from distinct patterns of genomic interaction of PR, we have mapped the genomic binding sites for PR in breast cancer cells and minimally transformed breast cells. PR binding was correlated with transcriptional outcome in both cell lines.

DESIGN
Three replicate PR ChIP samples and two replicate input DNA control samples from T-47D breast cancer cells and two replicate PR ChIP samples and two replicate input DNA control samples from AB32 transformed normal breast cells.
