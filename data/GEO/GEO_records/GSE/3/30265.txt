TITLE
Microdissection vs. no microdissection: Transcriptome bias induced by protocols used in microdissection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp07_regeneome_microdissectionbias - microdissection vs no microdissection - Transcriptome bias induce by protocols used in microdissection - To compare RNA from flowers and RNA from microdissected flowers to know bias induce by microdissection (dissection from all tissues were collected to have a representation of entire flower)

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
