TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the signaling networks that are dysregulated in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, gene expression data were obtained from, and compared between, the ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant derivative, A2780cis.
