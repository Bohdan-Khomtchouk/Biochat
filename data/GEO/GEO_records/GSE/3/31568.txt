TITLE
The human Whole miRNOme project version 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes peripheral blood profiles of controls and patients of 14 different diseases, all collected, measured, and analyzed using exactly the same SoP. Since miRNAs are known to be valuable diagnostic markers we asked whether respective patterns of patients can be detected in peripheral blood samples rather than in biopsies. The project aimed at an impoved understanding of complex profiles rather than single markers. Thus, a high-throughput technique was necessary, profiling all known miRNAs integratively and combining different diseases to achieve a high degree of specificity.
