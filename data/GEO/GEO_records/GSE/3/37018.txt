TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of 32Dclone3 cells overexpressing miR-125b

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the mechanisms of blockage of myeloid differentiation and apoptosis and induction of proliferation by miR-125b, we preceded to identify miR-125b target genes involved in these pathways. We analyzed the total cellular gene expression pattern by RNA-sequencing of the parental 32Dclone3 myeloid cell line and that ectopically expressing miR-125b. We generated four cDNA libraries corresponding to duplicates of miR-125b and control cells.

DESIGN
Compare the gene expression level in vector transduced 32Dclone3 cells with that in miR-125b transduced 32Dclone3 cells.Â
