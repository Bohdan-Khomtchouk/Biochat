TITLE
Therapeutic effect of γ-secretase inhibition in KrasG12V-driven non-small cell lung carcinoma through derepression of DUSP1 phosphatase and inhibition of ERK

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the role of the Notch pathway in the generation and maintenance of KrasG12V-driven non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrate by genetic means that γ-secretase and Rbpj activities are both essential in the formation of NSCLCs. Interestingly, pharmacologic treatment of mice carrying endogenous NSCLCs with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks cancer growth and induces partial regression. Treated cancers show a reduction in Hes1 levels, reduced phosphorylated Erk, decreased proliferation and higher apoptosis. We demonstrate that HES1 directly binds and represses the promoter of DUSP1, a dual phosphatase with activity against phospho-ERK, and this repression is relieved by GSI treatment both in mouse and human NSCLCs. Our data provide proof for the in vivo therapeutic potential of γ-secretase inhibitors in primary NSCLCs and provide a mechanistic explanation for its therapeutical effect.

DESIGN
We have included 6 samples. 3 with vehicle and 3 with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT and we compare both groups.
