TITLE
The transcriptional profile of Langhans-like multinucleated giant macrophages: Collapse of the inflammatory and immune responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes/macrophages have the ability to fuse in multinucleated giant cells (MGCs). Except for osteoclasts that resorb bones on large surfaces, the function of other macrophage-derived MGCs, which appear under pathological situations associated with granulomatous inflammation such as tuberculosis, is not understood. Here we deciphered functions and gene expression profiles of MGCs obtained after stimulation of human monocytes with IFN-gÂ and concanavalin A. First, we show that the competence of MGCs in phagocytosis and O2- production was similar to those of monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) and that MGCs exhibited a M1 polarization. Second, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of MGCs using gene categories and the building of gene networks. The signature of MGCs was markedly distinct from that of resting or stimulated MDMs. It consisted of the up-regulation of genes involved in adhesion and cytoskeleton organization while genes associated with immune response were down-regulated. Hence,  MGC formation was associated with a profound and original modulation of gene expression repertoire suggesting that macrophage immune were not prominent in MGC. This expression gene repertoire may be instrumental to understand the specific function of this giant macrophages in human pathologies

DESIGN
9 samples of monocytes-derived macrophages and 3 samples of mulitnucleated giant cells. 3 samples of MDM treated with concanavalin A, 3 samples of MDM treated with IFN-g, and 3 control MDM.
