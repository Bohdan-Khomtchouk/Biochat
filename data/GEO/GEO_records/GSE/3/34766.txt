TITLE
Suppression of Progenitor Differentiation Requires the Long Non-Coding RNA ANCR [lincRNA 391k Tiling Array V2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse processes, yet a potential role for lncRNAs in maintaining the undifferentiated state in somatic tissue progenitor cells remains uncharacterized. We used transcriptome sequencing and tiling arrays to compare lncRNA expression in epidermal progenitor populations versus differentiating cells. We identified ANCR (anti differentiation ncRNA) as an 855 bp lncRNA down-regulated during differentiation. Depleting ANCR in progenitor-containing populations, without any other stimuli, led to rapid differentiation gene induction. In epidermis, ANCR loss abolished the normal exclusion of differentiation from the progenitor-containing compartment. The ANCR lncRNA is thus required to enforce the undifferentiated cell state within epidermis.

DESIGN
Custom tiling arrays designed to assay the intergenic space corresponding to regions of H3K4me3-H3K36me3 domains (Khalil et al., 2009) were used to assay changes in RNA expression of putative lncRNAs. RNA from progenitor populations and terminally differentiated populations of human keratinocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts were hybridized to these arrays and differential expression was assessed.
