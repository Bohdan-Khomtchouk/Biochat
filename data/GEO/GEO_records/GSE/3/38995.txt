TITLE
Juvenile postnatally overfed mice heart microarray anaylsis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice underwent early postnatal overfeeding by litter size reduction (3 pups/dam, instead of 10 pups/dam, in postatally normally fed mice). These overfeeding conditions lead to early and permanent modifications of body weight and to an increase in body fat mass in the adulthood. When these postnatally overfed mice become adult, they develop several cardio-metabolic alterations (mild hypertension, impairment of heart contractility, remodeling, fibrosis, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia) but also increases in markers of cardiac and plasma oxidative stress. Moreover, we observed a higher sensitivity of the heart to injuries induced by ischemia reperfusion, such as an increase in necrosis. We now aim to establish if these late-coming modifications might be induced in a very early state of postnatal development, such as a postnatal programming situation. To achieve this objective, we are now comparing heart gene expression between 24 days old postnatally overfed and normally fed mice.

DESIGN
