TITLE
Characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant deficient in the GAPC gene.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of this enzyme in different plant tissues, we characterized a mutant from Arabidopsis thaliana having an insertion at the GAPC gene locus. The homozygous mutant was determined to be null respect to GAPC, as it exhibited complete absence of both expression of GAPC mRNA and enzyme activity. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the insertion mutant plant shows altered expression of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Keywords: 2 channel experiment in triplicate including a dye swap comparison
