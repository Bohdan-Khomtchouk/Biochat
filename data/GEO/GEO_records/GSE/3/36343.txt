TITLE
mRNA degradation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis during cold and hypoxic stress

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcription was arrested using 50 ug/ul of rifampin leaving RNA degradation as the sole vector responsible for mRNA abundance at 20C (cold) or in 0.2%O2 (hypoxia). mRNA half-lives were calculated from the decay of signal intensity from T0.

DESIGN
Three replicates were sampled after 0, 1, 2, and 5 hours of mRNA decay in both cold and hypoxia for a total of 24 arrays.
