TITLE
Expression data from iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated iPSCs from imatinib-sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient samples. We used microarrays tc ompare the gene expression pattern among CML-iPSCs and normal cord blood (CB) iPSCs.

DESIGN
Two CML derived iPS cells and one CB derived iPS cells were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
