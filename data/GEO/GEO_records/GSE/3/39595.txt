TITLE
Role of Dec1 transcription factor in naive CD4+ T cell activation transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene transcription effect of Dec1 underlying T cells activation during the first 24 hours after stimulation.

DESIGN
CD4+CD62LhiCD25- T cells were sorted and cultured with different stimulatory conditions (anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) for 24 hours. 4 replicates for each condition were analyzed.
