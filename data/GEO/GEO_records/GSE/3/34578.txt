TITLE
Dietary soyasaponin supplementation to pea protein concentrate reveals nutrigenomic interactions underlying enteropathy in Atlantic salmon

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Atlantic salmon was fed with diets based on five plant protein sources combined with soyabean saponins. Diets with corn gluten, sunflower, rapeseed and horsebean produced minor effects while combination of saponins with pea protein concentrate caused enteritis and major transcriptome changes in the distal intestine.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were perfromed in distant intestine. Individual samples from fish that received saponing were hybridized to pools from salmon fed with the same feeds without saponins.
