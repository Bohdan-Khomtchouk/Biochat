TITLE
KGF effects on cutaneous SCC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, fibroblast growth factor-7) is a fibroblast-derived mitogen, which stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells. The expression of KGF by dermal fibroblasts is induced following injury and it promotes wound repair. However, the role of KGF in cutaneous carcinogenesis and cancer progression is not known. We have examined the role of KGF in progression of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. Gene expression profiling was performed of three cutaneous SCC cell lines treated with KGF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, comparable untreated cells and of normal unterated epidermal keratinocytes to explore KGF-responce in SCC cells.

DESIGN
Three cutanous SCC cell lines (established from two primary and one metastatic tumors) were cultured to 70% confluency, serum starved (0% FCS) for 16 h and treated with rKGF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Comparable cell cultures were left untreated with rKGF. Normal epidermal keratinocytes from two individuals were cultured in specified keratinocyte culture medium to 70% confluency. All cell cultures were processed for RNA extraction and Affymetrix whole transcript microarray gene expression analysis. Thus, the samples included three untreated cutaeous SCC cell lines (n=3), the same three cell lines treated with rKGF (n=3) and untreated epidermal keratinocytes from two  individuals (n=2). Normal keratinocytes served as reference samples to untreated skin SCC cells.
