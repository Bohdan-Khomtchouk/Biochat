TITLE
Expresion profile of MEF reprogrammed with Yamanaka´s factor together with FoxA2 and Gata4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a pilot experiment to reprogramme MEF into endoderm, we infected MEF with the Yamanaka´s factors (O: Oct4, K: Klf4, S: Sox2, M:Myc), FoxA2 (F) and Gata4 (G). Global gene expression of isolated clones was performed.

DESIGN
After infection of MEF with the Yamanaka´s factor (OKS/M), FoxA2 and Gata4, the cells were grown until colonies could be isolated and expanded independently. Global gene expression of several clones was performed.
