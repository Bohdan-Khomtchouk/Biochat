TITLE
Gene expression in mouse pre-B cells transduced with Ikaros.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ikaros family DNA binding proteins are critical regulators of B cell development. To identify Ikaros-regulated genes in pre-B cells we performed gene expression studies at enhanced temporal resolution.

DESIGN
We used retroviral gene transfer to express Ikaros proteins in the pre-B cell line B3. Total RNA from 2 biological replicates of B3 cells transduced with wild type Ikaros (HA-Ikaros-IRES-GFP) and DNA binding-deficient Ikaros mutant 159A (HA-159A Ikaros-IRES-GFP) was isolated 48h after infection. To increase the temporal resolution of Ikaros-regulated gene expression we transduced B3 cells with inducible Ikaros (HA-Ikaros-ERt2-IRES-GFP) and isolated  total RNA from 3 biological replicates after 2 h and 6 h of exposure to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Vector transduced B3 cells (ERt2-IRES-GFP)  treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen were used as controls.
