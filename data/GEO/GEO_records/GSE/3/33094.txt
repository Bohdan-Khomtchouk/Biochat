TITLE
Kinetics of progressive pulmonary cavitary TB disease in rabbits

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Every year, tuberculosis kills nearly 1.8 million people through out the world.  Though  outcome of M. tuberculosis infection into active disease is determined by the host and bacterial factors, a strong host immune response controls the growth of the bacilli effectively.  However, in a host with suboptimal immune response, the bacilli grows and mounts active disease.  Activation of immune response following M. tuberculosis infection affects the expression of many host genes that are involved in the production of immune system molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, surface receptors and transcriptional regulators that manifest in the change of subsequent cellular events, including activation, maturation, chemotaxis and proliferation of effector cells. However, the specific nature of the host-pathogen interactions and the outcome of Mtb infection are not fully understood.   In this study, we have analysed the systematic changes in the global host gene expression profile in the lungs of Mtb infected rabbits at various stages of infection.  Mtb infected rabbit lung tissues were isolated at T=0,2, 4 and 16 weeks post-infection.  Lung bacterial load, histologic changes and host and bacterial gene expression were determined  for each timepoint and compared . Our data suggests a strong correlation between the significant changes in the global transcriptome of infected rabbits and the progression of Mtb infection into a chronic, cavitary TB disease. The microarray experiments involves comparison of: 1) Changes in rabbit gene expression between Mtb-HN878 infected and uninfected animals at 2,4 and 16 weeks post infection.

DESIGN
New Zealand White rabbits were infected with Mtb HN878 at 3.2log10 (on day 0).   Lung tissue from Mtb-infected rabbits were isolated at Day0, 2, 4 and 16 weeks post infection and used for total RNA extraction.
