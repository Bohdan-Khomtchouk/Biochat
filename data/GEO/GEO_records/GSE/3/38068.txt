TITLE
Investigation into the Physiologies of Aeromonas veronii in vitro and Inside the Digestive-Tract of the Medicinal Leech using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Aeromonas veronii

SUMMARY
In this study we used Illumina RNA-seq to identify genes expressed by A. veronii in mid-log phase growth in a rich medium and within the digestive tract of the medicinal leech. Our results shed light on the physiology of A. veronii during colonization of the leech gut.

DESIGN
A comparison of Illumina RNA-seq of A. veronii in vivo versus in vitro.
