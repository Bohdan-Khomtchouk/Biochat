TITLE
Dual Role of FoxA1 in Androgen Receptor Binding to Chromatin, Androgen Signaling and Prostate Cancer [Expression Array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the dual role of FoxA1 in androgen receptor recruitment to the chromatin of androgen responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP-1F5 using ChIP-sequencing. Depletion of FoxA1 reprograms both androgen and glucocorticoid receptor recruitment and subsequent gene expression. The ChIP-seq has been performed using AR, FoxA1, GR, H3K4me2 antibodies. We have also mapped the DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHS) using deep sequencing.

DESIGN
LNCaP-1F5 cells were depleted of FoxA1 using siRNAs. Parental cells and FoxA1 depleted cells (siFoxA1) were treated with vehicle or 100 nM DHT or (100 nM DEX) for 24 hours followed by RNA isolation and hybridization to Illumina arrays. All the experiments have been performed in biological duplicates. Parental cells treated with DHT (or DEX) were analyzed for differentially expressed genes compared to vehicle treated parental cells. Similarly siFoxA1 cells treated with DHT (or DEX) were analyzed for differentially expressed genes compared to vehicle treated siFoxA1 cells.
