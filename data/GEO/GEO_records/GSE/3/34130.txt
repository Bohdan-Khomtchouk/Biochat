TITLE
Ecotype specific nitrogen responses in the Arabidopsis root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Root branching in response to changes in nitrogen status in the soil, is a dramatic example of the plantâ€™s remarkable developmental plasticity.  In recent work we investigated the genetic architecture of developmental plasticity, combining phenoclustering and genome-wide association studies in 96 Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes with expression profiling in 7 ecotypes, to characterise natural variation in root architectural plasticity at the phenotypic, genetic, and transcriptional levels. This series contains the microarray expression data for 7 ecotypes that represent a range of root branching strategies. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression involved in the plants response to nitrogen in the root and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in the seven different Arabidopsis ecotypes during this process.

DESIGN
The whole experiment was carried out in triplicate with 42 chips in total (14 experiments).  The nitrogen response in seven Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype (Col0, Kas2, NFA8, SQ8, TAMM27, Ts5, Var2-1) whole roots was assayed using Affymetrix microarrays.  Seedlings were grown hydroponically in low nitrogen for 12 days, then 5mM KNO3 was used as a nitrogen treatment for 2 hours with 5mM KCl used as a control treatment for the same length of time.  At the end of the treatment time roots were harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction.
