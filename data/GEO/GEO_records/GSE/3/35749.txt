TITLE
sRSM1 synthetic decoy vs. scrambled transfections in MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MDA-MB-231 comparing the regulatory consequences of transfecting synthetic decoys carring sRSM1 motifs versus synthetic scrambled oligos

DESIGN
Two decoy/scrambled sets, each with two biological replicates
