TITLE
MicroRNA signature of young and replicative senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs regulate various cellular processes. While several genes associated with replicative senescence have been described in endothelial cells, miRNAs that regulate these genes remain largely unknown. The present study was designed to identify miRNAs associated with replicative senescence and their target genes in HUVECs. We have employed Agilent Human MicroRNAs microarray platform  to evaluate the expressions of 866 human miRNAs and 89 human viral miRNAs, based on Sanger miRNA database release 12.0

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles were established for young and replicative senescent HUVECs
