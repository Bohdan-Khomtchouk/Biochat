TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila third instar larvae eye imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The kinase nmo is required for proper ommatidial rotation in the developing Drosophila compound eye. It has been suggested to regulate gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors. We used microarray analysis to identify genes which expression is regulated by nmo during ommatidial rotation.

DESIGN
armGFP (used as wild type control) and armGFP, nmoP1 mutant eye discs were dissected for RNA extraction and hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays.
