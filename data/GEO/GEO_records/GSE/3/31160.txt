TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of three different types of mouse motor neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression differences in three types of mouse motor neurons: (1) those harvested from E13.5 mouse embryos; (2) those derived from embryonic stem cells by directed differentiation; and (3) those made from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by transcription factor reprogramming.

DESIGN
Hb9::GFP+ mouse motor neurons were obtained by three methods [(1) dissection of Hb9::GFP-transgenic E13.5 mouse embryo spinal cord; (2) directed differentiation of an Hb9::GFP-transgenic mouse embryonic stem cell line, V6.5; (3) reprogramming of Hb9::GFP-transgenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts by overexpression of 10 transcription factors]. Each type of motor neuron was purified by FACS and harvested in Trizol. Total RNA was purified and prepared for hybridization onto Illumina MouseRef-8.
