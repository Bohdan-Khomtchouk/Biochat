TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of ypeIR mutation in Yersinia pestis at  37°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
The etiologic agent of bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, senses cell density-dependent chemical signals to synchronize transcription between cells of the population in a process named quorum sensing. Though the closely related enteric pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis uses quorum sensing system to regulate motility, the role of YpeIR quorum sensing in Y. pestis has been unclear. YpeIR is one of the AHL quorum sensing system in Y. pestis. In this study we performed transcriptional profiling experiments to identify Y. pestis YpeIR quorum sensing regulated functions at 37°C.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from Y. pestis CO92 Δpgm ΔypeIR cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from control Y. pestis CO92 R88 cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. For three arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 555 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 647 dye; the dyes were reversed for the other three arrays to account for any dye bias.
