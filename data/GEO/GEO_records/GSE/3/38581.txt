TITLE
Gene expression signatures in miR-29c overexpressed gastric cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explain the mechanism that miR-29c affects the cell proliferation, we attempted to identify the miR-29c target genes in gastric carcinoma. The expression profiles in MKN45, MKN7 and MKN74 cells transfected with miR-29c oligo or Negative control oligo were obtained from microarray analysis. Then, the genes differentially expressed (Fold change > = 2.0) in miR-29c-transfected cells compared with negative control-transfected ones were identified in each cell lines, respectively. The differentially expressed genes shared among 3 cell lines were identified as the candidates for miR-29c targets.

DESIGN
Human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN45, MKN74 and MKN7 were transfected with miR-29c oligo or negative control oligo (n=2) (Ambion). At 24h after, total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed. The genes with common expression changes among three cell lines miR-29c-transfected were identified as the candidates for miR-29c targets.
