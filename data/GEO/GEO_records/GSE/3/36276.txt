TITLE
Microarray development for the Grooved carpet shell clam, Ruditapes decussatus: Functional approach to host parasite interaction

ORGANISM
Ruditapes decussatus

SUMMARY
An R.decussatus microarray platform was developed to to profile gene expression in R. decussatus heavy infected by Perkinsus olseni

DESIGN
A comparative analysis of gene expression was conducted between Grooved carpet shell clam R. decussatus individuals for non infected and infected by Perkinsus olseni clam gills. Gene expression profiling was performed using an R.decussatus oligo-DNA microarray of 43,758 probes based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
