TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) digestive gland after exposure to different concentrations of ibuprofen.

ORGANISM
Ruditapes philippinarum

SUMMARY
A Ruditapes philippinarum microarray platform was developed to identify digestive gland gene expression profiles in response to 100 µg /l and 1000 µg/l ibuprofen exposure.

DESIGN
A comparative analysis of gene expression was conducted in Manila clam R.philippinarum exposed to ibuprofen.Clams were exposed for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days to 0, 100 and 1000 µg IBU/l, and digestive gland gene expression were measured. Gene expression profiling was performed using an Manila clam-specific oligo-DNA microarray of 14,156 probes based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
