TITLE
Methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) microarray analysis of human gastric mucosa and cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation is implicated in the epigenetic field defect seen in gastric cancer (GC). Our aim in this study was to identify predictive biomarkers by screening for DNA methylation in noncancerous background gastric mucosa from GC patients.

DESIGN
A total of 46 endoscopically obtained human gastric mucosa, 10 gastric cancer and 5 cell lines were analyzed using MCA microarray. Aberrant DNA methylation was compared with clinicopathological features. Healthy individuals were divided into two groups based on the types of chronic gastritis; A: antrum-predominant gastritis P or C: pangastritis or corpus-predominant gastritis
