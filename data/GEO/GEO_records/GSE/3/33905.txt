TITLE
Identification of polyA sites in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
The 3' ends of most Drosophila melanogaster genes are poorly annotated or are determined by only a single EST or cDNA clone.  To enhance the annotation of poly(A) site use in Drosophila, we performed deep sequencing on RNA isolated from 29 dissected tissues using an approach designed to enrich for poly(A) spanning reads.  From these experiments, we identified 1.4 million poly(A) spanning reads leading to the identification of many new poly(A) sites and the identification of many tissue-specific poly(A) sites.
