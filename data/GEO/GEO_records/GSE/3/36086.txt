TITLE
Expression profile of Arabidopsis DEFLs in pistils and developing siliques

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of the project is to determine the expression profile of Arabidopsis DEFL during sexual reproduction, in particular seed development. To this aim, we generated a customised Affymetrics array that was hybridized with labeled cDNA synthetised from total RNA.

DESIGN
Plant were grown in a control environment chamber and were pollinated manually to precisely generate different stages of seed development. Samples were collected in tripicates.
