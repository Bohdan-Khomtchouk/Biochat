TITLE
Gene expression microarray data by Moutan Cortex Radicis (MCR) in the LPS-stimulated human gingival fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Moutan Cortex Radicis (MCR) has been used as an analgesic, sedative and anti-inflammatory agent. This study investigated the changes in gene expression by MCR treatment when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and the gene expression changes by the MCR when challenged with LPS using a microarray chip.

DESIGN
Human gingival fibroblast were divided into three experimental groups; 1, C: Control, 2, LPS: LPS-treatment only, 3, MCR40: LPS- and MCR40-treatments. Total RNA was isolated from each experimental fibroblast (3 experimental group Ã— 1 sample of each experimental group = total 3 samples).
