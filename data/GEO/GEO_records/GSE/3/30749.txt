TITLE
CGH analysis of haploid ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA samples of haploid ES cells and control DNA were compared to genomic DNA of the C57B/6 inbred mouse strain on a NimbleGen Mouse CGH 3x720K Whole-Genome Tiling Array (Build MM9), (GPL10989) DNA samples of haploid ES cells and control DNA were compared to genomic DNA of the 129/Sv inbred mouse strain on a NimbleGen Mouse CGH 3x720K Whole-Genome Tiling Array (Build MM9), (GPL10989)

DESIGN
this analysis was performed to analyse copy number variations in haploid mouse ES cells from different genetic backgrounds. Male C57/B6 DNA was used as control. To identify CNVs based on the different genetic background control experiments comparing DNA from the inbred CBA and a mixed transgeneic mouse strain were performed. this analysis was performed to analyse copy number variations in haploid mouse ES cells from different genetic backgrounds. Male 129/Sv kidney DNA was used as reference.
