TITLE
Aberrant expressed genes in AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common and deadly forms of hematopoietic malignancies. We hypothesized that microarray studies could identify aberrantly expressed genes selectively expressed in AML blasts, believing that these genes may be potential therapeutic targets for adoptive T-cell strategies

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profiles between leukemic blasts from 30 AML patients (this series and GSE9476) and prepublished samples of normal hematopoietic cells from healthy donors (N=17, GSE9476) and testis samples (N=2, GSE1133).
