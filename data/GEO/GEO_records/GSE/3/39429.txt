TITLE
Rice global gene expression profile in response to plant hormones

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A time course gene expression profiling of rice treated with various plant hormones (abscisic acid, gibberelin, auxin, brassinosteroid, cytokinin and jasmonic acid)  was performed to obtain an overall signature of the rice transcriptome in response to each phytohormone.
