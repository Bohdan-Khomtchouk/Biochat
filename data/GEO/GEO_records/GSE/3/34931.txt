TITLE
Antibody profiling of smallpox vaccinees with/without a 'take' using custom vaccinia virus proteome microarrays

ORGANISM
Vaccinia virus WR

SUMMARY
Successful vaccination against smallpox with conventional vaccinia virus is usually determined by the development of a vesicular skin lesion at the site of vaccinia inoculation, called a ‘take’.    Although previous vaccination is known to be associated with attenuation of the take, the immunology that underlies a no-take in vaccinia-naïve individuals is not well understood.   We hypothesized that antibody profiling of individuals before and after receiving vaccinia would reveal differences between takes and no-takes that may help better understand the phenomenon.   Using vaccinia proteome microarrays and recombinant protein ELISAs we first examined the antibody response in vaccinia-naïve individuals that failed to take after receiving different doses of the replication competent smallpox vaccines, DryVax® and APSV.   Most that received diluted vaccine failed to respond, whereas 4 other no-takes receiving diluted vaccine, and 4 receiving undiluted vaccine, mounted an antibody response.   Interestingly, their antibody profiles were not significantly different from controls that did show a take. However, we did find elevated antibody titers in no-takes prior to receiving DryVax® that was significantly different from takes.   Although the sample size studied was small, we conclude the failure to take in responders correlates with pre-existing immunity of unknown etiology that may attenuate the skin reaction in a way similar to previous smallpox vaccination.
