TITLE
Role of macrophages in invadopodia formation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The first experiment involved the DU-145 tumor cell samples cultured with or without macrophages. This experiment was planned with an aim to evaluate the gene expression changes that might occur in DU-145 cells when grown in proximity to macrophages as compared to DU145 cells being grown alone. Similarly, the second experiment, involved the macrophage samples cultured with or without the DU-145 cells. This experiment was planned with an aim to evaluate the gene expression changes that might occur in Macrophages  when grown in proximity to DU-145 cells .
