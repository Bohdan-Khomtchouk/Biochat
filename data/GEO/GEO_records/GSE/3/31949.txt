TITLE
Profiling whole lung from Ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged and control BALB/c mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This program aims at identifying the lung gene signature associated with OVA-challenged mouse asthma model to facilitate understanding of the disease mechanism and therapeutic compound testing

DESIGN
The OVA-challenged profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the lungs of OVA-challenged mice compared to the corresponding PBS-treated controls.
