TITLE
Ogt chromatin recruitment is mediated by TET proteins in mouse ES cells [expression array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc ) transferase (OGT) activity is essential for embryonic stem (ES) cell viability and mouse development. OGT is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus of different cell types and mediates serine or threonine glycosylation. The Ogt gene locus resides on the X-chromosome and its activity is required for the viability of male ES cells. Using Ogt conditional knock out (KO) ES cells it was shown the failure of establishing stable KO ES clones further suggesting that Ogt activity is required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency. For understanding these changes, we performed global gene expression upon silencing of Ogt mediated by esiRNA in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from E14 ES cells (derived from Ola129 mice) transiently transfected with Ogt specific and control esiRNA oligos 48 hrs. post-transfection.
