TITLE
Bacillus subtilis spores, PROTECT experiment, Space-exposed and Mars-exposed vs. Earth-control

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial spores are considered likely potential forward contaminants on robotic missions to Mars. Thus it is important to understand their global responses to long-term exposure to space or Mars environments. As part of the PROTECT experiment, spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return, spores were germinated, total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled, and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response, SPÎ² prophage induction), protein damage (CtsR/Clp system), oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars.

DESIGN
Two-color microarrays were performed comparing germination of Space-exposed or Mars-exposed vs. ground-control (Earth) spores.
