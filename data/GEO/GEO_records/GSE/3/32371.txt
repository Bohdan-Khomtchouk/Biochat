TITLE
DNA methylation and gene expression changes during human embryonic stem cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression changes during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.

DESIGN
hESCs (H1 and H13) DNA samples for 3 different differentian stage (D0, undifferentiated;D21, 21 days after undirected differentiation; D90, 90 days after undirected differentiation); two-color experiment, paired comparison (differentiated vs undifferentiated; A & B: two biological replicates). Differentian-stage variation in methylation profiling of human DNA samples were detected by MSAM. 2Âµg of DNA was serially digested with SmaI and XmaI followed by an adaptor ligation and adaptor mediated PCR amplification. Analysis of differentian-stage variation in gene expression of human mRNA samples were implementd following standard Agilent protocol.
