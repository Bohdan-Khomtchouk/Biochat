TITLE
The transcriptional response of ovarian cancer cells to treatment with cisplatin (CDDP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response to CDDP of three ovarian cancer cell lines was studied. These lines show different genetic profiles and display different susceptibilities to CDDP. The time and doses that resulted in the apoptotic death of each cell line was identified and used to study the expression profiles associated to CDDP-induced cell death in each cell line. CDDP: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)

DESIGN
In order to elucidate the mechanism of CDDP dependent cell susceptibilities to drugs, the transcriptional response of the three ovarian cancer cell lines to CDDP were studied by microarray based transcription profiling
