TITLE
Transcriptome wide analysis of  classically  and alternatively activated macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived human M1- and M2-like macrophage profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) methods and to establish a high resolution transcriptome of human macrophages. Total RNA was isolated from classically and aternative activated human macrophages.mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing og M1 and M2 macrophages from 3 donors using Illumina HiSeqSQ. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Casava1.8 and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using LightCycler and SYBR Green assays.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing og M1 and M2 macrophages from 3 donors using Illumina HiSeqSQ.
