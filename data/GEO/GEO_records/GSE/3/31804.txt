TITLE
Expression data of enterotoxigenic (ETEC) isolate E24377A

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
ETEC is an important human pathogen.  Although the mechanism of diarrhea is known in ETEC, the regulatory networks are less understood.  This study was conducted to understand the global expression of ETEC isolate E24377A under different growth and environemental conditions. ETEC isolate E24377A was grown in the presence of several chemical signals, including bile salts, glucose, and pre-conditioned media (PCM) from other enteric pathogens.  E24377A was also grown to different densities, to see if a quorum sensing mechanism was in place
