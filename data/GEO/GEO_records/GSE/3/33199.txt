TITLE
A mouse model of the most aggressive subgroup of human medulloblastoma [Mouse430_2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse models of medulloblastoma are compared to human subgroups through microarray expression and other measures

DESIGN
This study contrasts mouse medullablastomas from a range of mouse genetic  models. For Shh-type medulloblastoma [dka001-005, 009, 033 and 034] and [dka050-057], spontaneous medulloblastomas from [Cdkn2c-/-; Trp53Fl/Fl; Nestin-Cre] and [Cdkn2c-/-; Ptch1+/-] (Uziel et al.,2005 Genes Dev) were used, respectively.  For Myc [dka010-022, 037, 046, 049 and 058-71] and Mycn [dka023-032, 036 and 047] were generated by orthotopic injection of either Myc or Mycn overexpression in Cdkn2c-/-, Trp53-/- cerebellar cells into immunocompromised nude mice.  For Wnt-type medulloblastomas [pgr003, 016 and 066], spontaneously developed tumors from CTNNB1+/lox (ex3); BLBP-Cre; Trp53Fl/Fl (Gibson et al., Nature, 2010) were removed for RNA extraction.
