TITLE
Custom Agilent array-CGH of somatic cell hybrids targeted to 17q21.31 deletion syndrome locus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This is array CGH data of recurrent 17q21.31 deletions used to delineate breakpoints within segmental duplications in a study by Itsara et al. Somatic cell hybrids were generated from three parent-child trios probands with 17q21.31 deletions and three 17q21.31 probands for which no parental DNA was available that isolated individual chromosome 17 homologues. In parents, this isolated the H2 from the H1 haplotypes in distinct cell lines, and in probands, isolated the deletion-bearing chromosomes from the unaffected chromosome 17. In parent-child trios, the deletion-bearing chromosomes were hybridized against the progenitor parental chromosome. In probands with no parental DNA, the deletion-bearing chromosomes were hybridized against an H2 chromosome.
