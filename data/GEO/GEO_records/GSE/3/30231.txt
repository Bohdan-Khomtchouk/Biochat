TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis - Comparison of wild type SMR5 and amtR deletion strain YL1 under nitrogen starvation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
In this approach, total transcript of the Mycobacterium smegmatis wild type was compared to a amtR deletion strain under nitrogen starvation. With this experiment, putative target genes of AmtR, a regulator protein of nitrogen metabolism, were identified. Two biological replicates were analyzed.
