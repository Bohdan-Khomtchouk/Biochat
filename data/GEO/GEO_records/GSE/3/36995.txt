TITLE
PGE2-induced OSM expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to compare the wound macs with corresponding macs derived from peripheral blood monocytes (MDMs). Wound site macrophage (wound macs were isolated from human subjects with chronic wounds. Matching blood monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) were obtained from same subjects. Transcriptome profiling (GeneChip, Affymetrix) was performed.The expression values of genes were normalized using global scaling approach.

DESIGN
Blood monocyte derived macrophages or human wound macrophages were isolated and transcriptome analysis was performed using affymetrix gene chip analysis. Group -1 MDMs (n=3) Mac-1 Mac-2 Mac-3 Group -2 Wound macs (n=3) Wmac-1 Wmac-2 Wmac-3
