TITLE
carbonic anhydrase (1 or 2) simple or double mutants-Comparative transcriptome analysis between carbonic anhydrase mutants and wild type Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea05-01_carbonic-anhydrase - carbonic anhydrase (1 or 2) simple or double mutants - Identification of genes differentially expressed in leaves of single CA1 and CA2 T-DNA insertional mutants and in the corresponding double mutant vs wild type - CA1 (At3g01500) and CA2 (At5g14740) T-DNA insertional mutant lines, the double (CA1+CA2) mutant and wild type Arabidopsis seeds were sown in soil in a phytotron. Leaves were harvested 40 days later for RNA extraction

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - gene knock out
