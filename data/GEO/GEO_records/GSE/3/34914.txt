TITLE
Deep Sequence Analysis of non-small cell lung cancer: Integrated analysis of gene expression, alternative splicing, and single nucleotide variations in lung adenocarcinomas with and without oncogenic KRAS mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this manuscript, we have used RNA-Sequencing experiment to obtain and integrate a variety of genomic features in order to identify signaling pathways that are associated to mutant KRAS lung tumors.

DESIGN
8 lung adenocarcinomas with mutant KRAS in lung tumors and 8 lung adenocarcarcinomas without KRAS mutation of which one sample is ran twice for QC purposes.
