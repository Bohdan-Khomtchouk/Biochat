TITLE
Identification of genes responsive to mild hyperthermia in human normal fibroblast OUMS-36 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyperthermia is widely used to treat patients with various cancers. Here, the effects of heat stress at 41°C for 30 min (mild hyperthermia) on the gene expression in OUMS-36 human normal fibroblast cells were investigated using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. The cells were treated with mild hyperthermia, followed by incubation for 0, 1, or 3 h at 37°C. No cell death was observed in the mild hyperthermia-treated cells. On the other hand, many genes that were differentially expressed by a factor 1.5 or greater were identified in the cells treated with the mild hyperthermia.

DESIGN
OUMS-36 human normal fibroblast cells were treated with heat stress (41°C for 30 min), followed by incubation for 0, 1, or 3 h at 37°C. Non-treated cells served as the control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was monitored by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer's instructions.
