SUMMARY
Fibroblast were isolated from either back or forearm punch biopsies taken by Dr. Kari Connolly(UCSF) from either normal control patients, patients with a diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis with Diffuse Scleroderma and patients with a diagnosis of morphea.  Scleroderma fibroblast were grown to confluence, media was changed and the RNA prepared from the cells 48 hrs later (to avoid serum responsive genes). A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Keywords: disease_state_design
