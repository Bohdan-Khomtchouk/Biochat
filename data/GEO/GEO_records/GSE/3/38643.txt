TITLE
Gene regulation in autophagy and apoptosis juncture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autophagy to apoptosis switching event is an unexplored area. We were interested to explore the gene expression profile at this juncture. Our Microarray data emphasized that among all eNOS and p62 genes were markedly induced. In fuctional level eNOS expression activates mTORC1 followed by inhibition of autophagy. This ultimately allowed accumulation of p62 . Intraccellular accumulation of p62 sequestered unfolded toxic protein aggregates in mitochondria and ER resulting in to impaired redox regulation. Intraccelular ROS generation further sensitized cells for apoptosis and tilted autophagic response to apoptosis.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with Tunicamycin as an inducer of both autophagy and apoptosis. At early stage of Tunicamycin treatment 24h , prostate cancer cell PC3 showed activation of autophagic process where apoptosis was not evident. Sustained ER stress with Tunicamycin induced late apoptoisis at 72h of treatment. Hence we isolated total RNA from Untreated cells, cells with Tunicamycin treatment after 24h and 72h. Further the RNA were used to perform whole genome microarray to analyze the gene expression profile at autophagy and apoptosis juncture. The selected genes were also validated by qPCR and western bot. Morover RNAi study were implemented to evaluate the signaling crosstalk at the juncture of autophagy and apoptosis.
