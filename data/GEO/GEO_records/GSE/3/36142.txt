TITLE
Comparing gene expression in untransfected and transfected mouse neuronal (Neuro2A) cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression in untransfected Neuro2A cells and in pCDNA3.1myc/his vector transfected Neuro2A cells

DESIGN
1 sample each of untransfected and transfected Neuro2A cells were analyzed
