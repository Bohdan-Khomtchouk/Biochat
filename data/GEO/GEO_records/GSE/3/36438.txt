TITLE
Human lung adenocarcinoma DNA methylation profiling by MSNP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinomaâ€™s genomic alterations exhibit vast variation. Lung adenocarcinoma also has previously described intrinsic gene expression subtypes (Hayes et al. 2006, PMID: 17075127). This study detect global methylation differences among gene expression subtypes. These specimens were also assayed for genomewide transcription in GSE26939 and copy number in GSE36363.

DESIGN
33 tumor samples and 10 normal samples were quantified for DNA methylation by MSNP (Yuan et al, PMID: 16585166) using Affymetrix SNP 250K_StyI microarrays.
