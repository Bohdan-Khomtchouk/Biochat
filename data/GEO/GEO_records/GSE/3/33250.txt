TITLE
Gene expression in the tail tissue of tadpoles [Rana pirica] by larvae salamander or dragon fly

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail.  Whereas, dragon fly also induced higher tail tadpole.  The tadpoles revert to a normal phenotype upon removal of the larval salamander or dragon fly threat. The objective of the present study was to use Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip to profile gene expression in the tail tissue by different predation threat.
