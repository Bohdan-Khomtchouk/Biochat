TITLE
An atlas of mRNA expression in pig adipose and muscle tissues

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Obese and lean-type pig breeds show obvious differences in adipose deposition and muscle growth; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic variation remains unclear.  Landrace (a leaner, Western breed), Rongchang (a fatty, Chinese breed) and Tibetan (a feral, indigenous Chinese breed that has not undergone artificial selection) pig breeds were used in this study. We collected eight diverse adipose tissues and two phenotypically distinct skeletal muscle tissues from three well-defined pig models with distinct fat rates, and studied mRNA expression differences among breeds, males and females, and tissues.  These results highlight some possible candidate genes for porcine adipose deposition and muscle growth and provide some data on which to base further studies of the molecular basis of energy metabolism.

DESIGN
The mRNA expression differences of eight diverse adipose tissues and two phenotypically distinct skeletal muscle tissues from three well-defined pig models with distinct fat rates are measured.
