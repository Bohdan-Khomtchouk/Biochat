TITLE
Role of PKD2 in TCR-induced transcriptional reprogramming of na√Øve T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profile of TCR stimulated P14-TCR wild-type and P14-PKD2 null murine lymph node cells

DESIGN
Lymph node cells from 3 biological replicates (3 wild-type and 3 PKD2 null mice) were isolated and left unstimulated or stimulated for 4 hours with antigenic peptide (gp33-41) prior to RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarray.
