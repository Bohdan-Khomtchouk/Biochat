TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ovaries collected from mice treated with or without Ulipristal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ulipristal acetate (UPA), also referred to as VA/CDB-2914, is a new and promising emergency contraceptive. It is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that has been approved in Europe and the USA for emergency contraception.

DESIGN
To experimentally induce ovulation, the immature CD-1 mice (24â€“28 d old) were injected ip with 5 IU of PMSG and 48 h later by 5 IU of hCG.  Two hour after hCG treatment, mice were administered with UPA/CDB or vehicle/OIL. Ovaries were collected at 11 h and total RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix mouse arrays
