TITLE
Expression data from U2OS ER-E2F1 cells after FOXO knockdown and E2F1 activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effect of FOXO knockdown on E2F1-mediated transcription

DESIGN
U2OS cells stably expressing ER-E2F1 were infected with two different lentiviruses both targeting  FOXO1 and FOXO3 or control virus encoding scrambled sequence. Twenty four hours post infection medium was replaced to serum-free DMEM for 24 hours. Then medium was replaced to serum-free DMEM with or without 20 nM 4-hydroxy tamoxifen for 6 hours.
