TITLE
Effects of methylseleninic acid on prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This set of arrays contains 31 experiments. It is designed to determine the effects of methylseleninic acid on the transcriptional program of prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Threee concentrations, 3, 10, and 30 uM, were used for treatment. The effects were monitored through a time course of 48 hours, with samples collected at 10 different time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 48). RNA from treated cells were labeled using Cy5, and untreated using Cy3. One experiment using RNA from untreated cells in both channel was used as control. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Keywords: compound_treatment_design
