TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in miR-214 KO mouse hearts and skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissue remains the most effective intervention for improving clinical outcome following myocardial infarction.  However, abrupt increases in intracellular Ca2+ during myocardial reperfusion cause cardiomyocyte death and consequent loss of cardiac function, referred to as ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury.  Cardiac IR is accompanied by dynamic changes in expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), which inhibit specific mRNA targets.  miR-214 is up-regulated during ischemic injury and heart failure in mice and humans, but its potential role in these processes is unknown.  We show that genetic deletion of miR-214 in mice causes loss of cardiac contractility, increased apoptosis, and excessive fibrosis in response to IR injury.

DESIGN
The microarray contains 6 samples, each containing cDNA pooled from 3 mice per group. There are no replicates.  The array was designed to make 3 different pairwise comparisons between the following: P14 WT and miR-214 KO hearts; adult WT and miR-214 KO skeletal muscle; adult WT and miR-214 KO hearts
