TITLE
Progestin regulation of gene expression in breast cancer and minimally transformed breast cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time course of response to synthetic progestin ORG2058 in T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines and in two PR positive clones of the MCF-10A cell line: AB9 and AB32. Transcriptional response to synthetic progestin, 10nM ORG2058, was compared between the four cell lines at three treatment times.

DESIGN
T-47D breast cancer cells were treated in triplicate with 10nM ORG2058 or ethanol vehicle and harvested at 2, 6 and 24h after treatment for gene expression profiling
