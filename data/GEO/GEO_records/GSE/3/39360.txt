TITLE
Comparison of Zmiz1-induced keratoancanthoma and normal skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of Zmiz1 in the skin develop spontaneous keratoacanthomas. In this experiment, a Cre-inducible transgene expressing a truncated form of Zmiz1 was introduced into mice.  Activation of the transgene in these mice was achieved by breeding to K14-Cre transgenic animals.  Double transgenic mice formed spontaenous keratoacanthomas with short latency.

DESIGN
In this experiment, we generated gene expression profiles for five Zmiz1-induced keratoacanthomas and six normal skin samples.
