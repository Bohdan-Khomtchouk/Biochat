TITLE
Gene expression data of BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors from Dusp6 wild-type and Dusp6 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanism of Dusp6-mediated pre-B cell survival signaling, we investigated the gene expression pattern in BCR-ABL1-transformed Dusp6+/+ and Dusp6-/- B cell precursors.

DESIGN
BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors of Dusp6 wildtype and Dusp6 knockout mice were subjected to RNA isolation
