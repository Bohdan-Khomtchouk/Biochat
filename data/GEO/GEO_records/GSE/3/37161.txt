Expression data from roots of rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Potassium (K+) is one of the most important nutrient ions in plant cells and play crucial roles in many plant physiological and developmental processes. K+ deficiency is the common abiotic stress in natural environment, which inhibits plant growth and reduces production of crops. We used microarrays to analyse the transcriptomic changes in rice roots after suffering K+ starvation at different times. The results of GO analysis showed that these transcriptionally changed genes mainly fell into the categories of metabolic process, membrane, cation binding, kinase activity, transport and so on.
