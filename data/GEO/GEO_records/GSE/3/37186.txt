Effects of equol on gene expression in female cynomolgus monkey iliac arteries

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective:  To examine the effects of the phytoestrogen metabolite, equol, on gene expression in the monkey iliac artery. Design:  Eight ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys were on a high fat diet for 6.5 years.  The left iliac artery was biopsied prior to randomization to equol (0.0237 g/100 g chow, n=4) or vehicle (n=4) for 8 months.  The right iliac artery was obtained at necropsy.  Gene expression in the iliac arteries in response to equol was determined by DNA microarray and confirmed by real time RT-PCR. Results:  Atherosclerotic lesions in the iliac arteries ranged in size from 0.113-1.003 mm2 in equol-treated animals and from 0-0.873 mm2 in control animals.  59 genes were down-regulated and 279 were up-regulated in response to equol.  Comparison of these data to previous work identified 10 genes regulated in opposite directions by equol compared to presence of atherosclerosis plaque.  55 genes were differentially expressed in the same direction in response to both equol and estradiol. Conclusions:  Similar responses of genes to both equol and estradiol may reflect the extent to which equol serves as a natural selective estrogen receptor modulator in the arteries.  Opposite responses of 10 genes to equol versus the presence of atherosclerosis implicates those genes in the potential protective effects of equol in the vasculature.
