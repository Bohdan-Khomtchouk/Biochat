TITLE
Comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles of G. hirsutum L. cv. MCU5 and its fuzzless-lintless mutant during fiber development stages.

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Cotton is one of the most commercially important Fiber crops in the world and used as a source for natural textile Fiber and cottonseed oil. The fuzzless-lintless ovules of cotton mutants are ideal source for identifying genes involved in Fiber development by comparing with Fiber bearing ovules of wild-type. To decipher molecular mechanisms involved in Fiber cell development, transcriptome analysis has been carried out by comparing G. hirsutum cv. MCU5 (wild-type) with its fuzzless-lintless mutant (MUT). Cotton bolls were collected at Fiber initiation (0 dpa/days post anthesis), elongation (5, 10 and 15 dpa) and secondary cell wall synthesis stage (20 dpa) and gene expression profiles were analyzed in wild-type and MUT using Affymetrix cotton GeneChip Genome array.
