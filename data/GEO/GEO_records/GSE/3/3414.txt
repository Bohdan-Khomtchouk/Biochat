TITLE
Immune Response to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in the mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to examine the innate immune response to helminth infection in the lung. Hookworms (like many other helminths) use an obligate migration pathway through the lung. Their infection has been characterized in the gut in detail, but early immune responses in the lung have not been fully characterized. Keywords: Time Course
