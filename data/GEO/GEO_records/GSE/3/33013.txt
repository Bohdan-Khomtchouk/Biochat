TITLE
Combinatorial role of two paralogous splicing factors, hnRNP L and L-like, in multiple-exon regulation of CD45 alternative splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to investigate the role of hnRNP L-like in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in human B-cells through an RNA-Seq approach.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed in DG75 cell line with over expression of hnRNP L-like or GFP as control.
