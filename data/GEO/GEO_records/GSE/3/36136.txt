TITLE
Expression profiling of the E10.5 cardiac conduction system using MinKGFP BAC transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proper development of the specialized cardiac conduction system is crucial for function of the mature heart.  Tools for isolation and in-vivo study of the conduction system are limited.  The goal of this study was to identify pathways important for conduction system development.  We generated a BAC transgenic mouse line, minKGFP, that marks the conduction system during embryogenesis and in adulthood.  GFP is expressed in this line at high levels in conduction system myocardium (minkGFP high) and low levels in chamber myocardium (minKGFP low).  We used this mouse line to isolate E10.5 conduction system cells, and performed transcriptional profiling on these cells to identify pathways with potential roles in specification of the developing cardiac conduction system.

DESIGN
8 samples, 4 biological replicates of E10.5 minKGFP high cardiac conduction system cells, 4 biological replicates of E10.5 minKGFP low chamber myocardium cells
