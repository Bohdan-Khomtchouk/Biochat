TITLE
Effect of GRHL2 in HMLE+Twist-ER+4-OHT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Grainyhead genes are involved in wound healing and developmental neural tube closure. In light of the high degree of similarity between the epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) occurring in wound healing processes and the cancer stem cell-like compartment of tumors, including TGF-β-dependence, we investigated the role of a Grainyhead gene (GRHL2) in oncogenic EMT.  Grainyhead was specifically down-regulated in the claudin-low subclass of mammary tumors and in the basal-B subclass of breast cancer cell lines.  Functionally, GRHL2 suppressed TGF-β-induced, Twist-induced or spontaneous EMT, enhanced anoikis-sensitivity, and suppressed mammosphere generation in mammary epithelial cells.   These effects were mediated, in part, by its suppression of ZEB1 expression, through direct repression of the ZEB1 promoter.  GRHL2 also inhibited Smad-mediated transcription, and up-regulated mir200b/c as well as the TGF-β receptor antagonist, BMP2.  The expression of GRHL2 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 triggered a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and sensitized the cells to anoikis.  These results indicate that GRHL2 is a suppressor of the oncogenic EMT.

DESIGN
3 biologic replicates for each cell line. Comparison of HMLE+Twist-ER cells expressing GRHL2/pMIG vs. HMLE+Twist-ER cells expressing empty pMIG.
