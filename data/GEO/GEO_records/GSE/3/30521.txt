SUMMARY
Although many genes have been proposed to be involved in prostate carcinogenesis, no single gene or gene profile has shown to have prognostic value. The main challenge for clinical management is to distinguish slowly growing tumors from those that will relapse. In this study, we compared expression profiles of 18 prostate samples (7 with Gleason 6, 8 with Gleason 7 and 3 with Gleason score equal or higher than 8) and 5 non-neoplastic prostate samples, using the GeneChipÂ® Human Exon Array 1.0 ST of Affymetrix. Microarray analysis revealed 99 genes showing statistically significant differences among tumors with Gleason score 6, 7 and  8.  In addition, mRNA expression of 29 selected genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR with microfluidic cards in an extended series of 30 prostate tumors. From these, 29 were selected to be validated and the differential expression of 18 of them (62%) was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (14 upregulated and 4 downregulated in higher Gleason scores) in the extended series. This list was further narrowed down to 12 genes that were differentially expressed in tumors with Gleason score of 6-7 vs  8. Finally, the protein levels of two genes from the 12-gene signature (SEC14L1 and TCEB1) were additionally validated by immunohistochemistry. Strong protein levels of both genes were correlated with Gleason score, stage, and PSA progression. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
