TITLE
Profiling whole lung from lung-specific IL-1b-Tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This program aims at identifying the lung gene signature associated with inflammation and emphysema in IL-1b-Tg mouse COPD model to facilitate understanding of the disease mechanism and therapeutic compound testing

DESIGN
The lung profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the lungs of IL-1b-Tg mice treated with doxycycline (to induce IL-1b transgene) compared to the corresponding water-treated controls.
