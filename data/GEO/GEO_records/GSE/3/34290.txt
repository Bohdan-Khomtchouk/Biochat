TITLE
array-CGH on single blastomeres from day-3 human cleavage stage embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seventy blastomeres from fourteen frozen-thawed supernumerary human preimplantation embryos were disassociated and genomic was amplified using Multiple Displacement Amplification. BAC array-CGH was performed on the amplified products.

DESIGN
BAC array-CGH on single blastomeres amplified by Multiple Displacement Amplification.
