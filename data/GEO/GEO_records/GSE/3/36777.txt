TITLE
Rice leaves in the field in 2009

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf in the field in 2009. This experiment was performed to validate the results of field transcriptomic modeling.  Using 461 field transcriptome data obtained in 2008 (GSE36040; GSE36042; GSE36043; GSE36044; GSE18685) and the corresponding meteorologicla dara, we perfomred statistical modeling of transcriptome.

DESIGN
Rice leaves (Norin8 vs. osgi) in the paddy field were collected on Aug. 10 - 12, 24 - 25, 31, Oct. 8 - 9 in 2009.
