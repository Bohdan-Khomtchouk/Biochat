TITLE
Distinct Transcriptional Signatures of Bone Marrow-Derived C57BL/6 and DBA/2 Dendritic Leucocytes Hosting Live Leishmania amazonensis Amastigotes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the modulation of gene expression of  C57BL/6 and DBA/2 BMDLs in the presence of living intracellular Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes

DESIGN
A genome-wide transcriptional analysis was performed by comparing the gene expression profiles of control DLs and live amastigote-hosting DLs from both mouse strains. Dendritic Leucocytes were generated in vitro from bone marrow progenitors (C57Bl/6 and DBA/2 mice). Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes were purified from mouse cutaneous lesions and were added to DL cultures. After 24h, and following a sorting procedure, only BMDls housing living amastigotes were selected for total RNA extraction. Three Biological replicates per condition were run.
