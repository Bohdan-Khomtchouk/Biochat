TITLE
Transcriptome changes after genome wide admixture in invasive sculpins

ORGANISM
Cottus

SUMMARY
European sculpins (Cottus) harbor an example of a recent hybrid speciation event, which entails the invasion of a new habitat by the hybrid species. We compare the transcriptomes of both parental species and the hybrid species to understand how they differ. F2 crosses between the parent species are compared to the hybrid species and its parent species to identify unique patterns of the hybrid species due to the initial hybridization process or respectively to other processes. See the accompanying publication (Czypionka et al. 2011.Transcriptome changes after genome wide admixture in invasive sculpins Molecular Ecology no doi yet) for more information.
