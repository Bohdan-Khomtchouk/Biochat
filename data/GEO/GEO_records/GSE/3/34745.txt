TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of the Lates calcarifer Immune Response Towards Cryptocaryon irritans Infection

ORGANISM
Lates calcarifer

SUMMARY
Cryptocaryon irritans is the causative agent of white spot disease that infects virtually all marine teleost including Lates calcarifer. We undertook to gain an informative snapshot of the hostâ€™s transcriptomic response during the course of infection. Liver and spleen cDNA libraries-based L. calcarifer cDNA microarray were used as a tool to oversee the infection response. Parasites infection was carried out on juvenile fish for four days, and total RNA was extracted from the daily harvested infected liver. cDNAs synthesized from respective daily pooled total RNA were labelled and hybridized onto the L. calcarifer chip. The majority of infection-induced genes are acute phase proteins (APP) with hepcidin, C-type lectin and serum amyloid A being the most up-regulated products.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Control vs. Infected. Time series experiment: 4 time points (Day 1-Day 4 post infection). Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 infected per day. Two-color arrays (Cy3=daily control, Cy5=daily infected). Six arrays (including 3 dye-swap arrays) per each time series.
