TITLE
Gene expression profiling of in vitro matured bovine oocytes cultivated with or without cumulus cells.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Cumulus cells, surrounding the oocyte, play a key role in the acquisition of oocyte competence to be fertilized and to sustain early embryo development. Cumulus cells contribute to oocyte development by metabolizing energy substrates such as glutathione that may protect the oocyte from oxidative stress damages. The aim of our study was to compare transcriptomics profiles of cumulus enclosed (CEO) and cumulus denuded (CDO) oocytes after in vitro maturation.

DESIGN
Global transcriptional profiling was performed using cumulus enclosed and cumulus denuded oocytes after in vitro maturation. Matured oocytes were obtained after 22h of maturation with (CEO) or without (CDO) cumulus cells and four replicates of 25 oocytes were collected for RNA extraction.  Gene expression analysis was performed by comparing CDO versus CEO oocytes that represents a total of 8 slides using a dye swap hybridisation protocol.
