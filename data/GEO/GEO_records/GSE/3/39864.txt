TITLE
Treg specific Gata3 knock out array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Foxp3 is indispensible for the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 mediated gene expression we purified Foxp3 complexes and explored their composition. Biochemical and mass-spectrometric analyses revealed that Foxp3 forms multi-protein complexes of 400-800 kDa or larger and identified 361 associated proteins ~30% of which are transcription-related. Foxp3 directly regulates expression of a large proportion of the genes encoding its co-factors.  Reciprocally, some transcription factor partners of Foxp3 facilitate its expression. Functional analysis of Foxp3 cooperation with one such partner, Gata3, provided further evidence for a network of transcriptional regulation afforded by Foxp3 and its associates to control distinct aspects of Treg cell biology. Gene expression profile of Treg specific knock-out of Gata3 vs. their littermate controls were analyzed to gain insight into Gata3 dependendent genes in Treg cells.

DESIGN
Treg cells (CD4+CD25+YFP+) sorted from Gata3F/FFoxp3YFP-Cre and Gata3F/+Foxp3YFP-Cre mice (three mice in each group) followed by microarray analyses.
