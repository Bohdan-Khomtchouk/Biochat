TITLE
Gene expression changes in primary mouse fibroblasts in the absence of ASCIZ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify potential transcriptional targets of ASCIZ, we performed a microarray analysis of three wildltype and ASCIZ(ATMIN/ZNF822)-deficient littermate single-passage MEF cultures.  Only 22 and 25 genes were found to be down- or upregulated in the KO, respectively, by > 1.5-fold (p < 0.05).  The most severely downregulated gene was Dynll1, which was confirmed by Norhtern and Western blot in mulitple embryonic tissues.

DESIGN
Primary MEFs were isolated from embryonic day 12.5 embryos (3 wildtype, 3 knockouts), and passaged once before isolation of total RNA.
