TITLE
Histone deacetylation at coding sequences adjusts transcription kinetics during Candida albicans morphogenesis [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The dataset contains ChIP-Seq data of the Set3 and Hos2 proteins in Candida albicans, assayed in two morphological phases (yeast and hypha). The Set3 and Hos2 proteins in the respective strains carry 9myc epitopes and ChIP was performed with an anti-myc antibody. Included samples are the following: 1 input and 1 ChIP sample of an untagged wild type strain as negative control assayed in the yeast phase, 1 input and 3 ChIP biological replicates of the Set3-9myc strain in the yeast phase, 1 input and 2 ChIP biological replicates of the Set3-9myc strain in the hypha phase, 1 input and 2 ChIP biological replicates of the Hos2-9myc strain in the yeast phase, 1 input and 2 ChIP biological replicates of the Hos2-9myc strain in the hypha phase, 1 input and 3 ChIP biological replicates of Set3-9myc in a set1delta/delta background in the yeast phase.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq was performed of Candida albicans strains in two morphological phases (yeast and hypha). Yeast-phase cells were grown to the exponential phase in YPD at 30C. Hyphal differentiation was induced by resuspending the cells in YPD+20% Fetal Calf Serum and a shift of the growth temperature to 37C. Induction was performed for 30 minutes. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature.
