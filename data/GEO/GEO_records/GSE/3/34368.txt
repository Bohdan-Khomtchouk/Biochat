TITLE
Expression data form EhCPBF1 gene silenced strain.

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is a causative agent of amebiasis. One of the major virulence factors of this parasite is cysteine protease (CP). To understand the molecular basis of intracellular trafficking of CP, we identified CP5 binding protein and named cysteine protease binding protein family 1 (CPBF1). To study the function of CPBF1, we generate CPBF1 gene silenced strain and analyzed the expression profile by custom made microarray.

DESIGN
E. histolytica G3 strain was transfected with pSAP2 vector or pSAP2-CPBF1 and established the transformats by selecting the transfected cells with G418. After confirm the gene silencing of CPBF1 by RT-PCR, we performed the transcriptome analysis of pSAP2 (mock) and pSAP2-CPBF1 (gene silenced) cells.
