TITLE
Characterization of whole blood gene and while blood cell expression profiles of dietary-induced hyperlipidemia in miniature pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Miniature pigs are useful model animal for gene expression studies on dietary-induced hyperlipidemia, because they have similar digestive physiology to human. Two typical dietary components were used for dietary-induced hyperlipidemia miniature pig models. One is a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFCD) containing 15% lard and 2% cholesterol, the other is a high-fat, high-cholesterol and high-sucrose diet (HFCSD) containing 15% lard, 2% cholesterol and 37% sucrose.

DESIGN
Whole blood gene expression in HFCD, HFCSD and control male miniature pigs was measured at 10, 19 and 27 weeks of feeding periods.ã€€White blood cell gene expression in HFCD, HFCSD and control male miniature pigs was measured at 27 weeks of feeding period.
