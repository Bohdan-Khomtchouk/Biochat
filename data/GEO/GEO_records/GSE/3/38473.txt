TITLE
Gene expression changes following demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine（decitabine, DAC）in mouse T cell lymphoma EL4 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study had shown that DAC treatment enhanced immunogenecity of EL4 cells. To explore the mechanisms of DAC-induced tumor immunity, we carried out cDNA microarray analyses to compare the differential expression of genes between DAC and PBS treated EL4 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, PBS treated EL4  vs. Decitabine treated EL4 cells. Biological replicates: 3 PBS treated, 3 Decitabine treated, independently treatment and harvested. One replicate per array.
