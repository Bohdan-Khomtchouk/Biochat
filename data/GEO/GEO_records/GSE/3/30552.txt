TITLE
Expression data from mice lacking SIRT3 under dietary stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SIRT3 is a mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, which regulates the enzymatic activity of several mitochondrial proteins. We used microarrays to identify the differences in gene expression as a result of loss of SIRT3, under standard and high-fat diet conditions

DESIGN
Wild-type and SIRT3KO mice were sacrificed at 12weeks of age and RNA was extracted from liver tissue, and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays, to determine differences in gene expression as a result of diet
