TITLE
Expression data from active CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-17 from the miR-17-92 cluster regulate activation-induced cell death in T cells and modulate inducible regulatory T cell differentiation. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression modulated by miR-17 and aim to identify the potential targets of miR-17.

DESIGN
CD4 T cells from wild type or miR-17-92 deficient mice were activated and transduced with empty vector or that overexpressing miR-17. Potential targets of miR-17 should be upregulated in miR-17-92 deficient CD4 T cells compared to wild type CD4 T cells, and downregulated when miR-17 were reintroduced into the miR-17-92 deficient T cells.
