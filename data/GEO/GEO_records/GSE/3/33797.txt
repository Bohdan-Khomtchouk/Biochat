TITLE
P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) schizonts treated with A23187 vs P. falciparum (lab strain 3d7) reference RNA pool

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Calcium is a universal second messenger molecule which plays a significant role in several biological processes. Presence of calcium sensors (calmodulins) and calcium-dependent protein kinases in Plasmodium species suggests an important role of calcium-dependent signaling pathways in the regulation of cellular processes in the malaria parasites. Evidence for the transcriptional response of Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages to the well-known calcium ionophore A23187 has been presented here.
