TITLE
Genotoxic alterations of cord blood cells in newborns exposed in utero to a zidovudine-based antiretroviral combination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Zidovudine remains the cornerstone drug for prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. A mild but long-lasting hematological multilineage defect is observed in children exposed in utero. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of zidovudine-based ARV combinations on newborn cord blood cells. Methods: Cord blood-derived mononuclear cells from 22 HIV-1-uninfected newborn exposed in utero to a zidovudine-based ARV combination and from 20 healthy unexposed newborn were investigated by immunophenotyping, gene expression analysis, cytogenetic studies and functional capacity testing.

DESIGN
To evaluate the effects of zidovudine-based ARV combinations on newborn cord blood cells.
