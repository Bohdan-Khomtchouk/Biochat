TITLE
Evaluation of HIPK2-modulated genes in cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIPK2, a member of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase family, is a transcriptional corepressor whose activity inhibits tumor progression and allows tumor cell apoptosis in response to chemotherapy. HIPK2 regulates the function of numerous molecules and its inhibition by siRNA, hypoxia or mutations, strongly favours molecular pathways involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis, invasion and chemoresistance. Hence the identification of novel molecules regulated by HIPK2 may be beneficial for better understanding tumor progression and for evaluating targeted antitumor therapies.

DESIGN
By using microarray analysis, derived from HIPK2 overexpression (that mimics HIPK2 activation) in colon cancer RKO cells, we aim at evaluating the HIPK2 modulated gene expression involved in tumor progression.
