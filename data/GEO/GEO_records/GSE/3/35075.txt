TITLE
Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid Improves Metabolic Dysregulation and Aberrant Hepatic Lipid Metabolism in Mice by Both PPAR-alpha-Dependent and -Independent Pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test whether NDGA attenuate dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis by enhancing fatty acid oxidation through activation of PPAR-α. Using wild type (WT, C57BL/6) fed with chow diet as control, WT mice were either fed with high-fat diet or high-fat diet with NDGA (2.5g/kg food); ob/ob mice were fed with either chow or chow with NDGA (2.5 g/kg food), and maintained on the respective diets for 16 weeks. The expression of lipid metabolism related genes in the liver of these mice were analyzed using Phalanx GPL6845 platform (Mouse OneArray V1). Together with other biochemical/physiological data, our results suggest that the beneficial actions of NDGA on dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice are exerted primarily through enhanced fatty acid oxidation and energy utilization via the activation of PPAR- α receptor activity.

DESIGN
To examine the changes in gene expression in liver of WT and ob/ob mice with different NDGA diet treatment, RNA isolated from 3 animals of each group were used for studies of gene expression profiles. Phalanx GPL6845 platform (Mouse OneArray V1) was used for the microarrays analysis.
