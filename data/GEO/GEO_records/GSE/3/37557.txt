TITLE
Gene expression analysis in response to various hormone treatments

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Hormones effect various plant developmental processes by altering gene expression. The expression of several genes is regulated by plant hormones and many of these genes are regulated commonly and specifically by various hormones. We used microarrays to study the global effect of plant hormones on rice gene expression and identify the genes involved in operlapping and specific transcriptional responses.

DESIGN
Rice seedlings of IR64 variety were grown hydroponically for 7-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14h light and 10h dark. Seedlings were incubated in water (control) or 50 µM solution of indole-3-acetic acid (auxin, IAA) and benzyl aminopurine (cytokinin, BAP) and 100 µM solution of abscisic acid (ABA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ethylene derivative, ACC), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) for 3h. The 5 micrograms of total RNA sample isolated from each tissue sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Two biological replicates for each sample (two controls, IAA, BAP, ABA, ACC, SA and JA) were used for microarray analysis.
