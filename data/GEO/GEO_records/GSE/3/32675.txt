TITLE
Expression data from sorted Id3-GFP hi Id2-YFP int and Id3-GFP lo Id2-YFP hi activated CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During an immune response, CD8 T cells fall along a gradient of memory potential, but the regulators of these fate decsisions are not well understood. We utlized Id3-GFP and Id2-YFP reporter mice to elucidate the role of Id3 and Id2 during early CD8 T cell differentiation by gene expression.

DESIGN
Id3-GFP hi Id2-YFP int  or Id3-GFP lo Id2-YFP hi OT-I cells were sorted into trizol at day 6 of VSV-OVA infection and analyzed by microarray
