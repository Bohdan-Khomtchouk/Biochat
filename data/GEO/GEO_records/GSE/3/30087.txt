TITLE
Microarray experiment to identify gene expression changes in response to Phenobarbital treatment and CncC overexpression in Drosophila.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mature adult w1118 males treated with phenobarbital compared to controls and heat treated HS-CncC flies compared with heat treated w1118 flies.

DESIGN
Mature adult w1118 males were treated witheither 5% sucrose alone or 5% sucrose supplemented with 0.3% phenobarbital for six hours, following which RNA was extracted and subjected to micraoarray analysis.Similarly,mature adult w1118 flies or HS-CncC flies were subjected to heat treatment at 37oC for 30 minutes and recovered at room temperature for two hours,after which RNA was exctracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
