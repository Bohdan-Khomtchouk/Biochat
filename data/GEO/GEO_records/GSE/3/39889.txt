TITLE
Neutrophil gene expression in response to Mycobacterium abscessus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The response of human neutrophils to the emerging pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus has not been described.  However, M. abscessus infections are frequently associated with neutrophil-rich abscesses.  To better understand the reponse of neutrophils to M. abscessus we performed gene expression analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133A Plus 2.0 microarrays.  Human neutrophils from healthy donors were stimulated with isogenic rough and smooth morphotypes of M. abscessus.  Staphylococcus aureus was used as a control.  Gene expression was compared to neutrophils left unstimulated.  Neutrophils from four individual donors were isolated on separate days and stimulated with freshly prepared bacteria.  Neutrophils (stimulated and control) were left for 2 hours before total RNA was isolated, and biotinylated cRNA was prepared by standard methods.  Analysis indicates that M. abscessus morphotypes induce a limited number of genes, when compared to S. aureus, which are enriched in genes for cytokines and chemokines, including neutrophil-specific chemokines.  These data suggest that neutrophils have a limited response to M. abscessus, which may contribute to neutrophil-rich abscess formation.!Series_overall_design = Human neutrophils from healthy donors were exposed to rough Mab (ATCC 19977T), smooth Mab (ATCC 19977T) and S. aureus (CF clinical strain) for two hours; control cells were exposed to saline.
