TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Host Innate Immune Responses in the Brain and Spinal cord following Lethal CVS-11 Infection in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray and advanced pathway analysis of mice caused a paralysis in a fatal infection of a highly pathogenic CVS-11 was performed for the understanding of the detail gene networks and biological functions of inflammatory response and the related genes of innate immunity and apoptosis.

DESIGN
Brain Samples: Six female C57BL/6J mice aged six weeks old were inoculated 1E+7 focus-forming units (FFU) of CVS-11 propagated in MNA cells into the left hind limb, intramuscularly. On the other hand, MEM was inoculated into 6 negative control mice in a similar way. Each mice were sacrificed to collect their brains at days 7 postinoculation (dpi). Six mice were used for the analysis of microarray. The six of mock mice were also sacrificed at 7 dpi for the microarray analysis. Spinalcord Samples: Six female C57BL/6J mice aged six weeks old were inoculated 1E+7 focus-forming units (FFU) of CVS-11 propagated in MNA cells into the left hind limb, intramuscularly. On the other hand, MEM was inoculated into 6 negative control mice in a similar way. Each mice were sacrificed to collect their spinal cords at days 7 postinoculation (dpi). Six mice were used for the analysis of microarray. The six of mock mice were also sacrificed at 7 dpi for the microarray analysis.
