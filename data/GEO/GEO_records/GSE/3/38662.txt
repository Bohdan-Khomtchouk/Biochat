TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic stem cells(hESCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To detect the effect of  early culture on  hESCs, almost all initial-passaged hESCs have normal expression of DLK1-DIO3 gene cluster, the low-passaged hESCs lost the expression of DLK1-DIO3 gene cluster.

DESIGN
hESCs  were  extracted for RNA with TriZOL and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays
