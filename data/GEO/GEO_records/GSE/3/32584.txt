TITLE
Distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins during interphase and mitosis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we compare the distribution of insulator proteins during interphase and mitosis.  We performed ChIP-seq analysis on purified populations of interphase and mitotic Kc cells, using antibodies against CP190, dCTCF, BEAF, and Su(Hw).

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different insulator proteins during interphase and mitosis
