TITLE
MERLION LUNG CANCER STUDY_2_DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
East-Asian (EA) patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) are associated with a high proportion of non-smoking women, EGFR activating somatic mutations, and clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We identify copy number alterations specific to EA and Western European (WE) NSCLCs and conducted an integrative analysis using transcritomic data for identifying copy-number-driven candidate genes. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturerâ€™s specifications in the same center.

DESIGN
226 lung adenocarcinomas (90 East-Asian and 136 Western-European)  were analyzed for copy-number aberrations (CNAs) using a common high resolution SNP microarray platform.
