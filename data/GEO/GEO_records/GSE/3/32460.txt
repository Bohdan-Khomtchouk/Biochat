TITLE
Gene expression profiles using microarrays in diaphragm of normal Beagle dogs and Beagle-based canine muscular dystrophy (CXMDJ) before and 1 hour after initial respiration.

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Canine muscular dystrophy (CXMDJ) is a dog model of the lethal X-linked muscle disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by loss of dystrophin. Gene expression profile was analyzed in the diaphragm muscles of normal Beagle dogs and CXMDJ before and 1 hour after initial respiration.

DESIGN
Diaphragm were isolated from four groups (normal Beagle dogs and  CXMDJ before and 1 hour after initial respiration). Total RNA was purified and prepared to Agilent-021193 Canine (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (Feature Number version) (Agilent Technologies) using Agilkent reagents and protocols. The mRNA levels of differential expressed genes from gene chip analysis were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assay.
