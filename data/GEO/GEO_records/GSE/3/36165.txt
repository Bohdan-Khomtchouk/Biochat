TITLE
Drug efficacy reprogramming against aggressive human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We enriched for prostate cancer cells by the selection system used in human iPS purification. Gene expression signature-based chemical prediction enabled us to identify candidate drugs for reverting the EOS (early transposon promoter, OCT4 and SOX2 enhancer) signature with chemoresistance into a chemosensitive phenotype.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression between control and EOS-selected cancer cells.
