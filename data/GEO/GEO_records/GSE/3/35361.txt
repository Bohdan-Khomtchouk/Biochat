TITLE
JMJD3 is needed to regulate TGF beta responsive genes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural development requires crosstalk between signaling pathways and chromatin. In this study, we demonstrate that neurogenesis is promoted by an interplay between the TGFβ pathway and the H3K27me3 histone demethylase (HDM) JMJD3. Genome-wide analysis showed that JMJD3 is targeted to gene promoters by Smad3 in neural stem cells (NSCs) and is essential to activate TGFβ-responsive genes. In vivo experiments in chick spinal cord revealed that the generation of neurons promoted by Smad3 is dependent on JMJD3 HDM activity. Overall, these findings indicate that JMJD3 function is required for the TGFβ developmental program to proceed

DESIGN
Mouse neural stem cells (NSC) control and JMJD3 knock down (shctrl and shJMJD3) were treated with the vehicle (-TGFb) or TGFbeta 5ng/ml (+TGFb) for 2.5h. Three replicates were performed for each point. And all of them were use it to posterior analysis.
