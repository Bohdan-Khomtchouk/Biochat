TITLE
Serial gene expression profiling in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg mice that developed hepatic fibrosis and tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over expression of PDGF-C in mouse liver resulted in the progression of hepatic fibrosis, steatosis and the development of HCC; this mouse model closely resembles the human HCC that is frequently associated with hepatic fibrosis. Peretinoin (generic name; code, NIK-333), developed by the Kowa Company, (Tokyo, Japan), is an oral acyclic retinoid (ACR) with a vitamin A-like structure that targets the retinoid nuclear receptor. Peretinoin effectively inhibits the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors in Pdgf-c Tg mice. Gene expression profiling was evaluated during the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors.
