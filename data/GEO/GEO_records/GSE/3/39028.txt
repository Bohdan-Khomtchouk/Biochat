TITLE
H. salinarum transcriptome dynamics in response to 0.85mM extracellular copper

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Halobacterium salinarum is a halophillic archea that is capable of sustaining growth despite dramatic changes to the concentration of ions in its extracellular environment.  Here we studied H. salinarum's specific adaptation response to the transition metal copper.

DESIGN
Analysis utilized pre-treatment (time < 0min) samples as controls for all subsequent timepoints.  Time course samples were taken at +0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320min post treatment.  Interarray comparisons were normalized relative to a reference RNA sample generated from unperturbed H. salinarum batch culture in rich medium at OD600 0.6-0.8.
