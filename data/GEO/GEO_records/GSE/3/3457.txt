TITLE
Poplar flowering and maturation GeneXp arrays

ORGANISM
Populus

SUMMARY
To identify candidate genes involved in maturation and flowering, we conducted microarray expression studies using two poplar genotypes (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides hybrids) represented in continuous age gradients of one to six years. We designed 70-mers for 228 poplar genes and microarray studies were carried out using the microplate-based 96-well BioGridArray platform (GeneXP Biosciences).   Floral buds, vegetative buds and shoot tips were collected at different seasonal time points from juvenile and adult trees and from both basal and upper branches of mature trees. Keywords: Maturation and Flowering
