TITLE
Over-expression of a Cytochrome P450 is Associated with Resistance to Pyriproxyfen in the Greenhouse Whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum

ORGANISM
Trialeurodes vaporariorum

SUMMARY
Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), also known as the greenhouse whitefly, is a serious pest of protected vegetable and ornamental crops in most temperate regions of the world. The juvenile hormone mimic, pyriproxyfen, is a very effective mean of controlling this pest. Microarray analysis of a selected strain and a susceptible strain revealed a number of differentially expressed genes that were candidates for a role in resistance.

DESIGN
Analysis used total RNA from a susceptible strain (s) as control samples for comparison to the experimental resistant strain (r).
