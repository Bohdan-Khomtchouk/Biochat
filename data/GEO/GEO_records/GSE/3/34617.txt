TITLE
Gene expression during early stages of arbuscular mycorrhizal root formation in Medicago truncatula.

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel gene expression during early stages of Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on mycorrhizal root fragments enriched for early fungal infection stages. We used Medicago GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to early stages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and identified genes differentially expressed during these early stages.
