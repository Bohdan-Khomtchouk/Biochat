TITLE
Genetic Copy Number Variants in Myocardial Infarction Patients with Hyperlipidemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified 7 CNV regions that were associated significantly with hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction in our patients through multistage analysis (P < 0.001). The inclusion criteria for enrolling patients were drawn from the Prospective Cardiovascular Munster study [ ] and Framingham Heart Study [ ]. In brief, patients aged between 20 and 75 years with coronary arterial disease with more than 50% stenosis, as proven by cardiac catheterization, and a history of hyperlipidemia with serum cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein greater than 155 mg/dL were enrolled.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from whole blood samples. 40 Samples.
