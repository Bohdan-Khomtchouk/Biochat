TITLE
Effect of butyrate and DZNep on hESC HSF-6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to recover nuclei with two active X chromosomes (class I), we developed a reprogramming strategy by supplementing hESC media with the small molecules sodium butyrate, and 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep).  In order to determine how B+D affects global gene expression, we performed microarray analysis in triplicate in the HSF-6 (8) C and HSF-6 (8) B+D treated cultures.  We also evaluated HSF-6 (S9) B+D in triplicate and identified no statistically significant changes in gene expression in HSF-6 (S9) B+D compared to HSF-6 (8) B+D treated cultures. This suggests that global transcriptional differences are more strongly modulated by presence or absence of B+D and not the percentage of class I, II or III nuclei.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling on hESC HSF-6 (8, S9) in absent (control) and presence of butyrate and DZNep. All cell were collected after 11 passages in absent and presence of butyrate and DZNep.
