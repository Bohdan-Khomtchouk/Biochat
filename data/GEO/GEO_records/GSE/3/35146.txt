TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and IPF lung tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and IPF lung samples. The Illumina human methylation 27 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs samples. 2 normal samples, and 4 IPF samples

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
