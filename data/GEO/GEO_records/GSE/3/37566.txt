TITLE
Dendritic cell and monocyte progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profiles of Macrophage & Dendritic cell Progenitors (MDPs), Common Dendritic cell Progenitors (CDPs), committed dendritic cell precursors (pre-DCs), and Ly6Chi monocytes from mouse bone marrow

DESIGN
Four samples (MDPs, CDPs, pre-DCs, and monocytes) were collected in triplicate
