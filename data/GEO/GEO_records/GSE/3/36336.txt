TITLE
Expression data from kidneys of diabetic WT and T3-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation of A Disintegrin and A Metalloprotease Domain17 (ADAM17) is involved in nephropathy, but the role of this metalloprotease and its inhibitor TIMP3 in diabetic kidney disease is unclear. We used microarray profiling to find genes differentially expressed in the 2 genotypes which could explain the more severe diabetic kidney disease features observed in T3-/- mice compared to the WT littermates.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 WT and 3 Timp3-/- diabetic kidneys
