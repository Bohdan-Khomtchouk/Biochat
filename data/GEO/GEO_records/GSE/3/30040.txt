TITLE
Expression data from feline liver tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study looks at the effect of dietary manipulation on the development of hepatic steatosis and changes in hepatic gene expression in a feline model. We used microarray analysis to examine changes in hepatic gene transcription in response to Trans fat, High Fructose Corn Syrup  (HFCS) and/or Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) in the domestic cat. The use of human Affymetrix arrays for the study of feline gene expression has previously been validated by Dowling and Bienzle, 2005, Journal of  General  Virology. 86(Pt 8), 2239-48 (PMID 16033971).
