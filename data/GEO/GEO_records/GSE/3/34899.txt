TITLE
Autotoxicity mechanism of Oryza Sativa: Microarray analysis of rice plants in response to allelochemical ferulic acid

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Autotoxicity plays an important mechanism in regulating plant productivity. Ferulic acid (FA) is phytotoxic and was identified in extracts and residues of rice plants as a candidate for rice allelochemicals. To help characterize the autotoxicity mechanism of rice, we present the first large-scale, transcriptomic analysis of rice root responses to ferulic acid.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, short exposures and long exposures. Comparison of mock control and rice seedlings treated with 50 ppm ferulic acid (FA) during short (pooled from 1- and 3-h treatments), as compared to long (24 h) exposures.; Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (short and long exposures), 3 FA-treated replicates (short and long exposures).
