TITLE
Muscleblind-Like 2 Mediated Alternative Splicing in the Developing Brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have characterized the MBNL2-dependent changes in expression and alternative splicing by comparing hippocampi from MBNL2 deltaE2/deltaE2 and WT mouse brains.

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed: brains from 3 WT and 3 MBNL2 deltaE2/deltaE2 female mice, all 2-3 months of age.
