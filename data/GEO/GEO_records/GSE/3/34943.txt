TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of immediate early events in mRNA-mediated cellular reprogramming of human foreskin fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (HFF1 and BJ) were lipofected with an equal mixture of human reprogramming factor-encoding mRNAs. The cells were lysed and total RNA was harvested 24 hours post-transfection. Gene regulation was evaluated with respect to corresponding mock-transfected, Lipofectamine-treated control fibroblasts. For comparison, wildtype (un-treated) HFF1 and BJ fibroblasts as well as undifferentiated HFF1- and BJ-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and human embryonic stem cells (generated and maintained in our laboratory (refer to GSE26575) were included in the analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from untreated human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, reprogramming factor- and mock(Lipofectamine-treated)-transfected human neonatal fibroblasts, undifferentiated hESCs and iPSCs (derived from human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts).
