Differential Expression of microRNAs following activated protein C treatment in a rat model of septic shock

SUMMARY
Sepsis induces systemic stress by augmenting inflammatory and pro-coagulant responses resulting in microvascular dysfunction and end organ failure, events modulated by the Protein C pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene transcription yet their role in sepsis remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that aPC selectively alters the expression of specific miRNAs implicated in protection of hepatic function during septic shock. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty-four later, animals were randomized and treated with aPC (1mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% (w/v) saline) via an indwelling venous catheter at 12 hour intervals for 24 hours. Gene array was performed on hepatic RNA to determine miRNA expression, and predicted mRNA targets determined using a bioinformatics approach. Of 351 rat miRNAs examined by microarray hybridization, 17 were highly expressed during sepsis and restored to basal levels after aPC treatment. In silico analysis identified 9 miRNAs significantly regulating target genes of the focal adhesion pathway. These data suggest aPC treatment coordinates beneficial cytoprotective effects during sepsis by modulating miRNA expression. While translational effects remain to be fully elucidated in a clinical setting, we demonstrate herein the potential experimental and computational benefits for use of microRNA analysis in sepsis.
