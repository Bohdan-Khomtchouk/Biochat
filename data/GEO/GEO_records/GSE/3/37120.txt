ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma stem-like cells or their differentiated progeny were co-cultured for 48h with normal human astrocytes to detect if invasion associated genes were influenced

DESIGN
Co-cultured samples and controls, a total 24 samples were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
