TITLE
Temporal expression profile of CHRF-288 cell line after phorbol ester stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of phorbol-ester-induced Mk differentiation of the megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 (CHRF) cell line â€“ a model system for investigating megakaryopoiesis.  The goals of this study were to (1) verify the megakaryocytic nature of the CHRF cell line at the transcriptional level, and (2) extract novel insights into the key facets of Mk maturation including polyploidization, proplatelet formation, and apoptosis. Keywords: time course
