TITLE
Murine CD8+ T cells: in vitro-derived vs. thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse in-vitro derived CD8+ cells (obtained after culturing BM-HSCs isolated from B6 mice) with OP9-DL1 cells for 35 days were compared to CD8+ thymocytes isolated from 4-5 weeks old B6 mice.  Our goal was to determine similarities and differences in gene expression profile between in vitro-derived CD8+ cells and CD8+ cells isolated from the thymus. The procedure of in vitro differentiation of HSC using OP9-DL1 cocultures was previously described by: Schmitt, T. M., and J. C. Zuniga-Pflucker. 2002.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 2 different samples of in vitro-derived CD8+ T cells from day 35  were compared to 2 different samples of thymic CD8+ cells.
