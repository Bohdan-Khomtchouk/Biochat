TITLE
Transcriptome response to nitrosative stress in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis was employed to investigate the transcriptome response to nitrosative stress in a non-denitrifying facultative photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1. We focused on the role played by a nitric oxide-response transcriptional regulator NnrR in the response. The transcriptome profiles of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and its nnrR mutant before and after exposure to nitrosating agents S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) under semiaerobic conditions were analyzed.

DESIGN
R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and its nnrR mutant were cultivated in glass bottles under semiaerobic growth conditions. When the optical density at 600 nm reached approximately 0.15-0.2, 1 mM GSNO or SNP was added to the medium. RNA was isolated from a 50 ml aliquot of the culture prior to the addition of GSNO or SNP and at 15 min after the addition. The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
