SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq profiles of MSL1, MSL2, MSl3, MOF, MLE, H4K16ac and RNA Polymerase II phosphorlyated on Serine 5 in Drosophila S2 cells

DESIGN
MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, MLE, H4K16ac and RNA Polymerase II phosphorlyated on Serine 5 ChIP in Drosophila S2 cells. 1-3 biological replicates per experiment. Performed in single-read and paired-end read mode.
