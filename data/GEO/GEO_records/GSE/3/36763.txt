TITLE
Identification of NLP7 direct targets using ChIP-chip in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed in nlp7-1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings complemented by a pNLP7::NLP7-GFP construct upon 10 minutes NO3- resupply after a 3-day NO3- starvation.

DESIGN
Genome-wide profiling of NLP7 binding regions by ChIP-chip, 2 biological replicates in dye-swap
