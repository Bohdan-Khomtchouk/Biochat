TITLE
Global gene expression changes between PTIP KO and control PerC B-1a cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B cel receptor (BCR) signaling and downstream NF-kB activity are crucial for the generation and activation of innate-like B-1 and conventional B-2 B cells, yet the molecular requirements for these signaling pathways are not fully understood. We used microarray analysis to detail the global gene expression differences underlying the developmental phenotype of B-1a cells associated with defciency in the PTIP chromatin regulator protein.

DESIGN
B-1a cells were FACS sorted from 5-week-old CD19cre/+PTIPflox/flox mutant and CD19cre/+PTIP+/+ control mice.  After total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) and assessing RNA quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer with RIN numbers > 8, gene expression profiling was performed using 22 control and 29 mutant mice divided into 4 unique biological replicate samples for each genotype.
