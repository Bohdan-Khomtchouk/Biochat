TITLE
The genomic and transcriptomic dynamics of treatment-naïve epithelial ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reveal three-dimensional patterns of tumour growth by exploiting the unique metastasizing patterns of treatment naïve stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian cancer. We performed topographic mapping of structural genomic rearrangements, coding mutations, copy number changes and RNA expression in biopsies derived from 27 primary and metastatic sites across three patients. Based on somatic genomic changes, we performed sample clustering and obtained unique insight in natural tumour growth and spread. Based on extensive multi-level profiling, our data highlight the diverse modes of epithelial ovarian cancer development before applying selective pressure from therapy.

DESIGN
We performed SNP array analysis on tumor biopsies from 3 patients (P1, P2, P3) with advanced stage ovarian cancer. This submission includes SNP data for 26 tumor biopsies and 5 normal tissue samples.
