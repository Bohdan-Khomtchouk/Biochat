TITLE
Gene expression in Listeria- or vaccine-elicited T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B6 mice were immunized with either 2000 cfu  of ova expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LM-ova) or 100ug whle ovalbumin adjuvanted with 50ug polyIC + 50ug anti-CD40 (FGK45).  7 days later, tetramer staining CD8+ T cells from the spleen were flow sorted to purity (~98%), the RNA isolated, reverse transcribed and the resulting cDNA analyzed by gene array MoGene-1_0-st-v1 gene expression determined in naïve (CD44lo) and day 7 post Listeria chalelneg  or combined adjuvant vaccine immunization (internally referred to as " synergy " ).

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of CD44lo T cells (naïve), d7 tetramer staining CD8+ T cells from Listeria-treated or vaccine-treated B6 mice.
