TITLE
Learned Helplessness Regulates Synapse Related LncRNAs in Mouse Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goal of this study is to find learned helplessness/depression regulates synapse related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mouse hippocampus Methods: compared the differential expression of mRNA and lncRNAs in learned helplessness (LH) group, nonlearned helplessness (NLH) group and Ctrl group, using GO analysis, pathway enrichment and co-expression Results: We found that 2163 or 1396 mRNA are different expressed in LH compared with Control or NLH group, 199 or 142 lncRNAs are different expressed in LH compared with Control or NLH group, respectivly. Then we applied complex bioinfomatics analysis to do lncRNAs functional analysis, finding dendritic spine morphogenesis, chemical synaptic transmission and synaptic potential signaling pathway are common between LH group compared with Ctrl group and LH group compared with NLH group. Further more we found that the identified lncRNAs are mediating several cellular functions such as: protein transport, ion transport, mRNA processing, regulation of dendritic spine development, regulation of neuron projection development and regulation of GTPase activity. Interestingly, there was strong regulation of lncRNAs related to synapse. Conclusions: Our study is the first attempt to explore the possibility that lncRNAs might be involved in helplessness using RNA sequencing. And we found some lncRNAs have strong functions in synapse regulation.

DESIGN
Hippocampus mRNA and lncRNAs profiles of LH/Ctrl and LH/NLH group mice were generated by RNA-Seq.
