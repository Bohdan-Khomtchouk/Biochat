TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of transcription activator-like effector nucleases-induced XY dmy- sex reversal female medaka (Oryzias latipes)

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
We assembled transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) targeting the DMY gene and generated XYdmy- mutants to investigate gonadal dysgenesis in medaka. RNA-seq generated 157 million raw reads from WT male (WT_M_TE), WT female (WT_F_OV) and XYdmy- female medaka (TA_F_OV) gonad libraries. Differential expression analysis identified 144 up- and 293 downregulated genes in TA_F_OV compared to WT_F_OV, 387 up- and 338 downregulated genes in TA_F_OV compared to WT_M_TE.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 90-day old wild type (WT) and TALENs induced XY dmy- sex reversal female (TA) medaka were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeqTM 2000.
