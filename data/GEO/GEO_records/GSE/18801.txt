TITLE
Transcriptional profile of isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy and comparison to exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analyses on RNA from mice with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy and mice with exercise-induced physiological hypertrophy and identified 865 and 2,534 genes that were significantly altered in pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy models, respectively.

DESIGN
Three different sets of mouse hearts were compared: Sedentary mice, mice that were exercised (swimming) for 3 months, and mice that were given isoproterenol via a surgically implanted pump. Each experiment was performed in triplicate - one heart per array. This resulted in a total of 9 arrays.
