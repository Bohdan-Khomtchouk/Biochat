TITLE
Requirement for flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to maintain genomic stability and transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
As a central component during Okazaki fragment maturation, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) removes the 5â€™ flap and maintains genomic stability. Here, FEN1 was cloned as a suppressor of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) from a forward genetic screen. FEN1 is abundant in the root and shoot apical meristems and FEN1-GFP shows a nucleolus-localized signal in tobacco cells. Arabidopsis fen1-1 mutant is hypersensitive to MMS and shows reduced telomere length. Interestingly, genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq results demonstrate that FEN1 mutation leads to a decrease in the H3K27me3 level and an increase in the expression of a subset of genes marked with H3K27me3. Overall, these results uncover a role for FEN1 in mediating TGS besides maintaining genome stability in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
To characterized the role of FEN1 in epigenetic silencing, we examine histone modification and RNA expression changes by whole-genome RNA sequencing; H3K27me3-, H3K4me3-, H3K9me2-, H3-ChIP-seq in A. thaliana transgenic wild type (TWT) and fen1 mutant
