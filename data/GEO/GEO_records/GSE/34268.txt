TITLE
Expression data from normal and MDS erythroids cell cutlures ex vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34 positive cells of bone marrow samples from normal and MDS samples were cultured ex vivo into erythroid conditions. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression programm of erythroid cells between normal and pathological (MDS) samples

DESIGN
Mononuclear cells from bone marrow samples were selected on the expression of the CD34 membran marker. Then, they were cultured ex vivo during 14 days and total RNA samples were analyzed at day 7, 10 and/or 14 then compared between normal and MDS samples.
