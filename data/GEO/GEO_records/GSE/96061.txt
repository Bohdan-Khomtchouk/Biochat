TITLE
The Quantitative Analysis of Transcriptomes Derived From Ezh2- or Ezh1/2-Deleted Leukemia Stem Cells of Murine Acute Myloid Leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report dual genetic delstion of Ezh1/2 in murine AML model induced cell cyle progression of quiescent LSCs and cell differentiation of LSCs. To investigate the underlying mechanism by which Ezh1/2 regulate quiescent LSCs and maintein the stemness of LSCs, we performed RNA sequencing of L-GMPs derived from Ezh2- and Ezh1/2-deleted  AML mice.

DESIGN
Examination and comprison of transcriptomes from c-kit+ AML cells with 4 types of genetic backgraound; Ezh1 +/+ Ezh2 flox/flox, Ezh1+/+ Ezh2 Δ/Δ, Ezh1 -/- Ezh2 flox/flox and Ezh1-/- Ezh2 Δ/Δ.
