TITLE
Microarray Analysis in Vestibular Schwannomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vestibular Schwannomas are benign neoplasms that arise from the vestibular nerve. The hallmark of these tumors is the biallelic inactivation of NF2. Transcriptomic alterations, such as the Nrg1/ErbB2 pathway, have been described in Schwannomas. Here, we have performed a whole transcriptomic analysis in 31 vestibular Schwannomas and 9 control nerves in the Affymetrix Gene 1.0ST platform, validated by quantitative Real-Time PCR using TaqMan Low Density Arrays. We performed a mutational analysis of NF2 by PCR/dHPLC and MLPA as well as a microsatellite marker analysis of the loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 22q. The microarray analysis showed that 1516 genes were deregulated, and 48 of the genes were validated by qRT-PCR. At least two genetic hits (allelic loss and/or gene mutation) in NF2 were found in 16 tumors, seven cases showed one hit and eight tumors showed no NF2 alteration. As conclusion, MET and associated genes such as ITGA4/B6, PLEXNB3/SEMA5 and CAV1 showed a clear deregulation in vestibular Schwannomas. In addition, androgen receptor (AR) downregulation may denote a hormonal effect or cause in this tumor. Furthermore, the osteopontin gene (SPP1), which is involved in Merlin protein degradation, was upregulated, which suggests that this mechanism may also exert a pivotal role in Schwannoma Merlin depletion. Finally, no major differences were found between tumors of different sizes, histological types or NF2 status, which suggests that at the mRNA level all Schwannomas, regardless of molecular and clinical characteristics, may share common features that can be used in the fight against them.

DESIGN
In order to find target to fight against vestibular schwannoma, we performed an analysis of gene expression by microarrays.
