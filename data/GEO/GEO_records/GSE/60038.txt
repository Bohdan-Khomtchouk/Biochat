TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of high glucose and DZNep (EZH2 inhibitor) induced gene expression by mouse podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of DZNep-induced gene expression changes in cultured podocytes. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that DZnep ultimately augments Txnip expression, increasing oxidative stress in podocytes. These results provide important information on the response of podocytes to histone methyltransferase inhibition and a possible mechanism for DZNep action in podocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured podocytes subjected to 48 hours in vitro, with or without DZNep.
