TITLE
microRNA expression profile of wogonin treatment in HNSCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs induced by wogonin treatment, human head and neck squamos cell carcinoma cell lines were subjected to miRCURY LNA microRNA Array.

DESIGN
FaDu and SAS cell lines were treated with 10 ug/ml wogonin or DMSO for 72h and total RNAs were extracted. Defferentially expressed microRNAs were analyzed by miRCURY LNA microRNA Array.

PLATFORM
GPL17728 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 7th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (miRBase 19.0)
