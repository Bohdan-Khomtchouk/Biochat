Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in metastatic foci of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. We identified metastasis-related miRNAs in recurrent cases after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of primary HCC (T), noncancerous liver (N), and resected recurrent (metastatic) HCC (M) using microarray analyses to identify metastasis-related miRNAs in in three patients with post-transplant recurrence. The RNA samples from three cases that underwent resection of recurrences after LDLT were made available for miRNA microarray analysis. The three cases included a 57-year-old man (case 1) with peritoneal recurrence and infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV), and a 48-year-old woman (case 2) and a 51-year-old man (case 3) with lung recurrences and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Microarray analysis was performed for each RNA sample from the (T), (N) in the explanted liver, and (M). A sample containing equal amounts of RNAs from histologically normal livers of three living donors (NL: normal liver) was analyzed as a control.
