TITLE
A splicing-dependent transcriptional checkpoint associated with pre-spliceosome formation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
There is good evidence for functional interactions between splicing and transcription in eukaryotes, but how and why these processes are coupled remain unknown. Prp5 is an RNA-stimulated ATPase required for pre-spliceosome formation in yeast. We demonstrate through in vivo RNA labelling that, in addition to a splicing defect, the prp5-1 mutation causes a defect in the transcription of intron-containing genes. We present chromatin immunoprecipitation evidence for a transcriptional elongation defect in which RNA polymerase that is phosphorylated at serine 5 of the largest subunitâ€™s heptad repeat accumulates over introns, and that this defect requires the U2 snRNP-associated Cus2p. A similar accumulation of polymerase was observed when pre-spliceosome formation was blocked by a mutation in U2 snRNA. These results indicate the existence of a transcriptional elongation checkpoint that is associated with pre-spliceosome formation during co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly. We propose a role for Cus2p as a potential checkpoint factor in transcription.
