TITLE
Gene expression-based, individualized outcome prediction for RUNX1T1 Knock-down treated ECFCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of RUNX1T1 mediated.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the ECFCs from cord blood treated RUNX1T1 knock-down or shRNA and analyzed by microarray.
