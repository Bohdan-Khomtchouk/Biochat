TITLE
Immune Response to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in the mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to examine the innate immune response to helminth infection in the lung. Hookworms (like many other helminths) use an obligate migration pathway through the lung. Their infection has been characterized in the gut in detail, but early immune responses in the lung have not been fully characterized. Keywords: Time Course

DESIGN
SCID mice were used to examine the innate immune response. SCID mice have no functional B or T cells but a fully functional innate immune system. SCID and WT mice were infected with 500 L3 stage infectious Nippostrongylus brasiliensis SC and their lungs were removed at days 2,3,4,8 and 12 post infection.
