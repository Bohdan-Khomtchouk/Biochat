TITLE
Gene expression in adipose, liver and skeletal muscle of mice fed a diet with c9, t11 conjugated linoleic acid enriched beef

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a collective term for the positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid. In recent years CLA has been reported to have anti-carcinogenic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and anti-artherogenic effects.  The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a natural high-CLA enriched beef source on three primary insulin responsive tissues: adipose, liver and skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
ob/ob mice were assigned to one of two diets: a control beef diet, low in c9, t11-CLA (control diet) or a c9, t11-CLA enriched beef diet. After a 28 day feeding trial, RNA was extracted from adipose, liver and skeletal muscle tissue and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
