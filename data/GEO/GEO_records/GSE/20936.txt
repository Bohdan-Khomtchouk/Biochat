TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of normal and Ino-RNA treated cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During virus infections, host machinery is mobilized to defend against the invading pathogen. The recognition of a viral infection is accomplished by interaction of viral components with host cells. Viral proteins and double-stranded RNA have been previously reported to be potent activator of host cells. We have identified that recognition of virus infections by host cells is the presence of inosines in RNA, which is rare under normal growing conditions but is significantly increased during virus infections. This recognition leads to a robust activation of innate immune responses both in vitro in human epithelial cell cultures and in vivo in a mouse model. This study uncovers a novel structure for activation of innate immune responses during virus infections.

DESIGN
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with 20 ug/ml of normal or Ino-RNA (10% inosines). After 2 hr, total cellular RNA was isolated and used in global transciptomic analysis. All experiments were done in triplicate. Genes that were highly induced by Ino-RNA were selected and categorized into genes of anti viral responses, innate and adaptive immunity, and cell signaling.
