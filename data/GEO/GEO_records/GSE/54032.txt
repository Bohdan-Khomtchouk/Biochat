TITLE
Transcriptional response to 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) in Pseduomonas aeruginosa PAO1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of extracelluar 2-oxoglutarate at a concentration of 20 mM. We determined the transcriptional response of  P. aeruignosa PAO1 to extracellular 2-oxoglutarate.

DESIGN
P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in nutrient broth (Oxoid number 2) and induced with 20 mM 2-oxoglutarate.  At 30 min post induction, total RNA was isolated and prepped for Affymetrix GeneChips.

PLATFORM
