TITLE
Time course gene expression of HUVEC after TNF-alpha treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The many steps involved in the production of a mature mammalian mRNA are extensively coupled, and levels of both precursors and products can be measured using expression and genomic tiling microarrays.  Different probes in these arrays targeting the same transcript often give different signals; then, precursor (nascent) RNA – which is present transiently at low concentrations – is difficult to detect. Keywords: TNFa stimulation time course of HUVEC

DESIGN
Using tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) to switch on transcription of selected human genes rapidly and synchronously, we apply samples collected every 15 min to arrays
