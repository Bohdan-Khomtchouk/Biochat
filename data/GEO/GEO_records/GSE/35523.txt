TITLE
Array CGH from mouse SFME cells and SFME cells differentiated with TGFB and FCS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SFME cells (ATCC)  were grown as spheres or differentiated with TGFß for 24 h or 10%FCS for 12 h. ArrayCGH experiments were performed on all three samples.

DESIGN
ArrayCGH from SFME sphere cells, 24h differentiated SFME cells in the presence of TGFß and 12h differentiated SFME cells in the presence of 10% FCS
