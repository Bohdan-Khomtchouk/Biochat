TITLE
Patterns of transcriptional response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and bacterial lipopolysaccharide in primary human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examines patterns of genome-wide transcriptional response to the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to better understand pathways underlying the immunomodulatory role of 1,25D.

DESIGN
Total RNA extraced from monocytes from 20 healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS for 24 hours.

PLATFORM
