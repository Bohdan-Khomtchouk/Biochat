TITLE
Semiconductor based DNA sequencing of histone modification states

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The recent development of a semiconductor-based, non-optical DNA sequencing technology promises scalable, low-cost and rapid sequence data production. The technology has previously been applied mainly to genomic sequencing and targeted re-sequencing. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Ion Torrent semiconductor-based sequencing for sensitive, efficient and rapid chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) through the application of sample preparation methods that are optimized for ChIP-seq on the Ion Torrent platform. We leverage this method for epigenetic profiling of tumor tissues.

DESIGN
Examination of histone modifications in mouse dendentic cells stimulated with LPS, matched melanoma derived cell line, melanoma tumor tissue

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus) GPL16331 Ion Torrent PGM (Mus musculus) GPL17301 Ion Torrent PGM (Homo sapiens)
