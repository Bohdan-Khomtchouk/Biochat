TITLE
Grape skin transcriptome in the berries grown on the vine treated with exogenous abscisic acid

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The experiment was conducted using grapevines of Cabernet Sauvignon grown in a field. At veraison, the clusters in the vines were sprayed with a 400 mgl-1(+)-abscisic acid (ABA) solution. The ABA treated berries and non-treated berries (control) were harvested at 14 and 28 days after veraison and peeled. PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Kazuya Koyama.  The equivalent experiment is VV16 at PLEXdb.
