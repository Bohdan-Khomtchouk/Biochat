TITLE
Global expression profiling of peripheral Qa-1 class Ib-restricted CD8aa+TCRab+ regulatory T Cells reveals innate-like features: implications for immune regulatory repertoire

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the function of CD8aa Tregs, we have recently characterized several CD8aa+TCRab+ T cell clones and lines that are physiologically primed and are involved in recovery and protection from EAE (REF). In this report, we present a comparison of global gene expression patterns in CD8aa Tregs versus OT-1 CD8aa+TCRab+ T cells. The results of microarray data analysis are confirmed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry for better accuracy and phenotype expression. Our study reveals a unique gene signature in the CD8aa Tregs, including enhanced expression of several inhibitory molecules associated with the maintenance of peripheral T cell homeostasis. The identification of differentially expressed molecules by CD8aa Tregs should facilitate future functional studies in this area.
