TITLE
Molecular signature in human cumulus cells related to embryonic developmental potential

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study was to investigate gene expression profiles of human Cumulus cells isolated from oocytes at metaphase II  stage, under controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle and to evaluate the relationship of embryo quality with molecular signatures in Cumulus cells. This study has been performed by microarray analysis in order to identify potential biomarkers related to oocyte developmental potential. For each patient, the CCs were classified into two groups (good quality embryo group and bad quality embryo group) and pooled. From the total of 14 samples, total RNA was purified. After removal of rRNA, each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA along the entire length of the transcripts without 3â€™ bias utilizing a random priming method. The amplified and labelled cRNA were pooled as good quality and bad quality group followed by hybridization, scanning and data analysis.Three independent repetitions were carried out, thus a total of 6 chips were employed in this study.

DESIGN
the objective of the present study was to investigate gene expression profiles of human CCs isolated from oocytes at metaphase II  stage, under controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle and to evaluate the relation of following embryo quality to molecular signatures in CCs.
