TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Lysinibacillus varians reveal the genetic foundation of its cell cycle

ORGANISM
Lysinibacillus varians

SUMMARY
Lysinibacillus varians GY32 was isolated from river sediment of electronic waste recycling site. Its invariably filament-to-rod cell cycle represents a novel bacteria morphogenesis that is crucial in understanding cell division coordination with lifecycle and environmental bacteria adaptation. A description of genes and biological processes involved in the special filament-to-rod cell cycle of L. varians GY32 is within reach.

DESIGN
As a representative of filament cell and rod cell, 5 h and 10 h culture of strain GY32 were used to transcriptome sequencing
