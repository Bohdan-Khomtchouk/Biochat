TITLE
Expression of mutant p53 in Mammary carcinomas in WAP-SV40 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon induction, WAP-T mice express two synergistically acting SV40 early region encoded proteins, large (LT) and small (sT) tumor antigens in the mammary epithelium, recapitulating thereby the loss of p53 and Rb function and deregulation of PP2A-controlled mitogenic pathways in human breast cancer. In primiparous mice, WAP-promoter driven expression of SV40 proteins induces well and poorly differentiated (respectively low- and high-grade) mammary adenocarcinomas. We here studied the postulated mutant p53 (mutp53) 'gain of function' during mammary tumor development, progression and metastasis by crossing WAP-T mice with mutant p53 transgenic WAP-mutp53 mice.

DESIGN
This study includes gene expression analysis of 12 high grade mammary carcinoma samples. An alternative probe set mapping published by the AffyProbeMiner project (remapped transcript consistent cdf-file) was used to calculate probe set signals of 6 mono-trangenic WAP-T-NP8 samples from the dataset GSE29117 and 6 bi-transgenic WAP-T-NP8 x WAP-W10 (mutp53R245R) samples.
