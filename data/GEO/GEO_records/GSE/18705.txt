TITLE
Transcriptional response of trematode-infected Biomphalaria glabrata during development of S. mansoni and E. paraensei

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Time series analysis of the transcriptional responses of Biomphalaria glabrata throughout the course of intramolluscan development of Schistosoma mansoni and Echinostoma paraensei. Time series transcriptional profiling of Biompharlia glabrata comparing control uninfected M line B.glabrata with trematdoe infected groups.  The experimental groups are: Echinostoma paraensei infected and Schistoma mansoni infected at 12 hours(0.5day), 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, 16 days adn 32 days post infection.

DESIGN
Samples: control and two trematode infected B.glabrata in a time series: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 days post exposure were analyzed in triplicate Stress and immune response
