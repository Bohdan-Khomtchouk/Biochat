TITLE
Protoarray based identificatoin of dysregulated proteins in metastatic osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our results successfully showed through profiling of 8268 proteins that five autoantibodies in the metastatic group showed significantly higher intensities than non-metastatic and control groups Healthy or non-cancerous pediatric patients were pooled into a control group; Human ProtoArray that contains total 19200 protein spots of which 1326 are control spots and  8,268 are unique human proteins

DESIGN
In the study presented here we pooled plasma samples from Osteosarcoma patients who developed metastasis and localized disease within the first year of follow-up into a metastatic group and a non-metastatic group respectively and were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8268 proteins leading to successful identification of 5 proteins.
