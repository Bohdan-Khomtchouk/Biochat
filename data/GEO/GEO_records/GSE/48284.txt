TITLE
Gene expression of SKOV3 cells after no treatment or treatment with 50 microM peracetylated GlcNAc or peracetylated 4-deoxy-GlcNAc for three days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heparan sulfate (HS), a long linear polysaccharide, is implicated in various steps of tumorigenesis, including angiogenesis. We successfully interfered with HS biosynthesis using a peracetylated 4-deoxy analog of the HS constituent GlcNAc and studied the compound’s metabolic fate and its effect on angiogenesis. The 4-deoxy analog was activated intracellularly into UDP-4-deoxy-GlcNAc and HS expression was inhibited up to ~96% (IC50 = 16 µM). HS chain size was reduced, without detectable incorporation of the 4-deoxy analog, likely due to reduced levels of UDP-GlcNAc and/or inhibition of glycosyltransferase activity. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed reduced expression of genes regulated by HS binding growth factors as FGF-2 and VEGF. Cellular binding and signaling of these angiogenic factors was inhibited. Micro-injection in zebrafish embryos strongly reduced HS biosynthesis, and angiogenesis was inhibited in both zebrafish and chicken model systems. All these data identify 4-deoxy-GlcNAc as a potent inhibitor of HS synthesis which hampers pro-angiogenic signaling and neo-vessel formation.

DESIGN
9 samples were analyzed: 3 biological replicates from untreated SKOV3 cells, 3 biological replicates from SKOV3 cells treated with peracetylated GlcNAc, 3 biological replicates from SKOV3 cells treated with peracetylated 4-deoxy-GlcNAc
