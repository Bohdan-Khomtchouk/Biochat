TITLE
Identification of quiescence and early activation histones modifications pattern in satellite cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that the current stem cell isolation procedures induce important transcriptional and epigenetic modifications. Focusing on adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), here we report the epigenome (Histone 3 modifications by ChIP-sequencing) of true quiescent MuSCs and compare it to early-activated MuSCs isolated by the conventional method.

DESIGN
Histone 3 modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) ChIP-seq analysis of muscle stem cells that were either fixed in situ (T0) or isolated with the traditional dissociation protocol (T3).

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
