TITLE
microRNA binding by wildtype Ago2 and mutant Ago2 in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ago2 binds mature microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate gene expression.  A mutant Ago2 is constructed to render it unable to bind miRNAs and inhibit mRNA translation.

DESIGN
Human 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid that encoded a FLAG-tagged wildtype human Ago2 or mutant Ago2.  FLAG IP was preformed, and assoicated RNA was isolated and subjected miRNA microarray analysis.
