TITLE
Gene-level expression data from Oryza sativa.indica (mock-treated or blast pathogen treated resistant rice line and susceptible rice line )

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from untreated and blast pathogen treated rice seedlings using a variety of blast resistant rice line H4, as well as the susceptible rice line Zhonger-Ruanzhan. These data are used to obtain 4087 genes that are differentially expressed in response to blast pathogen in both of rice lines,as well as 717 genes that are differentially expressed between different lines both in the moch-treated and the blast treated. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in leaf from blast resistant rice line and susceptible rice line

DESIGN
Four total samples were analyzed, The untreated rice line Zhonger-Ruanzhan: Zhonger-0;the untreated rice line H4:H4-0;Zhonger-Ruanzhan inoclutated with blast pathogen after 24h:Zhonger-24;H4 inoculated with blast pathogen after 24h: H4-24. We generated the following pairwise comparisons : H4-0 VS H4-24; Zhonger-0 vs Zhonger-24; H4-0 vs H4-0; Zhonger-24 vs H4-24.
