TITLE
RP58 controls neuron and astrocyte differentiation by downregulating the expression of Id1-4 genes in the developing cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Appropriate number of neurons and glial cells is generated from neural stem cells (NSCs) by the regulation of cell cycle exit and subsequent differentiation. Although the regulatory mechanism remains obscure, Id (inhibitor of differentiation) proteins are known to contribute critically to NSC proliferation by controlling cell cycle. Here we report that a transcriptional factor, RP58, negatively regulates all 4 Id genes (Id1-Id4) in developing cerebral cortex. Consistently, Rp58 knockout (KO) mice demonstrated enhanced astrogenesis accompanied with an excess of NSCs. These phenotypes were mimicked by the overexpression of all Id genes in wild-type cortical progenitors. Furthermore, Rp58 KO phenotypes were rescued by the knockdown of all Id genes in mutant cortical progenitors but not by the knockdown of each single Id gene. Finally, we determined p57 as an effector gene of RP58-Id-mediated cell fate control. These findings establish RP58 as a novel key regulator that controls the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs and restriction of astrogenesis by repressing all Id genes during corticogenesis.

DESIGN
Sample RNAs were obtained from E16.5 Rp58 KO mouse cerebral cortex or control cortex. Two independent total RNA samples from each mouse strain were mixed and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed using Panorama Micro Array gene expression chips, each containing approx 22000 probe sets (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
