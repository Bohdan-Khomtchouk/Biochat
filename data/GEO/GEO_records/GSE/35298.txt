TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures in methylotrophic grown Bacillus methanolicus

ORGANISM
Bacillus methanolicus

SUMMARY
A total gene expression approach was applied to study the methylotrophic nature of B. methanolicus by comparing the gene expression in bacteria grown methylotropic compared to non-methylotrophic. Genes of interest with different gene expression were quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the results found in the microarray experiment. Genes of special interest that are expressed higher when grown methylotrophic, were the RuMP pathway genes located on the pBM19.

DESIGN
Bacillus methanolicus was grown in minimal media with either methanol or mannitol as carbon source. The experiment was preformed in triplicate, with bacterial cultures grown on 3 different days.
