TITLE
TCL001: Calu-3 cells treated with either IFN alpha or gamma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to compare transcriptomics of Calu-3 cells treated with either INF alpha or gamma.

DESIGN
Calu-3 cells were treated with 1000 Units/ml of INFa (Sigma I4276) or 500 Units/ml of IFN Î³ (Sigma I3265). Cells were collected for RNA isolation at 0, 3, 6, and 18 or 22 h post treatment.  Each treated sample was done in triplicate. (Triplicates are defined as 3 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates.)There are triplicate time-matched mock for each time point from the same cell stock as rest of samples.
