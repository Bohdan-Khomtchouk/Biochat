TITLE
Small RNA from S2 cell infected with FHV deltaB2 particle

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
S2 cells were infected with FHV deltaB2 particle and the S2 cells were harvested to isolate total RNA at 96 hpi. Small RNAs were separated on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. Ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH. Note: The base quality (.qual) file corresponding to the fasta format (.fna) file linked to Sample GSM306489 is unavailable.
