TITLE
Expression data from LRK1 060615 transgenic rice and control 9311

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Plant height is a critical constituent of plant architecture. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants have the potential to undergo rapid internodal elongation, which determines plant height. A number of physiological studies have proved that gibberellin is involved in internode elongation. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are the largest subfamily of transmembrane receptor-like kinases in plants. Plant LRR-RLKs play important functions in mediating a variety of cellular processes and regulating responses to environmental signals. LRK1, a PSK receptor homolog, is a member of the LRR-RLK family. In the present study, differences in ectopic expression of LRK1 were consistent with extent of rice internode elongation. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin responsiveness during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene, ent-KAURENE OXIDASE (OsKO2).

DESIGN
Leaf tissues of 6-week-old LRK1 060615 transgenic rice and control 9311 rice (10 plants each) were selected.
