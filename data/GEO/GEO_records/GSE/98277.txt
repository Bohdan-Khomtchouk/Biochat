TITLE
High-Throughput Drug Screening identifies Pazopanib and Clofilium tosylate as effective treatments for malignant rhabdoid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compared gene re-expression of SMARCB1 in I2A SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumor cell line.

DESIGN
[human mRNA] 3 I2A SMARCB1-def cell line samples, 12 I2A SMARCB1-reexpressed cell line samples at 4 different times (3 at day2, 3 at day4, 3 at day7 and 3 at day14 after re-expression of SMARCB1)

PLATFORM
GPL19264 [HuGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.1 ST Array [HuGene21st_Hs_ENTREZG_16.0.0]
