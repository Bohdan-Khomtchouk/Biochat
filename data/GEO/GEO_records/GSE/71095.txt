TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of gene expression in normal and YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 or SRSF10 deficient human HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from and YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 and SRSF10 deficient human HeLa cells using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual. For all samples the RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. All samples showed a RIN (RNA integrity number) of higher than 9. Approximately 2.5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read or paired-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expressive levels in normal and YTHDC1, SRSF1, SRSF3, SRSF7, SRSF9 or SRSF10 deficient Human HeLa cells
