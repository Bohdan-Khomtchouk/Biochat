TITLE
Poplar-Laccaria Mycorrhizal Roots

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of P. tremula x P. alba at three weeks after inoculation with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor.

DESIGN
We performed 6 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Populus tremula x P. alba control roots and mycorrhizal root tips. Samples were taken after 3 weeks of interaction (three biological replicates).  All samples were labeled with Cy3.
