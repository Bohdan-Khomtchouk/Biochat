TITLE
Longitudinal transcriptomic and metabolomic data demonstrate altered lipid metabolism following the onset of hyperglycemia in spontaneously diabetic rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fat metabolism is also peturbed after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Patients have less fat in the liver (4) and increased fasting lipid oxidation (5) compared to controls. Similarly, in a BioBreeding rat model of type 1 diabetes, the diabetes-prone animals develop a reduced respiratory quotient compared to non-diabetic rats before the onset of hyperglycemia, consistent with an increased use of fatty acids relative to carbohydrates as an energy substrate (6). We hypothesized that a lack of insulin reaching the liver contributes to the metabolic shift towards lipid oxidation observed in humans with type 1 diabetes and rodent models of the disease. To test our hypothesis, we measured changes in the hepatic gene expression and serum metabolome of a BioBreeding rat model of type 1 diabetes before and after the onset of hyperglycemia.

DESIGN
In this study, we investigate liver gene expression in BBDR.+/+, BBDR.lyp/lyp rat at day50 (+/-5 days) which are before hyperglycemic, and day55 (+/-5 days) which is short after hyperglycemic. Liver transcriptomes of 50 day old BBDR.lyp/lyp and 55 day old BBDR.+/+ rats were compared to 55 day old BBDR.lyp/lyp rats.
