TITLE
Development of gene expression signature in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strain UCBPP-PA14 without and with LAE treatment

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium capable of forming biofilms on living and non-living surfaces, frequently leading to undesirable consequences. We found that lauroyl arginate ethyl (LAE), a synthetic non-oxidizing biocide, inhibited biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations in both static and flow conditions. To identify the genes targeted by LAE, a global transcriptome analysis was conducted using a gene chip microarray.

DESIGN
Samples for transcriptome analysis consist of non-LAE treated sample and LAE treated sample. Total RNA both samples was extracted from planktonic cells using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. And then, transcriptome analysis was conducted by Agilent's protocol provided by the manufacturer.
