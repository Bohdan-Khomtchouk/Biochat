TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C by interferon administration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We attempt to catalog the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile according to the response of combination therapy in order to predict the outcome of drug-response before administration and clarify the relationship between aberrant expression of miRNAs and chronic liver disease.

DESIGN
We quantified expression profile of 474 mature miRNAs by microarray in the liver biopsy specimen from 105 CH patients without history of anti-viral therapy.
