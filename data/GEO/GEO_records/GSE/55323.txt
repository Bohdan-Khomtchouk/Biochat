TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Profiles of Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is of paramount importance to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling through microarrays is an invaluable tool to identify a miRNA signature, which is required to determine the general and specific expression alterations between distinct types of tissues.

DESIGN
In this study, it is aimed to compare the miRNA profile of recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumor tissues to explore a possible involvement of miRNAs in PCa progression.
