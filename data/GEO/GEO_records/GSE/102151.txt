TITLE
miRNA expression profile of GT1-7 exposed to 500 nM MC-LR for 24 h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using miRNA microarray, we screened 42 up-regulated miRNAs and 59 down-regulated miRNA in MC-LR-treated GT1-7 cells.

DESIGN
In this study, GT1-7 cells were treated with or without 500 nm MC-LR for 24 h. RNA was extracted and miRNA microarray was used to screened the differentially expressed miRNA in GT1-7 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL23854 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 6th generation [miRBase v16, Probe_ID version]
