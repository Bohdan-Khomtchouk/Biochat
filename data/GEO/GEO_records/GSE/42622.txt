TITLE
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Helicobacter pylori stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis and avoids elimination by the immune system of the infected host. The commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to exert beneficial effects as a supplement during H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study, we applied whole genome microarray analysis to compare the immune response induced in murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) stimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or with both bacteria in combination

DESIGN
Microarray expression profiling was performed to analyze stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophages with Helicobacter pylori 251, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM co-stimulated with Helicobacter pylori 251 were analyzed 5 hours after infection.
