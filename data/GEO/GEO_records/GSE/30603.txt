TITLE
[E-MTAB-434] Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of zebra fish tissues and developmental stages

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Sequencing the Zebrafish transcriptome from a range of tissues and developmental stages using the Illumina Genome Analyzer Paired-end sequence data has been generated using polyA selected RNA from a range of zebrafish tissues and developmental stages using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. These data have been used to improve the gene annotation of the zebrafish genome. Study description: Zebrafish total RNA was extracted from embryonic and adult tissue, then polyA selected. After fragmentation and reverse transcription Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared. Paired-end sequence runs were performed with 36, 37, 54 and 76 base reads on the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
