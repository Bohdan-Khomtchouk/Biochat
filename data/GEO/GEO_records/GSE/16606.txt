TITLE
Tumor T9 Sectors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The following CGH experiments were conducted on six sectors (S1-S6) from a single primary ductal carcinoma tumor (T9) using the Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) Approach.  SPP involves macro-dissecting the tumor, flow-sorting nuclei by differences in total genomic DNA content and profiling the genome of the tumor subpopulations.

DESIGN
The genomic DNA from each tumor subpopulation was labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to an 85K Bgl2 ROMA Microarray.  A normal reference male fibroblast was labeled with Cy3 as a control.  Samples were dye-swapped and the experiments were conducted in color-reversal.  The value data repesents a log ratio of the mean of two dye-swapped samples
