TITLE
Expression data from DOX(doxorubicin) -treated wild type or CHIP knockout C57BL/6J mice at day 5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The clinical application of doxorubicin as a broad-spectrum anti-tumor antibiotic is limited greatly by its cardiotoxicity. Various mechanisms have been studied, but little is known about whether genes or pathways relevant with energy metabolism contributes to doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy or not. We used microarrays to detail the global expression profiling of acute cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin in wild type or CHIP knockout C57BL/6J mice and discovered distinct classes of changed genes during this process.

DESIGN
The whole hearts were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays at day 5 after a single intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin at a dose of 15 mg/kg.
