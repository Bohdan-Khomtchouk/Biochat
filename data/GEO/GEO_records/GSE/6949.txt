TITLE
Examination of the function of NtMYBGR1 and NtDC1B in tobacco BY-2 cells.

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Overexpression lines for each of NtMYBGR1 (Genbank accession No. AB279612)  and NtDC1B (Genbank accession No. AB279614) were used to characterize the function of NtMYBGR1 and NtDC1B in tobacco BY-2 cells. We then analyzed the effect of overexpression of these genes on the expression of other genes, using the tobacco microarray. As control sample, tobacco cells transformed with empty vector pMAT137 vector were used. Two control and two transgenic cell lines were analyzed at day 4 after subculture into fresh media. Keywords: Genetic modification
