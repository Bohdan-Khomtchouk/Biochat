TITLE
Transcript analysis of nitrogen response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Understanding gene expression re-programming in response to limiting nitrogen (N) conditions is crucial for ongoing progress towards the development of crop varieties with improved nitrogen use efficiency. We analyzed expression data obtained from leaves and roots of rice plants adapted to sufficient and limiting nitrate as well as after shifting them to low (reduction) and sufficient (induction) nitrate conditions.

DESIGN
Rice plants were grown under sufficient (HN, 3 mM) and limiting (LN, 0.3 mM) nitrate (N) conditions or switched from HN to LN (reduction) or LN to HN (induction). Total RNA was extracted from leaves and roots and used for cDNA synthesis to profile the transcriptome using custom-designed Affimetrix microarrays
