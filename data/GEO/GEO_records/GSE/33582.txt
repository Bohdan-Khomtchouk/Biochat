TITLE
Hen1 analysis in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
small RNA libraries from wild-type and Hen1 mutant testes were made with either polyA tailing (VASAGFPHen1minus/plus) or adapter ligation (Hen1Testis and WTTestis) and sequenced on an Illumina GAII platform.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from total testis tissue of both Hen1 wildtype and Hen1 mutant animals. After size selection from gel, the small RNA libraries wre made.

PLATFORM
GPL9319 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Danio rerio)
