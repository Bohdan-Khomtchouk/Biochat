SUMMARY
Effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be generated by in vitro stimulation of naïve or memory subsets of CD8+ T cells. While the characteristics of CD8+ T cell subsets are well defined, the heritable influence of those populations on their effector cell progeny is not well understood. We studied effector cells generated from naïve or central memory CD8+ T cells and found that they retained distinct gene expression signatures and developmental programs. Effector cells derived from central memory cells tended to retain their CD62L+ phenotype, but also to acquire KLRG1, an indicator of cellular senescence. In contrast, the effector cell progeny of naïve cells displayed reduced terminal differentiation, and, following infusion, they displayed greater expansion, cytokine production, and tumor destruction. These data indicate that effector cells retain a gene expression imprint conferred by their naïve or central memory progenitors, and they suggest a strategy for enhancing cancer immunotherapy.

DESIGN
Effector cells were generated from naive or central memory CD8+ T cells. The cells were then rested (unstimulated) or restimulated (stimulated). This experimental design resulted in 4 groups (Naïve-derived/stimulated, Naïve-derived/unstimulated, Central memory-derived/stimulated, Central memory-derived/unstimulated). Three replicates from independent experiments were analyzed.
