TITLE
Gene expression index for olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis for GEI in olfactory behavior Keywords: whole body, olfactory behavior

DESIGN
Larvae were reared on three different media: standard cornmeal-molasses medium, standard medium supplemented with 9% ethanol  and standard medium enriched with tomato paste. After eclosion, we transferred all flies to standard medium at 25Â°C under a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle prior to characterization of behavioral responses to benzaldehyde and transcription profiling.
