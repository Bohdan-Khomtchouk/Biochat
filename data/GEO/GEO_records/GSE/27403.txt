TITLE
Gallus gallus Control Versus SU5402, LY294002 or U0126 Treated Preingression Epiblast from Gastrula Stage Embryos

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the preingression epiblast versus lateral epiblast, of preingression epiblast from control  embryos treated with the DMSO carrier vehicle (0.5%) versus embryos treated with SU5402, U0126 or LY294002.   Embryos were stages 5-6 at time of tissue isolation.  The preingression epiblast (E2 region) is the region of epiblast just lateral to the primitive streak. Lateral epiblast is the E3 region. Two condition experiment. Samples for each condition isolated from at least 30 embryos.

DESIGN
The experiments used isolated preingression epiblast, which is defined as the region of epiblast adjacent to the primitive streak that will ingress through the primitive streak.  Preingression epiblast was isolated by microdissection using tungsten needles from control embryos or embryos treated with SU5402, U0126 or LY294002.
