TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the cerebellum of daDREAM mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator) is a Ca2+-binding protein that binds DNA and represses transcription in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown a role for DREAM in cerebellar function regulating the expression of the sodium/calcium exchanger3 (NCX3) in cerebellar granules to control Ca2+ homeostasis and survival of these neurons. To achieve a more global view of the genes regulated by DREAM in the cerebellum, we performed a genome-wide analysis in transgenic cerebellum expressing a Ca2+-insensitive/CREB-independent dominant active mutant DREAM (daDREAM). Our results indicate that DREAM is a major transcription factor in the cerebellum that regulates genes important for cerebellar development.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix microarrays (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0) to compare global gene expression in wild type (WT) versus transgenic cerebellum cells. For ech type of sample three hybridizations were carried-out (independent biological replicates).
