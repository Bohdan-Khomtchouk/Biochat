TITLE
The lncRNA LUST promotes CCICs self-renewal stimulating the wnt/b-catenin signaling activation [RIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA-seq experiments in CD24bright/CD44bright (CCICs), CD24dim/CD44dim (more differentiated counterpart) cells and colonospheres delineate the role of the lncRNA LUST  in promoting CCICs self-renewal

DESIGN
Identification of lncRNAs binding to Beta-catenin in two different colon cancer cell lines: HT-29 and CaCo-2

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
