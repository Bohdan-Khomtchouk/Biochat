TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from different developmental stages of tomato fruits

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Comparison of endogenous small RNA profiles from different developmental stages of tomato fruits

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts was ligated to adaptors, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa/Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.
