TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures during fasting and refeeding (compensatory growth) for zebrafish liver

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Here, we certified zebrafish to be a suitable model for the compensatory growth study. After a 3-weeks fasting, recovered for 3 days, 10 days and 15 days were chose as the initial, middle and late sampling sites for compensatory growth analysis, and liver samples of each time point were chose for the microarray analysis.At the same time, zebrafish fed ad libitum, as well as fasting for 3 weeks were also added to the microarray research.

DESIGN
Fasting and refeeding induced gene expression in zebrafish liver was measured when zebrafish were fasted for 3 weeks, and then refed for 3 days, 10 days and 15 days. The control group (continiously fed) have 4 samples, while the other time point have 3 samples.
