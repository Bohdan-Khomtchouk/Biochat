TITLE
Role of miRNAs in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to an endothelial cell lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess changes in the miRNA-ome during the early stages of endothelial differentiation, the expression of mature human miRNAs at days 2, 4 and 10 of endothelial differentiation (vs pluripotent time-matched samples) in SA461 hESC cell line was analysed in a two-channel microarray. Expression of the pluripotency-associated miRNAs miR-302a â€“ d and miR-372 and miR-373 was significantly suppressed with progression of differentiation. The expression of miR-99b, miR-181a and miR-181b was, in contrast, increased in a time- and differentiation-dependent manner compared to time-matched pluripotent samples. The expression profiles were validated and good concordance was observed between microarray, Q-PCR and Northern blot analysis.

DESIGN
This experiment includes a total of 28 samples which are divided in to 3 groups, each with 4 biological repeats: group 1, Parental pluripotent hESC control sample. group 2, time-matched pluripotent hESC control samples. Group 3, hESC cells directed toward endothelial differentiation at time points 2 days, 4 days and 10 days.
