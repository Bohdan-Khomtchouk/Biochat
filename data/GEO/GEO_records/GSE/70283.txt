TITLE
Partial Hepatectomy Induced Long Noncoding RNA Inhibits Hepatocyte Proliferation during Liver Regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis showed that LncPHx2 depletion resulted in upregulation of mRNAs encoding proteins known to promote cell proliferation, including MCM components, DNA polymerases, histone proteins, and transcription factors

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was performed on livers of mice subjected to PHx or to sham surgery after treatment with LncPHx2_ASO1 or with PBS. Gene expression profiling was done at 48 hours post-surgery

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
