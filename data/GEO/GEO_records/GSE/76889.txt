TITLE
Inactivation of interferon signaling promotes the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in colorectal cancers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumors arise and grow despite anti-cancer immune responses. These responses can be stimulated by immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. anti-PD1 antibodies) and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR). Efficacy of these agents in solid tumors including colorectal cancers (CRC) is limited by immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that prevents killing of malignant cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Understanding the nature of TME-generated immunosuppression is of paramount importance. Here we report that TME elicited immunosuppression via eliminating activated CTL; this elimination required TME stress-induced downregulation of the IFNAR1 chain of type I interferon (IFN) receptor and attenuation of its signaling. Downregulation of IFNAR1 was observed in human colorectal cancers (CRC) and in mouse CRC models where it was required for efficient tumor development and progression. Stabilization of IFNAR1 on CTL improved their survival and increased anti- tumor activities of CAR T cells and PD1 inhibitors thereby providing a rationale for targeting IFNAR1 degradation for immunotherapies optimization.

DESIGN
Two genotypes of mice were examined either 9 or 21 days post injection of MC38 colon cancer cells or MC38mRFP cells, respectively.  2-3 replicate mice were analyzed on separate arrays for each condition.  6 conditions in total were analyzed.
