TITLE
Concomitant deletions of tumor suppressor genes MEN1 and AIP are essential for the pathogenesis of the brown fat tumor hibernoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hibernomas are benign tumors with morphological features resembling brown fat. They consistently display cytogenetic rearrangements, typically translocations, involving chromosome band 11q13. Here we demonstrate that these aberrations are associated with concomitant deletions of AIP and MEN1, tumor suppressor genes that are located 3 Mb apart and that underlie the hereditary syndromes pituitary adenoma predisposition and multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. MEN1 and AIP displayed a low expression in hibernomas whereas the expression of genes up-regulated in brown fat-PPARA, PPARG, PPARGC1A, and UCP1-was high. Thus, loss of MEN1 and AIP is likely to be pathogenetically essential for hibernoma development. Simultaneous loss of two tumor suppressor genes has not previously been shown to result from a neoplasia-associated translocation. Furthermore, in contrast to the prevailing assumption that benign tumors harbor relatively few genetic aberrations, the present analyses demonstrate that a considerable number of chromosome breaks are involved in the pathogenesis of hibernoma.

DESIGN
Global copy number analysis was performed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Cases 1-14 were hybridized onto Illumina Human1M-Duo v3.0 (and Human CNV370-Quad v3.0) BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), following standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Case 15 was analyzed using Illumina Human Omni-Quad BeadChip. Normal blood DNA was analyzed in cases 1, 2, 4 and 6 using the Human CNV370-Quad v3.0 BeadChip. Data analysis was done using the BeadStudio software (Illumina).
