SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Jonathan Preall jpreall@cshl.edu (Generation 0 Data from Hannon Lab), Carrie Davis davisc@cshl.edu (experimental), Alex Dobin dobin@cshl.edu (computational), Wei Lin wlin@cshl.edu (computational), Tom Gingeras gingeras@cshl.edu (primary investigator)). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). hg18: This data was produced by Hannon lab part of Cold Spring Harbor as part of the ENCODE Project. The series depicts NextGen sequencing information for RNAs between the sizes of 20-200 nt isolated from RNA samples from tissues or sub cellular compartments of cell lines. hg19: This track depicts NextGen sequencing information for RNAs between the sizes of 20-200 nt isolated from RNA samples from tissues or sub cellular compartments from ENCODE cell lines. The overall goal of the ENCODE project is to identify and characterize all functional elements in the sequence of the human genome. hg19: This cloning protocol generates directional libraries that are read from the 5' ends of the inserts, which should largely correspond to the 5' ends of the mature RNAs. The libraries were sequenced on a Solexa platform for a total of 36, 50 or 76 cycles however the reads undergo post-processing resulting in trimming of their 3' ends. Consequently, the mapped read lengths are variable. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
