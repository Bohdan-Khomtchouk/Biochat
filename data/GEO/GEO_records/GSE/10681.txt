TITLE
Diamond Back Moth treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Landsberg erecta) were grown at 20˚C constant temperature, 8 hr/16 hr Light/Dark photoperiod at 50-60% ambient humidity, for 8 to 9 weeks.  Short day conditions prevented the onset of flowering and the plants were thus maintained in growth stage 1 (leaf production) with 13 to 15 rosette leaves larger than 1mm (stage 1.13 to 1.14). Diamondback moth (DBM, Plutella xylostella) larvae were maintained on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) plants in a climate-controlled room at 25ºC, 12 hr photoperiod with 50%-60% relative humidity. Two days before exposing A. thaliana plants to herbivore treatment, plants were transferred to a climate-controlled room (22ºC, 50-60% humidity, 12 hr photoperiod).  For insect treatment, seven Diamondback moth (DBM, Plutella xylostella) larvae (third to fifth instars) were placed on a group of four or five plants until time of harvest, for each time point separately.  All rosette leaves were harvested at 1h, 4h, 12h, and 24h after onset of continuous herbivory and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Control plants were maintained under the same conditions and harvested in parallel. Keywords: time course, stress response, herbivory response
