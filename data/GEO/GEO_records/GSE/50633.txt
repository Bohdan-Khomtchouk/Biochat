TITLE
Rapidly cleaving bovine embryos have a better developmental potential and a distinctive mRNA pattern

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of in vitro-produced bovine 2-cell embryos according to their time to the first cleavage. Three time points were established in order to collect all the 2-cell embryos present at each moment to contrast only the two exteme embryo subpopulations: fast against slow.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates of fast (29.5 hpf) vs. slow (46 hpf) 2-cell embryos were contrasted. Each replicate was subjected to a dye-swap procedure.

PLATFORM
