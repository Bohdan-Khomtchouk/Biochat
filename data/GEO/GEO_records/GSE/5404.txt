TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila subjected to artificial selection on aggression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genes relevant to manifestion of and variation in aggression behavior might be differentially expressed in lines selected for divergent levels of aggression. Keywords: selection group

DESIGN
Drosophila males were assessed for their aggression levels in a behavioral assay that quantified aggressive encounters.  A subset of the sampled population was selected as parents for the next generation, with High, Low, and Control selection groups maintained.  This artificial selection was continued for 28 generations, with a variety of other behavioral and life history traits assessed for correlation with response to selection for aggression.  At generation 28, male and female flies were collected for RNA extraction and subsequent gene expression analysis.
