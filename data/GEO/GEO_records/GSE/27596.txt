TITLE
Differential expression of glycosyltransferases in P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells with or without differentiation by retinoic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The project is aimed at understanding the role of the Lex-containing L5 carbohydrate epitope in the developmental process of neural induction. We plan to identify 1) the protein to which the L5 glycan is attached, 2) glycosyltransferases upregulated during neural induction, 3) the corresponding L5 carbohydrate binding protein (CBP), 4) the mechanism of interaction between L5 and its CBP, and 5) the spatiotemporal regulation of L5 and L5-CBP expression during neural induction. There is evidence, by Westernblot and immunofluorescence, that the expression of the Lewis-x-like L5 carbohydrate epitope shows dramatic differences in expression between undifferentiated cells and cells differentiated with retinoic acid. We wish to know which enzyme(s) involved in the biosynthetic pathway may be up/downregulated under these experimental conditions.

DESIGN
Two classes of p19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell RNA were analyzed: undifferentiated and differentiated with retinotic acid. Classes were prepared in triplicate for a total of 6 samples. All samples were hybridized to the custom designed CFG GLYCOv2 glycogene array.
