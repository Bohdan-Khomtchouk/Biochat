TITLE
Mitochondrial 12S hypermethylation in HeLa cells and A1555G cybrids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset investigates the transcriptional effect of mitochondrial 12S rRNA hypermethylation, both by overexpressing the mitochondrial methyltransferase mtTFB1 in HeLa cells and by using A1555G cybrids, where the 12S rRNA is hypermethylated. HeLa cells overexpressing a methyltransferase-deficient mtTFB1 (mtTFB1[G65A]) and wild-type A1555A cybrids were used as controls.

DESIGN
four samples with 12S rRNA hypermethylation (two cell lines, with two biological replicates each) versus four samples with basal 12S rRNA methylation (two cell lines, with two biological replicates each)
