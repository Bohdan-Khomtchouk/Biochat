TITLE
ChIRP-Seq of Panct1 lncRNA in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the chromatin binding of the lncRNA (AK156552) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin Isolation by RNA purification was done using Glutaraldehyde cross-linking in mouse ES cells. DNA obtained after ChIRP was sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
