TITLE
Plant Viral Movement Protein-expressing Yeast Transcriptome compared with wild-type Yeast Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Virus life cycle heavily depends on their ability to command the host machinery in order to translate their genomes. By using a yeast-based approach we have found that over expression of the PNRSV MP caused a severe growth defect in yeast cells. cDNA microarrays analysis carried out to characterise at the molecular level the growth interference phenotype reported the induction of genes related to amino acid deprivation suggesting that expression of MP activates the GCN pathway in yeast cells.

DESIGN
Yeast cell cultures were grown 24h in minimal medium with doxycycline (100 mg/ml). These cultures were then diluted to an OD600 nm of 0.1 into fresh minimal medium without doxycycline. At 6 h total RNA was extracted from yeast cells transformed with the empty pCM262 vector (pCM construct) and pCM:MPpnrsv.
