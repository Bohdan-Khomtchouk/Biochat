TITLE
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells upon H1X knock-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells expressing Dox-inducible shRNAs against histone H1X

DESIGN
Stable breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing an shRNA against the histone H1X isoforms in response to doxycycline (Dox) were grown for six days in the presence or absence of Dox, and serum-starved for the last 48h for synchronization in G1, in duplicate, and RNA extracted for microarray hybridization. Cell lines used: inducible shRNA against H1X, and random shRNA-expression vector as a control.
