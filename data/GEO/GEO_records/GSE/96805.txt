TITLE
SOXB1 genetic regulation in the developing testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Absence of Sox3 in mice only results in subtle phenotype, presumably due to the rescue effects from the family members, SOXB1, which consist of Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3. Obvious defect in Sox3-KO mice is seen only in the testes where Sox1 and Sox2 are not co-expressed. The genetic dysregulation underlying this testis defects is unknown. We also hypothesize that this genetic dysregulation can be rescued by the other SOXB1 members. We performed microarray analysis to compare Sox3-KO mouse testes with the WT. We also generated Sox3-Sox2KI mice in which the Sox3 ORF is replaced with Sox2 ORF. Microarray was also performed to these knock-in testis samples to find out whether Sox2 can rescue genetic dysregulation resulting from the absence of Sox3.

DESIGN
Sox3-KO and Sox3-Sox2KI mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. RNAs were extracted from 2 week testes of WT, Sox3-KO and Sox3-Sox2KI mice followed by hybridization to the microarray chip. Three independent Sox3-KO and three Sox3-Sox2KI testes were compared to 6 WT testes in this set of experiment.
