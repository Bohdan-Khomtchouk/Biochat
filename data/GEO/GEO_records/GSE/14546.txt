TITLE
Effect of PPARγ inhibition on pulmonary endothelial cell gene expression: Gene profiling in pulmonary hypertension

ORGANISM
Bos taurus ; Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The loss of PPARγ is found to be associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). We hypothesize that  PPARγ inhibition induced gene expression changes may underscore the endothelial dysfunction in the disease process. We utilized microarray analysis to determine gene expression changes in PPARγ inhibited ovine PAECs.

DESIGN
Ovine PAECs were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or GW9662 (5μM) for 24hrs, and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL2112 [Bovine] Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array
