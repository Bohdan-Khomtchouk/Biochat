TITLE
Gene expression profiling of fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells derived from four individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) are the most widely used cells in genetic, genomic, and transcriptomic studies in relation to human diseases. Examining the gene expression patterns in these two cell types will provide valuable information regarding the validity of using them to study gene expression related to various human diseases. Fibroblasts and LCLs from four members of the Old Order Amish family 884 were purchased from Coriell cell repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). We used microarrays to profile the patterns of gene expression in these eight cell lines. By employing the PennCNV algorithm to the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP genotyping data, we detected 13 Copy Number Variants (CNV) that exist in these four individuals. CNV-expression association analysis revealed that seven of these 13 CNVs were associated with the expression of genes within or near ( < 2Mb sweep) these CNVs at a nominal regression P value of 0.05.
