TITLE
Expression profile of Maize (Zea mays L.) Embryonic Axes During Germination: Regulation of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Seed germination is a critical developmental process in plant propagation. Knowledge of the gene expression patterns  in this critical process  is important in order to  understand the main biochemical reactions involved in successful germination, specially for economically relevant plants such as Maize. The purpose of this study is the gene expression analysis of quiescent and germinated maize embryonic axes to determine the regulatory mechanism for (r)-protein expression during the maize development process.

DESIGN
This study analyzed samples of total and polysomal RNA from maize embryonic axes at different time periods during the germination process and under the influence of a specific growth factor. For each condition a biological replicate was included and for the time periods, a technical replicate was also included.
