TITLE
Glucocorticoid Receptor: MegaTrans Switching Mediates Repression of ERα-Regulated Transcriptional Program [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying GR-dependent inhibition of ERα-regulated gene activation programs at the global genomic level have been poorly understood. We found the binding of GR in trans on ERα-activated enhancers results in gene and enhancer repression by disassembling the MegaTrans Complex.

DESIGN
All ChIP-Seq experiments were designed to elucidate the mechanism involving GR-mediated repression of ERα-Regulated Transcriptional Program

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
