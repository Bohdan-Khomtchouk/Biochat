TITLE
Circadian regulation of miR-378 mediates circadian controls of cell cycle and metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the circadian functions of the miRNAs derived from these circadian primary miRNA transcripts, we focused on miR-378 and examined the transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon miR-378 over-expression at two circadian time points, CT10 and CT22. First, we observed a significant over-representation of the circadian oscillating genes affected by miR-378 over-expression. Cell cycle genes are further enriched in the affected circadian oscillating genes, which implied that miR-378 mediates the circadian control of cell cycle. Our examination of circadian regulatory network involving miR-378 suggests that miR-378 mediates the circadian control of cell cycle and metabolism by forming either coherent or incoherent feed-forward loops with circadian TFs.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of liver tissue from ad-null or ad-378 (miR-378 overexpression) mice at CT10 and CT22 with two biological replicates.
