TITLE
Survey of methylomes of two beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides and Tribolium castaneum

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum ; Nicrophorus vespilloides

SUMMARY
The presence of DNA methylation in beetles (Coleoptera) has only been investigated with bisulfite sequencing of Tribolium castaneum, which produced no evidence of DNA methylation. Here, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assay if DNA methylation was present in another beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. We used T. castaneum as a negative control.

DESIGN
MethylC-seq of Nicrophorus vespilloides and Tribolium castaneum larva.

PLATFORM
