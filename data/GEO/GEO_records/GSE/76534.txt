TITLE
Aspergillus oryzae gene expression with 1hr galactose, glucose, and sorbitol induction.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus oryzae RIB40

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to find out carbon souce responsive genes of A. oryzae with 1hr induction with galactose, glucose, and sorbitol.

DESIGN
The A.oryzae RIB40 was cultured for 24hr in glucose as a carbon source, then shifted to galactose, glucose, and sorbitol containing medium and cultured for 1hr. Two biological replicates in each conditions were used for the microarray analysis.
