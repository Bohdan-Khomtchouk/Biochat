TITLE
Dysferlin deficiency modulates the proximal-distal muscle transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By comparing the transcriptome from proximal (quadriceps femoris, QF) and distal (tibialis anterior, TA)muscle groups in dysferlin deficient mouse muscle (the SJL mutation bred onto C57BL/10 to produces C57BL/10-SJL.Dysf) with proximal and distal muscle groups from control C57BL/10 mice of an equivalent age (3-weeks old, prior to the onset of overt pathology) we aim to address the issues of muscle selectivity in this this form of muscular dystrophy. Keywords: parallel sample
