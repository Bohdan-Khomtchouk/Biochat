TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for IGF-1 overexpressing human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a key factor for differentiation and development, IGF-1 has attracted scientistsâ€™ attention gradually in recent years. However, its exact effects in human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are still unclear. In this study, we mainly investigated whether IGF-1 could affect some biological functions of UC-MSCs.

DESIGN
UC-MSCs were isolated from the human umbilical cord. IGF-1 overexpressing UC-MSCs (UC-MSCs-IGF-1) were established through retroviral infection. Whole genome expression of UC-MSCs-IGF-1 was analyzed with RNA microarray.
