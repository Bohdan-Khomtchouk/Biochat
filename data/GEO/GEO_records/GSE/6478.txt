TITLE
Small RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and its RISC complexes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA populations in Arabidopsis thaliana and its RISC complexes Keywords: Highly parallel pyrosequencing

DESIGN
Small RNAs were prepared from Arabidopsis total extracts, AGO1 and AGO4 complexes, ligated to a 3' adaptor and a 5' acceptor sequentially, and then RT-PCR amplified. PCR products were reamplified using a pair of 454 cloning primers and provided to 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT) for sequencing.
