TITLE
Comparison of primary MEF vs HRasV12 + Twist transformed MEF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEF cells were sequentially infected with H-RasV12 and Twist (Twist1 or Twist2) expression retroviral constructs. Gene expression profiles of the resulting transformed cell lines were compared to the gene expression profile of primary MEF cells
