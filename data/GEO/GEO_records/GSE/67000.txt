TITLE
Young and elderly fibroblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Age-associated accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been proposed to be responsible for the age-associated mitochondrial respiration defects found in elderly human subjects. In contrasts, our previous studies proposed that the age-associated respiration defects found in human fibroblasts are caused not by mtDNA mutations. To addressed these controversial issues, we carried out microarray analysis of two young (TIG3S and TIG121) and two elderly (TIG107 and TIG102) fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Young (TIG3S and TIG121) and elderly (TIG107 and TIG102) fibroblasts are analyzed.
