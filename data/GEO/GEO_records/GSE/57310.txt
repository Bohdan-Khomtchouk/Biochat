TITLE
Expression data from Suv420h1 knockout and mutant PREX2 expressing MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PREX2 truncating mutations occur in melanoma. We used microarray based gene expression profiling to compare expression patterns between cells harboring Suv420h1 knockout and PREX2 mutant expressing

DESIGN
Spontaneously immortalized MEFs from either wt or Suv420h1 knockout mice were used. Wt MEFs were transduced with lentivirus to express indicated PREX2 mutants. Suv420h1 ko MEFs were reconstituted either with control GFP or Suv420h1-GFP fusion. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to analysis
