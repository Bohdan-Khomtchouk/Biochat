TITLE
Expression profiling of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis isolates and H37Rv exposed to anti-TB compounds

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To explore the mechanism of drug resistance, most works focused on resistance associated genetic mutations, whereas concerns for resistance related gene expression are relatively low. Here a global expression analysis was performed between a reference strain H37Rv and two clinical extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains with three anti-TB drug exposures {isoniazid (INH), capreomycin (CAP), rifampicin (RIF)}

DESIGN
Strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with ADC, 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.2% glycerol to an OD600 of 0.5-0.6, and then respectively treated with control (water), 10×MIC INH, 1×MIC RIF and CAP for 6hr.

PLATFORM
GPL18119 Agilent-027618 Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv 8X15K Microarray (Probe Name version)
