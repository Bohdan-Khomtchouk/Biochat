TITLE
Whole-Genome Transcriptome Profiling of Microvascular Free Flaps

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Vascular compromise in microsurgical free flap transfers continues to present devastating outcomes in terms of flap failure and increased operating room costs. Current devices to detect early venous congestion have not become widely accepted because of insufficient sensitivity, incisiveness, or practicality. In our study, we developed a venous obstruction rat model in which the superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) vessels to the lower abdominal flaps was separated and artery or vein was ligated, and the flap reattached. Flaps were harvested 4 hours post-op. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression profiles were compared  by Affymetrix Whole Genome 230 2.0.

DESIGN
Flaps from groups of Venous or artery congestion (VC or AC, resp.) and sham operation group, were harvested and RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Other controls including histology assays to assure comparable phenotype within groups.
