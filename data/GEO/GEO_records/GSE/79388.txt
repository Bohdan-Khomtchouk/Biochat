TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the impact of NeuroAiD MLC901 on H9 hESC-derived human neural progenitor cells (NPC) undergoing neural differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression profile of human NPC undergoing neural differentiation in the presence and absence of NeuroAid MLC901.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human NPC undergoing neural differentiation in the presence of NeuroAid MLC901 compared to those undergoing neural differentiation in the absence of NeuroAid MLC901 at timepoints 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
