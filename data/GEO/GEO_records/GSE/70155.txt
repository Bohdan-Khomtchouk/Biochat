TITLE
Genome wide analysis of HDL and cyclodextrin induced gene expression in LPS-stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While LPS as expected induced a strongly upregulatedion of pro-inflammatory genes and signaling pathways, HDL and cyclodextrin clearly enhanced LPS-induced signaling, especially of Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)1 and Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB)-p65 dependent genes

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bone marrow derived macrophages incubated for 24h with 300ug/ml HDL or 4h with 4% cyclodextrin, compared to PBS treated control cells.
