TITLE
Gene expression profile of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Five ITP and five control whole blood samples were collected with IRB approval. The age range of ITP patients was 1-54 years, and the range in platelet counts was 2,000-98,000 W 109/L. We examined only one ITP sample for antiplatelet antibodies, and found it to be positive. Total RNA was isolated from 2.5 ml whole blood according to the PAXgene Blood RNA System (PreAnalytix, Switzerland). RNA isolated from ITP patients and controls, along with Human Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were linearly amplified using the MessageAmp aRNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
