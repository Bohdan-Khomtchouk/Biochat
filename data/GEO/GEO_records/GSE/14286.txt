TITLE
Expression data for biophenotypic leukemia patients treated in St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mixed-lineage leukemias represent about 3-5% of acute leukemias occurring in patients of all ages and comprise several different subtypes (biphenotypic, bilineal, and lineage switch). The optimal therapeutic approach to these cases, especially in pediatric patients, has not been defined. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of pediatric patients with biophenotypic leukemia. Keywords: Patient sample accumulation

DESIGN
The patient samples were selected from database review, and gene expressions were accumulated for the corresponding study period.
