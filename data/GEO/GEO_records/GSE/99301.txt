TITLE
ChIP-sequencing for histone modifications in primary human hepatocytes from three individuals heterozygous for the T2D risk haplotype at the SLC16A11 locus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-sequencing for H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac was performed in primary human hepatocytes from three individuals heterozygous for the T2D risk haplotype at the SLC16A11 locus. The goal was to identify allelic skews in chromatin marks at variants at the SLC16A11 locus.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different histone modifications in 1 primary human cell type obtained from 3 individuals.

PLATFORM
