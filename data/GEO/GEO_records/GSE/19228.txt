TITLE
Expression Analysis of Mammary Epithelial Cells Isolated from 12-16 Week Old Virgin C57Bl6 Lrp5+/+ and Lrp5-/- Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole-genome gene expression level changes in C57Bl6 Lrp5-/- mammary epithelial cells, compared to the wild-type strain. The mammary epithelial cells were isolated from numbers 4 and 5 mammary glands. The Lrp5-/- mouse strain described in this study has been further described in Lindvall C, Evans NC, Zylstra CR, Li Y, Alexander CM, Williams BO. 2006. The Wnt signaling receptor Lrp5 is required for mammary ductal stem cell activity and Wnt1-induced tumorigenesis. J Biol Chem. 2006 Nov 17;281(46):35081-7. Epub 2006 Sep 13. PMID: 16973609.

DESIGN
Mammary epithelial cells were isolated from 6 groups of Lrp5+/+ and 3 groups of Lrp5-/- mice. The isolated RNA was submitted to the Gene Expression Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison where it was labelled with Cy3. Labelled samples were submitted to Roche Nimblegen and were hybridized to Mus musculus 1-Plex arrays that represent 42,586 mouse genes.
