TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of EST-induced EBE-XVE  using Affymetrix ATH1 array

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome patterns were determined in XVE-14 and wild-type seedlings induced for 45 min b-estradiol in order to identify the genes early regulated by EBE transcription factor. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in EST-inducible EBE over-expression line #14 compared to wild-type plants, 45 min after 2µM EST induction. Three independent biological replications were performed.

DESIGN
In order to identify potential direct/early target genes of EBE transcription factor, estradiol inducible overexpression system was used. Three week old Arabidopsis EBE-XVE (line 14) and WT seedlings were treated with ß-estradiol (2µM) for 45 min. RNA was isolated from shoot and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiment was performed in 3 biological replications and genes differentially expressed between estradiol treated EBE-XVE and WT plants were identified as potential early targets of EBE.
