TITLE
The effect of progressive weight loss on metabolic function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of progressive weight loss (5, 10, 15% weight loss) on metabolic function such as multi-organ insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in obese people. We conducted microarray analysis to determine the effect of progressive weight loss on adipose tissue gene expression profile.

DESIGN
We examined subcuntaneous adipose tissue samples obtained from 9 obese subjects before (A) and after 5% (B), 10% (C) and 15% (D) weight loss (total 36 samples).
