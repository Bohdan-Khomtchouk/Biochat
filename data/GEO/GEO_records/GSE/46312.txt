TITLE
Expression data from two year old shoot apex and mature xylem of Populus tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
We take the two year old plant for sampling.Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to elucidate the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus tomentosa shoot apex and mature xylem. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in shoot apex and mature xylem.

DESIGN
Populus tomentosa shoot apex and mature xylem were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.CB2009304-C and CB2009304-D from shoot apex, CB2009304-G and CB2009304-H from mature xylem.

PLATFORM
GPL4359 [Poplar] Affymetrix Poplar Genome Array
