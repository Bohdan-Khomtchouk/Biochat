TITLE
Comparision of La-RNA-binding between wild type La and sumoylation deficient La mutant (K41/200R) in HEK293 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a RNA immunoprecipitations experiments using gfp-specific antibodies to precipitate gfp-tagged La proteins from from gfp-La wild type and sumoylation deficient La mutant (K41/200R) cells and found that specific mRNAs are preferentially enriched gfp-La wild type  RIPs when compared to sumoylation deficient La mutant (K41/200R) RIPs.

DESIGN
Evaluate role of La-sumoylation in cellular physiology.
