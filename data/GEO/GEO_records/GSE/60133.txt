TITLE
Expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings subjected to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) seedlings were grown on vertically oriented agar plates and subjected to hypoxia (0.2% oxygen, 99.8% nitrogen) for 30 to 240 minutes.

DESIGN
Five independent samples were analysed: three samples were subjected to hypoxia treatment and two samples were kept at ambient conditions;
