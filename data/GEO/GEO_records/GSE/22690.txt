TITLE
The intracellular domain of amyloid precursor protein induces the dynamic change of the gene expression profile in P19 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As previously reported (Neuroscience letters 444(2008)127-131), we established embryonic carcinoma P19 cell line expressing the intracellular domain of APP (AICD). Although neurons could be differentiated from these cell lines with RA treatment, expression of AICD gave rise to neuron-specific apoptosis. To identify the genes that are involved in this cell death, we evaluated changes of gene expressions that was induced by AICD through this process of cell death. The expression profiles of almost forty thousands transcripts were monitored by DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
AICD-expressing P19 cell lines (AICD/P19) and control P19 cell lines (pCDNA/P19) that carry vector alone were used and cultured. To induce neural differentiation of these P19 cell lines, cells were allowed to aggregate in culture medium with 5Ã—10-7 M all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) for 4 days (aggregated state). After aggregation, cells were replated onto cell culture grade dishes or poly-L-Lysine coated cell-disks for two days (differentiated state). RNAs were isolated at each states.
