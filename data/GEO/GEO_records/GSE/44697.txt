TITLE
Effect of Trp63 deletion on the developing vagina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the neonatal uterus and vagina from transformation related protein 63 (Trp63) conditional heterozygous and null mice was analyzed in order to identify upstream and downstream of Trp63 in the developing vagina. Differential gene expression between vaginal (Trp63 positive) and uterine (Trp63 negative) tissues should reflect both the upstream and downstream of Trp63 expression, whereas the comparison between conditional knockout and heterozygous vaginae should identify what is downstream of Trp63. Thus, the three-way comparison should identify what is upstream of Trp63.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the Trp63 conditional heterozygous (Trp63 flox/wt ; Pax2-cre) uteri and vaginae, and Trp63 conditional knockout (Trp63 flox/floxt ; Pax2-cre) vaginae. Total 12 samples (3 different genotype/tissue groups x 4 independent samples each).
