TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of HCC cells transfected with NCsiRNA or CDCA8siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized if targeting of CDCA8 with small interfering (si) RNA could inhibit HCC progression. We also investigated molecular mechanism to mediate HCC cell death caused by CDCA8 silencing. To accomplish this, Huh1 and Huh7 human HCC cells were transfected with CDCA8 siRNA and tested for growth inhibition and apoptotic induction using MTS, FACS and microscopic analysis. To obtain insights into the molecular changes in response to CDCA8 knockdown, global changes in gene expression were examined using RNA sequencing. As results, siRNA silencing of CDCA8 inhibited HCC cell growth by blocking cell-cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. RNA sequencing showed that, representatively, the anti-proliferative effects were driven by a subset of molecular alterations including the upregulation of tumor suppressive ATF3 and GADD34 genes, whereas a key regulator of cell growth and invasiveness BGLAP was repressed. Subsequent Western blotting also revealed that CDCA8 silencing decreases the levels of pro-caspase 3 and PARP-1, accelerating apoptotic signaling in HCC cells. In addition, targeting CDCA8 effectively suppressed HCC tumor growth growth in a murine xenograft model. Taken together, these findings suggest that CDCA8 could be a promising molecular target for systemic therapy of HCC.
