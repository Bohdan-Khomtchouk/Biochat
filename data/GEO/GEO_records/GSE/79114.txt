TITLE
Effects of muscle regeneration after injury on overloading-induced hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiotoxin was injected into left soleus muscle of adult rats. Right muscle was kept intact. Ambulation recovery was allowed for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of regeneration period, both left and right soleus muscles were overloaded by the transection of synergists' tendons for 2 weeks.

DESIGN
We tested 6 muscles for each group. RNA samples were mixed with same amount from each muscle toward analysis by microarray.
