TITLE
Pretreatment with Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor Prevents Tumor-Like Overgrowth in Human iPSC-Derived Transplant for Spinal Cord Injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell cycle- and more mature neuronal marker-related genes increased by > 2-fold change in both the GSI groups compared to the control group.

DESIGN
To analyze gene expression profiles in hiPSC-NS/PCs treated with or without Gamma-secretase inhibitor.
