TITLE
Recovery and analysis of nascent RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nascent transcription profiles are shown for scaled megadomains and 100kb flanking regions before BRD4-NUT induction (0h) and at different time points (2h, 3h, 7h) following induction in 293T cells. Increase of the transcription from 0h to 7h after induction. Average level of transcriptional activity is reduced within the megadomains and their flanking regions following JQ1 treatment of TC-797 cells. Profile of nascent RNA-seq is shown for cells without JQ1 treatment, and for cells 1hr, 2.5hr and 4hr following JQ1 treatment.
