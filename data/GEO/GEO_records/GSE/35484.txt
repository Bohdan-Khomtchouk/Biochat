TITLE
Acetate Fermentation facilitates survival of Mtb when respiration is inhibited

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Respiratory ATP-synthesis is at present the only known mechanism for ATP synthesis in Mtb. This makes Mtb particularly vulnerable to inhibition of respiratory ATP synthase inhibitors such as TMC207, a novel compound for treatment of tuberculosis. We now provide first evidence that Mtb possesses a pathway that is fermentative in nature that could compensate lack of respiratory ATP synthesis. We identified acetate as a fermentation product in Mtb. Production of acetate was mediated by phosphotransacetylase (Pta) and acetate kinase (AckA). In acetate fermenting Mtb cultures, ATP levels remained stable despite inhibition of respiratory ATP synthase. Deletion of the PtaAckA pathway in Mtb decreased ATP content and impaired survival. This study provides evidence that in Mtb substrate level phosphorylation can compensate lack of oxidative phosphorylation, and thus facilitates survival of Mtb in the absence of respiration. Acetate fermentation contributes to adaptation to respiration-limiting conditions, and plays an important role in the emerging field of fermentative metabolism of Mtb.

DESIGN
We performed DNA microarray analysis to validate the reduction of oxygen concentration  by comparing aerobic and hypoxic cultures. RNA was prepared from Mtb after two days of cultivation in aerobic and in hypoxic cultures. At each condition, Mtb were cultured in medium supplemented with glycerol and glucose. Labelled cDNA from three independent experiments was subjected to array analysis.
