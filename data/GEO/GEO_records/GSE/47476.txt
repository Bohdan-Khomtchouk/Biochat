TITLE
microRNA profiles of EZH2 activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). EZH2 expression is significantly upregulated in MPNST. In our study, we investigated the function of EZH2 and the molecular mechanisms that are regulated by EZH2 in MPNST pathogenesis. Our findings enhance the knowledge of EZH2â€™s function and biology, and have the potential to provide a novel therapeutic approach for MPNST patients in the clinic.

DESIGN
An EZH2 knockdown experiment was carried out in MPNST cells. There are one control and one siEZH2 samples for three cell lines (724,462,26T) and two repeats for each cell line, so in total there are 8 samples.  Two group comparison Two group comparison
