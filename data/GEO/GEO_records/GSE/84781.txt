TITLE
Polysome profiling: Mouse OT-1 T cells WT vs Lck-/- (OFF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify gene targets of translational regulation during T cell activation, a polysome analysis was performed in a T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic model (OT-1) possessing a homogenous alpha-beta CD8 T lymphocyte population. Cells with defective TCR signal tranduction (Lck-/-, OFF) were compared to WT cells to visualise targets regulated by TCR signalling. Total cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein was extracted from ex vivo OT-1 transgenic T lymphocytes stimulated with SIINFEKL peptide antigen for 24h, extracts were fractionated using a sucrose density gradient, and separated into a sub-polysomal and a polysomal fraction. Total RNA from each fraction was extracted, equal volume of RNA from each fraction was individually labelled (Sub-poly: Cy3; Poly: Cy5), and hybridised onto a Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE v2 8x60K Microarray.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates + dye swap control for each biological sample
