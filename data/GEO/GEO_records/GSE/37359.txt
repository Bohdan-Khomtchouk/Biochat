TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling analysis of a Sphingomyelin Synthase 1 mutant mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lysosomal storage diseases are congenital lipid metabolism disorders, often accompaning by male infertility. Sms1, the enzyme, that generates sphingomyelin from ceramides seems to be involved in spermatogeneis and spermiogenesis. Therefore, testis but also muscle and brain of a mouse line carrying an insertional mutation in Sms1 were analysed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 4 male mutant mice was compared to four wild type controls.
