ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression of the rat soleus muscle was assessed with microarrays after 12 hrs of physical inactivity and also after 12 hours of physical inactivity immediately followed by 2 hrs treadmill walking and compared to normally caged rats with voluntary standing and intermittent cage movements.
