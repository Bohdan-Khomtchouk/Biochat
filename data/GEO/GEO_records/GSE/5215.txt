TITLE
Expression data from rat soleus during acute physical inactivity and walking

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression of the rat soleus muscle was assessed with microarrays after 12 hrs of physical inactivity and also after 12 hours of physical inactivity immediately followed by 2 hrs treadmill walking and compared to normally caged rats with voluntary standing and intermittent cage movements. Keywords: between group design

DESIGN
Rats were either prevented from standing on the their hindlimbs for 12 hrs or were prevented from standing on the their hindlimbs for 12 hrs and then immediately engaged in 2 hours treadmill walking and compared to caged rats with normal standing/ambulatory activity. RNA was extracted from soleus muscles and each array represents the pooling of the RNA from the soleus of 8-10 different rats.
