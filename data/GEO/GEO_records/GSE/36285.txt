TITLE
Chronic Caloric Restriction Preserves Mitochondrial Function in Senescence Without Increasing Mitochondrial Biogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition appears to mitigate many detrimental effects of aging, in particular the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.  Although the mechanisms responsible for this protective effect remain unclear, CR is commonly believed to increase mitochondrial biogenesis; a concept that is now demanding closer scrutiny.  Here we show that lifelong CR in mice prevents age-related loss of mitochondrial function, measured in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized muscle fibers.  We find that these beneficial effects of CR occur without increasing mitochondrial abundance.  Furthermore, whole-genome expression profiling and large-scale proteomic surveys revealed expression patterns inconsistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis.  These observations, combined with lower protein synthesis rates support an alternative hypothesis that CR preserves mitochondrial function not by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, but rather by decreasing mitochondrial oxidant emission, increasing antioxidant scavenging, thereby minimizing oxidative damage to cellular components.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional comparison of skeletal muscle from young (8mo), old (24mo) and old caloric restricted mice, obtained from the colony maintained on behalf of the National Institute on Aging.
