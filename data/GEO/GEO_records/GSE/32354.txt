TITLE
Expression data from  E2f7/E2f8 and E2f1/E2f2/E2f3 null liver (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying cause and mechanisms of changes in hepatocyte ploidy upon Albumin-Cre mediated deletion of E2f7 & 8 and Mx1-Cre mediated deletion of E2f1,2 & 3, we analysed global gene expression of 6 weeks and 2 months liver tissues.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from liver tissues. Gene deletion in samples confirmed by PCR genotyping of DNA isolated from each sample.
