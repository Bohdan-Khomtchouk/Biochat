TITLE
Streptomyces coelicolor M145 scbRDM vs WT and scbR2DM vs WT

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
To help understand the functions of GBL receptor ScbR and antibiotic receptor ScbR2, the global transcriptional profiles of scbRDM and scbR2DM compared to WT were studied.

DESIGN
Transcprits of mutants scbRDM and scbR2DM were compared to WT at corresponded time points: WT and  scbRDM at 30h, WT and  scbR2DM at 42h mycelium were collected, and subjected to microarray hybridization and analysis. Three duplicated were conducted.
