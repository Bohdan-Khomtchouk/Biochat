TITLE
Solar UV-B regulation of high altitude maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To initiate a genomic scale analysis of high altitude maize, we performed expression-profiling experiments using Unigene I cDNA arrays from the Maize Gene Discovery Project that contain 5664 cDNAs printed in triplicate spots; a triplicate set for nearly all cDNAs was printed in at least one additional location on each slide, thus there is a minimum of 6 spots for each cDNA per slide. Four-week-old maize plants grown in the field under the three irradiation regimes no UV-B, solar UV-B or UV-B supplemental were used for the experiments. Samples were collected from adult leaves 9 and 10; samples from 6 plants were pooled for preparation of poly(A)+ RNA. Keywords: parallel sample
