TITLE
ATF3 is a central regulator of interferon-beta and interferon-stimulated genes during the innate immune response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study shows that in the absence of Atf3, primary mouse macrophages display significantly greater basal and PRR-inducible IFNβ expression. This regulation appears to be directly on the level of Ifnb1 transcription mediated by ATF3 binding proximal to the Ifnb1 promoter under basal condition. The ATF3 expression was demonstrated to be type I IFN-inducible in both human and mouse immune cells. A subset of 36 genes downstream of IFNAR signalling were modulated in an ATF3-dependent manner.The regulation of IFN responses by ATF3 had significant relevance on in vitro viral infection. Together these findings demonstrate that ATF3 is an important regulatory handbrake that limits the magnitude of IFN responses on multiple levels; basal Ifnb1 expression; PRR-inducible IFNβ; and the expression of specific ISGs.
