TITLE
Cross-platform prediction of gene expression signatures.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a method to convert gene expression signatures across the Illumina and Affymetrix platforms.

DESIGN
We generated an E2F1 signature. We processed RNA for E2F1, MYC, and Ras signatures on the Illumina platform.  16 Melanoma samples are also included for validation.
