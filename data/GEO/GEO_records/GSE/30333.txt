TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of temperature regulation in Yersinia pestis

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Temperature is a key environmental factor for facultative pathogens during the host adaptation response. To assess the functional role of temperature in Yersinia pestis, a microarray study was conducted comparing the Δpgm (pigmentation-negative) R88 strain grown at 37°C or 30°C.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from 37°C cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from 30°C cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. A dye-swap design was used to remove the Cy5 and Cy3 dye bias.
