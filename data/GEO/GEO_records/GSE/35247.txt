TITLE
Genome unstable murine prostate cancers acquire genomic aberrations and bone metastatic features of the human disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene copy numbers of prostate tumors of G3 and G4 generations of LSL-mTert PB-Pten/p53 mouse model

DESIGN
Prostate tumors were developed in G3 and G4 generations of LSL-mTert PB-Pten/p53 mice. These tumors were profiled with affy and aCGH. We used affy gene expression to correlate with the copy number alterations in the mouse prostate tumors.
