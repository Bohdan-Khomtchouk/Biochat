TITLE
STOP2 activated transcription in the stop1-mutant: STOP2-complemented lines (stop1-mutant with transformed STOP2) vs. stop1-mutant of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of genes recoverd by STOP2-complementation in the stop1-mutant (STOP2 expression is repressed in the stop1-mutant). The roots were exposed to Al and low pH stressed conditions, then genes recovered expression were analyzed. Goal is identifying the genes can be actevated the expression by STOP2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, STOP2-complemented lines (stop1-mutant backgoround) v.s. stop1-mutant. Biological replicates: 3 of low pH treatments replicates, 3 Al treatment replicates.

PLATFORM
