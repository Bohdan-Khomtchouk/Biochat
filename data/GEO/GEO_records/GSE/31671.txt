TITLE
DNA Methyltransferase 1 and DNA Methylation Patterning Contribute to Germinal Center B-Cell Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed DNA methylation (HELP) and gene expression profiling in 17 samples of purified Germinal center B cells (GCBs) and Naive B cells (NBC).  We performed  supervised analysis using HELP data and defined DNA methylation signature differentiting 2 subgroups of B cvells.

DESIGN
Study included purification of human B cells form reactive tonsils, DNA purification and DNA methylation analysis using HELP assay.
