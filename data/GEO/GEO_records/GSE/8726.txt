Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is a major antioxidant protein which detoxifies superoxide anion radicals generated by mitochondrial respiration (Weisiger and Fridovich, J. Biol. Chem. 1973).  We designed a model of oxidative stress-induced anemia caused by SOD2-deficiency (Friedman et al. J. Exp. Med. 2001).  Our previous work showed that mice reconstituted with SOD2-deficient hematopoietic stem cells develop an anemia with striking similarity to human sideroblastic anemia (SA) (Friedman et al. Blood 2004; Martin et al. Exp Hematol 2005).  Our overall goal was to define early events in the pathogenesis of SOD2-deficiency SA and, in particular, to identify genes involved in the response of erythroid progenitors to oxidative stress.  We compared gene expression of sorted TER-119+ CD71+ erythroblasts from SOD2-/- ('KO') versus Sod2+/+ ('WT') hematopoietic stem cell recipients using cDNA microarrays. Samples used in this study were re-hybridized with GLYCOv2 oligonucleotide arrays.  GLYCOv2 oligonucleotide arrays are custom Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) designed for the Functional Glycomics Gateway, collaboration between the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG, ) and Nature Publishing Group.  A complete description of the array can be found at .  Hybridization results and quality control details can be found at , by clicking on the ‘Raw Data’ icon link for microarray experiment ‘Jeff Friedman 1: Sod2 KO anemic mice’. Briefly but importantly, one Sod2-/- sample, which was prepared separately, and whose GAPDH 3'/5' ratio was off range, was legitimately removed from the analysis of the GLYCOv2 and 430 2.0 arrays.
