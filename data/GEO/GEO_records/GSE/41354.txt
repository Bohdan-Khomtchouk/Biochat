TITLE
Distribution of insulator proteins CP190, dCTCF, Su(Hw) and Mod(mdg4)2.2 in Drosophila S2 cells in the presence or absence of dPARP inhibitor 3AB

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We mapped the localization of insulator proteins in Drosophila S2 cells in the presence or absence of 12mM of 3AB. We found that inhibition of PARylation affects DNA binding of insulator proteins only at a small subsets of genomic sites.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic occupancy for insulator proteins in S2 cells with or without 3AB inhibition.
