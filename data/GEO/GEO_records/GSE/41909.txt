IL-7 and IL-15 instruct the generation of human memory stem T cells from naïve precursors

SUMMARY
The identification of the most appropriate T-cell subset to ensure optimal persistence and anti-tumor activity is a major goal of cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel post-mitotic CD45RA+CD62L+ T cell subpopulation (TTN), generated in vitro upon activation of naïve T (TN) cells with beads conjugated to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. This cell population is highly proliferative, produces low levels of IFNg and cytotoxic molecules, and requires IL-7 and IL-15 for in vitro expansion. To investigate whether this cell population represents a novel T-cell subset, we compared the transcriptomic profile of  TTN with that of other T-cell subsets, namely naturally occurring TN and central memory (TCM) and manipulated cells of TCM origin (TTCM).

DESIGN
We collected RNA from unmanipulated purified T-cell subsets (TN and TCM) or from T-cell subsets that were in vitro activated and transduced (TTN and TTCM). In vitro generated subsets were kept in culture for 15 days after activation before harvesting. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicas (A, B, C) were used for each of the 4 conditions (1: TN; 2: TCM; 3: TTN; 4: TTCM) for a total of 12 samples.
