TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of the stem of Wild Type and CEP1 Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed to examine the differential expressed transcriptomes in cep1 plants during stem development compare to wild type plants.

DESIGN
To examine the differential expressed transcriptomes in cep1 plants during stem development, the stem from cep1 mutants and wild type plants at 25-days after flowering were collected for RNA-seq analysis. No replicates include in each samples.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
