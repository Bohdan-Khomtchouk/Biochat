TITLE
Distinct Signaling Roles of Ceramide Species in Yeast Revealed Through Integromics Analyses

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cells were subjected to different combination of the following perturbations: heat stress, myriocin (ISP1) treatment and lipid (myristate) supplement.  Then gene expression and lipidomic data were collected under each experimental condition with triplicates.

DESIGN
heat stress, myriocin (ISP1) treatment and lipid (myristate) supplement in triplicates
