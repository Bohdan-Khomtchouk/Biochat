TITLE
Enhancing integrin alpha7 expression effect on myoblast transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 myoblast induced with tetracycline to enhance integrin alpha7 expression. Integrin alpha7 is the major laminin binding integrin in muscle cells. Enhancing its expression has been demonstrated to alleviate pathology in a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Results of this study provide insights into the effects of increasing integirn alpha7 expression on muscle cells and possible side effects associate with enhancing integrin alpha7 in muscle cells. Keywords: comparitive of integrin lapha7 induced and non-induced c2C12 myobalst

DESIGN
Triplicate biological smaples for each condition(induced and non-induced) C2C12 myoblast were used.
