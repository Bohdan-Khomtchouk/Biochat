TITLE
Whole-genome microarray of Caenorhabditis elegans strains DA650 and RC301 exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanisms by which RC301 compensates for the deficiency in the NPR-1 controlled immune and behavioral responses of strain DA650, we determine the whole-genome expression profile of these two strains upon exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14

DESIGN
DA650 and RC301 animals were synchronized to developmental stage L1. These animals were grown at 20°C on nematode growth media plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 until L4 stage (48 hours). At 48 hours, animals were transferred to plates containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14. After 4 hours of incubation at 25°C, animals were rinsed off the plates and total RNA from three biological replicates was extracted. C. elegans Gene Expression Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were used.were used.
