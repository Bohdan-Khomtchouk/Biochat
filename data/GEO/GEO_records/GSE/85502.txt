TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of H3K27me3 in Drosophila primary spermatocytes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
YFP-tagged primary spermatocytes were sorted by FACS, then ChIP together with microarray analysis was used to generate a genome-wide map for the H3K27me3 histone mark.

DESIGN
We performed two biological replicates with a Cy3/Cy5 dye swap. Input chromatin was used as the reference control to assay ChIP enrichment.
