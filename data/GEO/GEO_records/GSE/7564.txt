TITLE
Gene expression profiling reveals a regulatory role for RORalpha and RORgamma in Phase I and Phase II Metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinoid-related orphan receptors RORalpha and RORgamma are both expressed in liver; however, their physiological functions have not yet been clearly defined. RORalpha1 and RORgamma1, but not RORalpha4, show an oscillatory pattern of expression during circadian rhythm. To obtain insight into the physiological functions of ROR receptors in liver, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of livers from WT, RORalpha-deficient staggerer mice (RORalphasg/sg), RORgamma-/-, and RORalpha sg/sgRORgamma-/- double knockout (DKO) mice by microarray analysis. DKO mice were generated to study functional redundancy between RORalpha and RORgamma. These analyses demonstrated that RORalpha and RORgamma affect the expression of a number of genes. RORalpha and RORalpha are particularly important in the regulation of genes encoding several Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes, including several 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Hsd3b), the cytochrome P450 (Cyp) enzymes Cyp7b1, Cyp4a14, and Cyp8b1, and the sulfotransferases Sult1e1 and Sult2a1. Our data show that RORalpha and RORgamma can influence gene expression positively as well as negatively. In addition, our results indicate that RORalpha and RORgamma each affect the expression of a specific set of genes but also exhibit functional redundancy. Our study shows that RORalpha and RORgamma receptors influence the regulation of several metabolic pathways, including those involved in the metabolism of steroids, bile acids, and xenobiotics, suggesting that RORs are important in the control of metabolic homeostasis. Keywords: knockout comparison

DESIGN
We generated RORalpha and RORgamma double knockout (DKO) mice and compared the gene expression profiles of livers from wild type (WT), RORalphasg/sg, RORgamma-/-, and DKO mice by microarray analysis
