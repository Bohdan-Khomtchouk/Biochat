TITLE
Gene and MicroRNA Expression Responses to Exercise; Relationship with Insulin Sensitivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Healthy individuals on the lower end of the insulin sensitivity spectrum also have a reduced gene expression response to exercise for specific genes. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and exercise-induced gene expression in an unbiased, global manner.

DESIGN
Euglycemic clamps were used to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle biopsies were done at rest and 30 minutes after a single acute exercise bout in 14 healthy participants. Changes in mRNA expression were assessed using microarrays [GSE43219], and miRNA analysis was performed in a subset of 6 of the participants using sequencing techniques.
