TITLE
Zeb2 regulates commitment to plasmacytoid dendritic cell and monocyte fate (part 2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have identified Zeb2 as a transcription factor important for the final maturation of natural killer cells and effector CD8+ T cells. We show that Zeb2 is required for the development of two myeloid cell types, the monocyte and the plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and clarify that this factor is not required for the development of classical dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and neutrophils were isolated by FACS from the bone marrow (BM) of untreated or poly(I:C)–treated Zeb2-sufficient mice and from the BM of poly(I:C)–treated Mx1-Cre-driven Zeb2-deficient mice.
