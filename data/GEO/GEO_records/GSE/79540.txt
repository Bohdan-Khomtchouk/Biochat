TITLE
Identification of LncRNA Expression Signatures for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify BCBM-relevant lncRNAs, we assessed the expression profiles of lncRNAs in parental MDA-MB-231 (231-PAR) cells and isogenic brain metastatic cells (231-BRN), which were isolated from brain-seeking 231-PAR cells

DESIGN
LncRNA Expression profiling analysis of the 231-PAR and 231-BRN by Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0.

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
