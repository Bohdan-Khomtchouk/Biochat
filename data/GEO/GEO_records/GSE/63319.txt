TITLE
miRNA expression data from pediatric high grade gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression analysis was performed on 14 cases of high grade gliomas and 4 controls obtained from age-matched epileptic patients. After this differentially miRNA analysis has been done among T53,H3F3A,normal and pediatric high grade glioma patient and try to identify the highly altered  miRNA expression as well as sno expression pattern.

DESIGN
The data was used for identifying TP53 and H3F3A mutation specific miRNA profile
