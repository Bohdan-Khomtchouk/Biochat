TITLE
PIWI-interacting RNAs as novel regulators of pancreatic beta-cell function [p10, adult samples]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
There is mounting evidence indicating that piRNAs are also present in somatic cells where they may accomplish additional regulatory tasks. The aim of this study was to identify the piRNAs expressed in pancreatic islets and to determine whether they are involved in the control of beta-cell activities. piRNA profiling of rat pancreatic islets was performed by microarray. We detected about 18’000 piRNAs in rat pancreatic islets, many of which were differentially expressed throughout islet postnatal development.

DESIGN
Total RNA from two P10 pups islets were pooled while islets from adult rats were extracted individually. 3 Adult rat islets samples and 3 p10 rats islets samples were labeled using a RNA ligase method and were hybridized onto the piRNA Array in Agilent’s SureHyb Hybridization Chambers. The arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C.
