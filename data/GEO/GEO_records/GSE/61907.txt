SUMMARY
Metformin suppressed maturation of human visceral preadipocytes in vitro with upregulation of miR-1246 and miR-3687

DESIGN
Micro RNA expression of HPrAD-vis cells, a cell line of human visceral preadipovytes, with or without administration of metformin for 1 week and 2 weeks were assessed in vitro.
