TITLE
plp2 bc 1-Functional analysis of lipid acyl hydrolases in Arabidopsis antimicrobial defense

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Effects of deregulation of a lipid acyl hydrolase gene (PLP2, At2g26560) on global transcriptome upon infection by Botrytis cinerea. This deregulation affects resistance levels against fungal and bacterial pathogens, likely by perturbing the biosynthesis of oxylipins. Oxylipins are fatty acid-derived compounds (example:jasmonic acid) with diverse signaling or antimicrobial properties. - 2500 spores of Botrytis cinerea were pipetted on 4 infection sites per adult leaf. Leaf material was harvested at 0, 24 and 48 hours. 3 plant genotypes were used (Col-0) : PLP2- silenced (RNAi), control, PLP2-overexpressors. Keywords: normal vs rnai mutant comparison,time course,treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
