TITLE
Reconstruction of gene interaction networks by in vitro RNA interference and global expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here used the technology of RNA interference or selective treatment of the ESR1 and cDNA microarrays to reconstruct a network between genes known to be disregulated in ER-positive breast cancer diseases. Therefor single genes of high importance were silenced and the effect of this pertubation was measured with cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Network Reconstruction, RNAi, siRNA, Interaction Network
