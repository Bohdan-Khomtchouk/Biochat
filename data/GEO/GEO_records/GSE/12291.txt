TITLE
Reconstruction of gene interaction networks by in vitro RNA interference and global expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here used the technology of RNA interference or selective treatment of the ESR1 and cDNA microarrays to reconstruct a network between genes known to be disregulated in ER-positive breast cancer diseases. Therefor single genes of high importance were silenced and the effect of this pertubation was measured with cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Network Reconstruction, RNAi, siRNA, Interaction Network

DESIGN
human ER-positive breast cancer cell line was cultivated as described and transfection with chemically synthesized siRNAs was performed according to standard HiPerFect transfection protocol by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) At least 4 cDNA-microarrays were hybridized in dye-swap method for the silencing of every gene of interest. To minimize off-target effects we used at least two different siRNAs per gene.
