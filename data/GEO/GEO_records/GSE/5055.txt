ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Survey of gene expression in ten common inbred strains of laboratory mouse.  Seven brain regions examined:  amygdala, basal ganglia, cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory bulb. Keywords: Genetic background and brain region Sample data tables were removed because the ID_REF identifiers did not match the platform IDs

DESIGN
Tissue from three animals was pooled on each array.  Three biological replicates per strainxregion condition.  Animals were 4-5 weeks of age.
