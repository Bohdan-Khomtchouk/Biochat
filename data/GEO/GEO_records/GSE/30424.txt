TITLE
Indole-3-Acetaldehyde Inhibits Escherichia coli O157:H7 Biofilm Formation by Reducing Curli Formation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Pathogenic biofilms have been associated with persistent infections due to their high resistance to antimicrobial agents. To identify non-toxic biofilm inhibitors for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, indole-3-acetaldehyde was used and reduced E. coli O157:H7 biofilm formation. Global transcriptome analyses revealed that indole-3-acetaldehyde most repressed two curli operons, csgBAC and csgDEFG, and induced tryptophanase (tnaAB) in E. coli O157:H7 biofilm cells. Electron microscopy showed that indole-3-acetaldehyde reduced curli production in E. coli O157:H7. Together, this study shows that Actinomycetales are an important resource of biofilm inhibitors as well as antibiotics.

DESIGN
For the microarray experiments, E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 was inoculated in 100 ml of LB in 250 ml flasks with overnight cultures that were diluted at 1:100. Cells were shaken with 10g of glass wool at 250 rpm and 37°C for 7 hrs.  Cells were immediately chilled with dry ice and 95% ethanol (to prevent RNA degradation) for 30 sec before centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 13,000 g for 2 min; cell pellets were frozen immediately with dry ice and stored -80°C.  RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini Kit (Valencia, CA, USA). To eliminate DNA contamination, Qiagen RNase-free DNase I was used to digest DNA. RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and quantity was determined by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., DE, USA).
