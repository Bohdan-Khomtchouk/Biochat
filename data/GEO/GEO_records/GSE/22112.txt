TITLE
Rice NSF45K microarray experiment to explain Xa21, NH1 and NRR mediated defense responses in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice Xa21 resistance gene, which encodes a protein with predicted leucine-rich repeat (LRR), transmembrane, juxtamembrane, and intracellular kinase domains, conferred immunity to diverse strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We generated Xa21 plant on TP309 background (Oryza Sativa Japonica). Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) in plants confers durable broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens and requires a phytohormone, salicylic acid (SA). Arabidopsis NPR1/NIM1 is a key regulator of the SAR response. Recently, we found that rice NPR1 homolog 1 (NH1) mediated enhanced resistance responses for Xoo (Chern et al., 2005b). We further investigated relating pathways in rice by identifying proteins that interact with NH1. One of them, constitutive over-expression of NH1 mediated negative regulator of resistance (NRR) gene caused enhanced susceptibility to Xoo , indicating that this gene product negatively affects to basal resistance response (Chern et al., 2005a). To dissect defense responses for rice bacterial blight pathogen, we planed microarray using two resistant mutant named with Xa21-TP309, NH1ox and one super-susceptible mutant (NRRox) before pathogen inoculation and one day post pathogen inoculation. Keywords: Biotic stress response

DESIGN
Two or Three-condition experiment, NH1ox vs wild type control (LG) at two durations of Xoo inoculation (0d and 1d); NRRox vs wild type control (LG) at two durations of Xoo inoculation (0d and 1d); and Xa21vs wild type control (TP309) at three durations of Xoo inoculation (0d,1d and 2d);. Biological replicates: 2 or 4, independently grown and harvested.
