TITLE
Interplay between promoter methylation and chromosomal loss in gene silencing at 3p11-p14 in cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed integrative methylation, gene dosage and expression profiling to explore the interplay between promoter methylation and loss in gene silencing at 3p11-p14 in cervical cancer. Totally 26 hypermethylated genes were identified by comparing the methylation level of individual CpG sites with corresponding data of normal cervical tissue. Candidate methylation regulated genes in tumors were proposed from the correlation between methylation and gene expression. Integrated analysis of methylation, gene dosage and expression revealed three significant regulation patterns encompassing 8 hypermethylated genes; a methylation driven pattern, a gene dosage driven pattern, and a combined methylation and gene dosage driven pattern.  For the LRIG1 gene, patients with both hypermethylation and loss had a worse outcome compared to those harboring only hypermethylation or none of the events. C3orf14 emerged as a novel methylation regulated suppressor gene, for which knockdown was found to promote invasive growth in human papilloma virus (HPV)-transformed keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Methylation levels from Illumina 450K methylation arrays were correlated with Illumina gene expression data in cohort 1 and validated in cohort 2.
