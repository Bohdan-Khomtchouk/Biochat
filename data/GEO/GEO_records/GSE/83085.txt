TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis of gene changes in Huh7 cells treated with IFN-λ4, IFN-λ1 and IFN-α

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The change of gene expression in Huh7 cells treated with IFN-λ4, IFN-λ1 and IFN-α was analyzed at 0h, 6h and 16h after different interferon treatments.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells that had been treated with IFN-α (10 IU/ml), IFN-λ1 (20 ng/ml) and IFN-λ4 (20 ng/ml). Time points of 6 h and 16 h after stimulation were selected.
