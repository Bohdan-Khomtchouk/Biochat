SUMMARY
Mutations of the proto-oncogene KRas, together with the inactivation of the onco-suppressor genes APC and TP53, are considered to have an important role both in the carcinogenesis and in the colorectal tumor progression. The oncogene K-ras has activating mutations, especially in codon 12, in about 40% to 50% of colorectal carcinomas (Andreyev et al., 1998). The mechanism by which oncogenic K-ras alone contribuites to tumor progression in colon cancer is largely unknown. To this end, we have developed a model system where the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Colo741 has been stably trasfected with the Kras-G12V or Kras-G12D mutated oncogenes. Our results demonstrate how expression profiling data can be used to interpret changes in cellular characteristics induced by transfection and hence provide some clues as to the mechanisms by which different activated K-Ras impair processes mediated by endogenous wild-type KRas proteins.
