TITLE
miRNA expression data from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line BxPC3 and its cisplatin-resistant derivative BxPC3-R

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Differential expression of miRNAs between parental and cisplatin-resistant PDAC cells was analyzed to elucidate the role of miRNAs in the acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to cisplatin. Cisplatin-resistant BxPC3-R cells were developed from the parental BxPC3 cell line by culturing them in medium with step-wise increasing concentration of cisplatin.
