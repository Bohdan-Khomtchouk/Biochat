TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of AR-responsive gene expression in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of AR-regulation of  gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that AR influences the expression of genes that participate in important bioprocesses in  prostate cancer cells, including cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair. Results provide important information on AR-responsive genes that may be crucial to the cell survival and the progression of prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from AR siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells compared to negative control siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells 48 h after siRNa transfection.
