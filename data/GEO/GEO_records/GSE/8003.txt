TITLE
CD34 Overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of CD34 antigen in haematopoietic commitment, we overexpressed the human CD34 cDNA in human CD34+ cells by retroviral gene transfer. Keywords: treatment comparison

DESIGN
In a set of 10 independent experiments, gene transfer efficiency, assessed by flow cytometry analysis of ΔLNGFR positivity, ranged 15 to 30%. Transduced cells were than purified for NGFR expression at day 3 of liquid culture with the retroviral vector. Phenotypic analysis, performed on transduced/NGFR purified cells evidenced that the CD34 transgene was highly expressed at the protein level (80% of LCD34IΔN vs 30% of controls at 5 days post-infection) up to 14 days of liquid culture.
