TITLE
Gene expression signature of Gata6 positive epidermal cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize gene expression in Gata6 positive epidermal cells we analyzed a Gata6 reporter mouse in which the endogenous Gata6 promoter drives expression of mTomato. We performed flow cytometry followed by transcriptome analysis. We compared four subpopulations of telogen epidermal cells: Gata6+/Itga6+ cells, Gata6+/itga6- cells, CD34+/Itga6+ cells (which are Gata6-) and all remaining Itga6+ cells (Gata6-/CD34-). The RNA was isolated from age and sex matched mice.

DESIGN
We compared four subpopulations of telogen epidermal cells: Gata6+/Itga6+ cells, Gata6+/itga6- cells, CD34+/Itga6+ cells (which are Gata6-) and all remaining Itga6+ cells (Gata6-/CD34-). The RNA was isolated from age and sex matched mice. Three biological replicates for each cell population were analyzed
