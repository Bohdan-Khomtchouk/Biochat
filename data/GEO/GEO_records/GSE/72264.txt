TITLE
The comparison of MicroRNA profile of the dermis between young and old human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin aging is a process of structural and compositional remolding that can be manifested as wrinkling and sagging. Remarkably, the dermis plays a dominant role in the process of skin aging. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in the regulation of gene expression in organism aging. However, studies about age-related miRNAs in human skin remain limited. In order to obtain an overall view of miRNAs expression in human aged dermis, we have investigated the alteration of microRNAs during aging by examining biopsies of human dermis from 12 young and aged donors, and demonstrated that numerous microRNAs showed significant alteration in dermis tissue.

DESIGN
Normal human dermal tissue from 12 consenting individuals. Old group vs young group. Old group: with the age over 60 years old; young group: with the age below 10 years old; each group was constituted of 6 individuals.
