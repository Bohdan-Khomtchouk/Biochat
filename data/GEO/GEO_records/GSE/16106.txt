TITLE
PKGI KO vs. WT brown adipocytes and brown adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in brown adipose tissue and in primary adipocytes derived thereof from PKGI-/- mice was studied in comparison to wild type mice.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in triplicate, i.e three PKGI-/- mice and matching wt littermates were used for brown adipocyte preparation; another three mouse pairs were used for tissue preparation.

PLATFORM
