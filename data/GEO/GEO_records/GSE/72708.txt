TITLE
Akt regulates Progesterone Receptor B transcription

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Progestins have long been used clinically for the treatment of endometrial cancers, however, the response rates to progestin therapy vary and the molecular mechanisms behind progestin insensitivity are poorly understood. We hypothesized that in PTEN mutated endometrial cancers, hyperactive Akt signaling downregulates Progesterone Receptor B (PRB) transcriptional activity, leading to overall impaired progestin responses. We report that knockdown of Akt is sufficient to upregulate a subset of PRB target genes.

DESIGN
PRB-Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells were transfected with either siCtrl or siAkt1, siAkt2, and siAkt3. Cells were then serum starved overnight and then treated with either Ethanol Vehicle Control or 10 nM R5020 for 24 hrs. Each treatment was performed in triplicate.
