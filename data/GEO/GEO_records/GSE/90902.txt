TITLE
Cohesins and condensins orchestrate the 4D dynamics of yeast chromosomes during the cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The duplication and segregation of chromosomes involve the dynamic re-organization of their internal structure by conserved architectural proteins, such as structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes (i.e., cohesin and condensin). Although the roles of these factors is actively investigated, a genome-wide view of chromosome dynamic architecture at both small and large-scales during cell division remains elusive. Here we report the first comprehensive 4D analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome higher-order organization during the cell cycle, and investigate the roles of SMC in the observed structural transitions. During replication, cohesion establishment promotes long-range intra-chromosomal contacts and correlates with the individualization of chromosomes, which culminates at metaphase. Mitotic chromosomes are then abruptly reorganized in anaphase by mechanical forces exerted by the mitotic spindle. The formation of a condensin-dependent loop, that bridges the centromere cluster with the rDNA loci, suggests that condensin-mediated forces may also directly facilitate segregation. This work provides a comprehensive overview of chromosome dynamics during the cell cycle of a unicellular eukaryote that recapitulates and unveils new features of highly conserved stages of the cell division.
