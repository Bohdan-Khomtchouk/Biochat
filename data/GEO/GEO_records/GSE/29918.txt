TITLE
Expression data from LCL samples from patients with global developmental delay and autistic features and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the whole-genome mRNA expression profiling of cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from patients (n=2), carriers (n=2), and unrelated normal controls (n=3), all performed in duplicates using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays, to identify genes and pathways that are significantly dysregulated in affected individuals. Moreover, we have performed global transcriptional profiling in whole blood from patients (n=2) and healthy controls (n=13) using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Global transcriptional profiling of affected individuals and controls revealed significant alterations of genes and pathways in a pattern consistent with previous microarray studies of autism spectrum disorder patients.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene-level expression changes for samples from cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with global developmental delay and autistic features (n=2), carriers (n=2), and unrelated healthy controls (n=3), all performed in duplicate, using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays.
