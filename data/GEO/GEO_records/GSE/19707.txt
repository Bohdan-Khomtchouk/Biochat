TITLE
Expression data from Th2 cell of ECM1 KO mice vs WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+ helper T cells are critical for immunological response. Th2 cells, a subset of CD4+ helper T cells, are responsible for asthma and other immune diseases. We found a Th2 secreted protein, ExtraCellular Matrix protein 1 (ECM1), which is highly induced by classic IL-4 signaling pathway during helper T cells differentiation. We used microarrays to clarify the global programme of gene expression difference underlying fully developed Th2 cells from WT and ECM1 KO mice and identified distinct classes of up and down regulated genes by ECM1.

DESIGN
Na√Øve CD4+ T cells are seperated from WT and ECM1 mice, cultured and harveseted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
