TITLE
WRKY6 Transcription Factor Restricts Arsenate Uptake and Transposon Activation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Stress constantly challenges plant adaptation to the environment.  Of all stress types, arsenic was a major threat during the early evolution of plants.  The most prevalent chemical form of arsenic is arsenate, whose similarity to phosphate renders it easily incorporated into cells via the phosphate transporters.  Here we found that arsenate stress provokes a notable transposon burst in plants, in coordination with arsenate/phosphate transporter repression, which immediately restricts arsenate uptake.  This repression was accompanied by delocalization of the phosphate transporter from the plasma membrane.  When arsenate was removed, the system rapidly restored transcriptional expression and membrane localization of the transporter.  We identify WRKY6 as an arsenate-responsive transcription factor that mediates arsenate/phosphate transporter gene expression and restricts arsenate-induced transposon activation.  Plants therefore have a dual WRKY-dependent signaling mechanism that modulates arsenate uptake and transposon expression, providing a coordinated strategy for arsenate tolerance and transposon gene silencing.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were performed for each sample type. Single channel hybridizations were carried-out using either Affymetrix ATH1 platform or Nimblegen Gene Expression 12x135K platform (Arabidopsis thaliana).
