TITLE
Expression data from +Pi and -Pi treeatment between WT and spx1spx2 double mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Fourteen days plants growth under hydroponic +P condition (200 µM) were treated with +P(200µM) or –P (no phosphate) for another 7 days, shoot of plants from 3 biological repeats were sampled for Affymetrix microarray analysis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying +Pi and -Pi condition between WT and spx1spx2 double mutant.

DESIGN
Fourteen days plants growth under hydroponic +P condition (200 µM) were treated with +P(200µM) or –P (no phosphate) for another 7 days, shoot of plants from 3 biological repeats were sampled for Affymetrix microarray analysis.
