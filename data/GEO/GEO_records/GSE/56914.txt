TITLE
Plasma microRNA profile in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify the ebbrantly hypothesized that circulating miRNA profile might reflect the miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH more comprehensively, thus could be used as candidate biomarker and shed light on the recognition of CTEPH pathogenesis.

DESIGN
In this presented study, 10 CTEPH patients without any drug treatment for pulmonary hypertension except anticoagulation before blood collection and 10 healthy controls paired in age and gender were enrolled. The exclusion criteria included malignancies, other cardiovascular diseases, and patients who had ever received any treatment for pulmonary hypertension except for anticoagulation.
