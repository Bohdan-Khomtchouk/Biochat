TITLE
Genetic-to-epigenetic Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized RNA-Seq to define molecular markers for the effect of chaetocin and MLN8237 combination. PDAC cells were treated with individual drugs or their combination and compared to vehicle. Treatment was limited to 24 hours to extract RNA before significant mitotic catastrophe occurred to capture the transcriptional effect.

DESIGN
PANC-1 mRNA profiles following 24 hrs of treatment with vehicle (DMSO), chaetocin (30nM), MLN8237 (90nM) or a combination of chaetocin(30nM)+MLN3237(90nM). Each condition was performed in triplicate.
