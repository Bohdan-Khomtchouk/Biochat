TITLE
Identification of genes expressed preferentially in the developing peripheral margin of the optic cup

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes expressed in a preferential manner in the developing ciliary body/iris will provide a starting point for future functional analyses.  To identify candidate genes expressed in a variety of ocular tissues during development, we have profiled single cells from the developing eye. Post hoc identification of the origin of these cells showed that they included cells from the periphery of the developing optic cup.  By comparing the expression profiles of these cells to many retinal cell types, candidate genes for preferential expression in the periphery were identified.
