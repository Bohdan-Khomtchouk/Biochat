TITLE
Identification of genes expressed preferentially in the developing peripheral margin of the optic cup

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes expressed in a preferential manner in the developing ciliary body/iris will provide a starting point for future functional analyses.  To identify candidate genes expressed in a variety of ocular tissues during development, we have profiled single cells from the developing eye. Post hoc identification of the origin of these cells showed that they included cells from the periphery of the developing optic cup.  By comparing the expression profiles of these cells to many retinal cell types, candidate genes for preferential expression in the periphery were identified.

DESIGN
Single retinal cells were isolated in tubes containing lysis buffer, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays and the data was normalized using MAS5.0 software.  Since the retinal cells isolated during these developmental times had not yet adopted their mature morphologies, a post hoc strategy was employed to classify each cell based upon the expression of clusters of genes (Trimarchi et al., 2008).  This classification method allowed for the identification of 21 single cells as developing retinal ganglion (RGC), amacrine (AC) or photoreceptor cells (PR) (Trimarchi et al., 2007) and an additional 42 cells as cycling RPCs (Trimarchi et al., 2008).  However, a number of the single cells did not score significantly for any of the retinal cell types.  Two cells in particular expressed genes that suggested these cells originated from the developing ciliary body/iris region.
