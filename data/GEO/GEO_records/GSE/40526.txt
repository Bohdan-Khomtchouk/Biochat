TITLE
A transcriptomic analysis of the response of S. cerevisiae EC1118 to nitrogen supplementation during the stationary phase of four-stages continuous fermentation (FSCF)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The first aim was to investigate the suitability of FSCF to analyze yeast physiology during the stationary phase of wine making. In this way, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on mRNA samples collected from the third stage of FSCF and from batch culture, at the same fermentation progress (164 g/L residual glucose). In a second part, FSCF device was used to study the impact at the transcriptomic level of nitrogen addition performed at the beginning of the stationary phase. Gene expression profiles were compared at steady state between cells from the third stage of FSCF operating in presence or absence of continuous valine or ammonium perfusion.

DESIGN
4 conditions with 3 or 4 replicates compared: B (stationary phase of batch fermentation), WA (third stage of four-stage continuous fermentation without nitrogen addition), AA (ammonium supplementation in third stage of four-stages continuous fermentation) and VA (valine supplementation in third  stage of four-stages continuous fermentation)
