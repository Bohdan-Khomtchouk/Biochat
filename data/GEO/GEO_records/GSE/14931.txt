TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of MLL5 Knock down vs. control C2C12 myoblasts (S phase enriched)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Knockdown of MLL5 led to deregulation of S phase. To understand the molecular basis for this phenotype, we performed microarray analysis of S phase synchronized myoblasts. Genes differentially regulated by MLL5 knock down were revealed by microarray analysis using NIA15K mouse chips.

DESIGN
Control and knock down cells were synchronized at G0 by suspension culture and reactivated to enter S phase by replating for 24hrs in growth medium.
