TITLE
Expression data in S2 cells with or without dSTING knockdown followed by dsDNA treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
S2 cells were treated with dsRNA targeting dSTING (dSTING RNAi) or non-specifically (control). 90-mer dsDNA (dsDNA90) was then transfected, which activates dSTING. Mock transfection was performed in the absence of dsDNA90 using lipofectamine alone. Affymetrix arrays were used to profile gene expression.

DESIGN
Determining the effect of dSTING knockdown in dsDNA-transfected S2 cells on gene expression profiles was the overall goal of this project.
