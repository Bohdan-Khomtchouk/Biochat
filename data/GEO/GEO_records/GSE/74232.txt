TITLE
The effect of Heterogeneous Transcription Start Sites (TSS) on the Translatome: Implications for the Mammalian Cellular Phenotype.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sequencing of total RNA and polysomal RNA of two cell lines, MCF7 (tumoral) and MCF10A (non-tumoral)

DESIGN
Polysomal and total RNA was prepared from biological triplicates from the two cell lines.  For each biological triplicate sub-confluent cell monolyers were lysed to produce cytoplasmic extracts. Half of each extract was fractionated on a sucrose gradient and the polysomal fraction recovered. Polysomal-associated RNA was recovered by Trizol extraction. From the second half of each sample total cyoplasmic RNA was recovered (Trizol extraction).
