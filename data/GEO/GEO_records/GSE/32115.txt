TITLE
MiRNA array based, miRNA expression profiles of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression profiles were successfully examined through expression profiling of a total of 656 miRNAs between 2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues (C) and their paired adjacent normal mucousal tissues (AN).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues (C) and their paired adjacent normal mucousal tissues (AN) were examined by miRNA array
