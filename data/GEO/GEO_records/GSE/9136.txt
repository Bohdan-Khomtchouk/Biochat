TITLE
Induction of DAN/TIR yeast cell wall mannoprotein genes in response to high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied following changes in growth conditions to high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature. These profiles were quantitatively very similar, encompassing 561 co-upregulated genes and 161 co-downregulated genes. In particular, expression of the DAN/TIR cell wall mannoprotein genes, which are generally expressed under hypoxia, were markedly upregulated by high pressure and low temperature, suggesting the overlapping regulatory networks of transcription. In support of the role of the mannoproteins in cell wall integrity, cells acquired resistance against treatment with SDS, Zymolyase and  lethal level of high pressure when preincubated under high pressure and low temperature. Keywords: stress response
