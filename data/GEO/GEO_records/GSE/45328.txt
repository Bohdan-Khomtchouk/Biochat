TITLE
Inactivation of TP53 correlates with disease progression and low miR-34a expression in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Micro-RNA expression data of CD19 selected B-cells from previously treated and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We aimed to correlate miR-34a with TP53 mutation status and del17p status.

DESIGN
CD19 B-cells from previously treated and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
