TITLE
Human mural trophectoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The trophoblast cell lineage is specified as early as the blastocyst stage, leading to the individualization of trophectoderm from pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass. We used a double in vitro transcription mRNA amplification technique and compared trophectoderm with pluripotent stem cells.
