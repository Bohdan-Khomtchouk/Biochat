TITLE
Aging effects on DNA methylation modules in blood tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of whole blood in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Raw data included 325 schizophrenia patients (2) and 394 controls (1) from Dutch descent. One sample was excluded since it was a bipolar patient, indicated by 3 in diseaseStatus column. The column used_in_analysis shows the samples that were used in our study. The excluded samples failed quality control. Normalized data are also included in the non_normalized.txt (i.e. AVG_Beta column).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 720 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip [Publication: Horvath et al., Genome Biology, Special Edition]
