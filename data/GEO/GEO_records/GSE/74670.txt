TITLE
The differentially expressed genes in rice jmj704 mutants revealed through RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from two-week old rice seedlings of  jmj704 and wild-type (ZH11) plants  to obtain the differntially expressed genes in jmj704 mutant.

DESIGN
exzamination the differentially expressed genes between two-week old jmj704 and wild-type (ZH11) rice seedlings.
