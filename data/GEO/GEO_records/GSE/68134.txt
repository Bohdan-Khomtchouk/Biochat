TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from individuals with Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD), a class of peroxisome biogenesis disorder, and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zellweger spectrum disorder (PBD-ZSD) is a disease continuum caused by mutations in a subset of PEX genes required for normal peroxisome assembly and function. Their clinical manifestations highlight the importance of peroxisomes in the development and functions of the central nervous system, liver, and other organs. Although much is known about peroxisome assembly and activities, the underlying bases for the cell-type specificity of disease are not fully elucidated. We reprogrammed skin fibroblasts from PBD-ZSD patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and report their DNA methylation profiles as well as those of matching healthy controls.

DESIGN
Dermal fibroblast cultures from 6 PBD-ZSD patient and 3 healthy control donors were reprogrammed into iPSCs by transfection with retroviruses designed to express the human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC genes. Fibroblasts and iPSCs were cultured in 1:1 ratio of DMEM:F12 medium supplemented with 20% KSR at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 until confluence for RNA extraction. The overall goal was to confirm the epigenetic reprogramming of iPSCs and identify loci that are differentially methylated between PBD-ZSD patient and healthy control cells in order to gain insights into the pathomechanisms of disease.
