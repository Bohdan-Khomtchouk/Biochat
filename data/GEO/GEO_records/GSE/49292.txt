TITLE
Cloning Barrett’s esophagus stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus is a precancerous lesion that confers a significant risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Strategies for selective eradication of Barrett’s have been stymied by our inability to identify the Barrett’s stem cell.  Here we employ novel technologies to clone patient-matched stem cells of Barrett’s, gastric, and esophageal epithelium.  Genomic analyses of Barrett’s stem cells reveal a patient-specific mutational spectrum ranging from low somatic variation similar to patient-matched gastric epithelial stem cells to ones marked by extensive heterozygous alteration of genes implicated in tumor suppression, epithelial planarity, and epigenetic regulation.  Transplantation of transformed Barrett’s stem cells yields tumors with hallmarks of esophageal adenocarcinoma, whereas transformed esophageal stem cells yield squamous cell carcinomas.  Thus Barrett’s develops from cells distinct from local eponymous epithelia, emerges without obvious driver mutations, and likely progresses through and from the generation of dominant clones. These findings define a stem cell target for preemptive therapies of a precancerous lesion.
