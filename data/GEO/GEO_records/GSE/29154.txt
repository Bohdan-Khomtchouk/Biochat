TITLE
Identification of drought-responsive microRNAs in Medicago truncatula by genome-wide high-throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Two hundreds eighty three and 293 known miRNAs were identified from the control and drought stress libraries, respectively. In addition, 253 potential candidate miRNAs were identified, and among them 48 novel miRNAs/ novel members of known miRNA families whose complementary miRNAs were also detected. Both high-throughput sequencing and RT-qPCR confirmed that 22 members of 4 miRNA families were up-regulated and 10 members of 6 miRNA families were down-regulated in response to drought stress. Among the 48 novel miRNAs, 24 miRNAs were responsive to drought stress with 21 and 3 miRNAs being up- and down-regulated, respectively. The known and predicted targets of these miRNAs in response to drought stress are involved in diverse cellular processes in plants, such as development, transcription, protein degradation, detoxification, nutrient status and cross adaptation.

DESIGN
To identify miRNAs in response to drought stress in M. truncatula, control and drought stress shoots were used to construct small RNA libraries, respectively. The date from Solexa sequencer (Illumina) was compared to identify miRNAs in response to drought stress.
