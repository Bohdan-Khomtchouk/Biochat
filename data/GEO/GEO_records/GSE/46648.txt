TITLE
Identification of  DNA methylation changes in monocytes to osteoclast differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Conversion of monocytes to osteoclasts is a unique terminal differentiation process within the hematopoietic system involving differentiation and massive cell fusion. Here we focused on DNA methylation changes during osteoclastogenesis. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation changes took place in several thousand genes, including all relevant functional categories in osteoclast differentiation and function.

DESIGN
Comparison between the DNA methylation levels of  CD14+ monocytes and derived osteoclast from 3 female donors. Bisulphite converted DNA from the 6 samples was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
