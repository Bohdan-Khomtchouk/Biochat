TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Retinoblastoma Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methods:  mRNA profiles of retinoblastoma samples and para-tumor were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays

DESIGN
Retinoblastoma mRNA of retinoblastoma were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina.

PLATFORM
