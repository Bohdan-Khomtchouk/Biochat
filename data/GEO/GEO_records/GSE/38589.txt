TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression alterations of sorted LysM-KI LSK cells versus control LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes between bone marrow isolated  haematopoeietic cell populations (LSK cells: Lin-Sca1+cKit+) populations of control and mutant (LysM-KI) mice.   The LysM-KI mouse is a murine model which expresses an Idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) mutation (Idh1-R132H) in cells of the myeloid lineage.  Mutations in IDH1 (and IDH2) in humans are commonly found in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia as well as glioblastomas. The current study was initiated to understand how these mutations may affect leukemogenesis and myeloid cell development.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bone marrow sorted LSK cells of mutant LysM-KI and control individual mice.
