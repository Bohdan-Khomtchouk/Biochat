TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of microRNA expression in neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cardiovascular stem cells were isolated from adult (57-75 year old) and neonatal ( < 1 month old) atrial tissue.  Cardiovascular stem cells were then cloned by single cell dilution and compared using sabiosciences cell development & differentiation miRNA PCR array.

DESIGN
microRNA expression profiling by RT-PCR,  3 cardiac progenitor cell clones isolated from adults were run separately and results were pooled and compared to 8 neonatal cardiovascular progenitor cell clones that were run separately and pooled.
