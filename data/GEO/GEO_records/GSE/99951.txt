TITLE
Maturation of Human iPSC-derived Astrocytes in 3D Cortical Spheroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-cell RNA-seq: We used single-cell RNAseq to investigate the maturation of astrocytes within human cortical spheroids Bulk RNA-seq: Bulk sequencing from astrocytes and neurons purified (via immunopanning) from iPSC-derived coritical spheroids at varying in vitro differentiation states

DESIGN
Single-cell RNA-seq: Examination of neurons and glia from dissociated hCS at varying in vitro differentiation stages Bulk RNA-seq: Transcriptomic profiling of iPSC-derived human astrocytes and neurons from 3D cultures
