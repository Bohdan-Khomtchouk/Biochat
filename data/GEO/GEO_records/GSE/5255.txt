TITLE
Loss of BMPR2 Signaling in Smooth Muscle in Mouse Lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice expressing a doxycycline-inducible dominant negative BMPR2 transgene expressed only in smooth muscle are activated for one or eight weeks, and compared to transactivator-only mice also fed doxycycline. All mice are 12 weeks of old at sacrifice. Keywords: time course with SM22-rtTA x tetO7-BMPR2 transgene

DESIGN
Each chip is a pool of three individual mice, to reduce variability. The transactivator-only mice are controls. The other mice all had elevated RV pressures at time of sacrifice. RNA was prepared from whole lung.
