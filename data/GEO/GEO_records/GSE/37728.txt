TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the immature lifestages in feeding Rhipicephalus microplus cattle ticks

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of whole nymphs and larvae from Rhipicephalus microplus at day 4 and 7 post infestation, respectively. This enabled the identification of transcripts that are stage-specific or shared among the stages tested.

DESIGN
Reference pool design: Each tissue tested was compared to a reference pool comprising ticks (immature to adult stages) sampled on day 4, 5, 7, 13, 15 and tissues collected on day 20 post infestation. Biological replicates: 2; Technical replicates: 2.

PLATFORM
GPL15231 Agilent-024497 BmicroplusEST_1 custom array (Feature Number version)
