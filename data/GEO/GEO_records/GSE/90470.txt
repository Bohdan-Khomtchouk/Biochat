TITLE
Id2 controls specification of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell progenitors during gut development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To follow the changes in the transcriptional programs accompanying the specification of the adult ISCs we sequenced whole transcriptomes of embryonic intestinal epithelium progenitors (at E11.5 and E12.5) and adult ISCs. EpCAM positive embryonic gut epithelium was isolated from dissected small intestines using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Adult ISCs were purified on the basis of GFP fluorescence from crypts of Lgr5GFP-Cre-ERT mice (Barker et al. 2007) Double positive adlut ISCs were isolated by FACS based on GFP and tdTomato fluorescence.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells from two embryonic stages (E11.5 and E13.5), mesenchymal (E11.5) and adult Lgr5+ ISCs were used. For embryonic stages biological triplicates were analysed. For the adult ISCs either 4 biological replicates ot duplicates were analysed.
