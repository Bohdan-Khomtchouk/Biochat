TITLE
Expression data from human bronchial airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interleukin (IL)-17 plays an important and protective role in host defence and has been demonstrated to orchestrate airway inflammation by cooperating with and inducing proinflammatory cytokines. Mircoarrays were used to identify immediate-early/ primary response IL-17A-dependent gene transcripts in primary human bronchial ASM cells from mild asthmatic and healthy individuals.

DESIGN
To evaluate IL-17A-inducible gene transcripts, primary human bronchial ASM cells from 3 mild asthmatic and 3 healthy donors were treated for 2h with IL-17 [10ng/ml] and were probed with the Affymetrix GeneChip array. The 2h time point was carefully chosen in order to identify primary response gene targets and to avoid confounding autocrine mechanisms mediating indirect, or late-phase gene expression responses. Non-stimulated ASM cells from the same patients were used as controls.
