TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression patterns responding to TSA treatment during hESC neural differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the differential roles of an HDAC inhibitor-TSA during hESC nerual commitment. In the initiation of hESC differentiation, TSA could inhibit the downregulation of pluripotency genes to maintain pluripotency, whereas in the neural commitment stage, TSA could promote neural gene expression to assist hESC nerual determination.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression patterns in hESCs, day 4 or day 8 differentiated cells without or with TSA treatment

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
