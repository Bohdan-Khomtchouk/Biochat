TITLE
Expression data from BCL6-YFP-positive Tfh cells, BCL6-YFP-negative Tfh cells, non-Tfh cells, and na√Øve helper T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that a number of Tfh cells downmodulated BCL6 protein after their development, and we sought to compare the gene expression between BCL6-hi Tfh cells and BCL6-low Tfh cells.
