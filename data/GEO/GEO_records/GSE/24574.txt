TITLE
Expression data from BCL6-YFP-positive Tfh cells, BCL6-YFP-negative Tfh cells, non-Tfh cells, and na√Øve helper T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that a number of Tfh cells downmodulated BCL6 protein after their development, and we sought to compare the gene expression between BCL6-hi Tfh cells and BCL6-low Tfh cells.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were sorted from immunized and non-immunized mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Bcl6yfp/+ OT-II cells were transferred to congenic recipient mice, and immunized with NP-OVA in CFA subcutaneously. Seven or ten days after immunization, cells were collected from draining lymph nodes, and sorted on FACSAria by the expression of CXCR5, PD-1 and BCL6-YFP. Naive CD4+ T cells were CD4+ CD44lo CD62Lhi cells from unimmunized mice.
