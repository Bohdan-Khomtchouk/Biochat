TITLE
normal and diabetic rat muscle treated and untreated with vanadyl sulfate

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RNA was obtained from rear leg muscle of normal and diabetic rats in the presence and absence of oral treatment with vandyl sulfate. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin and expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Rat Genechip U34A.  The effect of treatment and disease on gene expression was examined. Keywords: vanadium treatment

DESIGN
4 groups (normal, diabetic, normal treated with vanadyl sulfate and diabetic treated with vanadyl sulfate) with 5 replicates in each group were analyzed. PMID:16403228 discusses 2 groups (normal, diabetic). PMID:16684804 discusses all four groups.
