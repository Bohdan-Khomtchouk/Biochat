TITLE
Profling of the Drosophila melanogaster neuronal microRNA transcriptome by small RNA deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in the coordination and/or fine-tuning of gene expression. As such, miRNAs are thought to be critical cis-acting regulatory factors that control a wide range of physiological processes in the brain. The datasets presented here represent the miRNA transcriptome of the adult and larval Drosophila melanogaster CNS as determined by small RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). They were derived from adult and larval samples explanted from the animal that contain minimal extraneous (non-neuronal) tissues. Here we present a concise summary of our profiling results as well as the original sequencing data. We identify many miRNAs that are expressed at equal levels in both tissues and several that are significantly enriched in the larval and adult brain. Some of these belong to miRNA families with conserved members in mammals. These datasets should provide a good starting point for others interested in characterizing miRNAs with putative functions in Drosophila neurons.
