SUMMARY
Enlargement of normal terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) by hyperplastic columnar epithelial cells is one of the most common abnormalities of growth in the adult female human breast.  These hyperplastic enlarged lobular units (HELUs) are important clinically as the earliest histologically identifiable potential precursor of breast cancer.  The causes of the hyperplasia are unknown but may include estrogen-simulated growth mediated by estrogen receptor alpha, which is highly elevated in HELUs and may be fundamental to their development. This study used DNA microarray technology and RNA from microdissected pure epithelial cells to learn more about changes in gene expression and molecular pathways associated with the development of HELUs from TDLUs Keywords: Identification of early cancer precursors
