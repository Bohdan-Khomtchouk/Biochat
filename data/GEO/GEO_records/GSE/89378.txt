TITLE
Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq of sorted and micro-dissected mouse bone marrow and fetal liver cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We here systematically studied the interaction network of bone marrow cells. To this end, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs, to infer cell identity. After grouping the cells into cell types (based on the single-cell transcriptomes), we identified actual physical interactions that occurred more, or less, than what would be expected by chance.

DESIGN
After mild dissociation of the bone marrow or fetal liver, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs. We also sorted single bone marrow cells. Finally we sorted 2000 or single neutrophils (Gr1+ CD115-) from control or megakaryocyte depleted mice.
