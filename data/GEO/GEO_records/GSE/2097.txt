TITLE
Epigenetic treatment of cervical carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Four cervical carcinoma cell lines (C4I, CaSki, HeLa, SiHa) were treated with epigenetic modifying drugs 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A.  Such treatment leads to reactivation of genes that are epigenetically silenced in cancer by aberrant methylation; reactivated genes were then identified by microarray profiling.  Subsets consist of 2 biological repeats and 2 dye-flip experiments for each repeat for CaSki cell line, and 3 repeats, each with 2 dye-flip experiments for C4I, HeLa, Caski cell lines.  The identification of reactivated genes, their selection for validation experiments, and final identification of 6 genes that are significantly more often hypermethylated in cervical carcinoma clinical specimens is described in (manuscript submitted).
