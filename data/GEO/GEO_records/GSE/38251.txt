TITLE
Expression data of 4T1 mammary cancer cells cultured in MSC-conditioned medium or co-cultured with MSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
4T1 mammary cancer cells exihibit higher proliferation and metastatic ability when cultured in conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells . Also, co-implantation with MSCs, 4T1 tumors show higher tumor growth and metastasis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the alteration of cell behaviour

DESIGN
RNA was extrated from 4T1 cells cultured in MSC-CM or regular medium as well as 4T1 cells isolated from co-cultured with MSCs. Gene expression of these cell groups was acquired from Affymetrix microarray analysis using mouse 430 2.0 array chip.
