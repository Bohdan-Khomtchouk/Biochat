TITLE
Alteration of mRNA and microRNA expression profiles in rat muscular type vasculature in early postnatal development [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study tested the hypothesis that mRNA expression profiles change in the muscular type rat saphenous artery during early postnatal development. To explore this, we performed mRNA microarray analysis on muscular type saphenous arteries of young (10-12 days) and adult (2-3 months) rats.

DESIGN
For one sample four saphenous arteries from 2 young animals (n = 4 samples per group) or two saphenous arteries from one adult animal (n = 4 samples per group) were used to profile mRNA (n = 8; GeneChip® Rat Gene 1.0) expression changes during the muscular type rat saphenous artery during early postnatal development. In this study, 10-12 days old (“young”) and 2 - 3 months old (“adult”) male Wistar rats.
