TITLE
Exposure of Feathead Minnows to Municipal Wastewater Effluent Inhibits the Canonical Wnt Signaling Pathway in the Liver

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
Municipal wastewater effluent can impact its receiving environment. In the St. Lawrence River, male fish living downstream from Montreal exhibit increased hepatic vitellogenin, intersex, delayed spermatogenesis and altered immune function. Few studies have examined genome-wide effects associated with municipal effluent exposure in fish to decipher the mechanisms of toxicity. The present objective was to identify hepatic cellular signaling pathways in fathead minnows following exposure to municipal wastewater effluent. Immature minnows were exposed for 21 days to either 0% (Control) or 20% municipal effluent, the highest concentration in the St. Lawrence River. Hepatic RNA was extracted and used to hybridize a fathead minnow oligonucleotide microarray containing approximately 15K gene sequences.

DESIGN
Sixteen samples were examined, 8 control samples and 8 exposed samples.
