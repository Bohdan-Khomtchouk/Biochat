TITLE
Transcriptional screening in MDA-231 cells treated with low-dose Paclitaxel for 24 and 48 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paclitaxel is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in breast cancer treatment. Notably, a comprehensive understanding of paclitaxel’s effects requires insight into the dose-specific activities of paclitaxel and their influence on the cancer cells and host microenvironment. The aim of our study is to reveal the gene transcriptional changes in response to low-Paclitaxel (PTX) treatment in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
For genome-wide gene expression analysis, MDA-MB-231 cells (high-invasive breast cancer cell line) were treated with 5 ng/ml PTX for 24 and 48 hours respectively and then the cell lysates were prepared by TRIzol reagent. Then the total RNA in each group was extracted and the genome-wide gene expressing profile was detected through the Human One Array (HOA) Microarray system (Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan).
