TITLE
Expression Profiling of Androgen Receptor and Vitamin D Receptor Mediated Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of gene expression profiles using the whole genomewide microarray analysis in LNCaP cells (AR+, p53wt) when treated with 5nM testosterone and 100nM 1,25(OH)2D3 alone or in combination. Comparisons between each treatment groups provide evidence for the crosstalk between VDR and AR mediated signaling events at the transcriptional levels, which may have significant clinical impact in patient care.
