TITLE
Expression Profiling of Androgen Receptor and Vitamin D Receptor Mediated Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of gene expression profiles using the whole genomewide microarray analysis in LNCaP cells (AR+, p53wt) when treated with 5nM testosterone and 100nM 1,25(OH)2D3 alone or in combination. Comparisons between each treatment groups provide evidence for the crosstalk between VDR and AR mediated signaling events at the transcriptional levels, which may have significant clinical impact in patient care.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments were carried out in LNCaP cells, which were treated with ethanol control (no exogenous androgen), 5nM testosterone, 100nM 1,25(OH)2D3, and the combination of testosterone and 1,25(OH)2D3. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates using QIAGEN midiRNeasy kit after 48h of treatment. The samples were run on 12 chips such that each chip measures the expression levels of 24,000 genes from Homo sapiens with 60-mer probe pairs, with three-fold redundancy.
