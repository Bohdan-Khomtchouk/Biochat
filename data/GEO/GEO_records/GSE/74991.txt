TITLE
Isolation of human iPSC and ESC-derived mesDA progenitor cells by immunomagnetic cells sorting (MACS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells are a promising cell source for the future treatment of ParkinsonÂ´s disease. It has been shown that mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons arise from the midbrain floor plate in which FOXA2 acts as a key transcription factor. We identified IAP which is specifically co-expressed with FOXA2 positive cells and is suitable to isolate mesDA progenitors utilizing MACS Technolog.The sorted iPSCs were viable, enriched for midbrain specific markers, lacked expression of pluripotency markers, and differentiated into mature dopaminergic neurons in vitro. IAP might be used as a tool to purify mesDA progenitor cells for regenerative therapy  in PD patients

DESIGN
human iPSC and ESC-derived mesDA progenitor cells were sorted for IAP positive cells on day 16 of differentiation. In addition, IAP neagtive and unsorted fraction were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridized on Agilent microarray . The dataset comprises 27 samples divided into three samples of each group.
