TITLE
Expression data from Wild type (WT) and AtCBF1 OX potato plants exposed to different abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Potato plants are sensitive to multiple abiotic stresses such as drought, low temperature and high light. We analyzed the transcriptome of WT potato plants as well as that of transgenic potato plants expressing the Arabidopsis stress related transcription factor CBF1 that confers tolerance to multiple stresses.
