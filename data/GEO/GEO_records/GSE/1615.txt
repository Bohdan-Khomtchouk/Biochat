SUMMARY
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that affects 5-10% of reproductive aged women.  The hallmark characteristic of PCOS is increased ovarian androgen synthesis.  Previous studies by our laboratory demonstrated that increased androgen synthesis is a stable biochemical phenotype of PCOS theca cells which are the primary source of ovarian androgen production.  The increase in theca cell steroidogenesis was due to an increase in expression of several steroidogenic enzymes including CYP17 and CYP11A but not StAR.  Interestingly, the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid induces increased theca cell androgen synthesis and increased CYP17 and CYP11A mRNA levels. In this study we have characterized the gene expression profiles of theca cells obtained from normal or polycystic ovaries which were maintained in the absence (UNT) or presence (VPA) of valproic acid.  The data identifed new candidate genes and novel signaling pathways which may contribute to the manifestation of PCOS phenotypes including increased androgen production.  The experiments in this study were carried using the Affymetrix U133A and U133B oligonucleotide chips. Keywords: other
