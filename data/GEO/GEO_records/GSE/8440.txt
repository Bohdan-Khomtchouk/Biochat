TITLE
Expression data from  Congenital disorders of Glycosylation type-1 patients (CDG-I)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disruption of N-linked glycosylation has a broad impact on proper glycosylation of nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which affect multiple signalling pathways( by changing the stability of membrane proteins or the signalling ability of membrane receptors) and may be responsible of the fibrotic stage associated to CDG type-I. We used microarrays to characterize the global changes in  gene expression in three distinct groups of CDG-I patients and we identified a common perturbation in the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in the stress as well as in the fibrotic responses. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts, obtained from forearm skin biopsies of healthy control subjects and three distinct groups of CDG-I patients,  were cultured in F12 DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose and 10% fetal calf serum prior to RNA extraction and Hybridization on  human HG 133 A Affymetrix Microarrays. To avoid bias related to the analysis of a specific CDG-I type or to a specific individual expression pattern, we have  considered three patients for the CDG-Ic and -Ie group  and two patients for the CDG-Ig group. Moreover the total RNA  was extracted from three different independent biological replicates.
