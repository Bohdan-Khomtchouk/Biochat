TITLE
CLL in Em-TCL1 mice provides a biologically relevant model to unravel and reverse immune deficiency in human cancer.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immune deficiency is common in cancer, but the biological basis for this and ways to reverse it remains elusive. Here we present a mouse model of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that recapitulates changes in the non-malignant circulating T cells seen in patients with this illness.1 To validate this model, we examined changes in T cell gene expression, protein expression and function in Em-TCL1 transgenic mice as they developed CLL 2,3 and demonstrate that development of CLL in these transgenic mice is associated with changes in impaired T cell function and in gene expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells similar to those observed in patients with this disease. Infusion of CLL cells into non-leukemia bearing Em-TCL1 mice rapidly induces these changes, demonstrating a causal relationship between leukemia and the induction of T cell changes. This model allows dissection of the molecular changes induced in CD4 and CD8 T cells by interaction with leukemia cells and further supports the concept that cancer results in complex abnormalities in the immune microenvironment. Gene expression profiling was performed to determine whether Em-TCL1 murine model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) mimics T cell defects induced by CLL cells in patients with CLL. Keywords: comparative gene expression profiling analysis.
