TITLE
Representative Illumina sequencing libraries upon T7-polymerase based amplification

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
This experiment highlights the extreme sequence bias generated by standard PCR amplication of sequencing libraries and decribes an adapted T7-polymerase based amplification method, which results in non-baised, representative libraries for Illumina sequencing

DESIGN
Adaptation of standard Illumina sequencing protocol to obtain representative sequencing libraries after sample amplification. Comparing different amplification methods with amplification free sequencing.
