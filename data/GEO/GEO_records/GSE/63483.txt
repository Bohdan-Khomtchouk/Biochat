TITLE
Genome-wide hsa-miR-191 target profile [chip]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profile of transcripts isolated from Ago2 immunoprecipitation following transfection with miR-191 mature duplex and gene expression profile following transfection with miR-191 mature duplex

DESIGN
RNA isolated from Ago2 immunopreciptation from HeLa cells 24 hours after transfection of mature miR-191 duplexes. Examination of mRNA levels in HeLa cells following transfection of miR-191 mature duplex or mock transfection
