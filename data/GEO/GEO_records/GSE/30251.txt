TITLE
Revealing novel transcribed sequences absent from the human reference genome by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These two transcriptome sequencing datasets were generated from two reference RNA samples established by the US FDA-led MicroArray Quality Control project with Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. The reference RNA sample A (UHRR, Catalog #740000) consists of total RNA extracted from 10 human cell lines of various origins: Blymphocyte, brain, breast, cervix, liposarcoma, liver, macrophage, skin, testis and Tlymphocyte. Equal quantities of DNAase-treated total RNA from each cell line were pooled to generate the UHRR. The reference RNA sample B (HBRR, Catalog #6050) consists of total RNA extracted from several regions of the brains from 23 adult donors.

DESIGN
Investigation of the completeness of human reference genome [SEQC Consortium].
