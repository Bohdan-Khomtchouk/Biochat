TITLE
Transcriptionally inactive ATF2 variant drives melanomagenesis [Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterized by striking metastatic propensity and chemoresistance, melanoma is among the most lethal cutaneous malignancies. The transcription factor ATF2 was shown to elicit oncogenic activities in melanoma, and its inhibition attenuates melanoma development. Here, a mouse model engineered to express a transcriptionally inactive form of Atf2 (Atf2?8,9) was found to be sufficient to induce nevi formation and, when crossed with BrafV600E animals, to promote melanoma development. The cross of Atf2?8,9 with BrafV600E;Pten-/- mice augmented pigmentation, tumorigenicity, and metastasis. Similar to mouse Atf2?8,9, the human ATF2 splice variant 5 enhanced growth and migration capacity of cultured melanoma and immortalized melanocytes. Induced Melan-A, CXCL9, S100A8, CCR7 expression, seen in Atf2?8,9-driven tumors associate with their enhanced pigmentation, immune infiltration and propensity to metastasize. Notably, elevated ATF2SV5 expression in melanoma specimens coincided with poor prognosis. The gain-of-function activity elicited by the truncated ATF2 form offers unexpected insight into mechanisms underlying melanoma development and progression.
