TITLE
RNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with MeJA or BTH

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col-0 ecotype) treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or with the salicylic acid analog benzothiadiazole (BTH).

DESIGN
Two-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col-0 ecotype) grown under short day conditions (9h of light at 21°C - 15h of dark at 18°C) were sprayed with 50 μM MeJA (Sigma), 300 μM BTH (Actigard 50WG) or a mock solution (0.02% Silwet, 0.1% ethanol). Samples were harvested 1h, 5h and 8h after spraying and used for RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. The experiment includes two independent biological replicates per condition. Each replicate corresponds to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
