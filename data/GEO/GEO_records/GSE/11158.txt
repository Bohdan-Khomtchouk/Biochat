TITLE
Microarray analysis of rice plants exposed to jasmonic acid (JA)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
In this study, integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approaches were applied to investigate the molecular responses of JA in the shoots of 7-days old rice (cv. Nipponbare) seedlings exposed to 5 micromolar JA for a period of 7 days. Based on the morphological alteration of JA-exposed rice seedlings, transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in seedlings using rice DNA microarray chip, and proteomics by 2-DGE. This systematic survey showed that JA triggers a chain reaction of altered gene and protein expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice growth and development and defense. Keywords: JA exposure response
