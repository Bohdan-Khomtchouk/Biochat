TITLE
Microarray analysis of rice plants exposed to jasmonic acid (JA)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approaches were applied to investigate the molecular responses of JA in the shoots of 7-days old rice (cv. Nipponbare) seedlings exposed to 5 micromolar JA for a period of 7 days. Based on the morphological alteration of JA-exposed rice seedlings, transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in seedlings using rice DNA microarray chip, and proteomics by 2-DGE. This systematic survey showed that JA triggers a chain reaction of altered gene and protein expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice growth and development and defense. Keywords: JA exposure response

DESIGN
An in vivo 7-days-old rice seedling model system was used, where whole seedlings were used for exposure to the JA (5 micromolar). Dye-swap or reverse labeling with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes procedure was applied followed by hybridization and wash processes, and the hybridized microarrays (G4138A) were scanned using a GenePix microarray scanner followed by the Gene Pix 4000 analysis application program for image analysis and data extraction processes. The GeneSpring Ver. 4 software was used for normalization.
