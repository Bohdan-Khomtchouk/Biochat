TITLE
Great Ape Copy Number Variation

ORGANISM
Gorilla gorilla ; Gorilla gorilla gorilla ; Pan paniscus ; Pan troglodytes ; Pongo pygmaeus ; Pongo abelii ; Pongo sp. ; Pan troglodytes troglodytes

SUMMARY
Intra-specific polymorphism in copy number is documented in many organisms, including human and chimpanzee, but very little is known for other great apes. This study aims to provide CNVs data for orangutan, gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee, and compare the CNV patterns among these species, as well as with human CNVs and segmental duplications from public databases.

DESIGN
Each sample is hybridized against a common reference of the same species for two dye combinations (e.g. chimp1_CY5 vs chimpREF_Cy3; chimp1_CY3 vs chimpREF_Cy5; bonobo1_CY5 vs bonoboREF_Cy3; bonobo1_CY3 vs bonoboREF_Cy5;)
