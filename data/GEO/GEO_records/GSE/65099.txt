TITLE
Loss of endometrial plasticity in recurrent pregnancy loss (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to try and identify characteristics of gene expression in the endometrium of women suffering infertility or recurrenty miscarriage, we performed RNAseq on endometrial pipelle biopsies from 20 women.  The endometrial transcriptome in the mid-luteal phase of the cycle (window of implantation) is highly divergent in women suffering infertility or miscarriages.

DESIGN
20 mid-luteal endometrial biopsies were analysed from infertile women and patients suffering recurrent pregnancy loss.Â
