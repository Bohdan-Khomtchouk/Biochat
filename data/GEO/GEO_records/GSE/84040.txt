TITLE
Slug-induced miR-137 expression contributes to non-small cell lung cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Slug has multifaceted roles in controlling lung cancer progression, but the downstream targets and underlying mechanisms of Slug remain undetermined. The miRNAs downstream of Slug in lung cancer cells were examined using Illumina bead arrays and TaqMan low-density arrays.

DESIGN
The Slug-overexpressing cells (CL1-0-Slug-4) and control cells (CL1-0-mock) were selected with 500ug/ml G418 in CL1-0 cells.  We tried to compare the Slug-expressing profiles with the negative control to identify the possible mechanisms of Slug-regulated microRNA in lung cancer cells.
