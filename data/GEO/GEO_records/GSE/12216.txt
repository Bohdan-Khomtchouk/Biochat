TITLE
Gene expression profiling indicates inflammatory pathways involved in IUGR due to placental insufficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) represents a major obstetric challenge with perinatal  complications and a risk factor of developing disease in adult life. Placental insufficiency is   one of the common features accompanying IUGR. The aim of this study was to evaluate   global placental gene expression profile in IUGR compared to normal pregnancies. Placental   samples were collected by eight IUGR pregnancies with placental insufficiency ascertained   by Doppler and eight healthy controls. A 30K Human Genome Survey Microarray v.2.0   (Applied Biosystems) was used to evaluate global gene expression profile.  Principal   component analysis showed good separation in terms of gene expression patterns between the   groups. Pathway analysis with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing showed significant   (p < 0.05) up-regulation of inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signalling   pathway in the IUGR placentas. Genes involved in metabolism of glucocorticoids (HSD11B1   and DHRS2) were found differentially expressed. We found no imprinted genes to be   differentially expressed and only one gene involved in epigenetic modifications (MBD3) to be   down-regulated in the IUGR placentas, indicating that IUGR due to placental insufficiency is   not associated to placental imprinting. Subgroup analysis between pure IUGR and IUGR with   preeclampsia placentas showed only 27 differentially expressed genes suggesting common   pathophysiology.
