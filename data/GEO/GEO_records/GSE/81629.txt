TITLE
Gene expression profile changes after ANLN knockdown in J82 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate gene expression profile changes after ANLN knockdown, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that altered after ANLN knockdown, so as to explore the potential function of ANLN. Bladder cancer cell line J82 was knocked down by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or control siRNA 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively.

DESIGN
J82 cells were transfected with siRNA against ANLN or control siRNA for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Each time point had one sample. As a result, we have 3 samples with ANLN knock down at 24, 48 and 72 hours in the treatment group, 3 corresponding control samples in the control group.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
