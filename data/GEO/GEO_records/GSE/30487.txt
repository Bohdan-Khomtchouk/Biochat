TITLE
Expression profile of high yielding rice introgression line

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Leaves and  panicles from recurrent parent KMR3 and a high yielding KMR3-O.rufipogon introgression line were used Microarray analysis was carried out to reveal up- and down-regulated DEGs in leaves and panicles of control and experimental line for identifying key genes that help improve yield

DESIGN
Leaves and fully emerged young panicles from both lines were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
