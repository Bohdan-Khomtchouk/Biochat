TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli K12 strain JM109 harboring pMG1 and pMG1-IrrE under 1M NaCl shock

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
IrrE is a unique gene in Deinococcus, which is the switch of DNA repair and celluar surival network. Expressing IrrE enhanced the salt tolence in E. coli. To understand the effect of IrrE to E. coli during salt shock, we constructed the IrrE-expressing plasmid pMG1-IrrE. And pMG1 is the empty vector used as a control. The GroESL promoter was amplified from D. radiodurans R1 genomic DNA by PCR with proper primers. The PCR product was ligated into the T-cloning site of T-vector pMD18T, generating the plasmid pMG1.
