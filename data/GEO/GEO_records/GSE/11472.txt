TITLE
Gene expression signature of cerebellum hypoplasia in a mouse model of Down syndrome (Part II).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We designed a large scale gene expression study in cerebellar external granular layer in Ts1Cje mice at P0 in order to measure the effects of trisomy 21 on in a enriched cell population (dissected layer) that is affected in Down syndrome in order to correlate gene expression changes to the phenotype observed. Keywords: Down syndrome, Ts1Cje, EGL, hypoplasia

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression in the EGL of Ts1Cje and euploid mice at P0 using pangenomic Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchips containing 46 632 probes representing approximately 19 000 mouse genes. 18 samples from individual cerebellar EGL were hybridized on 18 microarrays (6 by slide). On each slide, we hybridized 6 samples frome the same litter.
