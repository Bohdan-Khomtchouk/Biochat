TITLE
One color Agilent experiment of T. cruzi (Dm28C)infected and control human primary cardiomyocyte

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main objective of the study is to compare the differeneces in gene expression of the T.cruzi (Dm28C) infected and control cardiomyocytes at different times post infection.

DESIGN
Human cardiomyocytes (Celprogen) derived from adult cardiac tissue were grown in Human Cardiomyocyte Cell Culture medium (Celprogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Dm28C T. cruzi strain of TcI lineage was used throughout this work. For infection assays, semi-confluent cardiomyocytes were infected with cell-derived trypomastigotes (10: 1 parasite: cell ratio), centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm, and incubated for 2 hours to allow invasion, at 37°C, 5% CO2 in the cardiomyocyte medium without serum. After the interaction period, parasites were removed, and cells were washed 5-times with PBS and incubated with complete cardiomyocyte medium. Cell samples were taken at 0, 3, 6 and 12 hours after the interaction period henceforth named t0, t3, t6, and t12, respectively. Three biological replicates were performed for t0 and t3 time-points (infected and control cells), and two each for t6 and t12 time-points (infected and control cells).
