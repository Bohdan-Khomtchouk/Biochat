TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of CD133+ Cells in Coronary Artery Disease and Effects of Exercise on Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are under investigation for cardiovascular repair, but may be altered by disease. We identified 82 differentially expressed genes in CD133+ cells from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) versus controls, of which 59 were found to be up-regulated and 23 down-regulated. These genes were found to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cellular development and signaling, molecular transport and cell differentiation. Following completion of an exercise program, gene expression patterns resembled those of controls in 7 of 10 patients.

DESIGN
Blood sampled from 4 healthy subjects (H), and from 10 patients with coronary artery disease at baseline (A) and after 3 months (B) of exercise.
