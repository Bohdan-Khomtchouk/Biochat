TITLE
Involvement of hCMV in the ontogeny of CD4+ T-LGL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies suggest the potential involvement of common antigenic stimuli on the ontogeny of monoclonal TCRalphabeta+/CD4+/NKa+/CD8-/+dim T-large granular lymphocyte (LGL) lymphocytosis. Since healthy individuals show (oligo)clonal expansions of hCMV-specific TCRVbeta+/CD4+/cytotoxic/memory T-cells, we investigate the potential involvement of hCMV in the origin and/or expansion of monoclonal CD4+ T-LGL. A detailed characterization of those genes that underwent changes in T-LGL cells responding to hCMV was performed by microarray gene expression profile (GEP) analysis.
