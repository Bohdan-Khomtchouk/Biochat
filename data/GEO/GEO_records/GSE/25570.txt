TITLE
Ovary small RNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced small RNA from total RNA samples in two siRNA-pathway mutants in fly ovaries. This submission comes from a modENCODE project. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster Canton S ovaries. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt.
