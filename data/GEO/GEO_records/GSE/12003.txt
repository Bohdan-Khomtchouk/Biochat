SUMMARY
This array analysis is to study developmental time course of the regulation of target messagesâ€™ expression during culture of murine neutrophils versus miR-223 null neutrophils.  Culture media was SILAC-IMDM for MS analysis.

DESIGN
Two arrays of each for 4 days cultured progenitors and 8 days cultured mature neutrophils from wild-type cultured neutrophils versus miR-223 null cultured neutrophils
