TITLE
Identification of WRKY22 targets under submergence in Arabidopsis (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyzed global transcriptional changes in submerged Arabidopsis seedlings comparing control untreated seedlings.  The same analysis were also applied on wrky22-ko2 seedling to identify WRKY22 targets under submergence.

DESIGN
Time course experiments (1, 3, and 6 for Columbia and wrky22-ko2).  Tissues from submerged seedlings vs. Tissues from un-submerged seedlings.  Biological replicates: 4 replicates for each time point, independently grown, treated, and harvested. One replicate per array.  2 of 4 replicates are dye-swapped.

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
