TITLE
Effect of photoperiod on gene expression in Peromyscus polionotus brain nuclei

ORGANISM
Peromyscus polionotus

SUMMARY
The effect of photoperiod on gene expression was assessed in punch samples of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial preoptic area.  Long day mice were housed in 16L:8D and short day mice were housed in 8L:16D. Keywords: cDNA microarray

DESIGN
For the medial preoptic area, independent samples were collected from long day (n=3) and short day (n=3) mice.  For the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis independent samples were collected from long day (n=3) and short day (n=2) mice.
