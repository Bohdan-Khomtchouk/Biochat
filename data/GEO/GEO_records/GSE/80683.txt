TITLE
Association of Multiparametric MRI Quantitative Imaging Features with Prostate Cancer Gene Expression in MRI-targeted Prostate Biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Standard clinicopathological variables are inadequate for optimal management of prostate cancer patients. While genomic classifiers have improved patient risk classification, the multifocality and heterogeneity of prostate cancer can confound pre-treatment assessment. The objective is to investigate the association of multiparametric (mp)MRI quantitative features with prostate cancer risk gene expression profiles in mpMRI-guided biopsies tissues.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles were generated from 17 mpMRI-directed diagnostic prostate biopsies using an Affymetrix platform. Spatially distinct imaging areas (‘habitats’) were targeted following MRI/3D-Ultrasound fusion. Radiomic features were extracted from biopsy regions and normal appearing tissues

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
