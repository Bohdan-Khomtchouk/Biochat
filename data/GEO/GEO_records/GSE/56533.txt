TITLE
Scgb1a1, Lpo and Gbp2 is Characteristically Expressed in Rat Peri-Implant Epithelium.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The peri-implant epithelium plays an important role in the prevention against initial stage of inflammation. In order to minimize the risk of peri-implantitis, it is necessary to understand the biological characteristics of the peri-implant epithelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristic gene expression profile of peri-implant epithelium as compared to junctional epithelium using laser microdissection and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Left upper first molars of 4 week-old rat were extracted, and titanium alloy implants were placed. Four weeks after surgery, samples were harvested by laser microdissection, and total RNA samples were isolated. Comprehensive analyses of genes expressed in the junctional epithelium and peri-implant epithelium were performed using microarray analysis. Confirmation of the differential expression of selected genes was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.
