TITLE
GBM Xenograft response to 1 hour and 8 hour Cilengitide exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this experiment is the identify differentially expressed genes in GBM zenografts that have been exposed to Cilengitide for 1 or 8 hours.  A control with no cilengitide is also included.  None of the tumors recieved radiation.

DESIGN
4 replicates of mice brains with tumor 103 are used as a control for expression with no cilengtide exposure.  4 replicates of mice brains with tumor 104 were exposed to cilengitide for 1 hour.  4 replicates of mice brains with tumor 105 were exposed to cilengitide for 8 hours.
