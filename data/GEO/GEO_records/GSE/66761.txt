TITLE
microRNAs expression in kidneys from normal, cisplatin induced AKI rats and those with the restoration of MSCs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The availability of mesenchymal stem cells in kidney injury repair has been demonstrated. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains not well understood. Herein, we profiled the altered microRNAs in renal tissiues from cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) rats administrated with or without rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, normal kidneys as control. Sprague Dawley rats were administrated with PBS by caudal vein after 24h peritoneal injection of 6mg/mg cisplatin, short for g2. 1Ã—106 MSCs were injected to rats after 24h peritoneal injection of cisplatin, short for g3. Kidneys from healthey rats were used as control, short for g1. Renal tissues were collected at day 5 after treatment. There were 44 micorRNAs changed with significance between g2 and g3, among which 36 microRNAs upregulated and 8 microRNAs downregulated.

DESIGN
Cisplatin induced microRNAs expression in kidneys were profiled after administrated with PBS or MSCs for 4 days. In g2 and g3,three independent experiments were performed, while two in g1.
