TITLE
Transcriptome profiles comparison between the B220+, CD27- and CD27+ NK cell subset

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cell lineage origin of interferon-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDC), which exhibit prominent anti-tumoral activity, has been subject to debate. Although IKDC were first described as a cell type exhibiting both pDC and NK cell properties, the current view reflects that IKDC merely represent activated NK cells expressing B220, which were thus renamed B220+ NK cells. Herein, we further investigate the lineage relationship of B220+ NK cells with regards to other NK cell subsets. We surprisingly find that, upon adoptive transfer, B220- NK cells did not acquire B220 expression, even in the presence of potent activating stimuli. These findings strongly argue against the concept that B220+ NK cells are activated NK cells in vivo. Moreover, we unequivocally demonstrate that B220+ NK cells are highly proliferative and differentiate into mature NK cells upon in vivo adoptive transfer. Additional phenotypic, functional and transcriptional characterizations further define B220+ NK cells as immediate precursors to mature NK cells. By analogy to pre-B cells and pre-DC, we propose that B220+ NK cells should be renamed pre-NK cells. The characterization of these novel attributes to pre-NK cells will guide the identification of their ortholog in humans, contributing to the design of potent cancer immunotherapies.

DESIGN
Total RNA from B220+ NK cells compared to total RNA from CD27- and CD27+ NK cell subsets all isolated ex vivo from the spleen of B6.Rag-/-. Triplicatas were analysed.
