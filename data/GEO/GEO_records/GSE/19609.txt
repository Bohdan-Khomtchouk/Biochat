TITLE
High-throughput screening for Salmonella avirulent mutants that retain targeting of solid tumors

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
Salmonella has a natural ability to target a wide range of tumors in animal models. However, strains used for cancer therapy have generally been selected only for their avirulence rather than tumor-targeting ability. To select Salmonella strains that are avirulent and yet efficient in tumor-targeting, a necessary criteria for clinical applications, we measured the relative fitness of 41,000 Salmonella Typhimurium transposon insertion mutants growing in mouse models of human prostate cancer and melanoma. Two classes of potentially safe mutants were identified. Class 1 mutants showed reduced fitness in normal tissues and unchanged fitness in tumors (e.g., mutants in htrA, SPI-2, and STM3120). Class 2 mutants showed reduced fitness in tumors and normal tissues (e.g., mutants in aroA and aroD). Class 1 mutants are more suitable for delivery of therapeutics for cancer therapy.
