TITLE
Gene expression alteration after RBSDV infection

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We investigated the alterations of genes expression in maize infected by RBSDV, and detected about 4000 genes alterations which were significant according to the identification standards influenced by RBSDV infection, including resistance related genes, cellulosesynthesis and development related genes. Expression alterations was varified in the same RNA samples by RT- PCR.

DESIGN
Two sets samples, RBSDV-infected vs mock;  Biological replicates: 4 RBSDV-infected, 4 mock; independently inoculated and harvested.

PLATFORM
