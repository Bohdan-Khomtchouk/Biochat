TITLE
Global gene expression profiles of induced lung progenitor (iLung) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into lung progenitor-like cells by defined transcription factors. To evaluate characteristic of iLung cell, we compared the global gene expression profiles of iLung cells with those of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs), adult trachea, lung, esophagus, thyroid and E11.5 embryonic lung cells using microarrays.

DESIGN
MEFs were prepared from E13.5 mouse dorsal skin and limb skin. For MDFs preparation, skin tissue behind the ear of 12 week old mice was used. iLung cells were generated by retroviral transduction of transcription factors. In addition we also extracted total RNA form the trachea, lung, esophagus, and thyroid tissues isolated from 8 week old mice.
