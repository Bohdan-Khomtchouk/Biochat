TITLE
Expression data from Paneth cells isolated from mice on calorie restricted or ad libitum diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Paneth cells recide in the intestinal crypt bottom and are part of the innate immunity and of the intestinal stem cell niche. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression following reduced calorie intake.

DESIGN
Mice were kept on ad libitum or calorie restricted (60% of calories of ad libitum) diets for 4-7 weeks and paneth cells were isolated using flowcytometry
