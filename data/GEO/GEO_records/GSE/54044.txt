TITLE
Insm1 cooperates with Neurod1 and Foxa2 to maintain mature pancreatic β-cell function (Expression data from islets of control and Insm1 conditional deleted adult pancreatic islets)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The zinc finger factor Insm1 is known to regulate differentiation of pancreatic β cells during development, Here we show that Insm1 is essential for the maintenance of functionally mature pancreatic β cells in mice. We used microarrays to analyse the global gene expression after deletion of insm1 in adult pancreatic β cells and identified functional important genes and immature islets releated genes deregulated in the mutatant islets.

DESIGN
We used 8 mutant and 8 litter matched control mice for the islets preparation.
