TITLE
MiRNA expression profiles of trophoblastic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain more insight in the biological expression and role of microRNAs in trophoblast cells, we then set up to determinate the miRNA expression pattern of four trophoblastic cell lines and compare them with the miRNA signature of isolated trophoblast Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, pre-amplified with miRNA-specific primers, and loaded into TLDA cards. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for 768 miRNAs. For each of two cards per sample (A and B), 9 ul of pre-amplified diluted sample was mixed with TaqMan reaction mix (Applied Biosystems) and loaded into miRNA TLDA cards (Applied Biosystems) by centrifugation. Cards were sealed, and qRT-PCR was performed with a real-time thermocycler (ABI-7900, Applied Biosystems) per manufacturer's recommendations.

DESIGN
MiRNA signatures of isolated trophoblasts were compared with those in four trophoblastic cell lines
