TITLE
miRNA array for LPS-activated tnc+/+ and tnc-/- macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endogenous molecules generated upon pathogen invasion or tissue damage serve as danger signals that activate host defence, however their precise immunological role remains unclear. Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is specifically induced upon injury and infection. We have shown that its expression is required to generate an effective immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during experimental sepsis in vivo. Tenascin-C enables macrophage translation of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and suppresses the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines. It mediates post-transcriptional control of a specific subset of inflammatory mediators via induction of the microRNA miR-155. Thus tenascin-C plays a key role in regulating the inflammatory axis during pathogenic activation of TLR signaling. The data deposited here include the analysis of miRNA profile of  tnc+/+ and tnc-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) following stimulation with LPS for 8 hours.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured in complete DMEM medium, non-stimulated or stimulated for 8 hours with 100ng/ml LPS and total RNA was extracted. Samples were analysed with TaqMan Low Density Arrays (Applied Biosystems).
