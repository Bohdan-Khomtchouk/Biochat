TITLE
JAR cells: Control vs. siIMP1 transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To acquire an overall picture of IMP1 regulating network, we compared the global transcription pattern in IMP1 inhibited JAR cells with control cells by DNA microarray. Specific siRNA to IMP1 or universal negtive control siRNA were transfected into JAR cells respectively, the total RNA was extracted after 72hr incubation. Then went into the microarray assay procedure.

DESIGN
one control vs. one siIMP1

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
