TITLE
Genome-wide Mapping of Imprinted Genes by DNA Methylation Profiling of Human Placentas from Triploidies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of placentas from diandric and digynic triploidies. DNA methylation profiles across more than 27,000 CpGs were obtained by using the Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2. Placentas of 10 diandric and 10 digynic triploidies were included.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 20 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
