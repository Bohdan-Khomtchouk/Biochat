TITLE
Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing  of Longissimus Dorsi Muscles between Japanese Black (Wagyu) and Chinese Red Steppes Cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We performed a comparative genome-wide methylation analysis of longissimus dorsi muscles between the Japanese Black (Wagyu) and Chinese Red Steppes cattle, which exhibit significant differences in meat quality traits. This will allow us to better understand the correlation between DNA methylation variants and meat quality traits.

DESIGN
Comparative Genome-wide Methylation between three longissimus muscle (LM) tissue samples of Japanese black cattle (28 months old) and three LM samples of Chinese Red Steppes cattle (28 months old)

PLATFORM
GPL19172 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Bos taurus)
