TITLE
Global gene expression analysis comparing wild type and beta catenin deficient BxPC3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goal:obtaing an overview of gene expression changes in BxPC3 cells rendered deficient in beta-catenin protein due to a zinc-finger nuclease mediated disruption of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1).

DESIGN
Total RNA from exponentially growing cells were harvested and subjected to further analysis
