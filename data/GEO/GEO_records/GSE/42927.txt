TITLE
Expression data from cultured mouse BALB 3T3 cells containing bacterial plasmid gene mucAB

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene mucAB has an error-prone activity in bacteria. We introduced mucAB into mouse 3T3 cells with an expression vector and found drastic increase of spontaneous transformation, accompanied by increase of expression of eight oncogenes, i. e., Gpnmb, Foxml, Maff, Myc, Aurka, Aukb, Fosl1, and Anxa8 and decrease of expression in two oncogenes, i. e., Lrig1 and RhoX in order of the magnitude of change, as compared with those in non-treated 3T3 cells.

DESIGN
Transformation of cultured mouse BALB 3T3 cells was used as an indicator of cellular oncogenesis. We examined effects of introduction of foreign bacterial plasmid gene into mouse cells on spontaneous transformation frequency, accompanied by change of expression of known oncogenes. To do this, 3T3 cells with or without mucAB were compared for expression of known genes, using the microarray method.
