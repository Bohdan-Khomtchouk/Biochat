TITLE
Differential expression of genes after over expression of miR-23a~27a~24-2 cluster in human embryonic kidney cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was deigned to identify the genes which get altered after the over expression of miR-23a~27a~24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells. The HEK293T cells plated in 6-well plate were transfected with two different concentrations of cloned miRNA cluster i.e 2micrograms and 4micrograms per well.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates of 3 samples were used viz. control HEK293T cells, HEK293T cells transfected with 2micrograms of the cloned cluster and HEK293T cells transfected with 4micrograms of the cloned cluster.

PLATFORM
