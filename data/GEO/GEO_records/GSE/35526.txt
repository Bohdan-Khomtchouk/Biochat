TITLE
Gene expression in response to chloroplastic H2O2: IS-GUS-2-17 vs. IS-tAPX-19-23 under estrogen treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify chloroplastic H2O2-responseive genes, an estrogen-inducible RNAi method was used for silencing of tAPX, a H2O2-scavenging enzyme in chloroplasts. At 48 h after treatment with estrogen, the expression of  tAPX was silenced in the IS-tAPX-19-23 plants, but not in the IS-GUS-2-17 plants (negative control), resulting a large change in gene expression. These genes are candidates for chloroplastic H2O2-responseive genes.

DESIGN
IS-GUS-2-17 vs. IS-tAPX-19-23 leaves. Biological replicates 2.
