ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: The identification of new high sensitivity and specificity markers for HCC are essential. We aimed to identify serum microRNAs for diagnosing hepatitis B virus (HBV) â€“related HCC.  Methods: Serum microRNA expression was investigated with four cohorts including 667 participants (261 HCC patients ,233 cirrhosi patients and 173 healthy controls), recruited between August 2010 and June 2013. First, An initial screening of miRNA expression by Illumina sequencing was performed using serum samples pooled from HCC patients and controls,respectively. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was then applied to evaluate the expression of selected microRNAs. A logistic regression model was constructed using a training cohort (n=357) and then validated using a cohort(n=241). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy.  Results: , We identified 8 miRNAs(hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-433-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-26a-5p.)  formed a miRNA panel that provided a high diagnostic accuracy of HCC (AUC=0.887 and 0.879 for training and validation data set, respectively). The microRNA panel can also differentiate HCC from healthy (AUC =0.894) and cirrhosis (AUC = 0.892), respectively.  Conclusions:We found a serum microRNAs panel that has considerable clinical value in diagnosing HCC.

DESIGN
9 serum samples pooled from 3 healthy control donors and 3 HCC patients, 3 cirrhosi patients treated at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were subjected to Illumina HiSeq 2000 deep sequencing to identify the miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed.
