TITLE
Transcriptomes of Rice internode before and after heading

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify genes that co-express with rice cellulose synthase genes involved in rice secondary cell wall formation, transcriptome analyses was performed using rice internodesbefore and after the heading stage, where secondary cell wall formation extensively occur.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of rice third or the fourth internodes were analyzed at 17, 8, and 1 day before, and 6, 13, and 35 days after heading Please note that the current data were normalized together with additional 143 sample data available in GEO and the list of the sample accessions is provided in Series supplementary file [normalized_together_GSMs.txt].
