TITLE
PocR regulates glycerol reduction, assembly of metabolosomes and vitamin B12 biosynthesis in Lactobacillus reuteri F275

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri F275

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to encode a vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway that is phylogenetically related to the one present in some representatives of gamma-proteobacteria such as Salmonella and Yersinia. Here we present evidence supporting that the similarities between these otherwise unrelated organisms extend to their regulatory mechanisms. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Loop design
