TITLE
Transgenerational transmission of environmental information in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of N2 worms. Heterochromatic repetitive DNA transmits environmentally-acquired information for up-to fourteen generations in C. elegans

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of N2 worms grown at 25 degrees, worms propagated for 3 generations at 20 degrees after temperature shift from 25 degrees, and worms grown at a reference temperature of 20 degrees. This series includes RNA sequencing of set25 mutant worms grown at a reference temperature of 20 degrees.
