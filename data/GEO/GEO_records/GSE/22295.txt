TITLE
Lack of chemokine signaling through CXCR5  causes mortality, ventricular dilatation and  deranged matrix during pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inflammatory mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in  the development of heart failure (HF), but a role for chemokines is  largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of  the chemokine CXCL13 and its receptor CXCR5 in cardiac  pathophysiology leading to HF

DESIGN
A microarray study was performed on seven mice harboring a systemic knockout of the CXCR5 (CXCR5-/-) and seven wildtype mice. Four of the knockouts and four of the wild type mice were subjected to aorta banding and three of each to sham operations.
