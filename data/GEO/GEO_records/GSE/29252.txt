TITLE
The habitat disruption induces immune-suppression and oxidative stress in honey bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Background: Honey bee is a major insect used for pollination of a number of commercial crops worldwide.  However, the number of managed honey bee colonies has recently declined in several countries, and a number of possible causes are proposed.  Although the use of honey bees for pollination can be considered as disruption of the habitat, its effects on honey bees' physiology have never been addressed.  In Japan, more than 100 thousands colonies are annually used for pollination, and intriguingly 80% of them are used in greenhouses.  Recently, honey bee colonies have often collapsed when they are introduced into greenhouses.  Thus, to suppress colony collapses and maintain the number of worker bees in the colonies are essential for successful long-term pollination in greenhouses and recycling honey bee colonies.

DESIGN
Honey bee hives were installed into strawberry and eggplant greenhouses, and then the gene expression profiles of the honey bees were examined at the different time periods.  Total 16 samples with two replicates were analyzed.
