TITLE
Zebrafish embryos: hdac1 Morphants vs Standard control morphants at 12, 18 and 27 hpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of hdac1 ATG morphant zebrafish embryos in comparison to standard control injected embryos.  Embryos where injected at the one cell stage with either a translation blocking morpholino (Hdac1 ATG) or Standard control morpholino (StCo).  RNA was extracted at 12, 18 and 27hpf from both sets of embryos and compared with a two-colour hybridisation.

DESIGN
Timecourse experiment, hdac1 ATG morphants vs. standard control morphants. Biological replicates: 3
