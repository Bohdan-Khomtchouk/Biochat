TITLE
eif3k/WT polysome loading

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the contribution of the k subunit of eukaryotic transcription factor 3 (eif3k) to the translation of specific mRNAs, we compared the polysome loading states and overall transcript levels of wild type Arabidopsis and the eif3k T-DNA insertion mutant by Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
We analyzed the polysome loading states of wild type Arabidopsis and the eif3k mutant using the Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 array. Data from 3 biological replicates were collected.
