TITLE
Skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) and non-DM neuro-muscular disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle biopsies from DM1, DM2, idiopathic DM (DMx), and non-DM NMD patients were compared to those from normal individuals, with focus on MEF2 and MEF2-related genes. Keywords: 7 diseases and 2 normal (fetal and adult) groups

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle biopsies from 10 DM1 biopsies, 20 DM2 biopsies, 16 DMx (DM-like, no DMPK or ZNF9 expansion), 5 BMD (Becker Muscular Dystrophy), 1 MC-AD (Myotonia Congenita-Autosomal Dominant), 3 DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), 4 TMD (Tibial Muscular Dystrophy), 3 Normal Fetal and 6 Normal individuals
