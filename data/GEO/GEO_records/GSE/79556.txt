TITLE
Genome-scale methylation assessment did not identify prognostic biomarkers in oral tongue carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of heterogeneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cohorts has been reported to predict patient outcome. We investigated if a prognostic DNA methylation profile could be found in tumour tissue from a single uniform subsite, the oral tongue. The methylation status of 83 comprehensively annotated oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from a single institution were examined with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K (HM450K) array.

DESIGN
83 FFPE primary OTSCC tumour samples were analysed in one experimental run.
