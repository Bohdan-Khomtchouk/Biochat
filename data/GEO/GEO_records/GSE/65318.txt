TITLE
Role of polycomb repressive complex 1 in the intestinal homeostasis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data include the genome wide occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors by ChIP sequencing in mouse crypt cells and in mouse ISCs.

DESIGN
Immuno-precipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from wild type and Ring1a Ring1b dKO crypt cells and from WT ISCs using specific antibody against different target protein/modification.
