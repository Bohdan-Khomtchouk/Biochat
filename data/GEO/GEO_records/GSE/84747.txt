TITLE
RETINOBLASTOMA MICRORNA LANDSCAPE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work we examined miRNome expression in 12 samples of retinoblastoma. Present miRNAs show the common working machinery with Rb affecting most of pathways considered hallmarks of cancer.

DESIGN
12 Rb from enucleated patients with no chemotherapy history. 5 bilteral and 7 unilateral cases from which 4 are female and 8 male.

PLATFORM
GPL21572 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array [ProbeSet ID version]
