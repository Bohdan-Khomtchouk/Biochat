TITLE
Interspecies hybridization versus intra-species hybridization for Leishmania promastigote RNA.

ORGANISM
Leishmania major ; Leishmania mexicana

SUMMARY
We examined the Leishmania mexicana transcriptome to identify differentially regulated mRNAs using high-density whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays designed from the genome data of a closely related species, Leishmania major. This experiment appears as Fig. 1 of the associated publication. Keywords: RNA expression profiling

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of promastigote RNA from each species, L. major and L. mexicana, were hybridized to L. major arrays and analyzed.

PLATFORM
