TITLE
Reprogramming Mouse Fibroblasts into Engraftable Myeloerythroid and Lymphoid Progenitors: Induction and Underlying Mechanisms (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that hematopoietic transcription factors Scl, Lmo2, Runx1 and Bmi1 can convert a developmentally-distant lineage (fibroblasts) into “induced hematopoietic progenitors” (iHPs). We analyzed transcriptomic data for cell undergoing the transdifferentiation process at several time-points of the process.

DESIGN
We peroformed ChIP-Seq of Lmo2 using cell undergoing conversion from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to induced hematopoietic progenitors (iHPs).
