TITLE
A novel small-molecule inhibitor of STAT5A/STAT5B with therapeutic potential for prostate cancer and CML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the gene expression profiles induced by both genetic and pharmacological knockdown of Stat5a/b in CML cells. Stat5 was suppressed in K562 cells by lentiviral expression of Stat5 shRNA vs. scramble control for 6 days or by treatment of the cells with IST5-002 (5 µM) for 48 h.

DESIGN
K562 cells were treated with IST5-002 (5 µM) or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 h.  For Stat5 knockdown, K562 cells were infected with Stat5-shRNA lentivirus or scramble-shRNA lentivirus (as control) for 48 h followed by puromycin (2ug/ml) selection for 6 days to enrich for cells expressing Stat5 or scramble shRNA. Each group (vehicle control, IST5-002, scramble-shRNA control and Stat5-shRNA) was prepared in triplicate, and RNA samples from each group were not pooled.
