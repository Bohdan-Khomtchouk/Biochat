TITLE
Gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from members of 45 CEPH-Utah pedigrees

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine gene expression levels from members of 45 CEPH-Utah pedigrees. Keywords: array-based gene expression

DESIGN
We measured gene expression levels in immortalized B cells from members of 45 CEPH-Utah pedigrees.  For some cell lines, RNA extracts were hybridized twice, representing technical replicates. For these cell lines, we take the average signal intensity as a measure of relative abundance of a gene. These gene expression levels were then used in genome-wide linkage analyses to identify genetics determinants of gene expression. CEL files were lost for 3 Samples GSM420949, GSM421101, and GSM421103.
