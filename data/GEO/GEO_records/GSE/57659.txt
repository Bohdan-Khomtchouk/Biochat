TITLE
Transcription profiling by array of adipose samples from LDLR-/- mice to study response to anti-diabetic drug and dietary lifestyle interventions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lean male mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD, lard 24% w/w) for 16 weeks. At 9 weeks, when all hallmarks of prediabetes were established, groups of mice were treated with drug (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, T0901317, or salicylate) for another 7 weeks together with the high fat diet. An additional group was switched back to a chow diet (dietary lifestyle intervention) after the first 9 weeks of high fat diet. All groups were compared to a control group receiving HFD alone and to a reference group fed chow (baseline reference) for the entire experimental period (16 weeks).

DESIGN
One group remained on maintenance chow throughout the entire study period (16 weeks) and served as healthy, age-matched control (n=9, samples hybridized: 7 for gonadal, 7 for subcutaneous, 8 for visceral). After the nine week run-in period, the HFD fed mice were matched into thirteen groups based on body weight. The first group was sacrificed immediately after matching (n=9, samples hybridized: 8 for gonadal, 8 for gonadal, 6 for visceral). The second group was continued on HFD until the end of the experiment at t=16 weeks (n=15, samples hybridized: 8 for gonadal, 7 for subcutaneous, 6 for visceral). The fourth group was switched to regular chow (dietary lifestyle intervention, n=9, samples hybridized: 8 for gonadal, 8 for subcutaneous, 7 for visceral). The other groups continued on HFD supplemented with drugs typically used in clinical practice. More specifically, following drugs were mixed into HFD: rosiglitazone (0.010% w/w, n=9, samples hybridized: 8 for all adipose depots), pioglitazone (0.010% w/w, n=9, samples hybridized: 8 for gonadal, 8 for subcutaneous, 6 for visceral), T0901317 (0.010% w/w, n=9, samples hybridized: 7 for all adipose depots) and salicylate (0.40% w/w, n=9, samples hybridized: 8 for all adipose depots).
