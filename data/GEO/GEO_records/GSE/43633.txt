TITLE
Acute hepatic transcriptional response in male mice following oral exposure to benzo(a)pyrene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Benzo(a)pyrene is a well-established human carcinogen in humans and rodents. In the present study, we sought to determine the dose- and time-dependent changes in gene expression upon oral exposure to benzo(a)pyrene. Adult male B6C3F1 mice were exposed to four doses of benzo(a)pyrene or vehicle control for three days and sacrificed 4 or 24 hours after the final exposure.

DESIGN
This experiment examined the hepatic transcriptional response of male mice exposed to BaP for 3 days at four different doses, including D1 (300 mg/kg BW/day), D2 (150 mg/kg BW/day), D3 (50 mg/kg BW/day) and D4 (5 mg/kg BW/day), and one control.  Each dose group was further examined at 2 time points,  4 hours and 24 hours, following the final exposure.  Each dose group and time point had 4-5 biological replicates. There were a total 46 samples (arrays) included in the final analysis using a two-colour reference design.
