TITLE
Functional analysis of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli R049 gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective was to determine the function of the novel uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) gene R049 during host infection. We infected the urinary tracts of mice with E. coli UPEC132 or the R049 deletion mutant UPEC132ΔR049.The mouse kidneys were harvested at 4 and 8 h post-infection and screened for differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. We identified 379 and 515 differentially expressed genes at 4 and 8 h post-infection, respectively. Thirty-four of these genes were associated with inflammatory and immune signaling pathways, including those related to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, leukocyte transendothelial migration, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling, and apoptosis. Protein binding (GO 0005515) was the most prevalent molecular function in the Gene Ontology terms related to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, R049 expression in UPEC132 is related to the early innate immune and inflammatory responses in UPEC-infected hosts. This work lays the foundation for further research on anti-infective immunity against UPEC.

DESIGN
A ten chip study using total RNA recovered from 10 separate mouse kidneys of five experimental groups. The five experimental groups respectively were the UPEC132_4h group, UPEC132_8h group, UPEC132ΔR049_4h group, UPEC132ΔR049_8h group and Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) groups. Two separate mouse kidneys in every group were tested with two chips. Each chip measures the expression level of 44,170 genes from BALB/c mouse with three 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
