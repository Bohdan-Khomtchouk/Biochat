TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Pinus radiata branches reveals new insights into compression wood formation in response to gravity stress

ORGANISM
Pinus radiata

SUMMARY
Compression (CW) and opposite wood (OW) are formed in the uniderside and upperside of conifer branches respectively in response to gravity stress. We investigated genes differentially transcribed between the underside and upside of radiate pine branches using cDNA microarrays with a view to plant gravitropism.

DESIGN
Six trees with well-developed branches were selected from a radiata pine commercial plantation (aged 13 years) located at Bondo, NSW, Australia (35ยบ 16' 44.04 S, 148ยบ 26' 54.66 E). The largest branch from each tree was further selected for sampling, including three branches sampled in April 2007 (autumn in Bondo) and three sampled in October 2007 (spring). Bark was removed from the base part (about 10 cm in length) of each branch. Developing xylem tissues were scraped from the exposed upperside and underside surface respectively with a sharp chisel. Samples were immediately placed into 50 ml BD FalconTM tubes filled with liquid nitrogen. Gene expression in the underside and upperside of branches was compared using radiata pine cDNA microarrays.
