TITLE
Expression data from human melanoma cell lines treated or not with inflammatory cytokines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanomas are often infiltrated by activated inflammatory cells. Thus, melanoma cells are very likely stimulated by inflammatory cytokines. In order to assess the impact of common inflammatory cytokines, we investigated the gene expression profile of melanoma cell lines before and after cytokine treatment in vitro.
