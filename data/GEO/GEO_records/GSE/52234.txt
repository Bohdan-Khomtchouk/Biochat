TITLE
Consequences of beta-PDGFR deletion on hepatic stellate cells during hepatic regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine biological consequences during liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy in mice by next-generation sequencing. A particular interest was to compare mice with either a floxed b-PDGFR allele to mice that harbored a deletion of b-PDGFR in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), by crossing b-PDGFR fl/fl mice with transgenic GFAP-Cre mice. Methods: b-PDGFR fl/fl mice or mice with a HSC-specific deletion of b-PDGFR underwent either sham operation or 70% partial hepatectomy. Following 72 hours, livers were collected and total RNA was extracted using tizol, followed by a purification using Quiagen spin columns including an on-column DNAse digestion step. Conclusion: Our study represents a detailed analysis of hepatic transcriptome, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology of livers following sham operation or partial hepatectomy in b-PDGFR fl/fl mice or b-PDGFRfl/fl/GRAP-Cre mice.

DESIGN
Whole liver mRNA profiles of sham operated livers or livers collected 72hours after partial hepatectomy of beta-PDGFR fl/fl and beta-PDGFR fl/fl/GFAP-Cre (creating a hepatic stellate cell-specific deletion of b-PDGFR) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
