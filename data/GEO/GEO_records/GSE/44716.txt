TITLE
Comparative study of deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol on gene expression in the human cell line Caco-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen cellular effects on Caco-2 cells by deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON), toxin-treated Caco-2 cells were analyzed by DNA microarray. Exposure to either toxin induced up- or downregulation of genes in Caco-2 cells. Upregulation of 1290 and 3238 genes was observed for the DON- and 15ADON-treated groups, respectively, after a 60-min incubation period. This represented a greater than 1.5-fold change relative to the 0-min exposure (control) group. Five hundred and sixty-one genes showed a 1.5-fold upregulation in the both the DON- and 15ADON-treated groups. Similarly, 13 genes and 105 genes were upregulated with a log2 ratio > 2 (4-fold change) in the DON- and 15ADON-treated groups, respectively. The most remarkable gene upregulation corresponded to the inflammatory chemokine, IL-8, which showed a greater than 4-fold upregulation in response to both treatments.

DESIGN
Deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol at concentrations of 1 ug/mL were added separately to the AP chamber, and cells were harvested with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA after incubation for 0, 5, 30, and 60 min. Toxin-treated Caco-2 cells were analyzed by DNA microarray to screen for changes in gene expression in response to deoxynivalenol or 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol.
