TITLE
Effect of NO-sulindac treatment on hypoxic prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypoxia response contributes to radio and chemo-resistance in cancer cells. Our previous work has shown that the nitric oxide donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NO-NSAID) NO-sulindac is a potent inhibitor of the hypoxia response in prostate cancer cells and leads to increased susceptibilty to radiation. In this study we used microarrays to investigated the global impact of NO-sulindac on the hypoxia response in prostate cancer cells with a view to determining the mechanism of action.

DESIGN
PC3 hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cells were grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and treated with NO-sulindac, unnitrated sulindac or vehicle control. Global gene expression in response to treatment was examined using microarrays and the bioconductor software suite. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene ontology (GO) analysis and pathway analysis were used to examine the biological impact of treatments.
