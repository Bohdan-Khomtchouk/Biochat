TITLE
Expression data from mouse proximal intestinal epithelial Lgr5(hi) stem cells and differentiated villus cells (enterocytes from Atoh1 conditional knockout)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the differentail gene expression between intestinal Lgr5(hi) stem cells and differentiated cells

DESIGN
Assay the differential gene expression using total RNA from flow cytometry sorted Lgr5(hi) cells and EDTA isolated enterocytes from Atoh1 conditional knockout
