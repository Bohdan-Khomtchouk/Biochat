TITLE
Gene expression of CD66 expressing cells in cervical precancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene Expression profiles of sorted CD66High and CD66Low cells were generated from CIN612-9E cells grown in Emedia. We have analyzed the gene expression pattern of CD66High and CD66Low cells from CIN612 9E.  These cells are derived from a cervical precancer lesion (M. Bedell, J. Hudson, T. Golub  et al, 1991, J. Virol)

DESIGN
Two sets of experiments (biological replicates) were performed for CD66High and CD66Low cells.
