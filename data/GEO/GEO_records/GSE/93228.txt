TITLE
Cell lines iPSC CRL1831 (induced pluripotent stem cells) and CSC DLD1 (cancer stem-like cells)  derived from normal colon CRL1831 and colorectal cancer DLD-1 cells in 3D cell culture conditions and subjected to ionizing radiation doses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of two reporgrammed cell lines iPSC CRL1831 (induced pluripotent stem cells) and CSC DLD1 (cancer stem-like cells)  derived from normal colon CRL1831 and colorectal cancer DLD-1 cells, after transfer to 3D cell culture conditions and cell lines treated with single or fractionated ionizing radiation doses under 3D cell culture conditions. There are no data that cancer metastases arise due to specific mutations of cancer cells. Therefore ongoing investigation of reprogrammed cancer cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models might provide researchers with essential data studying tumor oncogenesis and metastases formation. 3D culture models were shown to mimic in vivo cell microenvironment more accurately than the standard two-dimensional cell monolayer (2D) cultures. Also, growing evidence suggests that 2D and 3D cultured cells gene expression pattern variance following irradiation is highly dependent on cancer cell state and their interaction with microenvironment.

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from two â€“ normal and colorectal cancer cell lines cultivated under 2D cell culture conditions, non-treated and from 3D cell culture conditions, 4h after treatment of single (2 Gy) or fractionated (3x2 Gy) ionizing radiation dose and from non-treated cells.
