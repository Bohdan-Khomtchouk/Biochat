TITLE
mRNA and lncRNA expression in cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play important roles in different cell contexts, including cancers. However, little is known about lncRNAs in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cholangiocyte malignancy with poor prognosis, associated with chronic inflammation and damage to the biliary epithelium. This study determined whether lncRNAs were dysregulated and participated in disease diagnosis or pivotal inflammation pathways through a genome-wide lncRNA screening and functional analysis. We firstly identified a large number of lncRNAs abnormally expressed between 9 pairs of cancerous and adjacent tissues of CCA, and between intra-hepatic CCA and extra-hepatic CCA through a genome-wide profiling. Our findings show that lncRNAs may be potential biomarkers of CCA progression.

DESIGN
LncRNA and mRNA expression profile of 9 pairs of cancerous and adjacent tissues of cholangiocarcinoma were identified using RNA microarray. 3 normal bile duct tissue were used as normal control.
