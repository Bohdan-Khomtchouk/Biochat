TITLE
Defining principles of gene and regulatory element imprinting in mouse trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An undefined number of mammalian genes are expressed preferentially from one parental allele, in a process termed genomic imprinting. To shed light on the general principles of this process in a single cell type, we profiled allelic gene expression, DNaseI hypersensitivity (DHS), and CTCF binding in genetically defined murine trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). The data deposited in this entry are from CTCF ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq experiments performed in the BC.1 cell line. All other data has been previously deposited as part of GEO Series GSE39406.

DESIGN
The F1 TSC line profiled was generated from a cross between a C57BL/6J (B6) female and CAST/EiJ (Cast) male mouse.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
