TITLE
Comparative transcriptional profiling of tumor-associated and normal lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the past decade, the relevance of tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis for the metastatic spread of tumor cells has been demonstrated, thus indicating the potential of targeting tumor lymphangiogenesis to treat cancer. Whereas numerous preclinical studies demonstrated that blocking angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis could inhibit tumor metastasis, the scarcity of highly selective targeting candidates hampers their translation to the clinic. We employed a new approach consisting of immuno-laser capture microdissection (i-LCM) and transcriptional profiling by means of microarrays in order to identify novel tumor-specific endothelial markers.

DESIGN
By using short immunostainings prior to microdissection, specific identification of lymphatic (LECs) and blood (BECs) endothelial cells was allowed. For the subsequent gene expression profiling, a single round of the Ribo-Spia amplification method in combination with the Affymterix microarray platform was used. Comparison of gene expression profiles of tumor-associated and normal LECs resulted in the identification of differentially expressed genes in tumor-associated lymphatic vasculature.
