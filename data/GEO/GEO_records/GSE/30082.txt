TITLE
IkBa associates with histone H2A in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we demonstrate that IkBa displays a predominant and unique nuclear localization in normal basal keratinocytes. This nuclear IkBa binds the chromatin through direct interaction of the ankyrin repeats with histone H2A and associates with the promoter and regulatory regions of several developmental-related genes including HOXA10, HOXB2 and HOXB9. Most importantly, IkBa dictates the competence of these HOX genes to be activated upon TNFa stimulation.
