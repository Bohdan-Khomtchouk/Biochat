TITLE
Expression Data from BALB/c and Stat6-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to find Stat6 dependent genes in control and IL-4 exposed bone marrow derived macrophages. Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) accumulate in tissues during Th2-associated immune responses like helminth infections and allergic disorders. These cells possess potent inhibitory activity against T cells. The differentiation of AAM depends on IL-4/IL-13-mediated activation of the transcription factor Stat6. Stat6 is also required in AAM to induce several genes, such as YM1, FIZZ1 and Arginase1.

DESIGN
Macrophages were differentiated from bone marrow cells in supplemented RPMI 1640 for 7 days in the presence of 10% supernatant from the M-CSF producing fibroblast cell line L929. After removal of nonadherent cells, macrophages were detached using 5mM EDTA treatment, washed, counted, and replated at a density of 10x6 cells/mL. Macrophages were cultured for 24 hours in medium (control) or in the presence of IL-4 (10mg/mL). F4/80 positive macrophages were sorted with a purity of  99% and RNA was isolated (Trizol/Chloroform) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was labeled (biotin), fragmented, and hybridized to the arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
