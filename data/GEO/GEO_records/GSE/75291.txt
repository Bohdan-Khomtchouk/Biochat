TITLE
RNA-seq analysis upon ARID1B overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We transduced either an empty vector or ARID1B cDNA in IMR90 cells. Cells were selected with puromycin and 6 days after the infection we collected the RNA. ARID1B is a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. Our previous experiments showed that knockdown of ARID1B allows cells to bypass cellular senescence. By performing RNA-seq we have shown that ARID1B expression can induce a set of genes involved in the senescence response.

DESIGN
2 samples examined: IMR90 cells expressing an empty vector and IMR90 cells expressing ARID1B cDNA
