TITLE
Expression data from spontaneous liver tumors of Trim24/TIF1a-null mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional coregulator Trim24 (formerly known as TIF1a) functions in mice as a liver-specific tumor suppressor. Mice carrying a null mutation in the Trim24 gene all develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We used microarrays to identify the alterations in gene expression patterns associated with loss of Trim24 and consequent HCC development. Keywords: normal-tumor comparison

DESIGN
Five independent liver tumor  (HCC) samples taken from five Trim24 knockout (KO) mice and five normal liver tissue samples taken from wild-type (WT) littermate controls  were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix  microarrays.
