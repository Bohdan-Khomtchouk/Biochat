TITLE
Global expression profiling of newly derived EpiSC lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize molecular features of new EpiSC lines established by the Wnt inhibition method, global gene expression profiles of the EpiSC lines were determined by microarray, and compared to those of EpiSC lines established by other group using the conventional method. Epiblasts, the source of the EpiSCs, and mESCs were also analyzed.

DESIGN
EpiSCs and mESC were maintained as undifferentiated state on feeder layers. The stem cells were then separated from feeders, and RNAs were extracted from the stem cell lines. Embryonic tissues were manually dissected out from mouse embryos of E5.5, E6.5 or E7.5, from which RNAs were extracted.
