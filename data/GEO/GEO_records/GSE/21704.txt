TITLE
Expression profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa TBCF10839 wild type and nadk1 mutant under oxidative stress conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Phagocytosis and killing of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) is the major antipseudomonal host defense of vertebrates. By screening a transposon library of the clinical P. aeruginosa isolate TBCF10839 that can grow and replicate in PMNs, a mutant was identified that was most strongly sensitized to killing by PMNs. The inactivated gene PA1572 termed nadK1 was found to encode an ATP:NAD kinase. The transcriptomes of the TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were investigated in the presence of PMNs or H2O2. Exposure to H2O2 led to diametrical mRNA expression profiles. H2O2-degrading enzymes were upregulated by wild type, but not by nadK1 mutant. This data demonstrates that NadK1 is crucial for the response of P. aeruginosa to reactive oxygen species.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were comparatively investigated in the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils or H2O2 in order to investigate the role of NadK1 in oxidative stress response. These samples represent test samples. The expression profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain TBCF10839 wild type cells, isolated from a Cystic Fibrosis patient, was investigated under standard growth conditions in batch culture in Luria broth (LB) with no treatment. These samples represent reference samples. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
