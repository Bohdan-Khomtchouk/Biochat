TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in blood, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The comparability of gene expression between blood and brain tissues is a central issue in neuropsychiatric research where the analysis of molecular mechanisms in the brain is of high importance for the understanding of the diseases and the discovery of biomarkers. However, the accessibility of brain tissue is limited. Therefore, knowledge about how easily accessible peripheral tissue, e.g. blood, is comparable to and reflects the mechanisms of the brain will help to advance neuropsychiatric research. In our study, we have compared the expression of blood, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in genetically identical rats by using a genome-wide Affymetrix gene expression microarray covering 29,215 transcripts. We find 56.8% of genes co-expressed in blood and at least one brain tissue and 55.3% of all genes co-expressed in all three tissues simultaneously. Around one third of the genes is expressed selectively in one tissue. This study provides a baseline analysis of absolute gene expression and its differences in blood, PFC and HC brain tissue in genetically identical rats. Our data might be used for first information on gene expression levels of genes of interest in blood and brain under baseline conditions.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and blood of three Wistar rats.
