TITLE
Reprogramming of a B cell line into macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription factor induced reprogramming of one specialized cell type into another is a promising approach for regenerative medicine. However, the process still remains poorly understood, in large part because of the lack of adequate experimental models. Here we describe a robust cell reprogramming system consisting of a B cell line with an inducible form of C/EBPa that can be converted into macrophages with essentially 100% efficiency in only 2 to 3 days. The conversion involves reciprocal changes in cell surface antigen expression, increase in cell granularity and size, alterations in cellular structures, formation of membrane extensions, acquisition of phagocytic capacity and an increased inflammatory responsiveness as well as migratory activity. Analysis of the transcriptome shows complex reciprocal regulation of B cell and macrophage genes, including transcription factors required for the formation of the two lineages. The fact that the cells become irreversibly committed to a macrophage fate within 1 to 2 days after activation of C/EBPa show that they are truly reprogrammed. The system should be useful to study epigenetic and cell biological mechanisms of transcription factor induced cell reprogramming.
