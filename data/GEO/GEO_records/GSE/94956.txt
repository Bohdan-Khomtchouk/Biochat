TITLE
450k methylation array of H9-hESC derived human neural stem cells with combinations of mutant IDH1-R132H overexpression, P53 shRNA knockdown and/or ATRX shRNA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation profiling was performed to assess methylation alterations by the addition of serial oncogenic hits (mutant-IDH1, P53 knockdown and ATRX knockdown) in human neural stem cells.

DESIGN
Illumina 450k array methylation profiling was performed in duplicates, there are four conditions total. Vector NSCs are the control line and have an empty mCherry vector and a scramble shRNA vector. One hit NSCs express mutant-IDH1 and have a scamble shRNA vector. Two-hit NSCs express mutant IDH1 and have p53 knockdown. Three-hit NSCs express mutant-IDH1, P53 knockdown and ATRX knockdown.
