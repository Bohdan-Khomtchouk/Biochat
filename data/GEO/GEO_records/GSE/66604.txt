TITLE
Inhibition of ABCB1 Overcomes Cancer Stem Cell-like Properties and Acquired Resistance to MET inhibitor in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have shown a dramatic response to EGFR inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). EGFR T790M mutation and MET amplification have been recognized as major mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. Therefore, MET inhibitors have recently been used in NSCLC patients in clinical trials. In this study, we tried to identify the mechanism of acquired resistance to MET inhibitor. We analyzed the antitumor effects of two MET inhibitors, PHA-665752 and crizotinib, in 10 NSCLC cell lines. EBC1 cells with MET amplification were the only cells that were sensitive to both MET inhibitors. We established PHA-665752-resistant EBC1 cells, namely EBC1-R cells. EBC1-R cells showed overexpression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) as well as phosphorylation of MET. EBC1-R cells grew as cell spheres that exhibited cancer stem cell-like (CSC) properties and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). The levels of two miRNAs, miR-374a and miR-138 which targeted ABCB1, were decreased in EBC1-R cells. ABCB1 siRNA and ABCB1 inhibitor elacridar could reduce sphere numbers and suppress EMT. Elacridar could also reverse the resistance to PHA-665752 in EBC1-R cells. Our study demonstrated that ABCB1 overexpression which was associated with CSC properties and EMT was involved in the acquired resistance to MET inhibitor. Inhibition of ABCB1 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to MET inhibitor.

DESIGN
To search resistant mechanisms of met inhibitor in EBC1-R cell, we compared EBC-1 cell and EBC1-R cell.
