TITLE
C. elegans young adults cultured on Bacillus subtilis strain 67 vs cultured on E. coli OP50

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans young adult worms cultured on non-pathogenic Bacillus subtilis strain 67 versus age-matched worms cultured on the control lab food E. coli OP50. The goal was to identify genes regulated in response to differences in diet, which potentially confer immunity to later exposures to pathogenic Bacillus thuringiensis DB27.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment. C. elegans young adults, cultured on : Bacillus subtilis strain 67 versus E. coli OP50. 4 biological replicates, including 2 dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL10094 Agilent-020186 C. elegans (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (Feature Number version)
