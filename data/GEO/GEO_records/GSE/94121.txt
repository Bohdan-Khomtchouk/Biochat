TITLE
The transcriptome of estrogen-independent mammary growth induced by dietary conjugated linoleic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing confirmed that both E and CLA increased the expression of genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression. The transcriptome of the mammary glands from E-treated mice was characterized by canonical E-induced genes including Pgr and Areg, whereas CLA differentially regulated the expression of genes implicated in inflammation â€“ a finding in-line with perturbation of the mammary stroma stimulated by CLA.

DESIGN
A total of 8 groups (Control_60h, Estrogen_60h, Control_84h, Estrogen_84h, Control 108h, CLA_108h, Control_132h, CLA_132h) were analyzed with 5 biological replicates per group for a total of 40 samples.
