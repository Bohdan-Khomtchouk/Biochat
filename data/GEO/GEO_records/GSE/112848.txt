TITLE
different expression of RNAs between breast cancer and benign tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To find differentially expressed RNAs between breast cancer and benign tissue, we have conducted whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that play a key role in the breast cancer progression. Primary cancer tissues and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after resection and were used to perform genome expression analysis.

DESIGN
Comparing to benign tissue, gene expression in human breast cancer tissue was measured. Three independent experiments were performed.
