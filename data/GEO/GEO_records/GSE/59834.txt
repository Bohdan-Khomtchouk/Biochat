TITLE
Genes regulated by SET7/9 knockdown in gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of SET7/9, a histone methyltransferase, was frequently reduced in cultured and primary gastric cancers. To identify the SET7/9 target genes in gastric cancer, we performed siRNA-based knockdown of SET7/9 in MKN74 and MKN45 cells and then examined significant expression changes of genes by microarray.

DESIGN
Transfection of SET7/9 siRNA into MKN74 and MKN45 cells were performed by electroporation. After 48hrs, cells were harvested. Total RNA was used for cDNA microarray.
