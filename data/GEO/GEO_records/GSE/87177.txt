TITLE
Genome wide methylation analysis of breast cancer epithelia, adjacent normal epithelia, breast cancer cell lines, and blood DNA from healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define methylation markers of breast cancer for circulating tumor DNA, we compare the methylation characteristics of breast cancer and blood DNA of healthy individuals.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 119 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
