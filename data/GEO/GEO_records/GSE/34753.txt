TITLE
Tissue-specific transcriptome analysis in nodules of Lotus japonicus

ORGANISM
Lotus japonicus

SUMMARY
Legume plants can establish symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) with rhizobia mostly in root nodules, where rhizobia-infected cells are accompanied with uninfected cells in a mosaic pattern. Inside the mature nodules of legume, carbon and nitrogen nutrients between host plant cells and their resident bacteria are actively exchanged. To elucidate the metabolite dynamics relevant for SNF in nodules, three cell-types from nodule tissues of a model legume, Lotus japonicus, were isolated using laser microdissesction, and transcriptome analysis was done by an oligoarray with 60-mer length representing 21,495 genes. In our cell-type-specific profiling, many genes were identified as being expressed in nodules with spatial-specific manners. Among them, genes coding for metabolic enzymes were classified according to their function, and detailed data analysis figured out that secondary metabolic pathway was highly activated in nodule cortex. In particular, a number of metabolic genes for phenyl propanoid pathway were found as highly expressed genes accompanied with those encoding putative transporters of secondary metabolites. These data suggest the involvement of novel physiological function of phenylpropanoids in SNF.

DESIGN
Gene expression in three different cell-types of Lotus japonicus nodule was measured.  Three independent experiments were performed at each cell-types.
