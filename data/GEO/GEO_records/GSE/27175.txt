TITLE
Formalin Fixation at Low Temperature Better Preserves Nucleic Acid Integrity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION. Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. RESULTS. The cold-fixation (CF) procedure preserved DNA and RNA, so that RNA segments up to 660 bp were efficiently amplified. Histological and immunohistochemical features were fully comparable with those of standard fixation. Microarray-based gene expression profiles were comparable with those obtained on matched frozen samples for probes hybridizing within 700 bases from the reverse transcription start site. In conclusion, CF preserves tissues and nucleic acids, enabling reliable gene expression profiling of fixed tissues.

DESIGN
Thirty samples from human cancers processed in different ways before RNA extraction: (i) Fresh-Freezing (FF), (ii) Standard Fixation with formalin (SF), (iii) Cold-Fixation (CF), a new formalin fixation procedure preserving nucleic acids. The first six samples compare CF with SF and FF in one colorectal cancer (CRC) specimen and one breast cancer (BRCa) specimen. The subsequent 24 samples compare only CF with FF in various cancer specimens. Expression data are neither normalized nor backound subtracted to preserve the original signal distribution for each sample, which is essential to compare expression profiles obtained after different tissue preservation methods.
