TITLE
PAX3-FOXO1 suppresses cellular senescence through RASSF4-mediated restraint of the mammalian Hippo/MST1 pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) is an aggressive sarcoma of skeletal muscle characterized by expression of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene. Despite its discovery over almost 20 years ago, PAX3-FOXO1 remains an enigmatic tumor driver. Previously, we reported that PAX3-FOXO1 supports aRMS initiation by enabling bypass of cellular senescence. Here, we show that bypass occurs in part by PAX3-FOXO1-mediated upregulation of RASSF4, a Ras-association domain family (RASSF) member, which then suppresses the evolutionarily conserved mammalian Hippo/Mst1 pathway. RASSF4 loss-of-function activates Hippo/Mst1 and inhibits downstream YAP, causing aRMS cell cycle arrest and senescence. This is the first evidence for an oncogenic role for RASSF4, and a novel mechanism for Hippo signaling suppression in human cancer. Human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMMs) were retrovirally transduced with either an empty vector (Vp, pK1) or PAX3-FOXO1 (PFp, pK1-PAX3-FOXO1) and selected on puromycin. Presenescent (presen) cells were harvested before the senescence checkpoint. Since cells expressing PAX3-FOXO1 can bypass the senescence checkpoint, postsenescent (postsen) cells expressing PAX3-FOXO1 were also harvested.
