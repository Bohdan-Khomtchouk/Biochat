TITLE
Chromatin Accessibility Reveals Insight into Androgen Receptor Activation and Transcriptional Specificity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using DNase-seq, mRNA-seq and publicly available ChIP-seq data sets, we examined the role of chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq) in androgen receptor binding to the genome (ChIP-seq) and AR-mediated transcriptional changes (mRNA-seq). Our data reveals genome-wide changes in chromatin structure that correspond to AR binding and  differential gene expression.  A focused examination of DNase-seq data around androgen receptor motifs within androgen receptor ChIP-seq peaks reveals distinct patterns of protection from DNaseI cleavage.

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq), AR binding (AR ChIP-seq), and transcription (mRNA-seq) in LNCaP cells before and after 12 hours of 1 nM R1881 treatment This Series represents the RNA-Seq data only. Exon microarray data generated under the same conditions is available through GSE15805.  The DNase-seq data is publicly available through GSE32970 as well as the UCSC genome browser (genome.ucsc.edu) under Regulation::ENCODE DNase/FAIRE::Duke DNaseI HS:LNCaP and LNCaP + Andro.  The accession numbers for the ChIP-seq experiments used are GSE14097 and GSE28126.
