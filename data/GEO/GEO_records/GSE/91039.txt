TITLE
mRNA-seq comparison of L1 larvae experiencing osmotic and starvation-induced arrest

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Wild-type (N2) C. elegans embryos were plated with or without E. coli OP50 as food and with 100mM or 500mM NaCl at 25C (4 conditions). They were allowed to develop for 24hr and collected as L1 larvae for RNA-seq.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were sequenced for each of four conditions: 100mM NaCl & OP50, 100mM NaCl & no OP50, 500mM NaCl and OP50, 500mM NaCl and no OP50
