TITLE
The Calcium Channel Subunit Alpha2delta2 Suppresses Axon Regeneration in the Adult CNS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Injuries to the adult central nervous system (CNS) often result in permanent disabilities because neurons lose the ability to regenerate their axon during development. Although the developmental transition from a growing to a transmitting phase may represent one of the first steps in the gradual loss of axon growth and regeneration ability, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process has yet to be identified. The main goal of this study was to dissect the molecular mechanisms mediating the decline in axon growth ability and its relationship with regeneration failure in the adult CNS. To this end, we sequenced the whole transcriptome of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in both growth competent and incompetent states at different developmental stages, in diverse culture and in vivo experimental conditions.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of mouse embryonic E12.5 and E17.5 lumbar DRGs, conditioned and sham operated adult L4-5DRGs, and cultured adult lumbar DRG (6, 12, 24 and 36 hr after plating) neurons were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kits V2.
