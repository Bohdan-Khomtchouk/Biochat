TITLE
Expression data of human coronary artery perivascular adipocytes and subcutaneous adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory crosstalk between perivascular adipose tissue and and blood vessel wall may contribute to atherosclerosis pathogenesis, and exhibits more pro-inflammatory than adipogenic phenotype than subcutaneous adipocytes. To identify a genomic basis for biologic differences, we performed genome-wide expression to identiy expression genes differentially regulated between perivascular and subcutaneous adipocytes.for biologic differences.

DESIGN
We performed global gene expression analyses on in vitro differentiated adipocytes from human left coronary artery perivascular adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissues derived from unrelated donors who were non-obese and did not have any known metabolic or atherosclerotic disease.
