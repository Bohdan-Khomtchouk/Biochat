TITLE
Genome wide gene-expression analysis of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae after long term host transfer from acyanogenic Phaseolus vulgaris cv. 'Prelude' bean plants to cyanogenic Phaseolus lunatus cv. '8078' bean plants

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
250 adult T. urticae females from the London strain (grown on acyanogenic P. vulgaris cv. Prelude bean plants) were transferred to cyanogenic P. lunatus cv. 8078 bean plants.  Thirty-five generations after the host transfer, total RNA was extracted from mites growing on both bean species (London and London-CYANO strain) and used in in a genome-wide gene expression microarray (Sureprint G3 microarray, Agilent) experiment to assess significantly differentially expressed genes (FC â‰¥ 2 and FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05) between mites grown on P. vulgaris (cv. Prelude) bean plants (London strain) and mites grown for 35 generations on P. lunatus (cv. 8078) bean plants (London-CYANO strain).

DESIGN
4 replicates for one comparison: mites of the London strain grown on P. lunatus for 35 generations (London-CYANO) compared to mites of the London strain grown on P. vulgaris bean plants (London)
