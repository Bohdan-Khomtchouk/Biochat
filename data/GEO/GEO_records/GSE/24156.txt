TITLE
Drosophila_2hr_mated

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that social interactions, such as those involved in courtship and mating, would lead to assayable changes in gene expression that may have important effects on individual reproductive success and fitness through alterations in physiology or changes in nervous system function.

DESIGN
Five-day-old males were collected two hours after mating with or courting a virgin female compared to males that were left alone for the 2 hrs. After collection, RNA was extracted from male head tissue. Five samples for each treatment were hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome arrays for a total of 15 arrays. Data were analyzed using dChip PM, dChip PM-MM, MAS5.0, R/Bioconductor GC-RMA, and GeneSpring GC-RMA.
