TITLE
ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments on female ESCs expressing V5-tagged REX1 and control wild-type Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evolution of the mammalian sex chromosomes has resulted in a heterologous X and Y pair, where the Y chromosome has lost most of its genes. Hence, there is a need for X-linked gene dosage compensation between XY males and XX females. In placental mammals, this is achieved by random inactivation of one X chromosome (XCI) in all female somatic cells. Up-regulation of Xist transcription on the future inactive X chromosome (Xi) acts against Tsix antisense transcription, and spreading of Xist RNA in cis triggers epigenetic changes leading to XCI. Previously, we have shown that the X-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF12 is up-regulated in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)  and activates Xist transcription and XCI. Here, we have identified the pluripotency factor REX1 as a key target of RNF12 in the XCI mechanism. RNF12 causes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of REX1, and Rnf12 knockout mouse ESCs show an increased level of REX1. Using ChIP-seq, REX1 binding sites were detected in Xist and Tsix regulatory regions. Over-expression of REX1 in female ESCs was found to inhibit Xist transcription and XCI, whereas male Rex1+/- ESCs showed ectopic XCI. From this, we propose that RNF12 causes REX1 breakdown through dose-dependent catalysis, thereby representing an important pathway to initiate XCI. Rex1 and Xist are present only in placental mammals, which points to co-evolution of these two genes and XCI.
