TITLE
The Demethylase JMJD2C/KDM4C Localizes to H3K4me3 Positive Transcription Start Sites (ChIP-seq ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped binding sites for the histone demethylase, Jmjd2c/Kdm4c/Gasc1, in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed using an antibody recognizing Jmjd2c. Chromatin was obtained from conditional Jmjd2c knockout ESCs cultured in the absence or presence of OHT to induce activation of Cre recombinase and loss of Jmjd2c expression.

PLATFORM
