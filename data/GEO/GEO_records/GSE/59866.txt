TITLE
Identification of early targets of SOX2 and PI3K signaling in normal, patient-derived tracheal basal cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes in patient derived tracheal basal cell lines after treatment with Lenti-SOX2. Comparisons were made between baseline, Lenti-SOX2 and Lenti-SOX2 with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from celll lnes 36 hours post lentivirus addition.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
