TITLE
Similarities and differences between human activated macrophages I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human AA dataset 5 includes the gene expression profile of monocyte-derived macrophages isolated from blood donor buffy coats and plated on TCP in medium containing 10% autologous serum. Cells were stimulated for 120 hours with 50 ng/ml of IL-4, 50 U/ml of IFN-γ plus 12.5 ng/ml of TNF-α, 50 ng/ml of M-CSF or 50 ng/ml of IL-10. RNA samples were isolated using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche) and the RNeasy Mini Kit-Qiagen Clean up method. The transcriptional profile was evaluated in two independent cell preparations, each derived from a different single donor using the HT12 V4 R2 bead chip arrays from Illumina.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to representative polarizing cytokines
