TITLE
A jasmonate ZIM-domain protein NaJAZd regulates floral jasmonic acid levels and counteracts flower abscission in Nicotiana attenuata plants

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of JAZd after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae.

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and irJAZd plants was measured at 2 hour after elicitation with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae. Three independent experiments were performed with wild type plants and three independent experiments were performed with irJAZd plants. A total of  503 genes were identified as more the 2 fold differentially regulated in irJAZd plants compared to wild type plants.
