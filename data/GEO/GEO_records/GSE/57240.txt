TITLE
Expression analysis of p53-/- and p53-/-, Ha-RasV12-transformed MEFs upon E4F1 gene inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E4F1 is a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger protein of the Gli-Kruppel family that was first identified, more than 30 years ago, as a cellular target of the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A13S (Ad type V), required for transcriptional regulation of adenoviral genes. In order to identify the p53-independent program controlled by E4F1, we performed microarray analyses in p53 KO and p53 KO; Ha-RasV12-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in wild type and E4F1-inactivated cells.

DESIGN
To address p53-independent E4F1 transcriptome, a 12 chip array study has been realized using total RNA recovered from wild-type (E4F1+/flox, CRE infected; odd Samples) MEFs and E4F1-depleted (E4F1-/flox, CRE infected; even Samples) MEFs in p53-/- (Samples 1 to 12) and p53-/-, Ha-RasV12 background (Samples 13 to 24). p53-/- MEFs were derived from 13.5-day mouse embryos. Transformed p53-/- MEFs were generated by infection with a recombinant retrovirus encoding for Ha-RasV12. Three independent biological replicates of wild-type and knock-out MEFs for E4F1 have been used on the two genetic backgrounds.
