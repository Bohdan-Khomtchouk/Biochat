TITLE
Stem cell lines of the early mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of stem cell lines derived from the early embryo representing the trophoblast, primitive endoderm, early epiblast (inner cell mass E3.5) and late post-implantation epiblast (E5.5).

DESIGN
Cells were grown without feeders and harvested. Comparisons were made to provide evidence of unique gene expression between the cell lines. Specifically, pre-implantation (ICM, epiblast and primitive endoderm, and trophoblast), as well as pre-implantation and post-implantation epiblasts.
