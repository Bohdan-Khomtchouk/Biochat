PPARγ activation promotes infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages into adipose tissue.

SUMMARY
Background: Obesity is associated with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue. Adipose macrophages may contribute to an elevated inflammatory status by secreting a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNFalpha and IL-6. Recent data suggest that during diet-induced obesity the phenotype of adipose-resident macrophages changes from alternatively activated macrophages towards a more classical and pro-inflammatory phenotype. Here, we explore the effect of PPARγ-activation on obesity-induced inflammation in 129SV mice fed a high fat diet for 20 weeks. High fat feeding increased bodyweight gain, adipose tissue mass and liver triglycerides. Rosiglitazone treatment further increased adipose mass, reduced liver triglycerides and changed adipose tissue morphology towards smaller adipocytes. Surprisingly, rosiglitazone markedly increased the number of macrophages in adipose tissue, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of macrophage marker genes CD68 and F4/80+. In adipose tissue, markers for classically activated macrophages including IL-18 were down regulated whereas markers characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages (Arginase 1, IL-10) were up regulated by rosiglitazone. Importantly, conditioned media from rosiglitazone-treated alternatively activated macrophages neutralized the inhibitory effect of macrophages on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that alternatively activated macrophages may be involved in mediating the effects of rosiglitazone on adipose tissue morphology and mass. Our results suggest that short term rosiglitazone treatment increases infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue. The alternatively activated macrophages might play a role in PPARγ-dependent expansion and remodeling of adipose tissue. Keywords: metabolic state analysis

DESIGN
Pure bred wild-type (129S1/SvImJ) male mice received a low fat diet or high fat diet for 21 weeks, providing 10 or 45% energy percent in the form of triglycerides (D12450B or D12451, Research Diets, New Brunswick, USA). The lard component in these diets was replaced by palm oil.  In the last week of diet intervention, half of the mice receiving the HFD were switched to HFD supplemented with Rosiglitazone (0.01 % wt/wt). Animals were sacrificed in the fed state. Epididymal adipose tissue was excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pooled RNA samples from 5 mice per experimental group were used for microarray analysis. Samples were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430-2.0 plus arrays. Five microgram total RNA was labelled according to the Affymetrix One-cycle Target Labeling Assay, fragmented and hybridized according to Affymetrix's protocols.
