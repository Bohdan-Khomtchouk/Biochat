TITLE
MicroRNA-150 Contributes to the Proficiency of B-Cell Receptor Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia by Regulating Expression of GAB1 and FOXP1 Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and identified miR-150 as the most abundant, but with leukemia-cell-expression levels that varied among patients. CLL cells that expressed ZAP-70 or that used unmutated IGHV each had a median expression-level of miR-150 that was significantly lower than that of ZAP-70-negative CLL cells or those that used mutated IGHV. In samples stratified for expression of miR-150, CLL cells with low-level miR-150 expressed relatively higher levels of forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) and GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1), genes with 3â€™ UTRs having evolutionary-conserved binding sites for miR-150. High-level expression of miR-150 could repress expression of these genes, which encode proteins that may enhance B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, a putative CLL-growth/survival signal. Also, high-level expression of miR-150 levels was a significant independent predictor of longer treatment-free-survival (TFS) or overall survival (OS), whereas an inverse association was observed for high-level expression of GAB1 or FOXP1 for OS. This study demonstrates that expression of miR-150 can influence the relative expression of GAB1 and FOXP1 and the signaling potential of the B-cell receptor (BCR), thereby possibly accounting for the noted association of expression of miR-150 and disease outcome.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression analysis on isolated leukemia cells from 100 CLL patients using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 platform. Array data was processed by dChip software ( http://www.dchip.org ). No techinical replicates were performed.
