TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analyses by RNAseq to determine the change that happens in the peripheral taste system with age.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanisms that regulate the renewal and maintenance of taste cells we performed RNA-sequencing analysis on isolated taste cells from 2 and 6 month old mice to determine how alterations in the taste cell-transcriptome regulate taste cell maintenance and function in adults. We found that the Activator Protein-1 (AP1) transcription factors (c-Fos, Fosb and c-Jun) and genes associated with this pathway were significantly  downregulated in taste cells from 6 month old mice and further declined at 12 months. We generated conditional c-Fos- knockout mice to target K14-expressing cells, including differentiating taste cells. c-Fos deletion caused a severe perturbation in taste bud structure and resulted in a significant reduction in the taste bud size. c-Fos deletion also affected taste cell turnover as evident by, a decrease in proliferative markers, and upregulation of the apoptotic marker cleaved-PARP. Thus, AP1 factors are important regulators of adult taste cell renewal and their downregulation negatively impacts taste maintenance.
