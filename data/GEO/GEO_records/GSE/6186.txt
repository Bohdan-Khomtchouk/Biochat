TITLE
Whole Genome Drosophila Embryogenesis Time Course

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed the expression of every gene in the Drosophila genome during the first 24 hours of development to examine patterns of gene activatio and repression responsbile for early development. Keywords: Expression Arrays time course

DESIGN
We isolated mRNA from each time point and hybridized against a reference set of RNA that was pooled from time points across all of development.
