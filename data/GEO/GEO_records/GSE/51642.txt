TITLE
Assessment of embryonic vascular toxicity by pluripotent stem cell-derived arterial endothelial cells on a microfluidic system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the similaries and differences between 3 types of arterial cells (adult cells, fetal cells, and arterial cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, we analyzed the gene expression. We were able to confirm the specific gene expression hallmark of arterial endothelial cells and also to identify which are the genes that make the difference between fetal and derived endothelial cells.

DESIGN
The 3 populations of cells were tripsinized and compared between them, without any treatment. All the populations were studied at the same passage number (p4) and cultured at the same densities and using the same culture media.
