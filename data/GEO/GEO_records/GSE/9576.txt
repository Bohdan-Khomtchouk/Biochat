TITLE
Gene expression profiling of classical midgut carcinoid primary tumors and liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify genes presenting a specific expression profile in midgut carcinoid cells, primary carcinoids tumors and liver metastasis were gene profiled. Gene expression profiling of classical midgut carcinoid primary tumors and liver metastasis reveal potential novel therapeutic targets and molecular signatures. Keywords: disease state comparison

DESIGN
Normal and tumoral (carcinoid) cells
