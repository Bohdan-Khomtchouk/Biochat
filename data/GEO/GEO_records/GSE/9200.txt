TITLE
Feedback Circuit among INK4 Tumor Suppressors Constrains Human Glioblastoma Development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed a nonheuristic genome topography scan (GTS) algorithm to characterize the patterns of genomic alterations in human glioblastoma (GBM), identifying frequent p18INK4C and p16INK4A codeletion. Functional reconstitution of p18INK4C in GBM cells null for both p16INK4A and p18INK4C resulted in impaired cell-cycle progression and tumorigenic potential. Conversely, RNAi-mediated depletion of p18INK4C in p16INK4A-deficient primary astrocytes or established GBM cells enhanced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, acute suppression of p16INK4A in primary astrocytes induced a concomitant increase in p18INK4C. Together, these findings uncover a feedback regulatory circuit in the astrocytic lineage and demonstrate a bona fide tumor suppressor role for p18INK4C in human GBM wherein it functions cooperatively with other INK4 family members to constrain inappropriate proliferation. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series. DNA copy number and mRNA transcriptome of human glioblastoma tumors were profiled using Agilent and Affymetrix microarrays.
