TITLE
Enrichment of processed pseudogene transcripts in L1-ribonucleoprotein particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the RNA binding properties of LINE-1 ORF1p, both free and in the L1 RNP, using a recently developed photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation technique (PAR-CLIP) to comprehensively identify ORF1p binding sites in the transcriptome of human cells (HEK293T). Our results show that ORF1p binds to a wide range of cellular mRNAs, with an enrichment for binding at the 3â€™ UTR. Our data also show that ORF1p binds very strongly with retrotransposable RNA, i.e., L1, Alu and SVA.
