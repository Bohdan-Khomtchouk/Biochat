TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy microarray for WT and jhd2-delete strains though sporulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
WT (MMY718) and jhd2∆ (MMY1879) sporulating cell cultures were profiled for global nucleosome occupancy using Affymetrix high-resolution tiling arrays.

DESIGN
MNase-treated mono-nucleosomes from WT and jhd2∆ cultures in rich media, and sporulation timepoints at 0h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, and 16h were microarrayed.
