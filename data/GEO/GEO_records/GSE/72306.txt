TITLE
Identification of differential expression genes in gastric cancer cell SGC7901 with or without knockdown KIF26B.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the study presented here, differential expression analysis of global gene profiling were performed in gastric cancer cells transfected with siKIF26B or negative control.

DESIGN
To characterize the overall cellular response to KIF26B silencing, gene expression microarray profiling was performed in SGC7901 cells.
