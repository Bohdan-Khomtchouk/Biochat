TITLE
MicroRNA expression during somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The microarray test aims to find the miRNAs involved in somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.  The plant microRNA array V2.0 (CapitalBio Corp., Beijing, China) contained 426 non-reduplicated plant miRNA probes, including 188 in Arabidopsis. Finally, 75 plant miRNAs expressed differentially, 36 increased and 39 decreased included.

DESIGN
Two critical period samples of somatic embryogenesis were chosen for the microarray test: the edge of embryonic calli in embryonic callus-inducing medium (ECIM) for 14 days and the secondary somatic embryos protuberances in somatic embryo-inducing medium (SEIM) for 2 days (marked as “14D” and “J2D” accordingly) . Three chip were test in each sample.
