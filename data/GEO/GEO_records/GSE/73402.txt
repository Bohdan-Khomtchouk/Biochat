TITLE
Sixty-two lung squamous precancerous and cancer samples obtained from brochoscopy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression signature for survival prediction, we conducted expression profiles of lung squamous carcinoma precancerous and cancer samples.

DESIGN
Precancerous progression and cancer samples of LSQC were collected from 62 cases through bronchoscopy in Department of Endoscopy, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The biopsy samples included 23 precancerous progression cases [5 cases with mild or moderate dysplasia (P1) and 18 cases with carcinoma in situ (P2)], and 39 lung squamous carcinoma cases (11 Stage I, 13 Stage II, 8 Stage III and 7 Stage IV cases).
