TITLE
Gene expression profile after injection of rhabdoviral recombinant protein NV

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Due to the common presence of a non-virion NV gene absent from other fish rhabdoviruses, NV-coding rhabdoviruses, such as the viral haemorrhagic septicemia (VHSV), were placed into a new Novirhabdovirus genus. Because conflicting results do exist on the importance of NV for VHSV trout pathogenicity and the NV function is still unclear, the effects of intraperitoneal injection of recombinant NV protein were studied by using home-designed immune-related microarrays from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.  The results were compared with parallel experiments using bacterial flagellins, a well know mammalian agonist of toll receptors (tlr5) with adjuvant activity recently described also in fish
