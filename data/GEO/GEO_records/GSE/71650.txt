TITLE
MicroRNA Profile in CD8+ T-lymphocytes from HIV-Infected Individuals: Relationship with Disease Progression

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The relationship between host microRNAs (miRNA), viral control and immune response has not been elucidated in the field of HIV yet. The aim of this study was to assess the differential miRNA profile in CD8+ T-cells between HIV-infected individuals who differ in terms of disease progression.
