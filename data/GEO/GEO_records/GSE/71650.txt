TITLE
MicroRNA Profile in CD8+ T-lymphocytes from HIV-Infected Individuals: Relationship with Disease Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The relationship between host microRNAs (miRNA), viral control and immune response has not been elucidated in the field of HIV yet. The aim of this study was to assess the differential miRNA profile in CD8+ T-cells between HIV-infected individuals who differ in terms of disease progression.

DESIGN
A total of 136 RNAs (miRNAs) were analyzed: 68 RNAs from resting CD8+ T-cells and the respective 68 RNAs from stimulated CD8+ T-cells from Elite Controllers (EC, n=15), Viremic Controllers (VC, n=15), Viremic Progressors (VP, n=13), Treated Patients (ART, n=14) and Uninfect Donors (HIV-, n=11).
