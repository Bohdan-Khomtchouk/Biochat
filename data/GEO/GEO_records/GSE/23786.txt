TITLE
Metatranscriptomics provides insight into the physiologies of the digestive tract symbionts within the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana

ORGANISM
Hirudo verbana

SUMMARY
Here, we report the use of Illumina RNA-Seq for investigating the physiology of the digestive-tract microbiome within the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana.  About 12 million cDNA reads were mapped against the genomes of the two dominant members of this simple microbiome.  Results suggested that the most abundant, yet uncultured Rikenella-like bacterium forages host mucin glycans and ferments the carbohydrates to acetate that is secreted into the environment.  The second dominant symbiont, Aeromonas veronii, appears to utilize the acetate secreted by Rikenella as a carbon and energy source, possibly linking the physiologies of the dominant symbionts.  This study demonstrates how RNA-seq can be used to reveal the physiology of a naturally occurring microbiome.

DESIGN
Examination of the physiology of the leech gut microbiome 42 hrs after ingestion of a blood meal
