TITLE
Host cell gene expression profile in Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infected Hep2 cells at 4, 8, 12 and 15 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on Hep2 cells infected with HRSV.

DESIGN
The HRSV infected Hep2 cells were harvested at 4, 8, 12 and 15 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host cell response to HRSV infection.
