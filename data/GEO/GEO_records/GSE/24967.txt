TITLE
Liver transcriptome comparison of divergently selected Lean and Fat mouse lines in cholesterol homeostasis, bile acids, glucose and lipoprotein metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify molecular basis of obesity-resistant mechanisms in the Lean line with the emphasis on lipid homeostasis. Expression profiling using custom Steroltalk v2 microarray demonstrated that Lean mice exhibit a higher hepatic expression of cholesterol synthesis genes compared to the Fat line. A significant difference between the strains was also found in the bile acid metabolism. We identified novel candidate molecular targets by which we can at least in part explain resistance to obesity development in the Lean line.

DESIGN
Direct comparison of 10 Lean and 10 Fat mouse samples. For 7 out of 10 comparisons dye-swap technical replication were performed.
