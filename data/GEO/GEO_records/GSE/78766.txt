TITLE
INO80 promotes reassembly of promoter proximal nucleosomes.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
INO80 and SWR1 mediate the exchange of H2A.Z and H2A. The influence of H2A.Z on overall gene expression in yeast is limited. Here we analyzed the possible influence on stress induced transcription, which changes expression of a large proportion of all yeast genes.

DESIGN
Yeast cells (wild type and htz1 mutant) were grown to exponential phase and treated with osmotic stress (0.4M NaCl) for 20 minutes or left untreated. Experiments were performed with 2 biological replicates.
