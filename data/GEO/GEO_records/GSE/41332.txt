TITLE
Transcription analysis of photocoagulated human retinal pigment epithelial cells in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ARPE-19 cells were either laser treated or not, and analyzed 2, 6 and 24 hours after laser treatment. In addition, the cells were treated with high or low glucose (T2D complications analysis). The difference in glucose levels did not make much difference in regards to gene expression.

DESIGN
52 ARPE-19 samples including controls and laser-treated samples. Separate analysis for high and low glucose levels.
