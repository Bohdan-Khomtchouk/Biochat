TITLE
Expression data from wheat cultivars

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in susceptibility, genechip hybridization experiments were performed in order to examine genes differentially expressed upon inoculation of resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars with powdery mildew. Some genes were identified which were just expressed in the susceptible host both after mock-inoculation and pathogen infection. Also, a total of 2693 transcripts were differentially expressed (fold changeâ‰¥2) in Yumai 13 in response to powdery mildew as compared to itself, comprising 1464 and 1229 up- and down-regulated genes respectively.

DESIGN
Seven-day-old wheat seedlings of susceptible cultivar Yumai 13, two resistant cultivars HY and CYC were inoculated with powdery mildew and harvested at 0, 24, 48 hpi for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to screen some genes which have very high expression in Yumai 13, but not in CYC and HY by pairwise comparation.
