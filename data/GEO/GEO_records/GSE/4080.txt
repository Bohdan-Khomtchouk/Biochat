TITLE
Effect of DES-treated Ept congenic rat lines on gene expression in the anterior pituitary gland.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Anterior pituitary glands were isolated from 21 week old male rats treated for 12 weeks with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Three biological replicates were prepared for each of 4 congenic lines: Ept1, Ept2, Ept6, and Ept9. Congenic rat lines were constructed by introgressing COP alleles onto an ACI background within a given Ept locus. Expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 v. 2.0 arrays. Comparison of congenic rats with the ACI and COP parental strains (see series GSE4028) will allow identification of genes whose expression is influenced by an estrogen-induced pituitary tumor (Ept) QTL.
