TITLE
Loss of histone demethylase JARID1C triggers genomic instability in cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin remodelers are recurrently mutated in cancer. Among these, JARID1C, (KDM5C) a histone demethylase, is frequently inactivated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. How the genetic inactivation of JARID1C leads to cancer remains largely unknown. Here we report that JARID1C binds to broad chromatin domains characterized by the trimethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9me3), an histone mark enriched in heterochromatin. We also found that JARID1C localizes on heterochromatin, is required for heterochromatin replication, and forms a complex with established and novel players of heterochromatin assembly, such as SUV39H1 and HP1 and the CUL4 complex adaptor protein DDB1, respectively. To safeguard the genome, transcription on heterochromatin is tightly suppressed. JARID1C inactivation leads to the unrestrained expression of heterochromatic ncRNAs, that in turn trigger genomic instability. Remarkably, ccRCC patients harbouring JARID1C mutations show aberrant ncRNA expression and increased genomic rearrangements when compared with tumors endowed with other genetic lesions. Together, these data suggest that the inactivation of JARID1C in renal cancer leads to heterochromatin disruption and to aggressive, genomically rearranged ccRCCs, shedding light on a novel mechanism underlying genomic instability in sporadic cancers.
