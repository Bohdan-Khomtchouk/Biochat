TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of primary human AML samples with distinct susceptibilities to telomerase inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles of human AML patient samples. The hypothesis tested was that AML patient samples showing a higher sensitivity to subsequent telomerase inhibition would already harbour a telomerase deficiency gene expression signature before treatment that may be useful to predict therapeutic efficacy. The results provide a clear separation of AML patient samples based on a telomerase deficiency gene signature that is correlated with subsequent sensitivity to pharmacologic telomerase inhibition assessed in a xenograft transplantation system in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA from sorted viable human CD45+ expressing AML patient cells expanded in an NSGS xenograft transplantation assay in vivo.
