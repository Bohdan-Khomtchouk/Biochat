TITLE
Inflammatory bowel disease (HG-U133A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples for microarray analysis were derived from terminal ileum and colonic tissues from probands with Crohn´s disease and Ulcerative Colitis and control patients, respectively. IBD tissue biopsies from non-inflamed regions 10 cm distant from pathological areas were selected. To minimize inter-individual differences in gene expression and to enrich for IBD-specific transcriptional events, 2.5 µg of total RNA from terminal ileum and colon transversum from four individuals of each patient and control group were used for pooling. Gene expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix HG-U133A Gene Chips. Keywords: ordered
