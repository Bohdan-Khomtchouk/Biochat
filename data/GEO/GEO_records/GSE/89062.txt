TITLE
Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Dynamics of Rituximab Treatment in B Lymphoblastoid Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The investigation aims to profile the molecular dynamics of Rituximab treatment in cells.  Specifically, a B-lymphoblast cells line was treated with Rituximab, and sampled every hour over a 24hour period. Treated and untreated cells were processed to extract RNA and protein that were subsequently used in high-throughput analysis of the transcriptome (RNA-Sequencing) and proteome (mass spectrometry). We expect our approach not only to provide a unique reference dataset to the scientific community but to also act as a paradigm as an approach to identify novel transcriptome-proteome molecular markers utilized in mapping drug action pathways. We have identified specific expression at both the gene and protein levels and are inferring associations between the omics through the use of temporal pattern identification, thus defining time-varying networks. This study will provide the next steps in the development of reference dynamic omics data that may be used in creating integration models, with further applications in dynamic monitoring of samples in precision medicine implementation.

DESIGN
Examination of dynamics in a treated cell line and a parallel untreated control line, both sampled over 24hrs every hour. Validation using a new repeated experiment, with treated and untreated tracks, sampled over 6 selected time points.
