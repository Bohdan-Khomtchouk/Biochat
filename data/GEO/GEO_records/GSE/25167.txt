TITLE
Transcriptional responses to nanoparticulate matter in human skin-derived cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated transcriptional effects of particles smaller than 100 nm of TiO2 and ZnO.  Based on previous data in colon cancer cells (GSE14910), we evaluated HaCaT and Sk Mel-28 cells for transcriptional responses to 1 and 5 ug/cm2 ZnO, or 5 and 10 ug/cm2 TiO2.  No particle controls were also included. Again, the most pronounced transcriptional response resulted from ZnO treatement with little responses to TiO2. We identified increased protein stress responses, decreased regulation of transcription, and responses to Zn ions.  We did not observe the protein stress response and regulation of transcription with soluble Zn. Keywords: skin-derived cancer cells - response to ZnO nanoparticulate

DESIGN
Two skin-derived cancer cell types (HaCaT and SK Mel-28) were treated with media containing the nanoparticulate,  ZnCl2, or ZnO separated from the HaCaTs by a Transwell insert, and RNA was collected after 4 hrs.  Generally, the RNA from 4 independent samples were combined for one microarray.
