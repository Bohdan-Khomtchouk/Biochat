TITLE
Temperature-dependent regulation of gene expression in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus treated with poly (I:C)

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
253 genes showed more than 4-fold up- or down-regulated expressions by poly (I:C) at 15 ºC and 25 ºC.

DESIGN
Fish were treated with poly(I:C) and reared at 15 ºC and 25 ºC and isolation of total RNA from spleen of the fish at 3 and 24 hours after the treatment.
