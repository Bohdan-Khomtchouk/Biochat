TITLE
A Stable Transcription Factor Complex Nucleated by Dimeric AML1-ETO Controls Leukaemogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML1-ETO, a fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, is a transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation. We now show that, in leukemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable protein complex (AETFC) that contains several hematopoietic transcription factors and cofactors. In conjunction with biochemical and leukemia pathological studies, the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of the AETFC components in leukemic cells reveal that these components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, colocalize genome-wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukemogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analyses gene expression upon knockdown of each AETFC component, including AML1-ETO, HEB, E2A, LYL1, LDB1 and LMO2, and double-knockdown of HEB and E2A, in Kasumi-1 cells. ChIP-seq analyses of four AETFC components, namely AML1-ETO, HEB, E2A and LMO2, in Kasumi-1 cells.
