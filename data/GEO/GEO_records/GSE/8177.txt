TITLE
DNaseI/Array multiple cell types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to map DNaseI sensitivity and DNaseI hypersensitive sites over the ENCODE regions in multiple human cell types (GM06990, CACO2, HepG2). Keywords: DNase/Array

DESIGN
DNA fragments released from DNaseI cut sites in nuclear chromatin were collected and hybridized to the Nimblegen ENCODE array. DNaseI-fragmented naked DNA was used as a control.
