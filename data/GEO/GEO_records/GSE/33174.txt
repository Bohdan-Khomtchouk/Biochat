TITLE
Effects of acute dietary zinc depletion on the gene expression profile of whole blood in human male adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Even though the importance of adequate zinc intake has been known for around half a century, a reliable diagnostic tool to assess the dietary zinc status of individual humans or populations is in absence. The specific aim of this study was to examine differential expression of specific gene transcripts that occur when the dietary intake of zinc is acutely reduced below the dietary requirement for a period of ten days. Gene expression profiles of whole blood collected before and after dietary zinc restriction were determined by microarray analyses. The data provide potential signature genes of suboptimal zinc consumption and relevant bioinformatic interpretation indicate immune response and cell cycle regulation as biological processes associated with the zinc-responsive genes.

DESIGN
To identify candidate markers holding the potential to indicate zinc status, a 24-day observational study comprised of acclimation (7 d; 10.4 mg Zn/d), zinc depletion (10 d; 0.3 mg Zn/d), and zinc repletion (7 d; 29.5 mg Zn/d) phases was conducted with healthy male subjects (n = 9). On day 0, 6 and 10 of zinc depletion, whole blood was collectedunder morning fasting state. RNA profiles were stabilized by using PAXgene reagents during the collection process and globin RNA reduction was conducted to improve the detection of transcripts at low abundance. Genes responding to dietary zinc restriction were determined by array results from individual samples collected before and after 10 d of zinc depletion. Pooled RNA samples from each day of blood collection, i.e., baseline, 6 d and 10 d of depletion, respectively, were used to determine the temporal expression pattern of the zinc-responsive genes during dietary zinc depletion.
