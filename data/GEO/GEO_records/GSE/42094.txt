TITLE
Dynamic regulation of miRNA and mRNA signatures during in vitro pancreatic differentiation (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The remarkable differentiation capacity of pluripotent stem cells into any adult cell types have enabled researchers to model human embryonic development and disease process in dishes, as well as deriving specialized cells for replacing damaged tissues. Type 1 diabetes is a degenerative disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta islet cells in the pancreas. Recent advances have led to the establishment of different methods to direct differentiation of human or mouse pluripotent stem cells toward beta cell lineages. However, existing strategies have not yet succeeded in generating fully functional beta cells in vitro. Thus, it remains a major challenge to identify novel regulators of beta cell differentiation and maturation, and the islet-specific genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks are logical targets.

DESIGN
To obtain a comprehensive view of the mRNA expression pattern during in vitro directed differentiation of hPSC into pancreatic beta islet cells, we collected 16 samples of 6 stages of differentiated derivatives, 2 samples of human fetal pancreas and 5 samples of purified human beta islet cells for analysis. With these samples, we performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling using the Illumina Infinium HT-12 v4 Gene Expression BeadArray.
