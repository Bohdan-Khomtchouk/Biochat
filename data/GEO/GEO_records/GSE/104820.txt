TITLE
Opposing roles of dendritic cells subsets in experimental GN

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Classical dendritic cells (DCs) are key players at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. In the kidney exist 2 major subsets of cDCs: CD11b+ cDCs and CD103+ cDCs. We investigated their function in the most widely used model of experimental glomerulonephritis (GN) in mice: nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN). Consistent with a role for cDCs in nephrotoxic nephritis, depletion of ZBTB46+ cells (all cDCs) attenuated kidney injury, while deficiency of the CD103+ subset of cDCs accelerated injury via a mechanism that involved increased neutrophils. This RNAseq was performed to analyze transcriptional changes in FACS-sorted renal CD11b+ and CD103+ cDCs under healthy conditions and at day 7 of NTN to reveal why both subsets have different functions in GN.

DESIGN
The study was performed with total of 6 mice (wildtype, male, age 8-12 weeks). 3 mice were sacrificed in the healthy situation, 3 mice were sacrificed 7 days after injection of the nephrotoxic nephritis antiserum (NTN). From each mouse CD11b+ and CD103+ DCs were sorted, resulting in 4 experimental conditions with 3 biological replicates each: CD103_healthy, CD11b_healthy, CD103_NTN, CD11b_NTN.
