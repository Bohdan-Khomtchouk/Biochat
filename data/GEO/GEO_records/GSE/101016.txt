TITLE
Dynamic regulation of T Follicular Regulatory (Tfr) cell responses by IL-2 during influenza infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that approximately 2,000 genes were differentially expressed between conventional Treg and Tfr cells following influenza virus infection

DESIGN
We conducted an RNA-seq analysis on sorted conventional Treg cells (FoxP3+CD69hiPD1loCXCR5loCD25hi) and Tfr cells (FoxP3+CD69hiPD1hiCXCR5hiCD25lo) obtained from the mediastinal lymph node (mLN) of day 30 infected B6.FoxP3-DTR/GFP mice. This analysis was performed to identify and quantify differentially-expressed genes and differentially-enriched signaling pathways between the two T cell subsets.
