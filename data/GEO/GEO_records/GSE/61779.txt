TITLE
Expression data from cells overexpressing c19orf63 (HSS1) [U87]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U87 cell lines were stable transfected with C19ORF63 (Human hematopoietic peptide secreted-1 - HSS1). HSS1 is a truly novel protein defining a new class of secreted factors.  U87 cell line overexpressing HSS1 greatly reduced their proliferation rate compared to mock-transfected cells. Microarray analysis was used to detail gene expression underlying the anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effect of HSS1 in U87 cells.

DESIGN
Exponentially growing U87 cells at growth curve day 5 were harvested for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays. Three groups of samples were evaluated in triplicates: U87 wild-type, U87 -pcDNA3.1 mock-transfected, U87-pcDNA-HSS1. Cells were stable transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or hHSS1. hHSS1-expressing cells and control cells were at confluence 40-80% when harvested. Trypan blue analysis of the number of viable cells showed a significant anti-proliferative effect in U87 cells expressing hHSS1 as compared to the control cells.
