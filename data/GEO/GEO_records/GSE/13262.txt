TITLE
Sclerotinia infected vs Mock infected controls in B. napus Westar and Zhong You 821

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
The fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects a broad range of dicotyledonous plant species and is the causative agent of stem rot in Brassica napus.  To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the defense response, we studied the patterns of gene expression in a partially resistant variety of ZhongYou 821 (ZY821) and a susceptible line from Westar over five time points, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) using a B. napus oligonucleotide microarray. For each cultivar, a two-dye experiment was run comparing infected to mock-infected stem tissue.  For each time point, 6 microarray slides were done (3 biological replicates, with a dye swap for each biological replicate). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
