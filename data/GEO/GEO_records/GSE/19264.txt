TITLE
Systemic responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used three different strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 to investigate systemic responses to infection in Arabidopsis and the development of SAR. Wildtype DC3000, the hrpA mutant and DC3000 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1 were syringe infiltrated into 4-week-old plants at a concentration of 10e8 cfu/ml. At least 5 leaves per plant were infiltrated and at least 10 plants were pooled for each sample. Systemic, uninfected tissue was then harvested at 8, 12 and 21h after inoculation. Three independent experiments were carried out to give three biological replicates for each timepoint.

DESIGN
27 samples were used in this experiment.
