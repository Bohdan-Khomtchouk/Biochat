TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of drought responsive noncoding RNAs and their target genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analyses of leaves from drought stressed rice plants was performed, producing differential expression profiles of genes containing coding RNAsand noncoding RNAs.

DESIGN
Water-deficit stressed leaves mRNA profiles of 5-week old wild type rice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2500.
