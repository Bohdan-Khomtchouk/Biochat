TITLE
Arabidopsis AGO3 predominantly recruits 24-nucleotide small RNAs to regulate epigenetic silencing [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
AGO3 predominantly bound 24-nt sRNAs with 5â€™ terminal adenine. The spectrum of AGO3-associated sRNAs was different from those bound to AGO2. By contrast, approximately 30% of AGO3-bound 24-nt sRNAs overlapped with those bound to AGO4 and over 60% of AGO3-associated 24-nt sRNA enriched loci were identical to those of AGO4. In addition, expression of AGO3 driven by AGO4 native promoter partially complemented AGO4 function and rescued DNA methylation defect in ago4-1 background.

DESIGN
Examination of AGO3 and AGO2 bound small RNAs with/without salt stress.

PLATFORM
