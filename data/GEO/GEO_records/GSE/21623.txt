TITLE
Heterologous expression analysis of wild type Fusarium fujikuroi and Ffvel1deletion strains grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions in liquid media over time.

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level differences of Fusarium fujikuroi between wild-type and a Ffvel1 (velvet) deletion mutant in liquid medium with minimal nitrogen between 24 hr, 72 hr and 120 hr of growth using an array based on a F. verticillioides gene call set. Fusarium fujikuroi produces a number of secondary metabolites including gibberellins, bikaverin, fumonisin and fusarin C that are influenced by nitrogen availability and the velvet global regulatory complex.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from six cultures of wild-type Fusarium fujikuroi and six cultures of Ffvel1  F. fujikuroi deletion mutant.  Each chip measures the expression level of over 13,000 putative genes with twelve 60-mer probes per sequence.
