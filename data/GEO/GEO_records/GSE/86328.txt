TITLE
SETBP1-WT and SETBP1-G870S epigenetic landscapes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq experiments targeting H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K36me3 histone modifications have been performed in order to assess if SETBP1 binding to gDNA was associated with chromatin remodeling and to further characterize the mechanisms responsible for SETBP1-mediated transcriptional regulation

DESIGN
n=10: 5 histone marks in 2 conditions: Empty vector and SETBP1-G870S

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
