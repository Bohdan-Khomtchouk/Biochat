TITLE
Easy Hi-C: A simple efficient protocol for 3D genome mapping in small cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the growing interest in studying the mammalian genome organization, it is still challenging to map the DNA contacts genome-wide. Here we present easy Hi-C (eHi-C), a highly efficient method for unbiased mapping of 3D genome architecture. The eHi-C protocol only involves a series of enzymatic reactions and maximizes the recovery of DNA products from proximity ligation. We show that eHi-C can be performed with 0.1 million cells and yields high quality libraries comparable to Hi-C.

DESIGN
We tested the eHi-C protocol in IMR90 cells with both low-depth and high-depth sequencing
