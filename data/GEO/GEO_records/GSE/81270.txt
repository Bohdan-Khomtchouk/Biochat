TITLE
Transcriptome of two S. cerevisiae strain in competition in natural must

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report RNAseq analysis of two strains in competition

DESIGN
Two strains, dominant and non-dominant were sampled at different time points during a natural must fermentation, separated by flow cytometry and transcriptome was analized by RNAseq

PLATFORM
GPL16234 AB 5500 Genetic Analyzer (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
