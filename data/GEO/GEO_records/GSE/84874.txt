TITLE
Time course of myeloid differentiation in the Lysozyme-GFP ER-HoxA9 cells following estradiol withdrawal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lysozyme-GFP ER-HoxA9 cells were cultured in the presence of estradiol (active ER-HoxA9) or in the absence of estradiol (inactive ER-HoxA9). Samples were taken at 10 time points over a 120 hour time course of myeloid differentiation to examine those gene expression changes that accompany differentiation upon the release of HoxA9 differentiation arrest.

DESIGN
RNA Sequencing at 10 different time points done in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
