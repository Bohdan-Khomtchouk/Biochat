TITLE
Effect of ppGpp on Salmonella Typhimurium gene expression

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
The expression profile of an S. Typhimurium mutant strain unable to synthesise ppGpp (relAspoT deletions) was compared to the wild-type strain. The effect of ppGpp on virulence gene expression was studied under 4 different growth conditions that induce virulence gene expression. Keywords: genetic modification
