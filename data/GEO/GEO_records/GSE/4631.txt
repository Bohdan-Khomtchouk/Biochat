TITLE
Effect of ppGpp on Salmonella Typhimurium gene expression

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ; Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
The expression profile of an S. Typhimurium mutant strain unable to synthesise ppGpp (relAspoT deletions) was compared to the wild-type strain. The effect of ppGpp on virulence gene expression was studied under 4 different growth conditions that induce virulence gene expression. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Study comprised 4 separate experiments (with 2 strains and 4 replicates for each strain per growth condition).  The experiments were indirect comparisons using Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator which also acted as the control for spot quality.
