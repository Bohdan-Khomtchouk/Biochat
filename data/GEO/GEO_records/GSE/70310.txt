TITLE
Comparative analysis of drought-responsive transcriptome in soybean lines contrasting for canopy wilting

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of abiotic stress molecular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of contrasting slow wilting lines to quantify transcript abumdance under drought stress condition

DESIGN
Methods: The three biological replicates of DS line, Pana (control and drought samples) and DT line, PI 567690 (control and drought samples) leaf sample RNA were multiplexed and sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 platform. The RNA concentration of each sample was approximately 200ng/µl with a quantity of 50 µl.isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays
