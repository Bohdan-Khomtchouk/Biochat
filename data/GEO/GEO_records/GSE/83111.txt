TITLE
Recurrent involvement of DPP9 in gene fusions in serous ovarian carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have looked for fusion genes in ovarian carcinomas. We combined previously known genomic aberrations, detected by karyotyping, and gene expression analysis. We found recurrent DPP9 gene expression deregulation with matching translocations. In additon, candidate fusion partner genes from the exon-level expression analysis were ranked according to deviating expression compared to the median of the sample set. The results were collated with data obtained from the RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
We analyzed 19 previously karyotyped ovarian carcinomas (18 of the serous histotype and one undifferentiated) using exon-level gene expression microarrays (Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform) to identify aberrantly expressed genes possibly involved in gene fusion events. In addition, some of the samples were analyzed by RNA-sequencing.
