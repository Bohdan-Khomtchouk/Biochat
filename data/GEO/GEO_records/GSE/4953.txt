TITLE
Expression data from NOD-scid vs B6-scid pancreas, submandibular glands,

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prior to the onset of autoimmune destruction, type 1 diabetic patients and an animal model thereof, the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, show morphological and functional abnormalities in target organs, which may act as inciting events for leukocyte infiltration. To better understand these abnormalities, but without the complications associated with inflammatory infiltrates, we examined genes expressed in autoimmune target tissues (pancreas, submandibular glands, and lacrimal glands) of NOD/scid mice and of autoimmune-resistant C57BL6/scid mice. Keywords: tissue expression, disease prone versus resistant strain comparison
