TITLE
Cryptococcus neoformans gene expression in YPD and Minimal Media of Wild type (WT) and ALL1 mutant cells

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
To examine the comparative transcription profile of WT and ALL1 mutant cells in in vitro conditions to determine genes resposible for hypervirulent phenotype of ALL1 mutant cells. Using transcriptional profiling, we determined that many genes involved in oxidation reduction processes and iron homeostasis were differentially transcribed between the wild type and the mutant strain

DESIGN
For arrays, total RNA was isolated from WT and ALL1 mutant using Qiagen RNeasy Kit. For RNA extraction, Wt and ALL1 mutant were grown in two different culture medium conditions including minimal media and YPD broth. Cells were grown for overnight, diluted 1:100 and then again grown overnight or up to an OD of 0.6-0.7 with agitation (150rpm) at 37Â°C.

PLATFORM
