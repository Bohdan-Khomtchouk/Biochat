TITLE
CX43 heterozygous, Cx43 null and Cx32 null vs wildtype neonatal mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cy3-labeled cDNA from brains of neonatal C57BL Cx43 null, Cx43 heterozygous and Cx32 null mice were compared among themselves and to Cy3-labeled cDNA from brains of neonatal C57BL wildtype mice through Cy5-labeled sample reference prepared at once for the entire experiment from aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary/testicles, spleen, and stomach - equal amounts from adult male and female C57BL mice.
