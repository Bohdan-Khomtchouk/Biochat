TITLE
Role of LANA in KSHV latent infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of three PEL cell lines compare to three Burkitt's lymphoma lines to figure out the changed genes under KSHV latent infection. Gene expression profiling of two time points on TIVE cells after infection by KSHV compare to TIVE cell without infection by KSHV to figure out the changed genes on TIVE cell under latent infection of KSHV. Gene expression profiling of four time points after inducing recombinant LANA protein expression when compare to no inducing BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells to figure out the changed genes under the latency-associate nuclear antigen (LANA) of KSHV expression. Gene expression profiling of three time points after inducing recombinant LANA protein expression when compare to no inducing Jurkat/Tet-On/LANA cell line to figure out the changed genes under the latency-associate nuclear antigen (LANA) of KSHV expression. Gene expression profiling of two time points after inducing recombinant LANA protein expression when compare to no inducing 293/Tet-On/LANA cell line to figure out the changed genes under the latency-associate nuclear antigen (LANA) of KSHV expression.
