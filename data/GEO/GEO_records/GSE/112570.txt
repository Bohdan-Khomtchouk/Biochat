TITLE
Single Cell RNA-Seq profiling human embryonic kidney cortex cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
To characterize the cellular diversity in the human kidney cortical nephrogenic niche we dissociated cells from the cortex and performed 10X Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Identifying cell types and nephrogenic programs in the developing human kidney

PLATFORM
