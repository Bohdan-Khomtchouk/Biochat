TITLE
POWERDRESS interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 to promote aging in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Functional analysis of HDA9 in Arabidopsis

DESIGN
HDA9 binding sites were investigated by ChIP sequencing, Transcriptome analysis of hda9 were performed in hda9 mutant in both young (YL) and early senescence (ES) leaves. Transcriptome analysis of pwr were performed in pwr mutant in early senescence (ES) leaves. H3K27ac ChIP-seq were performed with mixture of mature and early senescence leaves.
