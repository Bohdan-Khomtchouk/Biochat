TITLE
Identification and differential expression of microRNAs during metamorphosis in the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
The 987 probes  (Japanese flounder conserved miRNAs and candidates, fish conserved miRNAs, and contro) were hybridized with two stages during Japanese flounder metamorphosis by miRNA microarray. We validated 92 miRNAs using miRNA microarray in the 17 dph and 29 dph of Japanese flounder development, and obtained 66 differertially expressed miRNAs by comparison miRNA expression patterns of the two stages. These results indicate that miRNAs might play key roles in regulating gene expression during Japanese flounder metamorphosis.

DESIGN
Using miRNA microarray, the flounder conserved miRNAs and candidates were identified, and 92 conserved miRNAs were detected in the 17 dph and 29 dph during metamorphosis. Meanwhile, 66 conserved  miRNAs were differertially expressed by comparison miRNA expression patterns of the two stages. We further identified flounder miRNAs during metamorphosis.
