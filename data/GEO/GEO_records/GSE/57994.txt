TITLE
Expression data from HK2 proximal tubule cells transduced with shPGC-1alpha compared to cells transduced with control shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify regulation of genes involved in lipid and glycogen metabolism by PGC-1alpha We used whole genome expression analysis to explore the mechanism of lipid and glycogen accumulation in proximal tubule cells following suppression of PGC-1alpha expression.

DESIGN
HK2 proximal tubule cell line were transduced with control (shGFP) or shPGC-1alpha shRNA.  Successfully infected cells were selected with puromycin.  Total cellular RNA was harvested 5 days after transduction, and 24 hours after puromycin selection had been ceased.
