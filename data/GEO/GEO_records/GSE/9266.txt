SUMMARY
The transcriptome profiles of sporulating vs non-sporulating cells, within an isogenic culture were compared. Keywords: isogenic subpopulation comparison Bacillus subtilis sporulation

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from endospore containing cells which were separated from non-spore forming cells using buoyant density gradient centrifugation within an isogenic culture (details in Veening et al, submitted).
