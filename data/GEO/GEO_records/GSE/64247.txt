TITLE
The kinase DYRK1A reciprocally regulates the differentiation of Th17 and regulatory T cells [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using an unbiased chemical biology approach, we discover harmine as a novel regulator of Treg/Th17 differentiation. Harmine enhances Treg differentiation (working in conjunction with low levels of exogenous TGFb) and inhibits Th17 differentiation. Analysis of global gene expression of Tregs generated using low TGFb + harmine reveals significant similarity to Tregs generated using high TGFb only and suggests relevance of harmine-engaged mechanisms to IBD.

DESIGN
Na√Øve CD4+CD62L+ T cells were purified from Foxp3GFP mice either by MACS or FACS, then cultured in either low TGFb + harmine or high TGFb conditions. GFP+ Tregs were sorted by FACS at day 4.
