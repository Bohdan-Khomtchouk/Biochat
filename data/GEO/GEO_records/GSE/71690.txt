TITLE
Gbx2 is essential for maintaining thalamic neuron identity and repressing habenular characters in the developing thalamus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray, we compared the transcriptome of the wild-type and Gbx2-KO thalamus at E12.5. We show that Gbx2 promotes thalamic but inhibits habenular molecular characters.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from microdissected thalamus of wild-type and Gbx2-KO embryos at E12.5.
