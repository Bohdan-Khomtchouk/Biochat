TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of day 31 hESC-cardiomyocytes treated with DMSO (control) or retinoic acid (RA) during differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cell-reporter line hESC-NKX2.5(eGFP/w) were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (CMs) by utilizing the spin embryoid body method. During differentiation the cells were treated with DMSO or retinoic acid (RA) from day 4-7. At day 31, cells were sorted based on GFP prior to RNA isolation. The results of this microarray demonstrate that CMs treated with RA during differentiation exhibit atrial-like gene expression profile, while DMSO-treated cells show ventricular-like gene profile.

DESIGN
CMs treated with DMSO or RA during differentiation were sorted for GFP and analyzed for differential gene expression.
