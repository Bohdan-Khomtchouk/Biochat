TITLE
Expression data from germinating conidia of Aspergillus niger in the presence of the polyene antibiotic natamycin.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
The impact of natamycin on Aspergillus niger was analysed during 8 h of germination of conidia. Polarization, germ tube formation, and mitosis were inhibited in the presence of 3 µM and 10 µM of the anti fungal compound natamycin, while at 10 µM also isotropic growth was affected. Natamycin did not have an effect on the decrease of internal microviscosity and the concomitant reduction on mannitol and trehalose levels. However, it did abolish the increase of intracellular levels of glycerol and glucose during the 8 h period of germination. Natamycin hardly affected the changes that occur in the RNA profile during the first 2 h of germination. During this time period, genes related to transcription, protein synthesis, energy and cell cycle and DNA processing were particularly up regulated. On the other hand, when 8 h old germlings were compared, genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis were down regulated while genes related to endocytosis and metabolism of compatible solutes, and genes encoding protective proteins were up regulated.

DESIGN
Samples of germinating conidia of Aspergillus niger N402 were taken in triplo at 0h (dormant), 2h, and 8h after inoculation in CM. These were compared with conidia that germinated in the presence of either 3 µM or 10 µM natamycin.
