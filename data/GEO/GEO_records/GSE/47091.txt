TITLE
Comparison between GT and rre37 overexpressed strains of cyanobacteria

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Rre37 activates sugar catabolism in a unicelluar cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. We constructed rre37-overexpressing strain, named ROX370, by introducing the rre37 genes fusing psbAII promoter by homologous recombination. The transcript profiles of parental wild-type strain GT and ROX370 were compared by microarray CyanoChip (Takrara bio.). Experiments were performed by three times with biologically independent RNA. The results showed that genes for the oxidaditive pentose phosphate pathway and glycogen catabolism were induced by rre37 overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from three independent wild-type (GT) and three independent rre37-overexpression strains were differently labeled by Cy3 or Cy5, followed by hybridyzation on CyanoChip.
