TITLE
Endometrial transcriptome profile of cows affected by subclinical or clinical endometritis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Clinical or subclinical endometritis could affect the cow fertility by disturbing the molecular milieu of the uterine environment. We used a global gene expression approach to understand the effect of clinical and subclinical endometritis on endometrial transcriptome profiles of cows

DESIGN
Holstein Friesian cows at 42-60 days postpartum were classified as healthy (HE), subclinical endometritis (SE) or clinical endometritis (CE) based on clinical examination of the animals and histological evaluation of the corresponding endometrial biopsies. Endometrial transcriptome profile changes and associated molecular pathways induced by subclinical or clinical endometritis were then investigated using GeneChipÂ® Bovine Genome Array.
