TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of human fetal heart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced 2 heart samples from human fetal donors and detected the differential expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. The network of significant differential expressed transcripts could be associated to developmental program.

DESIGN
examination mRNA and lncRNA expression in heart tissues
