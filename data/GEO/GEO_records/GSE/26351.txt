TITLE
Expression data for Mobilized Peripheral Blood CD34+ cells with Wnt or BMP stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells from a healthy volunteer under erythroid differentiation conditions with and without stimulation to the BMP or Wnt signaling pathways. For erythroid differentiation, expanded CD34+ cells were placed in Stemspan SFEM medium supplemented with 2% pen/strep, 20ng/ml SCF, 1U/ml Epo, 5ng/ml IL3, 2uM dexamethasone, and 1uM beta-estradiol. Arrays were performed 2 hours after addition of cytokines. For signaling pathway stimulation, cells were exposed to 0.5uM BIO (a GSK3 inhibitor) for Wnt pathway activation, 25ng/ml rhBMP4 for BMP pathway activation, or vehicle control for 2 hours. Three biological replicates were performed per treatment group. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression changes after Wnt or BMP pathway stimulation in human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors under erythroid differentiation conditions.

DESIGN
To investigate the changes to gene expression in human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors following stimulation of the Wnt or BMP pathways during the early stages of erythroid differentiation. Three biological replicates were performed per treatment group.
