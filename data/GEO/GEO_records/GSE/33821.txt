TITLE
A functional map of DNA-associated proteolysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established an assay to localize DNA-associated proteins that are slated for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The genome-wide map we describe here ties proteolysis to active enhancer elements and to transcription start sites of specific gene families.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequencing of ubiquitin and transcription factors was performed in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibition.
