TITLE
AhR mutant vs N2 wild-type C.elegans, in L1 larval stage

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of AhR mutant vs N2 wild-type C.elegans, in L1 larval stage compared by using 23232 feature WUSTL microarray

DESIGN
4 ahr-mutant worm samples compared to 3 wild-type samples. Total RNAs purified and reverse transcribed to cDNA and labeled with Cy3-dUTP, and then hybridized on microarray.
