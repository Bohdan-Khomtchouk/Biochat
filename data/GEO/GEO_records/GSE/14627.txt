TITLE
Gene expression analysis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing ZNF423

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified ZNF423 (also known as Ebfaz, OAZ or Zfp423) as a component critically required for retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. ZNF423 associates with the RARα/RXRα nuclear receptor complex and is essential for transactivation in response to retinoids. Down-regulation of ZNF423 expression by RNA interference in neuroblastoma cells results in a growth advantage and resistance to RA-induced differentiation, whereas overexpression of ZNF423 leads to growth inhibition and enhanced differentiation. Futhermore, we show that low ZNF423 expression is associated with poor disease outcome of neuroblastoma patients. To identify the other key pathways regulated by ZNF423 in human neuroblastoma, we expressed elevated levels of ZNF423 in SH-SY5Y cells and performed full genome gene expression analysis in these cells.

DESIGN
Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (expressing the murine ecotropic receptor)  were retrovirally infected with MSCV-ZNF423 or MSCV vector control.  The gene expression analysis of these cells was then performed using the Illumina platform. The representative experiments are shown.
