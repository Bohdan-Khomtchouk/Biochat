TITLE
Effect of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) on skeletal muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Muscle biopsies taken from vastus lateralis muscle of 30 normal subjects and 19 FSHD subjects (see PubMed ID 17151338) Affymetrix U133A and U133B arrays were scanned both before (S1) and after (S2) antibody enhancement. Effects of age and sex in normal subjects reported previously under GSE362, GSE674, and GSE9676. Keywords: facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, skeletal muscle

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated for each individual for a total of 49 profiles (30 normal, 19 FSHD)
