TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of murine wild-type and dumbo retinas at P15

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hmx1 is a transcription factor expressed in the developing eye and ear and in some other parts of the nervous system. Dumbo mice are carrying the Hmx1 p.Q64X loss-of-function mutation (Munroe et al., 2009. BMC Developmental Biology). Transcriptomic analyses of this mouse model allows to decipher biological pathways under the control of Hmx1. In our study, we used it to better understand the role of Hmx1 in the retina and to identify several of its target genes.

DESIGN
Wild-type and dumbo mice were maintained in a 12-hours light/12-hours dark cycle with free access to food and water. Animals were sacrified at P15 for retina isolation and RNA extraction.
