TITLE
RNA-seq of chicken small yellow follicles with different FSHR expression level

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of study was to identify the differentially expressed genes in SYF by using Illumina RNA deep sequencing, one SYF has the highest expression level of FSHR, the other has the lowest expression level of FSHR. We sampled six follicles from three chickens.In order to discover the key genes that regulate the process of follicle selection. From RNA-seq results, we got 26.63G reads,when mapping the reads to chicken genome, 75.13%-78.40% reads were successfully mapped, and more than 98% reads were unique.and we found 1382 new genes,functional annotation of the new gene was also performed.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of six small yellow follicles come from three chickens
