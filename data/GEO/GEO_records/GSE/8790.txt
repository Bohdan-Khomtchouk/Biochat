TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in A/J CS vs Air lungs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the CS-exposed lungs of this strain (A/J) of mice would be able to give clues about the molecular mechanism of emphysema development, thus contributing to this phenotype. More specifically, although imbalance in oxidants/antioxidants and proteinase/antiproteinase pathways drives the pathogenesis of COPD, the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of emphysema are poorly understood. In order to test this hypothesis at the gene expression level, we utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between CS-exposed and Air-exposed groups of mice. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
