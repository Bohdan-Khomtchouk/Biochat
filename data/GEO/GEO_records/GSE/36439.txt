TITLE
Expression data from dormant and germinating conidia from Aspergillus niger.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Conidia of Aspergillus niger are characterized by a dormant state and are moderate stress-resistant. Upon contact with a moist substrate, germination of conidia occurs by changing from a dormant stabilized state towards a growing vegetative cell. The RNA expression levels of dormant conidia and conidia that were in various stages of germination were studied. The RNA composition of dormant conidia was substantially different than all the subsequent stages of germination. This indicates that the distinct morphological changes that occur during germination are not correlated with the highest change in the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Samples of germinating conidia of Aspergillus niger N402 were taken in triple at 0h (dormant), 2h, 4h, 6h and 8h after inoculation in CM.
