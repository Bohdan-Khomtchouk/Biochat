TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state during the differentiation of hESC into hNECs (MNase-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the epigenetic regulation during neuroectoderm specification process, we generated in-depth maps of nucleosome and histone modifications.We found that the depletion of nucleosome marked with H2A.Z in promoter regions contributes to the activation of key neuroectoderm related genes as providing open chromatin state for Pol II binding. Meanwhile, HMs undergo active remodeling with recruiting key transcription factors.So our study provided a full view on the transcriptional regulation of epigenome during neuroectoderm specification.

DESIGN
Examination of nucleosome positioning, four classical histone marks(H3K4me3,H3K9ac,H3K27me3,H3K36me3), binding profiles of transcription factor Sox2 for hESC and hNEC.
