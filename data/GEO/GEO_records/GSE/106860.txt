TITLE
Polyphosphate Metabolic Gene Expression Analyses Reveal Mechanisms of Phosphorus Accumulation and Release in Microlunatus phosphovorus Strain JN459

ORGANISM
Microlunatus phosphovorus

SUMMARY
The ability of Microlunatus phosphovorus to accumulate large amounts of polyphosphate (Poly-P) plays an important role in removing soluble phosphorus from wastewater. Our analyses indicate that Microlunatus phosphovorus  accumulates Poly-P under aerobic conditions but releases phosphorus under anaerobic conditions. To determine the mechanisms underlying Poly-P metabolism, we compared transcriptional profiles under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Significant differences were detected in the expression levels of genes associated with Poly-P metabolism between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of phosphate metabolism in a major bacterial species involved in wastewater phosphorus reduction.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Microlunatus phosphovorus at 86 h and 92 h in SBR were generated by deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL24264 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Microlunatus phosphovorus)
