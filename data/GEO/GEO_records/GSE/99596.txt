TITLE
SIRT7 Antagonizes TGF-Î² Signaling and Inhibits Breast Cancer Metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protein deacetylase SIRT7 is significantly downregulated in lung metastases of human patient and mouse tissues, and predicted metastasis-free survival. To explore the roles of SIRT7 in breast cancer, we analysed the gene expressions in breast cancer BT549 cells with SIRT7 knockdown or not.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of breast cancer BT549 cells with SIRT7 knockdown or not were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq-2000
