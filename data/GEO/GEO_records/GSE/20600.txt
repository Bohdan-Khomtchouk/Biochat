TITLE
Genome-wide identification of putative cis-regulatory elements through epigenetic profiling in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, we have applied ChIP-Seq to identify putative regulatory elements throughout the zebrafish genome.  For this purpose we identified sequences within the zebrafish genome that associate with H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, which are epigenetic modifications known to be associated with active cis-regulatory elements in other species.

DESIGN
Determination of H3K4me1- and H3K4me3-binding sites in the zebrafish genome.
