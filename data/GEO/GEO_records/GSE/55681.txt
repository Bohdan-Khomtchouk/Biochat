TITLE
Increased Rho GTPase activity is associated with decreased tumor inhibitory activity of immortalized fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two clones (Whirly and Crossy) of human BJhTERT (human foreskin cell line) cells with different inhibitory capacity were analyzed and compared for their gene expression profile by whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Two clones (Whirly and Crossy) of human BJhTERT (human foreskin cell line) cells were analyzed with Affymetrix Whole Target (WT) Assay (GeneTitan plate format Gene ST 1.1) in order to find out gene expression differences.

PLATFORM
