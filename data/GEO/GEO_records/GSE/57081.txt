TITLE
Temporal gene regulation of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells treated with obacunone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obacunone treatment slightly changes gene expression of cholesterol metabolism-associated genes in HepG2 cells

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HepG2 cells treated with 100 uM obacunone for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, or 12 h was compared to that of vehicle control cells.
