TITLE
Specialized piRNA pathways act in germline and somatic tissues of the Drosophila ovary

ORGANISM
Drosophila erecta ; Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here, we analyzed nine Drosophila piRNA pathway mutants for their impacts on both small RNA populations and the sub-cellular localization patterns of Piwi proteins. We find that distinct piRNA pathways with differing components function in ovarian germ and somatic cells. Keywords: Epigenetics

DESIGN
20 libraries were analyzed, with 9 being control samples (heterozygotes).
