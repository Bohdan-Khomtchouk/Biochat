TITLE
SM007 - Infection with SARS MA15 of C57BL6/J mice and CXCR3 knockouts in the same strain of mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to compare the host response of C57BL6/J mice to that of CXCR3 knockout mutant mice in response to SARS MA15 virus infections.

DESIGN
Groups of 10 week old C57BL6 mice or CXCR3 knockout mice were infected with SARS MA15 at a dose of 10^5 PFU or mock infected. Mice were euthanized on days 2, 4 and 7 post infection to measure virus load and isolate samples for measurement of virus load, lung pathology,  and transcriptional.  Mock infected animals were also harvested at each time point. Mice were weighed every 24 hours to measure general disease progression and any mouse approaching 30% weight loss were euthanized.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
