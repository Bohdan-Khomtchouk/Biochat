TITLE
Expression data from Bmi1 mutant versus wild-type lung cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bmi1 is an important stem cell regulator in multiple tissues, including the lung. We used microarrays to analyze the dysregulation of gene expression in the absence of Bmi1 in the lung, to identify pathways important in Bmi1-dependent lung stem cell regulation

DESIGN
Primary lung cells (CD31-negative, CD45-negative) were FACS-isolated from Bmi1 wild-type or mutant mice; RNA was then extracted, amplified, and analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.
