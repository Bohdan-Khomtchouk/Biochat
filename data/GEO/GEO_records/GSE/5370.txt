TITLE
Myositis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis and dermatomyositis) are heterogeneous group of muscle disorders of unknown etiology.The pathogenic pathways responsible for muscle fiber damage and dysfunction in myositis are not currently well defined. Identification of such pathways may help to design novel therapeutic interventions and also help to develop diagnostic tests. Keywords: Development or differentiation design

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies from a separate group of 5 adult untreated female DM patients  were profiled and compared to muscle tissue of normal human healthy volunteers to define  molecular pathways in muscle of myositis patients. Confirm and map key pathway members to specific cell types in the muscle tissue of patients and controls using RT-PCR, Western blotting and Immunolocalization.
