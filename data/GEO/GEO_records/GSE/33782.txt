TITLE
Transcriptome of normal,paracancerous and cancerous colon tissues based on RNA-seq method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To support our research of colon cancer in human genome, we conducted massively parallel pyrosequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) using normal,paracancerouse and cancerous human colon tissues. We obtained a total of 29.9M reads from normal,33.0M reads from paracancerous and 36.5M reads from cancerous.The RNA-seq data derived from the sample illustrated the differencially expreesion genes among normal,paracancerous and cancerous colon tissues of human.

DESIGN
3 samples examined: normal tissue, paracancerous tissue, cancerous tissue.
