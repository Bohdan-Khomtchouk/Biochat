TITLE
Epigenomics Studies in Acute Myeloid Leukemia disease progression [RNAseq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the DNA methylation and transcriptional molecular features of paired diagnosis and relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia  samples

DESIGN
To determine if epigenetic features at gene promoters can affect gene trancription during disease progression in AML, we profiled nineteen paired diagnosis and relapse AML patient samples using RNAseq and performed correlation analysis between transcriptional variance and epigenetic heterogeneity at respective gene promoters (normalized transcript counts are included in Dx_Rel_AML_RNAseq_rpkm.txt) To determine if epigenetic features at gene promoters can affect gene trancription in AML, we profiled 96 cells from a relapsed AML case using single cell RNA-sequencing and correlated transript variance with epigenetic heterogeneity at respective gene promoters (normalized transcript counts are included in AML_130_Rel_scRNAseq_rpkm.txt) Raw data has been deposited to  dbGaP (controlled access) due to patient privacy concerns: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/?term=phs001027.v1.p1
