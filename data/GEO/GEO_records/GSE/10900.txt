TITLE
c3h10t1/2 with dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
determine genes regulated by dexamethasone in c3h10t1/2 cells after 90 minutes of treatment compared to vehicle Keywords: treatment comparison microarray

DESIGN
c3h10t1/2 cells were treated with vehicle or 1uM dexamethasone for 90 minutes (3 biological replicates of each) RNA samples were isolated from RNeasy kit (Qiagen) hybridized all samples to a pool of RNA from vehicle and treated c3h10t1/2 cells
