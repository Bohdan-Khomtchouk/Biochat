TITLE
Splenic CD8+ and CD8- DCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expressions in mouse splenic dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were purified into two subsets, CD8-positive and -negative ones. DCs were expanded in vivo by injecting Flt3L-producing tumors into the backs of C57BL/6 mice.

DESIGN
To expand DCs in vivo, Flt3L-producing B16 melanoma cells were injected to the backs of mice. Then, 10-12 days later, splenic DCs were enriched by MACS and purified  into CD3-B220-CD8a+CD11c+ and CD3-B220-CD8a-CD11c+ cells by FACS cell sorter.
