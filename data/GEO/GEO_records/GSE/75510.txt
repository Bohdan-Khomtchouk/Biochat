TITLE
Impact of Prnp genetic ablation in the hippocampus transcriptome of congenic B6.129-PrnpZH1/ZH1 or coisogenic C57BL/6-PrnpZH3/ZH3 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effect of Prnp genetic ablation on different aspects of RNA metabolism, we performed RNA sequencing of the hippocampus of wild-type C57BL/6J, congenic B6.129-PrnpZH1/ZH1 and coisogenic C57BL/6J-PrnpZH3/ZH3 mice. We analyzed differential gene expression, exon usage and RNA editing.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing on hippocampus of wild-type C57BL/6 mice, congenic B6.129-PrnpZH1/ZH1 and coisogenic C57BL/6-PrnpZH3/ZH3 mice (3 month-old males, n=4 per genotype).
