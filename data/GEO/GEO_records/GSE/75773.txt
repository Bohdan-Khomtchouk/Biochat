TITLE
CPEB4 RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-seq) in SK-Mel-103 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the mRNAs bound by CPEB4 in melanoma cells

DESIGN
RIP-seq analysis of the mRNAs bound by CPEB4 in SK-Mel-103 melanoma cells left non-infected (NI) vs transduced with CPEB4 shRNA and harvested at day 6 after lentiviral infection. Experiments were performed in biological in duplicates
