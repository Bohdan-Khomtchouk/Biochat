TITLE
Immunoediting of the cancer genome during tumor progression and activation of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in a mouse model of carcinoma [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We designed a study to investigate immunoediting of an epithelial cancer genome using wildtype and immunodeficient mice, NGS, and analytical pipelines to process and analyze the data. We carried out experiments with wildtype and immunodeficient RAG1-/- mice with transplanted tumors and analyzed longitudinal samples with respect to the genomic landscape and the immunophenotypes of the tumors. Finally, we performed also experiments with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and show how the activation of the PD1-PD-L1 axis modulates immunoediting. MC38 cells were subcutaneously injected into wild-type C57Bl/6 and immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice. Samples were taken at predefined time points and subjected to detailed analysis, including FACS, exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and SNP arrays.

DESIGN
Samples were taken at predifined time points, in triplicates and subjected to RNA sequencing using Ion Torrent Proton

PLATFORM
