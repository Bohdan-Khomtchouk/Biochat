TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis C3H14/15 overexpressors, c3h14c3h15 double mutant vs wild type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, CCCH zinc finger proteins involved in secondary wall formation and anther development are poorly understood. We have functionally identified two homologous genes C3H14 and C3H15 and found that the two genes differentially regulate secondary wall formation and anther development. C3H14 contributes more to secondary wall thickening, whereas, C3H15 is more important for anther development. We performed microarray analyses on C3H14/15 overexpressors and c3h14c3h15 double mutant to to ientify differentially-expressed genes involved in the two developmental processes.

DESIGN
Our microarray data show that C3H14 and C3H15 regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in various biological activities, particularly those associated with secondary wall metabolism and pollen formation.
