TITLE
Gene chip analysis of NPCs with and without cocultured with ASCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the coculturing of degenerate NPCs and ASCs and identified distinct classes of altered genes and ncRNAs during this process.

DESIGN
We used 3 samples (after coculturing) with 3 control (without coculturing), then compare the genes and ncRNAs.
