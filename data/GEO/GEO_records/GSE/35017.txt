TITLE
Characterization of Neurospora crassa ghh (NCU06095) mutant strains

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
To determine the genes directly and indirectly under the control of the Grainy-head homolog (GHH) transcription factor in Neurospora crassa

DESIGN
Three different sample types (Aerial Hyphae & Conidia; Mycelia; or Whole Colonies) of both wild-type (FGSC #2489) and grainy-head homolog (FGSC #13563) strains of Neurospora crassa were subjected to transcriptome analyses to determine the genes differentially expressed in the ghh background compared to wild type.
