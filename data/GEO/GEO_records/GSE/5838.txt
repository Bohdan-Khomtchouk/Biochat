TITLE
Expression data from transplanted intestine bifor signs of rejection, and when their was signs of rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the major cause of intestinal graft loss. Little is known about the genetic response occurring in small bowel transplantation (SBTx) during ACR. We report the case of a 44 year-old female with short gut syndrome following multiple surgeries for familial adenomatous polyposis that underwent living-related SBTx. We obtained for the first time a gene expression profile of the intestinal graft during ACR. Microarray analysis revealed increased transcript levels for genes that match identically to an IFN? signature reported for activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T-cell chemotaxis and cytolysis correlating with the diagnosis of ACR. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
sam1, sam2, sam3 (without signs of rejection) sam4, sam5, sam6 (with signs and symptoms of rejection , histology showed increasing lymphocyte infiltration in the lamina propria and epithelium)
