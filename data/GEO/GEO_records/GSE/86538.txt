TITLE
ChIP-seq of ER and RUNX2 in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq on MCF7 cells in an effort to discern differential binding patterns between wild type MCF7s and MCF7s that have acquired resistance to Tamoxifen and Estrogen deprivation. Furthermore, we also performed an HAtag ChIP on a DOX inducible RUNX2 overexpression MCF7 cell line. We also performed RNA-seq on MCF7 cells to determine transciptional changes after acquisition of Tamoxifen resistance, and also transciptional changes in a DOX inducible RUNX2 overexpression model.

DESIGN
ER and HAtag ChIP on MCF7 cells, RNAseq on MCF7 cells
