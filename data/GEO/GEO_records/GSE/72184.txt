TITLE
Next generation sequencing analysis of DN1 transcriptomes from Wild type, gl/gl and transgenic CD2-Ostm1 gl/gl mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome stability of DN1wt versus DN1gl/gl and DN1CD2-Ostm1gl/glTR Methods: DN1 thymocytes mRNA profiles of 19-day-old wild-type (WT), osteopetrotic grey-lethal (gl/gl) and transgenic CD2-Ostm1 gl/gl mice were generated by deep sequencing,DN1 cells from 2-3 mice per genotype were pooled, no technical replicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: TopHat and Cufflinks. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays Results: DN1 gl/gl showed a distinctive transcriptome signature in comparison to DN1 wt and DN1 gl/glTR with respectivelly 146 and 205 differentially expressed genes and 205. Migration genes were significantly affected in DN1 gl/gl samples and RAC1 and S1PR1 gene expressions were confirmed using RT-qPCR. Conclusions: RNA seq allowed us to identify the enhanced expression of migration genes (RAC1 and S1PR1) in DN1gl/gl, that were both normalized in the DN1 cells from transgenic gl/glTR mice, which suggests defective T cell migration associated to the osteopetrotic thymus phenotype.
