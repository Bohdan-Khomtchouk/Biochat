TITLE
CT01 vs wild-type at 3% O2

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Comparison of wild-type (2.4.1) and CT01 (contains an omega Spr/Smr insertion in RSP4157) gene expression; growth condition is (3% O2 + 96%N2 + 1%CO2) semi-aerobic growth in the dark.  Manuscript in preparation. The below normalized data was generated using GeneSpring software with the following settings: A data: Data Transformation: set all values less than 0.01 to 0.01 Per Chip: normalize to 50th percentile, and then Per Gene: normalize to median B data: Data Transformation:  set all values less than 0.01 to 0.01 Per Chip: normalize to 50th percentile Values from independent replicates were averaged Keywords = Rhodobacter sphaeroides Keywords = photosynthesis Keywords = semi-aerobic Keywords = purple bacteria Keywords: other
