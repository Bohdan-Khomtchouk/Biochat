TITLE
Analysis of paired primary and metastatic cell lines identifies common DNA methylation changes in melanoma metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using 1 melanocyte and 6 melanoma cell line (3 pair of primary and metastatic), we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps to document DNA methylation drivers of melanoma metastasis.

DESIGN
Here we generated single-nucleotide resoultion DNA methylation map of a total of 7 cell lines using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)
