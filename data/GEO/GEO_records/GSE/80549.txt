TITLE
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) differentially interacts with Cenococcum geophilum and other simultaneously inoculated mycorrhizal (ECM) fungi

ORGANISM
Pinus sylvestris

SUMMARY
To identify specific gene networks induced in host roots by C. geophilum, we inoculated seedlings of Scots pine simultaneously with C. geophilum and either Suillus granulatus or Rhizopogon roseolus, two common ECM fungi associated to pines. We then measured the differential expression of Scots pine genes in the respective mycorrhizas using oligoarrays.

DESIGN
We performed 14 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Pinus sylvestris mycorrhiza with Cenococcum geophilum, Rhizopogon roseolus or Suillus granulatus (3 biological replicates each), as well as from non-mycorrhizal control roots (two replicates). Only the Pinus-derived sequences from the array were considered for this analysis. All samples were labeled with Cy3.
