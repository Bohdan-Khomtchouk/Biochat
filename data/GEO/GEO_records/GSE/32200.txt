TITLE
Effects of Plasmodium berghei infection on Anopheles gambiae during oocysts development

ORGANISM
Anopheles gambiae

SUMMARY
Plasmodium ssp. are pathogens in their vertebrate hosts and also cause deleterious effects to their insect vectors. We show here, however, that Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes more efficiently accumulate energy resources (glycogen) during oocyst development, and survive better when they are starved. Microarray analysis revealed that mosquito metabolism is altered by the presence of rapidly growing oocysts in the midgut. Plasmodium infection is associated with enhanced expression of several insulin-like peptides in mosquitoes and blocking insulin-like signaling results in diminished Plasmodium development. We conclude that Plasmodium infection dramatically changes mosquito metabolism pathways, epitomized by enhanced insulin-signaling, and thereby confer a survival advantage to the insects during periods of starvation. Manipulation of this pathway may provide new strategies to influence the ability of mosquitoes to transmit the protozoa that cause malaria.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment: P. berghei infected vs uninfected mosquitoes; 10 mosquitoes per sample; 4 biological replicates for each group; two different time points, 10 and 17 days post infection; control mosquitoes were from same batch as infected mosquitoes that were fed on clean mice.

PLATFORM
GPL13157 Agilent-020449 Mosquito Gene Expression Microarray (Probe name version)
