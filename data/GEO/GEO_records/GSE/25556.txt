TITLE
Global miRNA transcriptomic profiling of permanent focal ischemia in an in vivo rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Focal ischemia is triggered by the sudden significant reduction of blood supply to the brain, as a result of either the rupture or occlusion by thrombus/embolism of a blood vessel in the brain. Permanent focal ischemia occurred when blood supply to a specific part of the brain is impeded without reperfusion. Despite major steps achieved in the elucidation of the patho-physiology of cerebral ischemia, the available therapeutic avenues for acute ischemic stroke remain scarce. Cell cycle re-activation has been revealed as a novel signaling pathway during permanent focal ischemia. As such, non-specific aurora kinase inhibitor ZM447439, has been injected intracranial-ventricularly 30min post-ischemia induction to determine its efficacy in reduction of neuronal damage in terms of infarct volume.

DESIGN
miRNA microarray analysis was performed on Exiqon 5th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (Product no: 208300-A) to compliment our existing gene expression microarray data [GSE23651]. Arrays were run as dual colour (Hy3: Sample, and Hy5: Common sample reference pool). Right cortex RNA samples were collected at two time-points (8h and 24h )respectively for all three experimental conditions: Sham (n=4), vehicle (i.e. ischemic injury with i.c.v. injection 80% DMSO; n=4) and treatment (injury plus i.c.v.injection of 30mM ZM447439 in 80% DMSO; n=4). Supplementary file: Project_Summary_Report.txt The percentages listed in the top row are present-call rates, i.e. number of identified miRNAs compared to number of miRNAs on array.
