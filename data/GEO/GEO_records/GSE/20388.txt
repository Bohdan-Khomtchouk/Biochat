TITLE
Expression Profiling of a Genetic Animal Model of Depression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression Profiling of a Genetic Animal Model of Depression Reveals Novel Molecular Pathways Underlying Depressive-like Behaviours In this study we have used genome-wide microarray expression profiling of the hippocampus and prefrontal/frontal cortex of Flinders Depression Sensitive (FSL) and control Flinders Depression Resistant (FRL) lines to understand molecular basis for the differences between the two lines. We profiled two independent cohorts of Flinders animals derived from the same colony six months apart, each cohort statistically powered to allow independent as well as combined analysis. Using this approach, we were able to validate using real-time-PCR a core set of gene expression differences that showed statistical significance in each of the temporally distinct cohorts, representing consistently maintained features of the model.

DESIGN
Cohort one was established with 12 FRL and 9 FSL animals, while the second cohort (6 months later) was made up of 10 FRL and 8 FSL animals.
