TITLE
Ets homologous factor has critical roles in epithelial dysfunction in airway disease [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ets homologous factor (EHF) is an Ets family transcription factor expressed in many epithelial cell types including those lining the respiratory system. Disruption of the airway epithelium is central to many lung diseases, and a network of transcription factors coordinates its normal function. EHF can act as a transcriptional activator or a repressor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), showed that EHF binding sites in lung epithelial cells are enriched at promoters and coincide with putative enhancers, marked by specific histone modifications. Using EHF ChIP-seq and RNA-seq after EHF depletion, we show its targets in HBE cells are enriched for genes involved in degradation of misfolded proteins, inflammation, and wound repair.

DESIGN
Examination of EHF binding plus three histone modifications in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Also examined c-Jun and JunD binding in Calu-3 cells. There are two replicates of the EHF, c-Jun and JunD ChIP-seq plus an input sample (control). There is one replicate each of the three histone modifications.
