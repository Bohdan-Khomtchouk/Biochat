TITLE
Effect of Glucocorticoids on microRNA Expression Profile of the Human Bone Microcirculatory Endothelial Cells from Femoral Head

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Appropriate gene expression patterns form the basis for bone microcirculatory endothelial cells’ function and bone morphology. Although previous studies have elucidated the impact of hydrocortisone on bone microcirculatory endothelial cells’ specific gene expression, the exact differential transcriptomes and comprehensive gene expression profiles remain unknown. We have investigated the microRNA expression patterns before and after hydrocortisone administration of bone microcirculatory endothelial cells. Only 5 microRNAs were Benjamini-Hochberg characterized over 368 microRNAs candidates. Transcriptomic analysis of bone microcirculatory endothelial cells from human samples is highly informative due to their relevance to the large number of expressed genes. Our study provides a very valuable basis for investigation of genes, regulation and their co-expression network contributing to hydrocortisone induced disorders.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, hydrocortisone treated vs. untreated bone microcirculatory endothelial cells. Biological replicates: 8 control replicates, 8 treated replicates.
