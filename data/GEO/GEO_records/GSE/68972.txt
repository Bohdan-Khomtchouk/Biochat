TITLE
The identification of differentially expressed genes between animal and vegetal blastomeres in Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
To identify asymmetrically localized maternal mRNAs along the animal-vegetal axis in cleavage Xenopus embryos, we isolated animal and vegetal blastomeres at 8-cell stage, extracted the maternal mRNA respectively and analyzed them by RNA-seq technology. We identified 43 maternal transcripts significantly enriched in the vegetal region (FDR < 0.05) by R/Bioconductor package DESeq

DESIGN
RNAseq of animal and vegetal blastomeres with 2 biological replicates
