TITLE
Synergistic effects of temperature and pCO2 on growth, development and gene expression of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larvae

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) larvae cultured under four different seawater conditions: (i)13°C/400 µatm pCO2, (ii)13°C/1100 µatm pCO2, (iii)18°C/400 µatm pCO2 (iv)18°C/1100 µatm pCO2. The goal was to determine the effects of temperature and CO2, both important climate change variables, on gene expression

DESIGN
Larvae were cultured under four different seawater conditions (ii)13°C/1100 µatm pCO2, (iii)18°C/400 µatm pCO2 (iv)18°C/1100 µatm pCO2, (i)13°C/400 µatm each with three replicate cultures for each condition and sampled at pluteus stage
