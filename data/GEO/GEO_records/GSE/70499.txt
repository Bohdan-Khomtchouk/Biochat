TITLE
Effect of Bmal1 pre-natal knockout on liver gene expression: time-series

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use a conventional (pre-natal) Bmal1 KO (cKO) mouse strain to investigate the effect of circadian disruption on gene expression in the liver by comparing cKO mice with wild type (WT) mice using RNA-Seq. All mice were housed under 12h:12h LD conditions with free access to food and water. Three mice per genotype were sacrificed every 4 h for 20 h (6 time points). Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit Set A was used for library construction and samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. RNA-seq data were aligned by STAR, and data were normalized with a resampling strategy ( https://github.com/itmat/Normalization ).

DESIGN
Time-series liver mRNA profiles of 6.4- to 13.9-week-old male and female wild type (WT) and Bmal1 knockout (KO) mice were generated by sequencing, three mice per genotype per timepoint, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
