TITLE
Soybean cultivars RCAT-Angora & Harovinton, embryo comparison and development

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean cultivars RCAT-Angora & Harovinton, comparison of embryos at 30,40,50,60 & 70 days after pollination (dap) and seed development within each cultivar " Keywords: time course

DESIGN
42 microarray slides GPL3015; 2 soybean cultivars, RCAT-Angora (with high seed isoflavonoid content) & Harovinton (with low seed isoflavonoid content); 2 technical reps for each time point (dye swap); 4 biological reps from 2 locations at London (L) & Delhi (D) Ontario & 2 consecutive growing seasons 2003 and 2004; 5 time points of 30, 40, 50, 60 & 70 dap for D04, L03, L04 and 4 time points of 30, 40, 50 and 70 dap for D03. In addition 2 slides for seed development confirmation D03 30 vs 70 dap RCAT-Angora and 2 for genomic comparison of RCAT-Angora & Harovinton were included. Slide data was analyzed in GeneSpringGX7.3, Agilent technologies, using background subtracted values. The ratio for RCAT/Hvtn was calculated from the 2 colour hybridization (same slide) and the relative expression for embryo development as a function of time (single channel approach) was calculated for each cultivar. The slide identities are L04 GSM94935 - 94944; genomic GSM95945-94946; L03 GSM94947 - 94956; D04 GSM94957 to 94966; D03 GSM94967 - 94976
