TITLE
Gene expression profiles in human alveolar epithelial cell line exposure to impurity-free single-wall carbon nanotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to assess the effects of manufactured nanomaterials at the molecular level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish characterization of physico-chemical properties of impurity-free single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).

DESIGN
Three kinds of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), CNT-1, CNT-2 or CNT-3 induced gene expression in human alveolar epithelial cell lines were measured at 24 and 48 hours exposure to doses of 90.8μg/mL (CNT-1), 109.0μg/mL (CNT-2), and 77.0μg/mL (CNT-3). Three independent experiments were performed at each time (24 or 48 hours) using different untreated control for each experiment (n=4).
