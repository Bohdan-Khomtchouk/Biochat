TITLE
Ribosome profiling upon inhibition of eIF4A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribosome profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Silvestrol to monitor transcriptome wide, eIF4A-dependent changes in translation efficiency

DESIGN
Translation efficiency (TE) of mRNAs dervied from ribosome footprints was monitored in the presence or absence of 25 nM Silvestrol, an inhibitor of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A).  Transcripts with reduced TE in the presence of Silvestrol were compare to transcripts with reduced TE in the presence of INK128, a catalytic mTOR inhbitor.
