TITLE
microRNA alterations associated to clinical response in advanced stage ovarian cancer patients (test set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate miRNA alterations associated to early relapse in ovarian cancer patietns, we analyzed miRNA expression profile in a test set of 30 surgical specimens including 13 early and 17 late relapsing patients. Samples included in test set were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.

DESIGN
Patients were selected on the basis of residual disease after primary surgery and time to relapse (TTR) after front-line chemotherapy. For the test set, a selection of the outliers concerning TTR was made: 12 months from the end of therapy was the TTR selected to define early ( < 12 months) or late ( > 12 months) relapsing patients. Clinical codes: Histotype: according to International Federation of Gynecological and Obstetrics guidelines Stage: according to International Federation of Gynecological and Obstetrics guidelines Grading: according to WHO guidelines Debulking: NED: not evident disease; mRD: minimal residual disease; GRD: gross residual disease Therapy code: P: Platinum without taxanes; PT: Platinum/paclitaxel End Point: Early: relapse whithin 12 and 6 months from the end of therapy for optimally (NED+ mRD) and sub-optimally (GRD) debulked patients respectively. Late: median time to relapse 48 and 34 months from the end of therapy for optimally and sub-optimally debulked patients respectively. Time to relapse (TTR) code: 0=no relapse; 1=relapse Overall survival (OS) code: 0=alive; 1=dead
