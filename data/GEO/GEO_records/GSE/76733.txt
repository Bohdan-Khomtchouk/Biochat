TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of 2 month vs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report age-related gene expression of Treg cells isolated from injured muscle and spleen. Male C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP reporter mice were injured intramuscularly with cardiotoxin. Tregs were sorted directly into Trizol from injured muscle and spleen 4 days post-injury.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of muscle and splenic Tregs from 2- vs > 6-month old mice (biological duplicate for each).
