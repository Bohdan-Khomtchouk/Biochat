TITLE
Expression data of myofibroblast isolated from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive lung disease of unknown etiology, is characterized by the expansion of myofibroblasts and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to IPF, we analyzed myofibroblasts established from patients with IPF by oligonucleotide microarrays.  Gene expression profiles revealed a novel pathophysiologic function of myofibroblasts as a generator of reactive oxygen species, and a self-defense mechanism against oxidative stress of their own generating. Keywords: cell type comparison, disease state analysis

DESIGN
We isolated two myofibroblast cell culture from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Embryonic pulmonary fibroblast was used for the reference.
