TITLE
hnRNPK is involved in mRNA processing of a significant fraction of the transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we report the first genomic-scale comprehensive characterization of mouse transcripts bound to hnRNPK. hnRNPK binding at the isoform level was evaluated via RNA-sequencing of liver samples obtained from obese and wild-type mouse models. The comparison of hnRNPK co-immunoprecipitated fractions with total RNA fractions in a given mouse model enabled quantitative evaluation of the binding affinity of hnRNPK for thousands of isoforms.

DESIGN
Total RNA, cytoplasmic fraction and nuclear fraction was isolated from liver of three mouse strains (wild type-normal diet, wild type-high fat diet, leptin defficient-normal diet). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hnRNPK antibody (and IgG as control). Comparison of immunoprecipitated and total fraction allowed for estimation of extent of hnRNPK-mediated translational regulation.
