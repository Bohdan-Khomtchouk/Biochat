TITLE
Molecular analysis of a microbial strain improvement paradigm

ORGANISM
Penicillium chrysogenum

SUMMARY
Industrial production of penicillins with the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is based on an unprecedented effort in microbial strain improvement. Sequencing of the 32.19 Mb genome of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 revealed many genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production. DNA microarrays were used to compare the transcriptomes of the sequenced strain and a penicillinG high-producing strain, grown in the presence and absence of the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid. Transcription of genes involved in biosynthesis of valine, cysteine and alpha-aminoadipic acid, the amino-acid precursors for penicillin biosynthesis, as well as genes encoding microbody proteins, increased in the high-producing strain. Many key (intra)cellular transport processes involving penicillins and intermediates remain to be characterized at the molecular level. Genes predicted to encode transporters were strongly overrepresented among the genes transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that stimulate penicillinG production, illustrating potential for future genomics-driven functional analysis. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures (D=0.03h-1)of the Wisconsin54-1255 strain and the derived industrial, penicillinG high-producing strain DS1769032. Chemostat cultivation offers the possibility to keep specific growth rate and other key parameters constant33. Some intermediates of Î²-lactam biosynthesis are produced in the absence of the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid (PAA), but penicillinG biosynthesis is strictly dependent on PAA addition to culture media.
