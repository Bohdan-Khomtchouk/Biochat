TITLE
Microarray data from ferulate/coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase F5H Arabidopsis mutant lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis was performed on the main inflorescence stems of wild-type and lignin-modified lines growing under the same conditions. Study transcriptomic changes in arabidopsis stem manipulated in F5H. Loss of function fah-1 mutant and F5H overexpression (F5H-OE) We used microarrays to detail the global determine changes of gene expression in loss of function fah-1 mutant and F5H overexpression (F5H-OE)  up and down-regulated genes were identified.

DESIGN
One and a half month old plants were harvested, stems from 5 different plants were pooled as one biological replicate, and three biological replicates were included for analysis. Stem material was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ÂºC prior to RNA extraction.
