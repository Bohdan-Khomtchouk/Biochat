TITLE
Rat duodenum during immobilization

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we examined duodenal gene expression in rats subjected to immobilization, to elucidate the mechanism of the stress response in the duodenum. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the duodenal mucosa with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture. Total RNA was analyzed using the rat genome U34A microarray (Affymetrix). Gene intensity information was converted to a mean intensity for each gene using the manufacturerâ€™s proprietary software (version 4.0; Affymetrix), which includes routines for data filtering and normalization.
