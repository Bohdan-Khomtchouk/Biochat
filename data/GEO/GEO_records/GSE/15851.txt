TITLE
Expression profiling of dme-miR-310 cluster (miR-310, miR-311, miR-312, miR-313) knockout

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the dme-miR-310 cluster knockout line in D.melanogaster. The knockout line was generated in an imprecise P-element excision screen using a stock P{EP}2587 containing a P-element insertion directly upstream of the miR-310 cluster. The precise excision line of P{EP}2587 was used as the control.

DESIGN
The expression of miR-310 cluster knockout line (imprecise deletion of P{EP}2587 insertion) were compared with the control (precise deletion of P{EP}2587 insertion) using Drosophila Tiling 1.0 F array. Each stock has three biological repeats. A processed data matrix reporting values (log2 intensity after quantile normalization) for all of the Samples is linked below as a supplementary file.
