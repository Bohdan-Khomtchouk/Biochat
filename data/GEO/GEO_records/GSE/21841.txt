TITLE
Expression data from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages treated with Hypericum perforatum fraction and bioactive constituents

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypericum perforatum extracts have been used as dietary supplements to treat conditions including mild-moderate depression and inflammation. A group of four bioactive constituents were identified from an active fraction of the extract. In order to identify the mechanism for the potential anti-inflammatory activity of the identified compounds, we used Affymatrix microarray to study the gene expression profile impacteded by these compounds, as well as the active fraction in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages.

DESIGN
We treated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages with DMSO control, active fraction from Hypericum perforaum extract, and a combination of the 4 putative bioactive compounds, called the 4-component system, all with and without LPS induction. A total of six treatment combinations were included in the final gene expression analysis using microarray.
