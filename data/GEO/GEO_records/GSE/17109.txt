TITLE
MYC Transactome Mapped by Global Array-based Nuclear Run-on (ANRO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe and illustrate the use of a method to measure nascent nuclear gene transcription with an Array-based Nuclear Run-On (ANRO) assay using a commercial microarray platform. ANRO measurements in an inducible c-Myc expressing human P493-6 B cell model reveals time-dependent waves of transcription, with a transactome early after c-Myc induction that does not persist at a late, steady-state phase, when genes that are regulated by c-Myc and E2F predominate.

DESIGN
Gene expression is compared at a global level across a 48 hour time course as measured for both nuclear run-on and total RNA using the Illumina microarray platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6255 Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
