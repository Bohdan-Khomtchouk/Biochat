TITLE
Feasibility of global microRNA analysis from fine-needle biopsy FFPE material in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor cells were microdissected from FFPE sections of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. micro RNA expression were correlated to clinical outcome and sorafenib-therapy. miRNA was labeled with the Affymetrix FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit

DESIGN
20 microdissected hepatocellular carcinoma samples with detailed clinical data

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
