TITLE
[E-MTAB-366] Transcription profiling by array of chicken embryos at 15 different stages

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of chicken development The experiment were perfomed as a part of our Vertebrate Evo-Devo project. The aim of the project is to compare transcription profiles of normal (unmanipulated, wild-type, whole embryo) vertebrate embryos.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from wild type G.gallus whole embryos at 15 different stages (Stages:HH1,2,4,6,8,9,11,14,16,19,24,27,32,34,38), and hybridized to the Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array. All the stages contains data from two biological replications. Each staged-samples consists of pooled total RNA from several whole embryos.
