TITLE
ChIP-seq for Satb2 in E15 cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify the binding site of SATB2 in wild-ype cortex by performing ChIP-seq using SATB2 antibody. E15 cortical tissues were dissected, lysed and fixed. Chromatin was prepared by sonication. Sequences bound by SATB2 protein was precipitated using a SATB2 antibody. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Genome Analyzer II. SATB2 binding peaks were called using MACS.

DESIGN
ChIP for Satb2, followed by sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
