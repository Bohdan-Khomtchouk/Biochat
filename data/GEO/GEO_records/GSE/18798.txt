TITLE
Expression data from PonA stimulated transfected U373 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induction of proximal components of the PI3-K/AKT pathway stimulates the expression of several genes, including several genes in the JAK/STAT pathway, documenting a crosstalk between these two important pathways. These changes were accompnied by nuclear translocation of certain transcription factors as well.

DESIGN
we measured levels of RNA transcripts using the Human Genome U95 Av2 geneChip microarrays.  We used an ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system.
