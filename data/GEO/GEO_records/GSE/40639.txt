TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression of microdissected epidermis and dermis in mycosis fungoides and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the epidermis, CCR4, CCR6, CCL20 and CCL27 were higher in ATLL than in MF.

DESIGN
We obtained the epidermal samples from MF (n=5) and ATLL (n=5) with the aid of laser microdissection. Complementary RNA  amplification were used for gene expression profiling by microarray analysis. We compaired MF with ATLL in epidermis. We obtained the epidermal dermal samples from MF (n=3) and ATLL (n=3) with the aid of laser microdissection. Complementary RNA  amplification were used for gene expression profiling by microarray analysis. We compaired MF with ATLL in dermis.
