TITLE
Subconfluent and confluent aortic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in subconfluent mouse aortic endothelial cells were compared with confluent endothelial cells. Compartmental analysis showed coordinater response in several endothelial-specific functions and organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosomes, peroxisomes) which were downregulated, and upregulation of the microtubular system and proliferation. Keywords = endothelium Keywords = confluent Keywords = subconfluent Keywords = organelles Keywords: other
