TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of canine mammary cancer cells and macrophages grown in co-culture conditions

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
miRNA expression in five various canine mammary cancer cell lines grown with macrophages as co-cultures was assessed using Agilent microarrays. We observed significant changes in miRNA expression in comparison to control cells grown as a mono-culture. The changes in the Wnt pathway were most significant.

DESIGN
Five cell lines were grown as a co-culture with macrophages for 72 hrs. After that, the cells were sorted out and t-RNA was isolated and hybrydized on Agilent microarrays. The control was RNA isolated from cells grown as a mono-culture.

PLATFORM
GPL16580 Agilent-037303 Canis familiaris miRNA array (miRNA version)
