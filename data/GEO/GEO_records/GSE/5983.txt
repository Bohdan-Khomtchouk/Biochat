TITLE
Tissue profiling of phosphodiesterases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: tissue profiling

DESIGN
24 human tissues plus one control pool were selected to investigate tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing of the human phosphodiesterases
