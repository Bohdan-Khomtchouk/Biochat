TITLE
Sequential gene regulatory events leading to glucocorticoid-evoked apoptosis of CEM human leukemic cells [HG_U95Av2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid (GC)- sensitive cells are killed by receptor (GR)-filling concentrations of GC for a sufficient time. We used 3 closely related clones (2 sensitive, 1 resistant) from the CEM line of ALL cells to test the hypothesis that over time, a distinct set of regulated genes would be found in sensitive clones, with cross-talk to other significant pathways

DESIGN
CEM C1-15(resistant), CEM C1-6 (spontaneous revertant to sensitive) are subclones of resistant clone CEM C1.  CEM C7-14 is a subclone of sensitive clone CEM C7.  C1 and C7 were cloned from the original CEM ALL line.  Samples were obtained 2, 8, 12 an 20 hr after addition of 10E-6 M dexamethasone (Dex) to triplicate cultures, RNA extracted and analyzed for transcript expression levels **Please note that the submitter was unable to locate the raw data CEL files.
