TITLE
Genes regulated by SOX4 in glioblastoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of SOX4 in LN229 glioblastoma cells prevents their cell cycle We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in SOX4 overexpression LN229 cells compared with mock control LN229 cells

DESIGN
SOX4 overexpression LN229 cells and and control LN229 cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture media for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the genes regulated by SOX4 in glioblastoma cell lines.
