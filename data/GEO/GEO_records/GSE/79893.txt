TITLE
Epigenomic remodeling of the PAX8 cistrome in high grade serous ovarian cancer [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report mapping of the PAX8 cistrome in three high grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (KURAMOCHI, OVSAHO, and JHOS4) compared to three benign immortalized fallopian tube cell lines (FT33, FT194, and FT246). We identified a highly conserved PAX8 binding pattern common across benign fallopian tube cell lines that was distinct from the unique PAX8 binding patterns seen in each cancer cell line.

DESIGN
Comparison of benign and malignant Mullerian cell lines.
