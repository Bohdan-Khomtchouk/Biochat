TITLE
Effects of antagonist of retinoid X receptor (UVI3003) on morphology and gene profile of Xenopus tropicalis embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) plays an important role in the development of vertebrates, and the agonists of RXR are well-known to induce featured malformations in vertebrate embryos. However, there is no information about the teratogenicity of antagonists of RXR in vertebrate embryos. We exposed embryos of amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) at stages 10/11 to a highly selective antagonist of RXR (UVI3003).

DESIGN
The experiments were initiated when embryos reached stage 10/11, the embryos were exposed to 250, 500, 750 Âµg/L UVI3003 for 0-24 and 24-48 for microarray analysis (n=24).
