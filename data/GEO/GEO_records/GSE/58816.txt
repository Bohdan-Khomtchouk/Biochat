TITLE
Allergic contact dermatitis to nickel is characterized by a specific microRNA signature [KCs]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that keratinocytes (KCs) (from healthy subjects) stimulated with nickel were characterized by a specific miRNA signature that were different from vehicle-stimulated KCs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, nickel vs. vehicle challenged keratinocytes (KCs). Biological replicates: 3 healthy subjects. One replicate per array.  Sample 1-6 (A28-A33)

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
