TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression from human 293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression phospho-mimic TRBP enhanced in vitro miRNA production and cellular expression of ectopic miRNA. We used miRNA microarray experiments to determine the effect of expression of phopsho-mimic TRBP on global endogenous miRNA expression.

DESIGN
We established isogenic cell lines stably expressing phospho-mutant and phospho-mimic TRBP using Flp-In 293 cells and a Flp Recombinase Target system.  After monoclonal cell colonies were selected, cells were cultured for two weeks.  Total RNA was harvested when cells were ~75% confluent.  Initial analysis was performed using one sample from each experimental group.  Subsequent analysis included an additional two samples for each group.  miRNA with values less than 500 were not included in analysis.
