TITLE
Expression data from ectodermal explants following activation of hormone-inducible zic1

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The response of ectodermal explants, neuralized by noggin and treated with cycloheximide, following activation of hormone-inducible zic1 injected into the parent embryos compared to those from beta globin injected embryos as controls, is expected to provide information on the direct targets of the Zic1 transcription factor.
