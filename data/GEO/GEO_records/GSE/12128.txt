TITLE
Expression data from ectodermal explants following activation of hormone-inducible zic1

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The response of ectodermal explants, neuralized by noggin and treated with cycloheximide, following activation of hormone-inducible zic1 injected into the parent embryos compared to those from beta globin injected embryos as controls, is expected to provide information on the direct targets of the Zic1 transcription factor.

DESIGN
Activation of zic1 in ectodermal explants following inhibition of new protein synthesis allowed the direct targets of zic1 to be identified by comparison with controls. After RNA extraction, purification and checks with PCR with actin primers for any mesoderm contamination samples were prepared for hybridization to Xenopus laevis Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.
