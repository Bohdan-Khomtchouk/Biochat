TITLE
A Novel Model of Common TLR4- and Injury induced transcriptional themes in Human Leukocytes (supported by NIH grant GM34695)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fifteen human volunteer subjects (18-40 years of age) and 5 Trauma patients were studied. One volunteer group (saline + LPS [n = 8]) received a 12 hour infusion a second  volunteer group (cortisol + LPS [n = 7]) received a 12 hour infusion of cortisol (3 µg/kg/min). After 6 hours of saline or cortisol infusion, intravenous lipopolysaccharide (2 ng/kg) was administered to all subjects. Blood samples were collected at 0 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours relative to LPS administration at 0 hours. Blood samples were drawn from a grounp of Trauma patients shortly (day1-5) after admission and later in their ICU stay (day 5-7). Leukocytes were isolated from these blood samples, total RNA extracted, and microarray analyses performed using Affymetrix Focus GeneChips® on samples yeilding sufficent quantity and quality RNA for analysis.

DESIGN
Blood samples were collected at 0hr, 6hr, and 24hr in relation to the LPS infusion. For both saline and cortisol treated subjects, infusion was started at (-6) hr and continued to (+6) hr.
