TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and smyd4 mutant zebrafish cardiac transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Heart tissue mRNA profiles of  50 wild-type (WT) and  50 homozygous smyd4 mutant zebrafish embryos  at 72-hpf created by CRISPR/Cas9 were generated by deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Heart mRNA profiles of 72-hpf  wild type (WT) and smdy4 mutant zebrafish were generated by deep sequencing using illumina

PLATFORM
GPL23085 HiSeq X Ten (Danio rerio)
