TITLE
Antimicrobial mechanism analysis of an oil-in-water micro-emulsion by DNA microarray-mediated transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The DNA microarray was employed in this study to investigate the gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli treated by an oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion, in order to better understand the antimicrobial mechanism of the microemulsion as a promising food-grade antimicrobial system. 5,440 open reading frames (ORFs) of E. coli were investigated.

DESIGN
5 ml bacterial cultures with a known inoculum of E. coli cells (1.0 × 109 cfu/ml) was added at 1:1 (v/v) to the microemulsion and incubated on a tube rotator at 200 rpm for 4 h at 37 °C for the subsequent DNA microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL17676 Escherichia coli O157:H7 4*72K
