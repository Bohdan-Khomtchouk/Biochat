TITLE
miRNA transcript levels in ccRCC-derived cell lines and proximal tubular epithelial cell samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite numerous studies reporting deregulated microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression patterns in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), no direct comparisons have been made to its presumed normal counterpart; the renal proximal epithelial tubular cells (PTEC). The aim of this study  was to determine the miRNA expression profiles of ten clear cell renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines and short-term cultures of PTEC, and to correlate these with their gene expression, and copy-number profiles. Using microarray-based methods, a significantly altered expression level in ccRCC cell lines was observed for 23 miRNAs and 1630 genes. The set of miRNAs with significantly decreased expression levels include all members of the miR-200 family known to be involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Expression levels of 13 of the 47 validated target genes for the downregulated miRNAs were increased more than two-fold.  Our data reinforce the importance of the EMT process in the development of ccRCC. For mRNA expression data of these cell lines see GEO Series accession number GSE20491.

DESIGN
MicroRNA profiling was performed on two proximal tubular epithelial cell samples (both cell samples were hybridized twice (biological duplicates)) and ten clear cell renal cell carcinoma- derived cell lines (one of which; RCC-JF in duplicate)
