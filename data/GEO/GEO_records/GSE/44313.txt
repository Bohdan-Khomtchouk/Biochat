TITLE
Gene expression Fulminant type 1 diabetes vs classical type 1A diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We determined the genes that were differentially expressed between fulminant type 1 diabetes and classical type 1A diabetes using gene expression microarray in peripheral blood cells.

DESIGN
Ten patients with type 1 diabetes (5 fulminant and 5 classical type 1A) were enrolled in this study.  All patients had recovered from ketosis or ketoacidosis at disease onset and had been receiving intensive insulin injection therapy for at least 1 month, which means that all patients and healthy controls were free of metabolic derangements at the time of blood sampling.  To determine the genes that were differentially expressed between classical type 1A and fulminant type 1 diabetes, a volcano plot analysis (fold change > 1.5 and p-value < 0.05) was performed.
