TITLE
Exon Array Expression data from fershly isolated human peripheral blood NK cells (pNK),  deciudual NK cells (dNK)  and induced decidual NK-like cells (i-dNK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
pNK treatment with a combination of TGFb, 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine and hypoxia yields cells with functional and phenotypic similarities to human dNK cells, called induced dNK-like cells (idNK)

DESIGN
This dataset includes the expression data of 3 CD56Bright CD16- pNK samples, 3  CD56Dim CD16+ pNK samples,  3 dNK csamples, 3  CD56Bright CD16- idNKsamples  and 3  CD56Dim CD16+ idNK samples
