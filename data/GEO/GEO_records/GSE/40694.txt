TITLE
KSP-positive or -negative cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals and objectives of this study was to characterize KSP-positive cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. KSP is a specific cadherin expressed in renal tubular cells, so it was predicted that KSP-positive cells have characteristics of renal tubular cells.

DESIGN
To purify renal lineage cells from differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, KSP-positive cells were sorted out by use of anti-KSP antibody. Mouse embryonic stem cells were differentiated with Activin 10ng/ml for 18 days through embryoid body formation. 2 independent experiments were carried out. KSP-negative cells were also purified as negative control.
