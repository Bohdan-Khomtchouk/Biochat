TITLE
Glycosylation-related gene expression in the mucus-secreting gastrointestinal cell line HT29-MTX-E12 in response to infection by Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The HT29 derivative cell line HT29-MTX-E12 (E12) produces an adherent mucus layer predominantly of the gastric MUC5AC mucin when grown on transwells. This mucus layer supports Helicobacter pylori survival in culture. E12 cells were infected with H. pylori and the transcriptome of infected and uninfected E12 were compared. Also included for comparison was the HT29 parent cell line grown on transwells. The study focused on glycosylation related genes as these regulate the structures that have a major role to play in pathogen-host cell interaction.

DESIGN
E12 cells were infected with H. pylori and the transcriptome of infected and uninfected E12 were compared.
