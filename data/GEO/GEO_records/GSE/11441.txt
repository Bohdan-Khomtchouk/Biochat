TITLE
MN1 or MN1-TEL in the promonocytic cell line U937

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of U937 derived cell lines with induced expression of MN1or MN1-TEL in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) Keywords: expression profiling

DESIGN
Two similar experiments (A and B, biological duplicates) were performed. Hybridization includes dye swaps. See experimental_design.jpg (below) for detailed setup of the study. In short, different time points after induction of MN1 or MN1-TEL were compared to uninduced samples. The effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were also investigated
