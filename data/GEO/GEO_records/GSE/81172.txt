TITLE
High-throughput sequencing identify miRNAs of Tribolium castaneum

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs of Tribolium castaneum, one small RNA libraries for mix samples of eight development stage (including 1-day-old early embryo, 3-day-old late embryo, 1-day-old early larva, 20-day-old late larva, 1-day-old early pupa, 6-day-old late pupa, 1-day-old early adult, 7-day-old late adult) were constructed.  Totally, 12,259,974 raw reads were obtained, 7,116,806 mappable reads were remained and 2,175,311 high-quality miRNA reads were identified after the small RNA digitalisation analysis. At last, 1,447 unique miRNAs which contained 274 conserved miRNAs, 245 known candidate miRNAs and 927 novel miRNAs were identified.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA in Tribolium castaneum lifecycle development
