TITLE
Cell cycle and cell death interaction in plants: PCNA, AtXRs and AtMIPS pathway.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-04_mips - atmips mutant/photoperiod - In Arabidopsis thaliana, how does MIPS knock out influence gene expression? In AtMIPS mutants how does photoperiod influence gene expression. - Wild type Colombia and MIPS mutant (Salk 023626) plants are grown in short days (8h light) during 27 days and then transfered in long days (16h light) during 4 days. J4JC correspond to 27+4=31 days plants in short days. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
