TITLE
Gene expression in IRF3-/- peritoneal macrophage infected with VSV

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IRF3 is one of the most critical transcription factor in down stream of pattern recognition receptors (such as toll-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor) signalling pathway. IRF3 is known to induce the expression of type I IFN gene upon virus infection. To furter examine the role of IRF3 in virus-induced gene expression, we preformed microarray analysis in IRF3-/- peritoneal macrophages infected with VSV, and found that IRF3 suppresses the expression of Il12b gene.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from WT of IRF3-/- B6 mice were infected with VSV(1 M.O.I. ) for 6 hous, and then subjected to microarray analysis.
