TITLE
H_Alessio_05: sedentary and active lifestyles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The interaction of genetics and environment play a major role in health and disease. Therefore, modeling experiments to investigate gene-environment interaction in a laboratory setting would provide the opportunity to gain mechanistic insight under controlled conditions. In laboratory research it is unclear if the gene-environment interaction of a sedentary lifestyle predisposes laboratory animals to hypokinetic diseases. Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
We are seeking to compare gene expression and physiological markers of health and wellness in animals with: i. a sedentary lifestyle in a standard cage (CSS1-4); ii. access to twice-weekly physical activity in a large box outside a standard cage (CSA1-4); and iii. access to regular exercise in cages with running wheels (CSR1-4).
