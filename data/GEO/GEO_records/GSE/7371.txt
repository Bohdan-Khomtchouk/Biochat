TITLE
SMARCA6 ChIP-ChIP from HeLaS3 Cells using the NimbleGen ENCODE Array; [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SMARCA6 ChIP DNA was isolated from HeLaS3 cells and surveyed for binding in the ENCODE regions on NimbleGen ENCODE arrays. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
SMARCA6-ChIP DNA and reference ChIP DNA (background obtained with normal rabbit IgG) were isolated from untreated HeLaS3 cells. Combined SMARCA6 and reference ChIP DNA samples were hybridized to a NimbleGen ENCODE tiling array that contains overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. The series is comprised of three biological replicates, hybridized separately to three arrays.
