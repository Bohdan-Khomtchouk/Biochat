TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of psaA and psbA tobacco mutant plants.

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis in tobacco mutant plants using tomato Genechip Genome array Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havanna) psaA and psbA deletion  mutants were constructed through a targeted deletion of 767 and 1152 nucleotides of coding regions, respectively with two gene cassettes: psbAproR:uidA:psbterR and rrnR:aadA:rbcLterR coding for GUS reporter and spectinomycin selectable marker genes, respectively. Standard established procedures were followed for chloroplast transformation to generate the psaA and psbA deletion mutants based on the homologous recombination. Gene expression profiles in psaA and psbA tobacco mutant plants were analyzed using tomato Genechip Genome array to study the global changes in the expression of genome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from psaA and psbA tobacco mutant plants along with the wild type plants. Biotin labeled cRNA was hybridized on tomato GeneChip Genome Array following the Affymetrix protocols. Two independent biological replicates were maintained.
