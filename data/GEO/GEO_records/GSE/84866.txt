TITLE
Dirofilaria immitis exhibits sex- and stage-specific differences in excretory/secretory miRNA profiles in vitro

ORGANISM
Dirofilaria immitis

SUMMARY
We report analyses of the types, amounts and stage-dependence of microRNAsfound in D. immitis culture media recovered after incubating 800,000 microfilariae for 6 days, 500 third-stage larvae (L3) and 500 fourth-stage larvae (L4) for 7 days, as well as 40 adult females and 40 adult males for 48 hours, all separately.

DESIGN
Examination of excretory/secretory miRNAs in 5 different stages of Dirofilaria immitis released in culture media.
