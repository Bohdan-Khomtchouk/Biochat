TITLE
C-JUN promotes BCR-ABL induced lymphoid leukemia by inhibiting methylation of the 5´ region of Cdk6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor c-JUN and its upstream kinase JNK1 have been implicated in BCR-ABL induced leukemogenesis. JNK1 has been shown to regulate BCL2 expression thereby altering leukemogenesis, but the impact of c-JUN remained unclear. In this study we show that JNK1 and c-JUN promote leukemogenesis via separate pathways, since lack of c-JUN impairs proliferation of p185BCR-ABL transformed cells without affecting viability. The decreased proliferation of c-JunD/D cells is associated with the loss of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. In c-JunD/D cells CDK6 expression becomes down-regulated upon BCR-ABL induced transformation which correlates with CpG island methylation within the 5´ region of Cdk6. We verified the impact of Cdk6 deficiency by using Cdk6-/- mice that developed BCR-ABL induced B-lymphoid leukemia with significantly increased latency and an attenuated disease phenotype. In addition we show that re-expression of CDK6 in BCR-ABL transformed c-JunD/D cells reconstitutes proliferation and tumor formation in Nu/Nu mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function for the AP-1 transcription factor c-JUN in leukemogenesis by antagonizing promoter methylation. Moreover, we identify CDK6 as relevant and critical target of AP-1 regulated DNA methylation upon BCR-ABL induced transformation, thereby accelerating leukemogenesis.
