TITLE
RMST associates with SOX2 to regulate neurogenesis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that knockdown of the lncRNA RMST changes the chromatin binding profile of the transcription factor SOX2.

DESIGN
Examination of SOX2 chromatin binding profile under normal and RMST-depleted conditions in differentiating neural stem cells.
