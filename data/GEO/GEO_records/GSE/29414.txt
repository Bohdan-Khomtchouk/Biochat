TITLE
To examine the influence of the early stress of maternal separation on the hippocampal transcriptome in middle-aged life

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined the consequences of the early stress (ES) of maternal separation on hippocampal gene expression in middle-aged animals. Middle-aged (15 months old) ES animals exhibit hippocampal transcriptome changes with a significant regulation of genes associated with ion binding, transcriptional regulation, cellular projection, cellular stress responsive pathways, neuronal development and chromatin remodeling.
