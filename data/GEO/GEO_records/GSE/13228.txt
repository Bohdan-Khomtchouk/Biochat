TITLE
Genomics-based molecular epidemiology of human clinical and feedlot cattle C. jejuni isolates in Alberta, Canada

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotide DNA microarrays were used as a platform to compare C. jejuni isolates from feedlot cattle and human clinical cases from Alberta. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed on 87 isolates (46 bovine, 41 human) obtained within the same geographical regions and time frame.  In addition, We also performed gene association analysis to determine if any genes may be differentially distributed between human and cattle sources or between clusters dominated by either human or cattle isolates (“human enriched” vs “cattle enriched”). Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Genomic epidemiology; Gene-association study

DESIGN
Data from 119 microarrays is included in the dataset, representing the 89 bacterial strains analyzed (87 field isolates, 2 control laboratory strains). Replicate arrays for 20 of the 87 field isolates were included in the dataset, as well as 5 replicates for each of the 2 laboratory controls. An array representing 1546 ORFs from strain NCTC 11168 was used in CGH experiments. CGH was performed by comparing signal from each Tester field isolate analyzed vs. signal from the Control strain NCTC 11168. Values represent mean of triplicate spots.
