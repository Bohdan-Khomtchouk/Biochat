TITLE
Maneb treatment with 2 ppm for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The number and type of synthetic chemicals that are being produced worldwide continues to increase significantly. While these industrial chemicals provide numerous benefits, there is no doubt that some have potential to damage the environment and health. Toxicity must be evaluated and use must be carefully controlled and monitored in order to minimize potential damage. DNA microarray technology has become an important new technique in toxicology. We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism for toxicological study because it is a simple, fast-growing eukaryote that has been thoroughly characterized. In order to evaluate toxicity by newly synthesized or mixture chemicals, toxicity-induced gene expression alteration profiles by known chemicals should be collected. In our study, cells need to be exposed with same experimental cellular condition, semi lethal (IC50), respectively. In the case of maneb (CAS; 12427-38-2), the exposure dose was decided as 2 ppm by growth curve with continuously diluted exposure. Maneb is a pesticide (fungicides) that is recognized as a carcinogen and suspected to be developmental toxicant, endocrine toxicant, gastrointestinal or liver toxicant, immunotoxicant, neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant and skin or sense organ toxicant. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Series contains triplicate hybridization results from independent biological samples respectively.
