TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Setx shRNA P19 cells, wild type human Setx P19 transfected cells with and without retionoic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of senataxin effect on neuronal differentiation and neurite growth in RA-treated P19 cells by modulating senataxin expression levels. Senataxin silencing does not grossly affect the gene expression profiles of P19 cells

DESIGN
At day one total RNA from Setx shRNA P19 cells, wild type human Setx P19 transfected cells with and without retionoic acid were used to compare gene expression profiling versus P19 control cells

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
