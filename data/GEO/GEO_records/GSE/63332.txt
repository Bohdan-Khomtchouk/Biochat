TITLE
Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin spikes local inflammation that induces Th2 and Tfh responses to the coadministered antigen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from mouse organs after hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin injection Cyclodextrins are commonly used as a safe excipient to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic pharmaceutical agents. In this study, we reprofiled hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) as a vaccine adjuvant, and found that it acts as a potent and unique adjuvant.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice (6 week old, male, n = 3) were injected i.d. or i.p. with a total volume of 200 micro liter of 30% HP-β-CD in PBS. The vehicle-control mice (n = 3) were injected with the same volume of PBS. After 6 h, the inguinal LNs, Liver, and Spleen were removed (within one hour for all samples) and global gene expression was obtained by Affymetrix GeneChip.
