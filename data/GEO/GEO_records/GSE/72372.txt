TITLE
Response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to west nile virus (E, NS2a) and type 1 diabetogenic antigens (GAD65, ZnT8) derived peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 3 healthy donors. The cells were stimulated with peptides derived from west nile virus (E, NS2a), type 1 diabetogenic antigens (GAD65, ZnT8) for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours.
