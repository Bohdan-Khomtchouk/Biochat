TITLE
gene profiling changes induced by regulation of Brachyury expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chordoma is a rare malignant bone tumor on axial skeleton, locally invasive and has a high rate of recurrence. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms of tumor recurrence after surgical intervention, as well as resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, remain elusive. In this study, cell lines PCH1 and PCH2 were established and characterized by chordoma specific markers. We found that the embryonic transcription factor brachyury inhibits taxol induced apoptosis in different cells, including PCH1 and U2OS cells. Brachyury regulated genes were identified in PCH1 and U2OS using microarray. Brachyury is an embryonic transcription factor involved in embryo development. We emplored the downstream genes related to apoptosis of Brachyury by microarray in different cell lines: U2OS, PCH1 and H460.
