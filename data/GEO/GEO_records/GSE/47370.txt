TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of HM1, HP1a-/-, and HP1b-/- ESC transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HM1, HP1a-/-, and HP1b-/- ESC transcriptomes were generated to determine whether depletion of these HP1 proteins influences gene and/or retroelement expression

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HP1a and HP1b Knockouts and its corresponding wildtype
