TITLE
Identification of kidney transplant patients at risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by differentially methylated regions in T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in peripheral T cells involved in de novo cSCC development after kidney transplantation. This was a retrospective study on biobank patient material. We matched kidney transplant patients with (future) cSCC to those without cSCC and studied genome-wide DNA methylation (450k arrays) of T cells on three timepoints. Prior to transplantation, after trasplantation but prior to the clinical onset of the first cSCC and lastly during a recurrence episode of cSCC.

DESIGN
Pure T cell samples of 132 patients were analyzed. No replicates are included, all samples are unique. Kidney transplant patients with a (future) cSCC were matched to control kidney transplant patients without cSCC.
