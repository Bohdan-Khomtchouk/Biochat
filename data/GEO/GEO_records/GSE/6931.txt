TITLE
Expression data from female reproductive organs of adult mice treated with estrogen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen induce organ-specific cell proliferation and development in female reproductive organs, though the reproductive differentiation, sex maturation, implantation and lactation. However, the mechanism of organ-specific estrogen responsive genes is unknown. Thus, we examined early estrogen responsive genes in mouse uterus, vagina and mammary gland. Keywords: organ specificity

DESIGN
70-day-old ovariectomized mice (C57BL/6J)(n=4) were treated with 17beta-estradiol (5micro g/kg) or sesame oil. Whole uterus (Ut), vagina (Vg) and mammary gland (Mg) were sacrificed 6h after the injection.
