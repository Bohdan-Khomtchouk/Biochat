TITLE
RLSC and MMH-D3 cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence provide support that the mammalian liver contains stem/progenitor cells, but their molecular phenotype, embryological derivation,  cell biology as well as of their role in the liver cell turnover and regeneration remain to be further clarified. We report the isolation, characterization and reproducible establishment in line of a resident liver stem cell (RLSC) with immunophenotype and differentiative potential distinct from other previously reported liver precursor/stem cells. RLSCs, derived from foetal and neonatal murine livers as well as from immortalized hepatocytic MMH lines and established in lines, are Sca+, CD34-, CD45-, alfa-fetoprotein+, albumin-. This immunophenotype suggests a non-haematopoietic origin. RLSCs transcriptional profile, defined by microArray technology, highlighted the expression of a broad spectrum of “plasticity-related genes” and “developmental genes” suggesting a multi-differentiative potential. RLSCs, indeed, spontaneously differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and, when cultured in appropriate conditions, into mesenchymal and neuro-ectodermal cell lineages, such as osteoblasts/osteocytes, chondrocytes, astrocytes and neuronal cells. RLSCs capability to spontaneously differentiate into hepatocytes, the lack of albumin expression and the broad differentiative potentiality locate them in a pre-hepatoblast/liver precursor cells hierarchical position. In conclusion, RLSCs may provide an useful tool to improve liver stem cell knowledge and to assess new therapeutic approaches for liver diseases. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profile of a RLSC line to that of the previously characterised hepatocytic differentiated cell line MMH-D3 (ref Amicone), using Affymetrix Mouse430_2 GeneChip array.
