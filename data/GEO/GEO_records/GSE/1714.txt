TITLE
Gene expression in rat kidney following recovery from acute renal failure (ARF)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to study the alteration in expression of mRNA is kidney following recovery from transient acute renal failure. The model used was a 52 min. bilateral renal artery clamping, followed by reperfusion, which resulted in a transient loss of renal function, followed by a functional recovery.   All tissue in this study was harvested 35 days post-surgery, when renal function was restored, and renal structure largelyy normal. For controls, sham-operated animals were used.  An N of 6 post-ischemia reperfusion animals were used with 6 sham-operated controls. For hybridization studies, RNA from one of six post-ischemic acute renal failure animals were compared with with RNA from kidney of six sham-operated control animals.  Each ARF vs. sham-operated comparison was performed twice, alternating the cy3 and cy5 label between the two hybridizations for each pair. A second set of hybridizations was carried out using sham vs. sham hybridizations.  This was done to get a quantitative analysis of the variation of the biological and microarry platform.
