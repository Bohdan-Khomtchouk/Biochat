TITLE
Circadian and feeding rhythms differentially affect rhythmic mRNA transcription and translation in mouse liver [Ribosome Profiling]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Diurnal oscillations of gene expression are a hallmark of rhythmic physiology across most living organisms. Such oscillations are controlled by the interplay between the circadian clock and feeding rhythms. While rhythmic mRNA accumulation has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about their transcription and translation. Here, we quantified simultaneously temporal transcription, accumulation, and translation of mouse liver mRNAs under physiological light-dark conditions and ad libitum or night-restricted feeding in wild-type and Bmal1 deficient animals. We found that rhythmic transcription predominantly drives rhythmic mRNA accumulation and translation for a majority of genes. Comparison of wild-type and Bmal1 KO mice shows that circadian clock and feeding rhythms have broad impact on rhythmic genes expression, Bmal1 deletion having surprisingly more impact at the post-transcriptional level. Translation efficiency is differentially regulated during the diurnal cycle for genes with 5’-TOP sequences and for genes involved in mitochondrial activity and harboring a TISU motif. The increased translation efficiency of 5’-TOP and TISU genes is mainly driven by feeding rhythms but Bmal1 deletion impacts also amplitude and phase of translation, including TISU genes. Together this study emphasizes the complex interconnections between circadian and feeding rhythms at several steps ultimately determining rhythmic gene expression and translation.

DESIGN
RIbosome profiling from total RNA of mouse liver during the dirunal cycle. Time-series ribosome density of wild type (WT) and Bmal -/- mice under ad libitum and night restriced feeding regimen were generated by deep sequencing.
