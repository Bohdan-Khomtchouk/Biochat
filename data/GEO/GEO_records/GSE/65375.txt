TITLE
Absence of heterozygosity due to template switching during replicative rearrangements [Agilent-041162 Chr6q_10q_14q]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the size, genomic extent and gene content of complex rearrangements involving multiple chromosomes

DESIGN
To determine size, genomic extent and gene content for each rearrangement, we used a customized tiling-path oligonucleotide microarray spanning the entire chromosomal regions of chromosomes 6q, 10q, 14q. A 2X400K Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) microarray was designed using the Agilent e-array website.
