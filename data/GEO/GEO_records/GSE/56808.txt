TITLE
Gene expression signatures in motor neuron disease fibroblasts reveal dysregulation of metabolism, hypoxia-response and RNA processing functions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis are two syndromic variants within the motor neurone disease spectrum. Whilst primary lateral sclerosis is associated with loss of upper motor neurons and a more benign disease course up to 17yrs,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is caused by loss of both upper and lower motor neurons and has an average disease course of 2-3 years. The majority of cases are sporadic, thereby limiting the availability of cellular models for investigating pathogenic disease mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate fibroblasts as a cellular model for  sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis, to establish whether disease-related dysregulated biological processes recapitulate those seen in the central nervous system and to elucidate pathways that distinguish between the two disease phenotypes.

DESIGN
We used microarray analysis to determine the differences in gene expression between fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies taken from sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis neurologically normal human controls
