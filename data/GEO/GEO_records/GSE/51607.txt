TITLE
Transcriptional regulation in pluripotent stem cells by Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rett syndrome (RTT) is one of the most prevalent female mental disorders. De novo mutations in methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) are a major cause of RTT. MeCP2 regulates gene expression as a transcription regulator as well as through long-range chromatin interaction. Because MeCP2 is present on the X chromosome, RTT is manifested in a X-linked dominant manner. Investigation using murine MeCP2 null models and post-mortem human brain tissues has contributed to understanding the molecular and physiological function of MeCP2. In addition, RTT models using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from RTT patients (RTT-iPSCs) provide novel resources to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of MeCP2. Previously, we obtained clones of female RTT-iPSCs that express either wild type or mutant MECP2 due to the inactivation of one X chromosome. Reactivation of the X chromosome also allowed us to have RTT-iPSCs that express both wild type and mutant MECP2. Using these unique pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the regulation of gene expression by MeCP2 in pluripotent stem cells by transcriptome analysis. We found that MeCP2 regulates genes encoding mitochondrial membrane proteins. In addition, loss of function in MeCP2 results in de-repression of genes on the inactive X chromosome. Furthermore, we showed that each mutation in MECP2 affects a partly different set of genes. These studies suggest that fundamental cellular physiology is affected by mutations in MECP2 from very early fetal development and that a therapeutic approach targeting to unique forms of mutant MeCP2 is needed.

DESIGN
RNA samples from normal ESCs/iPSCs, RTT-iPSCs and MeCP2 KD iPSCs were obtained. Gene expression of those cells were analyzed.
