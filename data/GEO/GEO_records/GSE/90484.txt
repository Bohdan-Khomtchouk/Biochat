TITLE
Inhibition of RNA polymerase II allows controlled mobilisation of retrotransposons for plant breeding [rice]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We report the application of a high-throughput sequencing approach that is specifically designed to analyze the active mobilome of eukaryotes after simultaneous inhibition of RNA polymerase II and/or DNA methylation in O. sativa japonica. We found that the simultaneous inhibition of Pol II and DNA-methylation activated the evolutionary young Houba-Retrotransposon in O. sativa suggesting a crucial role of Pol II in regulating retrotransposition in plants.

DESIGN
Comparison of the mobilomes in 10-day-old rice seedlings after inhibition of Pol II and/or DNA-methylation compared to control conditions.
