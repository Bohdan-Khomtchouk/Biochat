TITLE
Twi1p-loaded scnRNAs in GIW1 KO Tetrahymena cells

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
To understand the importance of Giw1p in the loading of small RNAs to the Argonaute protein Twi1p in Tetrahymena, we compared Twi1p-bound small RNAs from wild-type cells and GIW1 KO cells. We found that the Twi1p-bound small RNA populations in wild-type cells and GIW1 KO cells are indistinguishable in their size distributions and base profiles.

DESIGN
We immunopurified Twi1p-containing complex from wild-type and GIW1 KO cells and co-purified small RNAs were compared.
