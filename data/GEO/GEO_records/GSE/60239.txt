TITLE
A. baumannii Cells: oleanolic acid (OA) tretment vs. ethanol treatment (OA solvent)

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC17978 cells comparing treated ethanol cells with oleanolic acid treated. Based on the gene expression, we performed experiments to confirm the therapeutic effect and mechanism of OA in A. baumannii.

DESIGN
We performed a transcriptome anaylsis of 2 samples that are OA and ethanol treatment, respectively.
