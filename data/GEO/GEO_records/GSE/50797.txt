TITLE
Analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome in granulopoiesis reveal timed changes and dynamic enhancer methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study investigated the changes in DNA-methylation and gene expression during granulopoiesis. To this end CMP, GMP, PMC and PMN cell populations were isolated by FACS from bone marrow from healthy donors and analysed by CAGE as well as expression and DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from biological triplicate samples of CMP, GMP, PMC and PMN cell poplulations were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
