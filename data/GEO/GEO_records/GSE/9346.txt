TITLE
The function of CERK1 receptor-like kinase in the chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To see the function of CERK1 receptor-like kinase in the chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis, we compared the gene expression profiles in the chitin oligosaccharide treated seedlings of wild type A. thaliana and CERK1 knock-out mutant. Keywords: Defense response
