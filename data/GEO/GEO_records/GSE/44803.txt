TITLE
Gene expression in mouse leukocytes after CAWS administration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed DNA microarray analyses and compared the difference in the transcriptome between B6 and DBA/2 mice with modest or dramatic sensitivity to CAWS-vasculitis, respectively. Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS), a mannoprotein-Î²-glucan complex obtained from the culture supernatant of C. albicans NBRC1385, causes CAWS mediated vasculitis (CAWS-vasculitis) with distinct sensitivity among mouse strains.

DESIGN
The mouse leukocyte derived from B6 and DBA/2 mice after 2-, 4-, 8-, 9- weeks administration were examined. Each mice was run in singlete or duplicate. Microarray analyses were performed as single-color hybridizations.
