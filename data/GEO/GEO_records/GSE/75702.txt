TITLE
Differentially expressed genes between WT and AtC3H17-overexpressing transgenic plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We characterized the biological and molecular functions of AtC3H17, a unique Arabidopsis gene encoding a non-tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, in plant development. To investigate the downstream regulatory mechanisms of AtC3H17, whole genome microarray expression profiling was carried out. The experiment was designed to identify differentially expressed genes between WT and AtC3H17-overexpressing transgenic plants (AtC3H17 OXs) grown for 14 days under SD growth conditions. Interestingly, the most up-regulated genes were 12S seed storage globulin genes, CRUCIFERIN A (CRA1) and CRUCIFERIN 3 (CRU3), and seed oil-body protein genes such as OLEOSIN 1 (OLEO1) and OLEO2 in AtC3H17 OXs compared with WT. We performed quantitative RT-PCR and confirmed that transcription levels of CRU3, OLEO1, OLEO2, and 2S seed storage albumin 1 (At2S1) were higher in AtC3H17 OX seedlings than in WT seedlings.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed genes between WT and AtC3H17 OX at 14 days after germination under SD conditions (8-h-light and 16-h-dark cycle) were explored in whole genome level. Two AtC3H17 OX samples were compared to WT sample as a control.
