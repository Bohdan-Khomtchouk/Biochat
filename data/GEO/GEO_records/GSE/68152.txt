TITLE
FGFR1/KLB regulated genes in mouse brown adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify genes that are regulated at downstream of FGFR1/KLB receptor complex in brown adipose tissues of adult male mice on high fat diet by injecting anti-FGFR1/KLB agonistic antibody or human FGF21.

DESIGN
A three condition experiment with five biological replicates per condition.  Interscapular brown adipose tissues were isolated from adult male mice on high fat diet at day 5 after a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg anti-FGFR1/KLB agonistic antibody (bFKB1) or after injection of human FGF21 at 1 mg/kg b.i.d. (2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days.
