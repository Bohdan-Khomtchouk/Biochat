TITLE
RNA expression analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines treated with epigenetic drugs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The impact of drugs inhibiting DNA methylation (5-aza-2'-deoxycytodine, DAC) and EZH2 (EPZ-6438) on the neuroblastoma transcriptome was analyzed in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Parallel analyses investigated associated changes in histone modification and DNA methylation.

DESIGN
The neuroblastoma cell lines Be(2)-C and IMR5-75 were treated with DAC and EPZ-6438 in combination or alone. Controls were treated with solvent (DMSO). RNA was isolated and sequenced.
