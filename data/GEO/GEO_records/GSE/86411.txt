TITLE
Gene expression profile of micropapillary bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyses of mRNA gene expression profiling performed on 43 micropapillary bladder samples and 89 conventional urothelial carcinoma samples. Micropaillary tumors showed downregulation of miR-296 and activation of chromatin-remodeling complex RUVBL1. Micropapillary tumors evolve through luminal pathway.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples obtained from 43 micropapillary bladder tumors and 89 conventional urothelial carcinomas were arrayed
