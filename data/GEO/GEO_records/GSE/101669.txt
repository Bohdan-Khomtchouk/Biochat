TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis Reveals Extensive Changes in LncRNAs during Skeletal Muscle Development in Hu sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
To explore functional lncRNAs during sheep muscle growth, we systematically investigated lncRNAs using strand-specific Ribo-Zero RNA Sequencing at three key developmental stages of Hu sheep (110-day fetus, 5-day-old lamb and 2-year-old adult)

DESIGN
LncRNA profiles of  Hu sheep were generated by deep sequencing, three longissimus dorsi muscle samples for each developmental stage, including 110-day fetus, 5-day-old lamb and 2-year-old adult, using Illumina.
