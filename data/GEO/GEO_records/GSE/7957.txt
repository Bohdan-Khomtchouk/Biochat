TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed airway epithelium from C57Bl6 and MMP-7 and MMP-10 deficient mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Airway epithelium is the initial point of host-pathogen interaction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis and nosocomial pneumonia. We used global gene expression analysis to determine airway epithelial transcriptional responses dependent on matrilysin (MMP-7) and stromelysin-2 (MMP-10), two matrix metalloproteinases induced by acute P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Extraction of Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) analysis of gene expression changes in P. aeruginosa infected organotypic tracheal epithelial cell cultures from wildtype, Mmp7-/-, and Mmp10-/- mice identified 2,089 matrilysin-dependent and 1,628 stromelysin-2-dependent genes that were differentially expressed. Key node network analysis showed that these MMPs controlled distinct gene expression programs involved in proliferation, cell death, immune responses, and signal transduction, among other host defense processes. Our results demonstrate discrete roles for these MMPs in regulating epithelial responses to pseudomonas infection and show that a global genomics strategy can be used to assess MMP function. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
C57Bl6, Mmp7-/- and Mmp10-/- mouse epithelium at an organotypic air liquid interface culture was exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 1 and 24 h. RNA was collected from these samples as well as uninfected 0 h and assessed for expression changes using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 Arrays. Triplicate samples were processed for each genotype at each time point.
