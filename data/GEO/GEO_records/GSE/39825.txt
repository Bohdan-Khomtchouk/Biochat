TITLE
A mutation in the c-Fos gene associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lipodystrophies resemble syndromes of disturbed adipocyte biology or development and severe congenital forms (CGL) lack adipose tissue. The ubiquitous immediate-early gene c-fos is one essential transcription factor to initiate adipocyte differentiation. In a CGL patient we identified a single homozygous point mutation in the promoter of c-fos gene. The mutation facilitates the formation of a novel specific protein/ DNA complex and ubiquitously reduces basal and inducible c-fos transcription activity. We used microarrays to determine differences in gene expression due to a repressive c-fos promoter mutation in a patient with CGL.

DESIGN
Cultued fibroblasts of non diabetic controls and a patient with c-fos promoter mutation were analyzed at identical passage number and growth conditions without further additional treatment.
