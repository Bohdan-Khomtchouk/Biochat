TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of apple seeds

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
Comparison of seed of two different types of developing fruits in apple: central and lateral. Our objective is to find transcriptomic signatures that allow to explain the physiological drop of young lateral fruitlets

DESIGN
Apple seeds transcriptomes were generated by deep sequencing by triplicate from seeds collected from central and lateral fruitlets at 20 days after petal fall (DAPF)

PLATFORM
GPL18137 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Malus domestica)
