TITLE
TSS-seq analysis of K. marxianus

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces marxianus

SUMMARY
Thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus possesses intrinsic abilities to ferment and assimilate a wide variety of substrates including xylose and to efficiently produce proteins. The transcriptome analysis clarified distinctive metabolic pathways under three different growth conditions, static culture, high temperature and xylose medium, in comparison to the control condition of glucose medium under a shaking condition at 30Â°C. Interestingly, the yeast appears to overcome the issue of reactive oxygen species, which tend to accumulate under all three conditions.

DESIGN
12 (3 samples each of 30D, 30DS, 45D and 30X conditions)
