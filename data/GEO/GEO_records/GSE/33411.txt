Resistance gene-dependent responses in rice to the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
TITLE: Transcriptional profiling of Rgene-mediated responses in rice    PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The dominant gene Xa7 and the recessive gene xa5 of  rice confer resistance to several races of the bacterial blight pathogen  Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To reveal the modes of action and  the defense responses these genes initiate, we decided to obtain the  global transcriptional profiles of the rice cultivars IRBB7, IRBB5  (which harbor Xa7 and xa5, respectively) and IR24 undergoing early  infection by the Xoo Race 2 strain PXO86. Both IRBB7 and IRBB5 are  resistant to PXO86 (which carry the corresponding avirulence genes  avrXa7 and avrxa5), whereas IR24 is susceptible. We inoculated by vacuum  infiltration the three rice cultivars ten days after seed germination  (or 2 weeks after sowing) and collected inoculated tissue at 5 different  timepoints within the first day after inoculation. The transcriptional  profiles obtained will provide valuable insight into the similarities  and differences between incompatible interactions mediated by a dominant  and a recessive Rgene, in comparison to a compatible interaction.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  David O Nino-Liu.
