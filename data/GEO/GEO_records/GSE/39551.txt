TITLE
Gene expression profiles of adult neural stem cells with loss-of-function and gain-of-function of SIRT1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the role of SIRT1 in adult neural stem cells, we have carried out a genome-wide microarray analysis on cultured adult neurospheres from wildtype (WT) and sirt1 knockout (KO) mice and WT neurospheres treated with DMSO and SIRT1 activator,resveratrol for 24 hours. Then we screened for genes that exhibited opposite changing patterns beween KO-versus-WT and resveratrol-versus-DMSO-treated groups. Our result revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in metabolic process. And numerous genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation were represented in these SIRT1-responsive genes. More interestingly, Notch signaling-related genes,such as Dll4, Mib1,Hes5, Heyl, Hey2 and so on, also showed a significant enrichment. Real-time PCR validated the expression of Notch signaling-related genes. These data revealed the regulation of SIRT1 on the self-renewal and differentiation of adult neural stem cells.

DESIGN
Secondary neurospheres from WT and sirt1 KO adult mice, and WT neurospheres treated with DMSO and resveratrol for 24 hours were used, each in duplicate.
