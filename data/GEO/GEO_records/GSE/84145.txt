TITLE
Transcriptome profile of wildtype and Ret homozygote null mouse guts at E11.5 and E12.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total mRNA seq was perfomed on widtype and Ret null mouse embryonic gut at 2 stages of devlopment- E11.5 and E12.5

DESIGN
Total RNA from 3 replicates each of wildtype and Ret null emryonic gut was converted to cDNA  and run on HiSeq 2000 (75 bp paired end)
