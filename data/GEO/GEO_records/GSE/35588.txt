TITLE
Effect of obestatin, its N-terminal fragment and fragment analog Nt8U on mice epididymal tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of epididymal tissue of mice treated with obestatin, its N-terminal fragment residues 1-13 and a N-terminal fragment analog Nt8U

DESIGN
Four groups of six mice each were placed in individual metabolic cages and acclamatised to fasting from 6AM to 6PM and ad libitum water. The mice were administered 80ng/kg of the respective peptides intraperitoneally for 8 days and the epididymal tissue was subjected to mRNA extraction and microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
