TITLE
Nanostring Immunology V2 panel comparing the transcriptional profile of GD2-CAR T-cells vs GD2-CAR.C7R T-cells after multiple tumor cell challenges.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the experiment was to compare the transcriptional profile of T-cells expressing a GD2-CAR construct or a GD2-CAR.C7R construct (where the GD2-CAR and the C7R construct are co-expressed), after the T-cells had been exposed to two serial tumor cell co-cultures. C7R is an engineered IL-7 receptor that has been rendered constitutively active. The sample replicates were generated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy human donors.

DESIGN
There are 6 sample replicates for the GD2-CAR T-cell condition, and 6 sample replicates for the GD2-CAR.C7R T-cell condition. Samples 7546 and 7785 are from the same human donor (and were averaged together after normalization for the follow-up statistical analysis.
