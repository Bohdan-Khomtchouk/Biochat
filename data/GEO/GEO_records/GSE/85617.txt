TITLE
QUORUM SENSING IN A METHANE-OXIDIZING BACTERIUM

ORGANISM
Methylobacter tundripaludum 21/22

SUMMARY
Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy and serve as a major sink for the potent greenhouse gas methane in freshwater ecosystems. Despite this important environmental role, little is known about the molecular details of how these organisms interact in the environment. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing systems to regulate gene expression in a density-dependent manner. We have identified a quorum sensing system in the genome of Methylobacter tundripaludum, a dominant methane-oxidizer in methane enrichments of sediment from Lake Washington (Seattle, WA, USA). We determined that M. tundripaludum primarily produces N-3-hydroxydecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3-OH-CÂ­10-HSL) and that production is governed by a positive feedback loop. We then further characterized this system by determining which genes are regulated by quorum sensing in this methane-oxidizer using RNA-seq, and discovered this system regulates the expression of a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster. These results identify and characterize a mode of cellular communication in an aerobic methane-oxidizing bacterium.

DESIGN
Samples are 2 sets of biological replicates of a Methylobacter tundripaludum strain 21/22 mutant where the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase gene mbaI (T451DRAFT_0796) has been deleted. The mutant strain was grown to log (48 hours) or stationary (68 hours) phase in the absence or presence of the AHL 3-OH-C10-HSL.

PLATFORM
GPL22320 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Methylobacter tundripaludum 21/22)
