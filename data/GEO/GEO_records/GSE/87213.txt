TITLE
Differential gene expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ΔPA14_22470 (ΔPA3225) versus UCBPP-PA14 wildtype in planktonic and biofilm cells

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
PA3225 is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, and the ΔPA3225 deletion mutant is more resistant to various antibiotics than the wild-type PA14 strain in both planktonic and biofilm cells.  In order to characterise the regulon of PA3225, we compared the transcriptomes of biofilm and planktonic ΔPA3225 to biofilm and planktonic PA14 wild-type by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from planktonic and biofilm PA14 wild-type and ΔPA3225 cells (3 biological replicates for each condition = 12 samples) and submitted to McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre for library preparation, RNA-seq, and data processing.
