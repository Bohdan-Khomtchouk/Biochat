TITLE
Total RNA: 24h activated mouse OT-1 T lymphocytes, WT vs Lck-/- (OFF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment aims to study the transcriptome of activated T cells at 24h, using the same biological samples as the polysome profiling in GSE84781. A T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse model (OT-1) posessing a homogenous alpha-beta CD8 T lymphocyte population was used, and cells with intact TCR signalling pathways (WT) were compared to those with defective signal transduction (Lck-/-, OFF). Ex vivo OT-1 T cells were isolated from the superficial cervicals, axillary, brachial, mesenteric, and inguinal lymph nodes and then activated for 24h with cognate peptide antigen SIINFEKL. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, labelled with Cy3, and hybridised onto an Agilent-074809 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE v2 8x60K Microarray.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates of WT + 3 biological replicates of Lck-/- (OFF).
