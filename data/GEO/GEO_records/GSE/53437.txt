TITLE
Circulating microRNAs are candidate markers of heart failure and differentiate between heart failure with reduced vs preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared the expression profiles of circulating miRNAs in blood samples from controls and patients with heart ailment. Subject with no past history of heart failure/disease are considered as controls. The patients were classified according to the percentage of left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients were grouped as heart failure  with reduced (hfREF) and preserved (hfPEF) left ventricular ejection fraction. Employing miRNA microarray, we identified 'signature miRNAs' in peripheral blood samples that distinguished Heart failure from the non-heart failure controls, as well as those of hfREF and hfPEF groups.

DESIGN
Total RNA (plus miRNAs) was isolated using a modification of the RiboPure™-Blood kit from Ambion (Austin,TX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of total RNA and integrity were determined by using Nano-Drop ND-1000 Spectrophotometry (NanoDrop Tech, Rockland, Del) and gel electrophoresis respectively.
