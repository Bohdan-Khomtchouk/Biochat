TITLE
SOX7 and ETS factors regulate an endothelial transcriptional program during vascular development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vascular development involves complex changes in gene expression necessary to dictate the behaviour of differentiating endothelial cells within the emerging vascular network.  However, the transcriptional programs regulating vascular development are poorly understood.  Here we use a microarray approach to profile the genes regulated in response to SOX7 overexpression.

DESIGN
CD41 hematopoietic precursors (HPCs) were treated with and without dox for 12 and 24 hours in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
