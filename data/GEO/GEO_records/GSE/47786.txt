TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of berberine chloride-responsive gene expression in HepG2 liver cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from many medicinal herbs such as Coptis chinensis, has a wide range of pharmacological effects.  Here, we used gene expression microarray to analyze gene expression profiles of HepG2 human hepatoma cell line after berberine chloride treatment or 0.08% DMSO as control.

DESIGN
Comparing gene expression profiles of 40 µ­M berberine-treated HepG2 human hepatoma cell line to those of control cells sampled after 4 hours treatment. A 50 mM stock solution of Berberine chloride was prepared in DMSO. Cells were treated with 40 µ­M berberine chloride or 0.08% DMSO as control.
