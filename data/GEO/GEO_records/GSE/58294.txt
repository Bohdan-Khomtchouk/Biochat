TITLE
Gene Expression Following Cardioembolic Stroke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood from subjects with cardioembolic stroke and controls was collected, and the RNA extracted was interrogated and whole genome U133 Affymetrix Arrays. Twenty-three control samples and sixty-nine cardioembolic stroke samples were assayed.

DESIGN
Blood from subjects with cardioembolic stroke and controls was collected, and the RNA extracted was interrogated and whole genome U133 Affymetrix Arrays. Twenty-three control samples and sixty-nine cardioembolic stroke samples were assayed. Cardioembolic stroke subjects were analyzed at three time points: less than 3 hours, 5 hours, and 24 hours following the event.
