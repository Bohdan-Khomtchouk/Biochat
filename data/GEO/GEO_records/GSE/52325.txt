TITLE
Transcriptional adaptation of L. monocytogenes EGD to oxygen availability

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes EGD

SUMMARY
Comparison of aerobic and anaerobic transcriptome of L. monocytogenes EGD L. monocytogenes EGD cells used in this study were grown either aerobically or anaerobically to an OD600 = 0.70 - 0.75 and the transcriptome of these two conditions was compared

DESIGN
Six biologically independent cultures of each aerobically and anaerobically grown L. monocytogenes EGD were used for total RNA isolation (six RNA sets). 4 array experiments were performed with Cy5-labelled cDNA derived from aerobically grown Listeria and Cy3-labelled cDNA derived from anaerobcially grown cells. For the two other RNA sets a dye swap was performed, that means the two other array experiments were performed with Cy3-labelled cDNA derived form aerobically grown Listeria and Cy5-labelled cDNA from anaerobically grown cells. As all oligonuceotides are spotted twice on an array, technical duplicates were performed for each experiment. The overall design results in 12 data points for the expression of each gene.
