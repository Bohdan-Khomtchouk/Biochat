TITLE
Expression profile of COUP-TFII overexpressing hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increased COUP-TFII levels are found in human dilated cardiomyopathy as well as in mouse models that develop cardiomyopathy. COUP-TFII overexpression in adult mouse hearts caused ventricular dilation and compromised cardiac functions. To gain insights on COUP-TFIIâ€™s effect in hearts, we identified the molecular profile of COUP-TFII overexpressing hearts through microarray analysis. The result may shred light on molecular mechanisms that mediate development of dilated cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN
We utilized a previously established CAG-S-COUP-TFII allele and crossed it with the Myh6-MerCreMer (Myh6-MCM) line to overexpress COUP-TFII specifically in cardiomyocytes at two months of age by administration of tamoxifen. The experimental group has genotype of Myh6-MCM; CAG-S-COUP-TFII while the control group consists of Myh6-MCM mice (Figure 1C). Whole ventricles were harvested 16 days post induction for molecular profiling.
