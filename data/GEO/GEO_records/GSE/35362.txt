TITLE
Infection of bone marrow derived macrophages with M. tuberculosis CDC1551

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
I infected 8 flasks of resting murine bone marrow derived macrophages with M. tuberculosis CDC1551.  Individual samples of intracellular Mtb were collected at 2hr, and days 2,4,6,8,10,12, and 14 post-infection using the GTC (guanidine thiocyanate) method as previously published.  A 2hr " no macrophage " control was used as a common denominator in the two-color hybridizations.  I have two independent biological replicates of this experiment. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Time: culture time post-infection
