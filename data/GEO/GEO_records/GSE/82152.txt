TITLE
Expression data from Yellow Fever 17D vaccine immunized healthy subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand how innate immunity to vaccination can lead to lasting protective immunity, we have used systemic bioinformatics approaches to define the signature of the yellow fever specific immune response in a cohort of 21 volunteers.

DESIGN
In this study, we have 21 subjects in the final enrollment. Nine time points had been set as a time-course, which one time point (Day0) before inoculation, and eight time points covered serveal time points after immunization from Hour 4 to Day 28 (Hour4, Day1, Day2, Day3, Day5, Day7, Day14 and Day28). The goal is to indentify some gene expression signature from the microarray data that correlate with immune responses.
