TITLE
Inflammatory mediators alter astrocyte genomic profiles and G-protein receptor evoked calcium signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inflammation features in diverse central nervous system disorders such as stroke, trauma, neurodegeneration, infection and autoimmunity. To better understand how inflammatory mediators may alter astrocyte functions, we examined the effects of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) on purified, murine, primary cortical astrocyte cultures. We used microarrays to conduct whole genome expression profiling, and measured calcium signaling, which is implicated in mediating dynamic astrocyte functions. Combinatorial exposure to TGF-β1, LPS and IFNγ significantly modulated astrocyte expression of over 6,800 genes and resulted in both additive and synergistic changes compared with individual stimuli alone. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that combinatorial treatment significantly and markedly up regulated molecular networks and pathways associated with immune signaling and with regulation of cell compromise, death, growth and proliferation. These findings provide databases of astrocyte transcriptome changes elicited by the inflammatory stimuli, TGF-β1, LPS and IFNγ alone and in combination, and show that these stimuli up regulate astrocyte molecular networks associated with immune- and injury-related functions and significantly alter astrocyte calcium signaling evoked by multiple GPCR.
