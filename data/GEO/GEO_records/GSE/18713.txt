TITLE
Changes in gene expression induced by miR29b in HTM cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of miR-29b on the changes in expression of genes involved in the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix  in human trabecular meshwork cells (HTM).

DESIGN
One HTM cell line was transfected by triplicate with microRNA 29b or scramble control. After  3 days  total RNA was extracted.
