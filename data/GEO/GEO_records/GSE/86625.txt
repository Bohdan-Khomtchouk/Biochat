TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of serum miRNA in response to ionizing radiation in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kunming mice were total body irradiated by 0.5Gy and 2Gy carbon ions radaition. After 24 hours, blood was collected and serum was isolated. Total RNA of serum sample was extracted by miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Then, miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT microRNA PCR, Ready-to-Use Mouse & Rat Panel I V3 (Exiqon, Denmark) containing 384 assays was performed to profile miRNAs differential expression in these serum sample.

DESIGN
miRNA qRT-PCR expression profling. The relative miRNA expression levels of serum samples from mice exposed to 0.5Gy and 2Gy carbon ions radaition were compared with control group (0Gy, sham-exposed at the same conditions). Each treatment has three independent samples.
