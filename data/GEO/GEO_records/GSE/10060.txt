TITLE
comparison of HL60-NG cell and HL60-RG cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Promyelocytic Leukemia Cell Line HL60 has been used extensively as a model for myeloid differentiation and leukemia. HL60-RG cell is its sub-line and shows a higher growth rate. In this study, we carried out a genome scan using SNP 10k mapping array on both cells. Comparative study on chromosomal changes of these cells will give us information on mechanism of tumor progression. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Two samples HL60-NG cell and HL60-RG cel were analyzed by SNP 10k mapping array.
