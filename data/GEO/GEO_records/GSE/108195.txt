TITLE
Gpr97 exacerbates acute kidney injury via mediating Sema3A signaling in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish between the mice with renal IRI injury and sham-operated group.Expression of Gpr97 from this signature was quantified in the same kind of samples by real-time PCR, confirming the change pattern. By microarray analysis, we found that IR-induced Sema3A expression was significantly abolished by Gpr97 deficiency in mice

DESIGN
The kidney from wild type mice and Gpr97 deficiency mice with or without renal IRI injury were analysed.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
