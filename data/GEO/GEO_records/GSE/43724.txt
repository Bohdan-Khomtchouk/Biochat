TITLE
dreb1a expression data from Arabidopsis flowers under drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to examine transcriptomic changes upon dreb1a under drought, identifying hundreds of genes that potentially function downstream of DREB1A and mediate drought responses in the flower, including genes encoding transcription factors that likely play crucial regulatory roles.

DESIGN
DREB1a mutant (CS872453) were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased sharply and, after about 80 hours (defined as day 3 for drought treatment), the relative soil moisture content was near 35% of the soil water-holding capacity. The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest. Unopened flower samples were collected from drought treated plants, at day 3, 4, 5.
