TITLE
Leukocyte gene expression variation as a function of psychological well-being

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual differences in basal leukocyte gene expression profiles as a function of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA samples collected from 79 healthy adults measured for hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions of well-being using the Short Flourishing Scale (Keyes, C (2014). The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) for adults). Higher values of the hedonic well-being scale indicate greater levels of positive affect, higher values of eudaimonic well-being scale indicate greater experience of purpose and meaning in life, higher values of social well-being scale indicate greater experience of social well-being in life, higher values of psychological well-being scale indicate greater experience of psychological well-being in life, greater TotalMHCSF scores indicate greater experience of all forms of well-being measured by the MHC-SF, the FlourishGroup variable indicates individuals showing flourishing mental health as defined by the MHC-SF scoring instructions referenced above, greater BrownPsychological scores indicate greater experience of psychological well-being as measured by the MHC-SF with an alternative scoring, and greater BrownSocial scores indicate greater experience of social well-being as measured by the MHC-SF with an alternative scoring. key word: Risk prediction
