TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the spinal cord below the lesion level and influence of treadmill locomotor training

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to loss of locomotor function. Neuroplasticity of spinal circuitry underlies some functional recovery and therefore represents a therapeutic target to improve locomotor function following SCI. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating neuroplasticity below the lesion level are not fully understood. The present study performed a gene expression profiling in the rat lumbar spinal cord at 1 and 3 weeks after contusive SCI at T9. The below-level gene expression profiles were compared with those of animals that were subjected to treadmill locomotor training.

DESIGN
Rat lumbar spinal cords were taken for the microarray analysis at 1 and 3 weeks after contusive spinal cord injury at the T9 level. Another group of rats received treadmill locomotor training for 3 weeks, and theirs spinal cords were harvested for the microarray. The changes in gene expression after spinal cord injury were analyzed at the two time points. The influence of treadmill locomotor training was evaluated by comparing gene expression profiles between animals with or without treadmill training.
