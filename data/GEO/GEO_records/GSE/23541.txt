TITLE
Regulation of Embryonic and Induced Pluripotency by Aurora Kinase-p53 Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Illumina Beadchip array analyses of mouse embryonic stem cell gene expression profiles in the presence of or upon knockdown of Aurka. An ES complementation 'rescue' system was employed to measure the effects of knockdown (minus Dox). Aurka was rescued to wildtype levels in the presence of Dox (plus Dox). A control rescue ES cell line, with a Luciferase-targeting shRNA, was also assessed.

DESIGN
Total of 12 samples; Aurka_R (+/-Dox) and Control_R (+/-Dox); all performed in triplicates

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
