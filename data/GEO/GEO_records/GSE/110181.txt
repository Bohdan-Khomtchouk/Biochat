TITLE
Essential role of Arid1a in intestinal stem cell maintenance and homeostasis through Sox9 regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, have been reported in multiple human cancers, however, its functional role in intestinal homeostasis remains unclear. To investigate the role of Arid1a in murine intestine, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling of Arid1a conditional knock out mouse intestines. We found that Wnt signaling is downregulated in Arid1a conditional knock out mouse intestines compared to that of wild type mouse intestines.

DESIGN
We used the isolated crypts of Arid1a conditional knock out muse intestines as samples and compared to that of wild type mouse intestine.
