TITLE
Expression data from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae midgut 3h after a protein meal with or without E. coli.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The Anopheles gambiae midgut harbors bacteria that proliferate upon a blood feed.  We used microarrays to examine the midgut gene expression response at early stages (3hours) after an artifitial meal containing heat killed bacteria.
