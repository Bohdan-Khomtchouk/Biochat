TITLE
Expression data from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae midgut 3h after a protein meal with or without E. coli.

ORGANISM
Anopheles gambiae

SUMMARY
The Anopheles gambiae midgut harbors bacteria that proliferate upon a blood feed.  We used microarrays to examine the midgut gene expression response at early stages (3hours) after an artifitial meal containing heat killed bacteria.

DESIGN
Anopheles gambiae G3 mosquitoes 5-6 day-old  were fed BSA (20% in PBS with fresh 10 mM sodium bicarbonate) with or without heat killed E. coli (equivalent of  2.5 ml of 0.8 OD) .  Three pools of 10 mosquito midguts were dissected after 3h and processed for microarray analysis of gene expression.
