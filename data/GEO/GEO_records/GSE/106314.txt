TITLE
microRNA expression data from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We examined the influence of chronic morphine on microRNA expression profile in the mPFC using miRNA microarray technology. We found that 97 miRNAs (59 upregulated and 38 downregulated) were altered more than 2-fold in the mPFC from chronic morphine-treated rats.

DESIGN
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from rat mPFC using a miRNA microarray after chronic morphine treatment.
