TITLE
Expression data from rejection and non-rejection kidney transplant patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute renal allograft rejection is an important complication in kidney transplantation. Accurate diagnosis of rejection events is necessary for timely response and treatment. We illustrate the usefulness and biological relevance of selected multivariate approaches to detect rejection from genomic and proteomic signals. The data was used to study gene expression changes using whole genome microarray analysis of peripheral blood from subjects with acute rejection (n=20) and non-rejecting controls (n=20) to obtain insight into the molecular and biological causation of acute renal allograft rejection when combined with proteomics (iTRAQ) data for the same patients/time-points.
