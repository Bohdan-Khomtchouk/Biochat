TITLE
Effect of loss of PKC theta and p50+cRel on gene expression post T-cell stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OT-1 Transgenic CD8 T-cells were isolated from spleens of WT, PKCθ theta KO, and p50 cRel DKO mice.  The T-cells were either cultured with non-pulsed DC (WT only and signified as " WT - UN " ) or with BMDCs pulsed with the OVA peptide SIINFEKL (N4)  (WT, PKCθ theta KO, and p50 cRel DKO and signified as 'genotype - N4') at a ratio of 1:10 (DC:T-cell) for 18 hours. DCs then were depleted from the culture and RNA was made from the T-cells to measure gene expression at the early / late stage of T-cell activation

DESIGN
The T-cells were either cultured with non-pulsed DC (WT only and signified as " WT - UN " ) or with BMDCs pulsed with the OVA peptide SIINFEKL (N4)  (WT, PKCθ theta KO, and p50 cRel DKO and signified as 'genotype - N4') at a ratio of 1:10 (DC:T-cell) for 18 hours.
