TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of ROP10 GTPase-mediated abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study, we have identified genes that are respectively activated and repressed by the low concentration of ABA and show that ROP10 gates a specific subset of genes that are responsive only to a low ABA concentration. Keywords: Whole seedlings of wild-type (Ws) and the mutant (rop10-1) treated with or without ABA

DESIGN
12 Arabidopsis ATH1 chips were purchased from Affymetrix. Total RNA was extracted and purified from 1ÂµM ABA-treated or non-treated Ws and rop10-1. Each genotype/treatment has three biological replicates. Probe labeling, array hybridization and scanning were done by the University of California-Irvine DNA Microarray Facility.
