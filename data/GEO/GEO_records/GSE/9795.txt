TITLE
Monocular Visual Deprivation in Macaque Monkeys: A Profile in the Gene Expression of the LGN by LCM

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Laser capture microdissection was used to obtain individual LGN layers for DNA microarray of Rhesus array in macaque monkeys that Monocular Visual Deprivation was generated by either opaque dark contact lens or tarsoraphoplasty at birth. Keywords: Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, monocular deprivation, Rhesus array, Laser Capture Microdissection, Gene expression
