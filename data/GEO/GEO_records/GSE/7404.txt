TITLE
Comparison of Longitudinal Leukocyte Gene Expression after Burn Injury or Trauma Hemorrhage in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report here the genes that are sequentially expressed in white blood cells from blood and spleen at 2 hours, 2 day,3 days, and 7 days after burn and sham injury or trauma-hemorrhage (T-H) and sham T-H. Includes WBC treated with LPS for 2 hours and 1 day.

DESIGN
White blood cells (WBC) and splenocytes were harvested from individual mice and RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0  GeneChipsâ„¢. The results were analyzed by dCHIP and BRB Array Tools software. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was applied to identify molecular networks significantly affected by the injuries.
