TITLE
Tumor-associated stroma derived from primary clinical breast cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor-associated breast stroma was laser-capture microdissected from IDC breast cancer cases. The goal of the study was to characterize the heterogeneity of breast tumor-assocaited stroma and identify gene expression signatures predictive of clinical outcome. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Common reference design, 53 samples, with dye-swap replicates. Some samples replicated three or four times, a total of 111 arrays.
