TITLE
RNA Pol II ChIP-seq analysis after THZ1 treatment in TL-Om1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis was performed in an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell line (TL-Om1) to analyze DNA bindings of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) after treatment with the THZ1 CDK7 inhibitor.

DESIGN
TL-Om1 cells were treated with control DMSO or THZ1 for 3 hours.  The cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde for 10 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Illumina Hiseq 4000.  A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment.  ChIP was performed using an antibody against RNA polymerase II (Abcam, ab817: 8WG16).
