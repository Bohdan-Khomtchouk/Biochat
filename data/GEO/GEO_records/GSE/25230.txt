TITLE
microRNA expression data in bronchial epithelial cells from healthy and asthmatic donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Airway inflammation is the hallmark of asthma and suggests a dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, necessary for the proper function of cellular processes. We used miRNA microarrays to  compare the profiles of human bronchial epithelial cells from healthy and asthmatic donors

DESIGN
Human bronchial epithelial cells were isolated from healthy and asthmatic donors.  RNA was extracted and miRNA expression was analyzed on Affymetrix miRNA microarrays. We sought to utilize miRNA expression as a tool for understanding underlying biological differences in BECs from healthy and asthmatic donors.
