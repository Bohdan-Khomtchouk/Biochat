TITLE
microRNA expression data in bronchial epithelial cells from healthy and asthmatic donors

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Airway inflammation is the hallmark of asthma and suggests a dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, necessary for the proper function of cellular processes. We used miRNA microarrays to  compare the profiles of human bronchial epithelial cells from healthy and asthmatic donors
