TITLE
RNA expression analysis after RNA polymerase II transcriptional blocking with α-amanitin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HeLa cells treated with α-amanitin for 9 h. Relative abundance to untreated control cells was used to evaluate the biogenesis of lncRNAs by RNA polymerase II.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, alpha-amanitin-treated vs. untretated HeLa cells. Biological replicates: 4 with dye-swap
