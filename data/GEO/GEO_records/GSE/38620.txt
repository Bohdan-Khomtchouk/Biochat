TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of a genome-reduced strain in Schizosaccharomyces pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Gene number of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is the lowest in free-living eukaryotes. We further reduced the gene number to examine a minimal gene set required for growth. The genome-reduced strain, named ASP3894, has four chromosomal deletion regions: 168.4 kb deletion in the left arm of chromosome 1 (ALT), 155.4 kb deletion in the right arm of chromosome 1 (ART), 211.7 kb deletion in the left arm of chromosome 2 (BLT) and 121.6 kb deletion in the right arm of chromosome 2 (BRT). As a result of the 657.3 kb genome reduction, 224 genes of approximately 5100 total genes were reduced. ASP3894 transcriptional profiling was compared with a parent strain, ASP3880, that is a non-genome-reduced strain to examine the influence of genome reduction.

DESIGN
Three independent experiments. 3 control ASP3880 samples and 3 genome-reduced strain ASP3894 samples were independently grown in EMM medium and harvested at the logarithmic phase.
