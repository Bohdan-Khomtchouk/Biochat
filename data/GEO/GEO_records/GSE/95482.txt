TITLE
Expression data from hepatocytes of Tangier disease and control subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional effects of ABCA1 deficiency in human primary hepatocytes is not clear. We generated iPSC-derived hepatocytes from a Tangier disease patient and a matched control subject for transcriptomic profiling.

DESIGN
Induced pluripotent stem cells from control and Tangier disease subjects were differentiated into hepatocytes for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain transcriptome profiles of Tangier disease hepatocytes.
