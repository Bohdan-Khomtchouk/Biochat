TITLE
Partial hepatectomy 1, 2, 4, 6h

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (275-350 g) were anesthetized and subjected to two-thirds PHx. Liver sections removed by partial hepatectomy (PHx) were collected and used both as controls (time=0) and as individual reference material for each animal to reduce the error introduced by animal-to-animal variability. At 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours following PHx, rats were killed and liver samples were harvested. Keywords: Time series PHx (1, 2, 4, 6h)

DESIGN
Reference Design with 4 biological repeats for each time-point.

PLATFORM
GPL5051 TJU-DBI Rat array v3.2
