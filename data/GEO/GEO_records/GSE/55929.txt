TITLE
Changes of microRNA expression levels in HBV-infected human primary hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary hepatocytes isolated from chimeric mice were infected with HBV for 7 days. The comprehensive changes of miRNA levels were determined by miRNA array.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression levels were compared in between control and HBV-replicating primary hepatocytes by 2K microRNA microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL17061 3D-Gene Human miRNA V19_1.0.0
