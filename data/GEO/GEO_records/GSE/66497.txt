TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of MAPK cascade genes in brachypodium distachyon of different tissues and under multiple stresses

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
MAPK cascades genes responding to 14 stresses were screened using qPCR. All samples were repeated with 3 times and ACTIN was regarded as house keeping gene.  The stresses included heavy metal treatments, environmental factors, phytohormones and biotic treatments.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. The 20d-seedlings were used and the 3Âµg of total RNA were sysnthesis for cDNA by using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TAKARA).
