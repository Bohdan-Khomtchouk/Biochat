TITLE
MMP1 and MMP7 as potential peripheral blood biomarkers in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  We identified a combinatorial signature of 5 proteins that was sufficient to distinguish IPF patients from controls; of these proteins MMP7 and MMP1 exhibited significantly higher values in both peripheral blood concentrations and lung tissue gene expression,  suggesting their role as true biomarkers. Keywords: disease versus control
