TITLE
Expression data of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient samples from the REACH study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed genome-wide expression of available pretreatment specimens from CLL patients enrolled in REACH, a study of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide FC or R-FC (addition of rituximab to FC) in relapsed CLL, to understand the disease heterogeneity and explore genes that may be prognostic or predictive of benefit from R-FC treatment. REACH (NCT00090051) was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. This dataset supports the manuscript " PTK2 expression and immunochemotherapy outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia " by Weisser et al.

DESIGN
300 available pretreatment specimens from patients enrolled in REACH trial were analyzed. Additional contributers: REACH study investigators and patients
