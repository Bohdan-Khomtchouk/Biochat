TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli k12 TPEN

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were conducted on E. coli K12 cells stressed with 10 Î¼M in N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). Overall, 260 genes varied in expression, 114 up-regulated and 146 down-regulated by Zn deprivation Keywords: TPEN stress

DESIGN
Array hybridizations were carried out for three RNA samples prepared from three independent cultures (control or TPEN-treated).
