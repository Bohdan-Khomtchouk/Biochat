TITLE
DNA methylation in newborn cordblood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is extensive variation in DNA methylation between individuals and ethnic groups. These differences can arise from a combination of genetic and non-genetic influences and potential modifiers include nutritional cues, early life experience, and social and physical environments. Here we have assayed genome-wide DNA methylation in neonatal cord blood from African American, European American, and other ancestral groups. This is part of the CANDLE Study (Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood). Our overarching goal is to determine the different environmental and maternal factors that can modify DNA methylation in newborns.

DESIGN
This is a cross-sectional study of a total of 216 racially diverse participants of CANDLE. Cordblood was collected at birth. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Based on maternal self-report, the samples are 112 African Americans, 91 European Americans and 13 other racial or mixed race group.
