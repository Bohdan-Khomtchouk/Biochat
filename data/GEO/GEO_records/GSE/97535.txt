TITLE
ATAC sequencing of developing cone photoreceptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the accessible genome of postmitotic cone photoreceptors in the central region of the mouse retina on postnatal days P3, P6, and P10. At eachtimepoint we isolated GFP-labeled cells from three different Chrnb4-GFP mice (biological triplicates) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We then acquired reads of regions of  accessible DNA of the sorted cones using ATAC sequencing. Our data set contained 9 samples.

DESIGN
