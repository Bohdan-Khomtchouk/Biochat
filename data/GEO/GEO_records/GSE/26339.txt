TITLE
Expression data from pericardial and subcutaneous adipose tissue and adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better characterize the role of whole pericardial adipose tissue (PCAT) in the pathogenesis of disease, we performed a large-scale unbiased analysis of the transcriptional differences between pericardial and subcutaneous adipose tissue, analysing 53 microarrays across 19 individuals.

DESIGN
Patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting and/or cardiac valve replacement surgeries participated in the study. Pericardial adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were harvested from patients. 3 of the 53 samples were of inadequate quality and were not included in the analysis.
