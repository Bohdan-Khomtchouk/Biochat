TITLE
Effect of simultaneous activation of TGFbeta and TLR4 pathway in human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the interaction of TGFbeta and Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in monocytes, we performed microarray analysis. We identified a unique set of genes whose expressions in monocytes were regulated by simultaneous stimulation of TLR4 and TGFÎ² signaling.

DESIGN
THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were stimulated for 24 hours with PBS as control, LPS (100ng/ml), TGFbeta1 (1ng/ml) or LPS (100ng/ml) + TGFbeta1 (1ng/ml). After 24 hours of stimulation, total RNA was isolated and prepared for genome wide analyses using Illumina HumanRef8 V3.0 Beadchips. In total 32 arrays were analyzed including 8 samples of PBS-stimulated monocytes, 8 samples of LPS-stimulated monocytes, 8 samples of TGFbeta1 stimulated monocytes and 8 samples of monocytes stimulated with LPS + TGFbeta1.
