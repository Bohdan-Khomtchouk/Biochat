TITLE
Gene expression in Mist1+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mist1+CD24hi cells and Mist1+CD24lo cells in mouse small intestine were separatedly sorted, and RNAs were isolated. Mice were treated with irradiation, Lgr5-DT ablation, doxorubicin, or NICD expression before sorting.

DESIGN
TdTomato+ cells were gated by CD24 and sorted by FACS. Each group has 2 replicates. Groups contain untreated control, irradiated, Lgr5-ablated, doxorubucin-treated, and NICD-expressed samples.
