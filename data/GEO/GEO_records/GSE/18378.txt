TITLE
Gene profiling and prediction of response to anastrozole neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of 17 tru-cut biopsies and 13 matched surgical samples from ER+ breast tumor patients, treated for 3 months with Anastrozole were anayzed to identify a robust expression signature predictive of response to Anastrozole neoadjuvant treatment in ER+ breast cancer patients and, at the same time, to delineate treatment effects.

DESIGN
Each specimen had been hybridized against a Human universal reference used as baseline in each array. Two replicates with dye-swap had been performed for each sample, both before (tru-cut biopsy sample) and after treatment (surgical sample).
