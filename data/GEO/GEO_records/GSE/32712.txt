TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis CLIB214  21% Oxygen (normoxia) versus at 1% oxygen (hypoxia).

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray were used to generate the transcriptional profile of C. parapsilosis in hypoxic condition.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from CLIB214 grown in YPD medium in normoxia or hypoxia at 30 degree Celsius for 3.5 h, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Four independent biological replicates were compared. Isolates from normoxic condition were labeled with Cy3 and isolates from hypoxic condition were labeled with Cy5.
