TITLE
Expression data from tumor and normal epithelium derived from BRCA1-mutation carriers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine relative global gene expression changes in WT and BRCA1-mutation carrier breast epithelium as well as tumors created from WT and BRCA1-mutation carrier breast epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from freshly dissociated mammary epithelilal cells obtained from disease-free prophylactic masectomy tissues of 4 different BRCA1-mutation carriers or 4 different reduction mammoplasty tissues from non-mutation carriers.  Total RNA was also isolated from fresh tumor tissues derived from in vivo transformed human mammary epithelial cells created from cells obtained from WT or BRCA1-muation carrires. Dissociated mammary epithelial cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding mutant p53, mutant ras, mutant PI3K and cyclin D1 and injected into in humanized glands. There were four tumor tissues isolated for each genetic background.
