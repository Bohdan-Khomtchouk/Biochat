TITLE
Expression data from Mus musculus subspecies and their F1 hybrids for 3 tissues (brain, liver, testis)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus castaneus ; Mus musculus domesticus ; Mus musculus musculus ; Mus musculus musculus x M. m. domesticus ; Mus musculus musculus x M. m. castaneus

SUMMARY
We have studied different subspecies of the house mouse (M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids to estimate the within-locus mode of inheritance for subspecies differences in gene expression in three tissues (brain, liver, testis) of male mice. This study investigates mode of inheritance in crosses at a larger taxonomic distance than have been previously systematically investigated. We found the vast majority of transcripts to be additively expressed with only a few transcripts showing dominance or overdominance in expression, except for one direction of one cross, which showed large mis-expression in the testis. Keywords: comparative whole transcripome analysis

DESIGN
Wild-derived inbred lines of M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus were used to generate reciprocal crosses of M. m. musculus x M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus x M. m. castaeneus. The gene expression profile of  2 males each of the hybrids and the pure parental  subspecies were analyzed by using the Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 to obtain evidence about the within-locus mode of inheritance of genes. First, we studied all transcripts that are differentially expressed between the parental subspecies and assessed additivity vs. nonadditivity of expression of these transcripts in the F1 hybrids. Second, we investigated those transcripts which do not differ in expression between the parental lines, but which are expressed differently in the F1 hybrids relative to both of their parents.
