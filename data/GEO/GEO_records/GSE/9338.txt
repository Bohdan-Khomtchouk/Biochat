TITLE
Expression data from Mus musculus subspecies and their F1 hybrids for 3 tissues (brain, liver, testis)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have studied different subspecies of the house mouse (M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids to estimate the within-locus mode of inheritance for subspecies differences in gene expression in three tissues (brain, liver, testis) of male mice. This study investigates mode of inheritance in crosses at a larger taxonomic distance than have been previously systematically investigated. We found the vast majority of transcripts to be additively expressed with only a few transcripts showing dominance or overdominance in expression, except for one direction of one cross, which showed large mis-expression in the testis. Keywords: comparative whole transcripome analysis
