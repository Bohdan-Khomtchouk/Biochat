TITLE
Synergistic interactions between CLAMP and MSL complex facilitate Drosophila dosage compensation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq experiments were performed to understand the role of the CLAMP protein in dosage compensation

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiments compared the binding profiles of CLAMP in male and female cells and mRNA-seq data to define the role of CLAMP in regulating genes on the X-chromosome
