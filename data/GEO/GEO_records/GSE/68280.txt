TITLE
Recruitment of RNA Polymerase II by the pioneer transcription factor PHA-4

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Using staged embryos, we find many more genes with poised RNA polymerase than had been observed previously in C. elegans embryos, suggesting that early embryos accumulate poised PolII, and that poising is dynamic.

DESIGN
Embryos were staged at the 8E and Bean stages of development prior to ChIP-seq
