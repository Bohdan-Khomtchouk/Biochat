TITLE
An NF-κB-dependent, lineage-specific transcriptional program regulates Treg identity and function [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found a NF-κB-dependednt transcriptional program specific in Treg cells compared to Tconv cells by performing multiple RNAseq analyses using various knockout systems.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide RNA expression in different T cell types

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
