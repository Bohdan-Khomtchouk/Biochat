TITLE
Genes regulated by UCHL1 in ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UCHL1 is related to apoptosis and proliferation in cancers and we sought to identify genes regulated by UCHL1

DESIGN
UCHL1 was knocked down in A2780 (A2780-shUCHL1). A2780-shUCHL1 and A2780-control were cultured in RPMI and total RNA was extracted and hybridizated on Affymetrix.GeneChip.HG-U133_Plus_2

PLATFORM
