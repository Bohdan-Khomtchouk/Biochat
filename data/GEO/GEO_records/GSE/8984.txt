TITLE
Gene expression profiling of GABAergic neurons isolated from different brain regions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The main goal of the experiment was to analize the transcriptome of GABAergic neurons in general and compare their expression profiles among different brain regions Keywords: GABAergic neurons; expression profiling; rare cell

DESIGN
We used transgenic GAD67-eGFP mice to isolate early postnatal GABAergic neurons by flow cytometric cell sorting from whole mouse brains as well as from the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the striatum, and the cerebellum. Subsequently, microarray analysis was performed from amplified RNA of the isolated cells. Biological replicates: 4 for whole brain, 3 for each brain region. One replicate per array.
