TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in the Hippocampus of Orchidectomized Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The present study was conducted to identify relevant genes that could be involved in the action of androgens in rat hippocampus. We compared hippocampal gene expression between controls and orchidectomized male rats.

DESIGN
For microarray analysis hippocampus were collected from sham (control) and orchidectomized male rats, in a total of 3 biological replicates.
