TITLE
Gene expression patterns in IgG4-RD before and after steroid treatment and healthy control groups

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis in patients with IgG4-RD and healthy controls IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a new emerging disease entity characterized by elevated serum IgG4 concentrations and tissue tumefaction or infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells. At present, however, it is not clear whether IgG4-RD is caused by abnormalities in acquired immunity, like autoimmune diseases, or whether the excess production of IgG4 is a true cause of IgG4-RD or an epiphenomenon associated with inflammatory and/or allergic reactions. We therefore attempted to identify genes related to the pathogenesis or clinicopathology of IgG4-RD. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with IgG4-RD before and after steroid therapy and from healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted and DNA microarray analysis was performed to screen for genes showing changes in expression.

DESIGN
To exclude any gender-related differences in gene expression, DNA microarray analysis was performed only on samples obtained from male patients and controls. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Ambion速 WT Expression kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), labeled with GeneChip速 WT Terminal Labeling and Controls kits (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and hybridized to GeneChip速 Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix), which include 28869 probes. Digitalized image data were processed using GeneChip速 Operating Software (Affymetrix).
