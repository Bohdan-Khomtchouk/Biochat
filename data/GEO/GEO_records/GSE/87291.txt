TITLE
MicroRNA Expression in Bone Marrow-Derived Human MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Six commercially available MSC lines were expanded from passage 3 to 7 and their miRNA expression was evaluated using microarray technology. Statistical analyses of our data revealed that 71 miRNAs out of 939 examined were expressed by this set of MSC lines at all passages and the expression of 11 miRNAs were significantly different between passage 3 and 7.
