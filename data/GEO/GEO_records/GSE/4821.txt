TITLE
Identification of putative learning and memory genes in the dentate gyrus of aged rats following the Morris Water Maze

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the differences in memory decline associated with aging are a result of differences in gene expression.  We first categorized age-unimpaired and age-impaired rats based on their performance in the Morris water maze, when compared to young rats. Then we isolated messenger RNA from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of each animal to interrogate Affymetrix RAE 230A rat genome microarrays. Supervised statistical analysis of the different groups of aged animals recognized 85 genes (p < 0.005) that were significantly different in the dentate gyrus of aged rats that had learned the Morris water maze (MWM) paradigm when compared to learning impaired and a number of controls for stress, exercise and non-spatial learning.  In addition, statistical analysis of the microarray data that included young and aged rats identified 1129 genes (p < 0.005) that were differentially expressed between aged and young rats independent of behavior, but due to aging alone. Keywords: behavior comparison, age comparison
