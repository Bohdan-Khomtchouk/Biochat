TITLE
Decrease in DNA methylation 1(DDM1) is required for the establishement of CHH islands in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
DNA methylation plays a crucial role in suppressing mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) and regulating gene expression. The maize (Zea mays L.) genome contains more than 80% of repetitive sequences and ca. 85% of maize genes are within 1 kb distance from a TE. It is already known that the biosynthetic pathways and the derived patterns of DNA methylation possess distinct properties in maize compared to Arabidopsis and rice. Here, we characterized the function of DDM1 in regulating genome-wide DNA methylation, small RNA accumulation and gene expression in maize. We identified that two copies of ZmDDM1 are most abundantly expressed in embryo and simultaneous disruption of those two causes embryo-lethal phenotype with abnormality in cell proliferation from the early stage of kernel development. In addition, we found that ZmDDM1s are critical for high level of methylation at CHG sites and to a lesser extent at CG sites in heterochromatic regions, and unexpectedly, required for the establishment of mCHH islands. Moreover, small RNA sequencing revealed that ZmDDM1s are indispensable for the production of 24-nt siRNA. Although disruption of ZmDDM1s has little effect on the gene-body methylation, thousands of genes express ectopically. Our results provide novel insight into the possible participation of ZmDDM1s in establishing mCHH islands via RdDM pathway, suggesting that different from Arabidopsis, maize may adapt distinct mechanisms in regulating mCHH under the circumstance that CMT2 is evolutionarily absent.
