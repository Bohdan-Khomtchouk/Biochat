TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional response of primary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) following infection with porcine circovirus type 2

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) play impoartant role in innate immunity. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been identified as the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, an economically important multifactorial disease of the swine industry worldwide. We used microarrays to study the transcriptome of PAMs infection with PCV2.

DESIGN
PAMs were collected by bronchoalveolar lavage from health piglets (free of PCV2, PRRSV, PRV, CSFV, PPV), and PAMs were cultured for 48 hours and inoculated with 5 moi of PCV2.

PLATFORM
GPL13968 Swine Protein-Annotated Oligonucleotide Microarray, 20K
