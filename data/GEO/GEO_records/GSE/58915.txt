TITLE
Changes of genes in time-dependent photoaged mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Photoaging results from the damaging effects of long-term exposure to UV. It is characterized by deep wrinkle, but the mechanism is still lack. To better understand molecular events contributing to photoaging, We used microarray analysis using an optimized in time-dependent wrinkle model in mice.

DESIGN
We used non UV-irradiated 1 and 8 weeks as a control group and compared expression patterns with UV-irradiated 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks mouse skin. Three animals were used per each group.
