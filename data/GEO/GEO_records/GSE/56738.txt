TITLE
Gene expression profiles of colorectal cancer cells under the three dimensional culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) shows the high mortality and morbidity. The mortal number of patients and the morbid number of patients with CRC is also increasing. However, the genes which relate to promote tumorigenesis in CRC remain unclear. In order to investigate specific genes and pathways involved in CRC tumorigenesis, we compared genes expressed between three dimensional cultures and control two-dimensional cultures.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from the CRC cell lines under the condition of two-dimensional culture and three dimensional culture.
