TITLE
Anp32e is a histone chaperone that removes H2A.Z from chromatin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a genome wide enrichment, redistribution and accumulation of H2A.Z at specific chromatin control regions, in particular at enhancers and insulators, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts depleted for Anp32e (MEFs Anp32e-/-).

DESIGN
H2A.Z ChIP-seq in MEFs WT (+/+) or KO (-/-) for Anp32e.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
