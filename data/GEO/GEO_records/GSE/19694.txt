TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of siRNA accumulation in Arabidopsis treated with bacteria

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify endogenous siRNAs in response to bacterial pathogen at a whole genome level, we performed small RNA profiling on Pseudomonas syringae-challenged Arabidopsis and obtained more than 24.6 million (M) reads with more than 3.8 M unique small RNAs that perfectly matched Arabidopsis genome. We found some new miRNAs and some miRNA induced by pathogen infection. We also identified more than 20K unique siRNAs from the NAT mRNAs and 22K siRNAs from the introns or intron-exon junction of the NATs.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNAs from Arabidopsis infected by control and 3 bacterias in 6h and 14h.

PLATFORM
