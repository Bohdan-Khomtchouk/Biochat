TITLE
PiceaGenExpress database of transcription profiles

ORGANISM
Picea abies ; Picea glauca

SUMMARY
A small database of transcription profiles called PgGenExpress was developed from over 150 hybridizations spanning eight major tissue types. In total, transcripts were detected for 92% of the genes on the microarray, in at least one tissue. Non-annotated genes were predominantly expressed at low levels in fewer tissues than genes of known or predicted function. Diversity of expression within gene families may be rapidly assessed from PgGenExpress. In conifer trees, dehydrins and late embryogenesis (LEA) osmotic regulation proteins occur in large gene families compared to angiosperms. Strong contrasts and low diversity was observed in the dehydrin family, while diverse patterns suggested a greater degree of diversification among LEAs.

DESIGN
This is a one-color meta-analysis of tissues from 5 separate experiments. There are 8 different tissue types. Each tissue is represented by a variable number of slides, each slide being a biological repetition, for a total of 149 slides.
