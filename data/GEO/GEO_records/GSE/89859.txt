TITLE
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of equine sarcoid and tumor distant skin samples

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The aim of the project was to identify sites undergoing changes in methylation level in cancer cells of equine sarcoid. The comparative analysis of DNA methylation patterns of the genome fraction rich in CpG dinucleotides was investigated using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) technique. In this study, for the first time we report the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of skin tumour in horses and describe differentially methylated genomic regions with respect to healthy skin.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, sarcoid vs. tumour-distant skin. Biological replicates: 1 sarcoid replicate, 1 control tissue replicate.
