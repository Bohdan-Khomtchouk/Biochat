TITLE
Whole-genome comparative RNA expression profiling of axenic and intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania infantum

ORGANISM
Leishmania infantum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum intracellular amastigote and transcriptional analysis of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum axenic amastigote. The full-genome DNA microarrays includes one 70-oligonucleotides probe for each gene of L.infantum. Keywords: stage and culture condition

DESIGN
Intracellular amastigote analysis: Two-condition experiment, promastigote stage vs intracellular amastigote stage. Six biological replicates for each stage, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array Axenic amastigote analysis: Two-condition experiment, promastigote stage vs axenic amastigote stage. Four biological replicates for each stage, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
