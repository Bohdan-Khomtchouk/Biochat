TITLE
Whole-genome comparative RNA expression profiling of axenic and intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania infantum

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum intracellular amastigote and transcriptional analysis of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum axenic amastigote. The full-genome DNA microarrays includes one 70-oligonucleotides probe for each gene of L.infantum. Keywords: stage and culture condition
