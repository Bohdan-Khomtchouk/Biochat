TITLE
Endometrial methylome of healthy women during the transition from pre-receptive to receptive phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The inner uterine lining (endometrium) has been shown to have a distinct methylation pattern that changes throughout the menstrual cycle. However, not much is known about how the endometrial methylome affects endometrial receptivity to implanting embryo in the second half of the menstrual cycle. The aim of the present study was to use genome-wide technologies and a paired study design to characterize the endometrial methylome in pre-receptive and receptive endometrium sampled from 17 healthy women within the same menstrual cycle.

DESIGN
Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip arrays were used to explore DNA methylation profiles of paired endometrial tissue from early- and midsecretory phase of 17 healthy women

PLATFORM
