TITLE
Drosophila ovarian stage 8 and 10 follicle gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified genes whose expression changes between stage 8 and stage 10. We also identified genes whose expression was altered in stage 10 from temperature senstive ecdysone receptor mutant flies raised at the restrictive temperature. The experiments showed a significant number of genes that are upregulated in stage 10 depend EcR-mediated signaling.
