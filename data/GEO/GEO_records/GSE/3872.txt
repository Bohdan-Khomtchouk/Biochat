TITLE
Baseline gene transcription in genital fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the role of androgen in genital morphogenesis, we compared basal transcriptional patterns in genital fibroblasts from 46,XY individuals with either wild-type AR or germline inactivation of the AR as a result of mutation. A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Keywords: disease_state_design
