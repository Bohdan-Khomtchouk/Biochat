TITLE
Glycosyltransferase enzyme GCNT3 overexpression effect on SW620 colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate glycosyltransferase enzyme GCNT3 function and to identify putative GCNT3 partners, regulators and/or downstream targets, we performed genomic analysis of GCNT3 overexpression in colon cancer cells. Data from three independent experiments were assayed in a whole genome microarray analysis. We compared patterns of global expression between GCNT3 and No ORF SW620 cells.

DESIGN
Modulation of whole gene expression by GCNT3 was tested in SW620 cells using expression arrays (Agilent Human Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray Kit). Three replicates between GCNT3 stable overexpressed and control (No ORF) cells were performed. Ten Âµg of total RNA for each condition were used for RNA quality evaluation, amplification, labelling and hybridization to Agilent arrays according to the manufacturer's protocols.
