TITLE
Gene expression analysis of murine pluripotent stem cells treated with myxothiazol for 12 h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ROS are frequently associated with deleterious effects caused by oxidative stress. Despite the harmful effects of non-specific oxidation, ROS also function as signal transduction molecules that regulate various biological processes, including stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that elevated ROS level by myxothiazol exposure makes murine P19 pluripotent stem cells more potent to differentiate in trophoblast cells, but not in neurons.

DESIGN
For gene expression analysis samples were extracted from P19 cells grown under normal conditions (4 independent samples) or treated with 5 nM myxothiazol for 12 h (3 independent samples).
