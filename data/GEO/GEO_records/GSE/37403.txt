TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the SNAPc complex [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-activating protein complex (SNAPc) is a basal transcription factor that mediates the transcriptional activation of snRNAs. Here, we describe the genome-wide occupancy of the SNAPC1 and SNAPC4 subunits of SNAPc. While the SNAPC4 occupancy was in accord with the role for SNAPc in snRNA transcription, SNAPC1 displayed a broader genomic profile mirroring that of RNA polymerase II at highly active protein-coding genes. Our functional analysis revealed a role for SNAPc1 in regulation of both basal and activator-induced transcription of protein-coding genes. These studies expand the role for SNAPC1 beyond its regulation of snRNA transcription.
