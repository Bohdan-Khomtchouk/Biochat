TITLE
Shaping of Tumor and Drug Resistant Genomes by Instability and Selection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization to carry out a higher resolution evaluation of the effect of MMR competence on genomic alterations occurring in 20 cell lines and to determine if characteristic aberrations arise in MMR proficient and deficient HCT116 cells undergoing selection for methotrexate resistance. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization

DESIGN
Array CGH experiments of cell line genomic DNA as test samples and normal human genomic DNA as reference sample.
