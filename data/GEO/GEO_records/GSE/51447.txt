TITLE
Microarray data from CREB inhibited and control mesothelioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is known to play important roles in growth and drug resistance of various cancers. Here we show roles of inhibition of CREB1 on gene expression profile of malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells (Hmeso and H2373/PPMMill).

DESIGN
Stably transfected HMESO or H2373/PPMMill cells with either shControl or shCREB1 plasmids were used. Microarrays were performed on samples from 2 independent experiments. Each sample was analyzed on a separate array (2 independent biological replicates).
