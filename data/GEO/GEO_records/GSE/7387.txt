TITLE
Identification of immune-related genes in tolerogenic dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression data from induced-regulatory T cell treated- and untreated-DCs from patients with ITP. Keywords: Regulatory T cell, dendritic cell

DESIGN
This experiment consists of 10 arrays.The microarray slides were hybridized with RNA prepared from 5 biological replicate samples. As a measure of technical replication, each experiment also had a corresponding dye swap.

PLATFORM
