TITLE
Analysis of White Adipose Tissue Gene Expression Reveals CREB1 Pathway Altered in Huntington's Disease.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated gene expression signatures in subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from control subjects, premanifest HD gene carriers and manifest HD subjects with the aim to identify gene expression changes and signalling pathway alterations in adipose tissue relevant to HD. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. Target genes were technically validated using real-time quantitative PCR and the expression signature was validated in an independent subject cohort.

DESIGN
20 subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples were analyzed by affymetrix: 7 control samples; 8 premanifest HD samples; 5 stage II/III HD samples.
