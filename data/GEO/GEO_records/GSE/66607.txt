TITLE
Identification of differently expressed miRNAs between Tamoxifen sensitive cells and Tamoxifen resistant cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen is the most widely administered adjuvant first-line hormone therapy for Estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive breast cancer patients. However, one from three patients will develop resistance, while the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently unclear. Recent studies reported that abnormal expression of miRNAs played a role in cancer progress. To study the potential function of miRNAs in tamoxifen resistance, Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 microarray was employed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between tamoxifen sensitive MCF7 parent (MCF7-Pa) cells and induced resistant (MCF7-Re) cells.
