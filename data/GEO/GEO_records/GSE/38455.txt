TITLE
Analysis of the global gene expression in the rat hearts transduced with adeno-associated viral vectors coding VEGF-B

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We show that an excess of VEGF-B protects the heart via adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and increased coronary arterial reserve, and by inducing a shift from lipid to glucose metabolism.

DESIGN
Six hearts transduced with AAV-VEGF-B  were compared to six AAV-HSA (human serum albumin) controls
