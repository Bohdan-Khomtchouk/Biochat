TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis axe1-5 and met1-3 mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis axe1-5 and met1-3 mutants.

DESIGN
Fifteen-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown on the agar plates were harvested. The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants (axe1-5 (hda6 mutant), DR5 (parental line of axe1-5), met1-3 and Col) and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
