TITLE
Genome-Wide High-Resolution Mapping of Exosome Substrates Reveals Hidden Features in the Arabidopsis Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The exosome complex plays a central role in RNA metabolism, and each of its core subunits is essential for viability in yeast  However, comprehensive studies of exosome substrates and functional analyses of its subunits in multi.CELlular eukaryotes are lacking  Here we show that, in sharp contrast to yeast and metazoan exosome complexes, individual subunits of the plant exosome core are functionally specialized  Using whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarray analyses of csl4 null mutant plants and conditional genetic depletions of RRP4 and RRP41, we uncovered  unexpected functional plasticity in the plant exosome core as well as generated a set of high-resolution genome-wide maps of Arabidopsis exosome targets  These analyses provide evidence for widespread polyadenylation- and exosome-mediated RNA quality control in plants and reveal novel aspects of stable  structural RNA metabolism  Finally, numerous novel exosome substrates were discovered, including a select subset of mRNAs, miRNA processing intermediates,  and hundreds of noncoding RNAs, the vast majority of which have not been previously described This large collection of RNAs belong to a Òdeeply hiddenÓ layer  of the transcriptome that is tightly repressed and can only be visualized upon inhibition of exosome activity These first genome-wide maps of exosome  substrates will aid in illuminating new fundamental components and regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptomes Keywords: Strand-specific gene expression analysis using whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarray analyses of three exosome subunits, using csl4 null mutant plants and conditional genetic depletions of RRP4 and RRP41.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were done for each sample on each chromosomal strand (Watson and Crick) which meant a total of four whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used per sample. We studied a total of 8 biological samples for this project Overall, a total of 32 whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used for this study
