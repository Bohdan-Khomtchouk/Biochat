TITLE
Expression data from Notch-activated CD34+CD45RA-Lin- hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) transduced with nuclear-trapped AF1q/MLLT11 (A2M)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine the impact of AF1q/MLLT11 on the gene expression profile of Notch-activated CD34+CD45RA-Lin- HPCs isolated from umbilical cord blood CD34+CD45RA-Lin-  HPCs correspond to early multipotent progenitors. A2M is a nuclear mutant derivative of AF1q/MLLT11
