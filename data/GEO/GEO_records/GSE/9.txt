UV Exposure in Wild-Type and SOS-Deficient E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
UV Irradiation of the wild-type and lexA MG1655 Escherichia coli. Cells were irradiated at ~2x10^8 cells/ml in the Davis medium by 15-W germicidal lamp (254 nm, 0.66J/m^2/sec). Set also includes respective controls for unirradiated cells collected at 20 and 60 min time points. Comparison between lexA mutant and the isogenic wild-type prior the UV treatment is also included as part of the set. The SOS response in UV-irradiated Escherichia coli includes the upregulation of several dozen genes that are negatively regulated by the LexA repressor. Using DNA microarrays containing amplified DNA fragments from 95.5% of all open reading frames identified on the E. coli chromosome, we have examined the changes in gene expression following UV exposure in both wild-type cells and lexA1 mutants, which are unable to induce genes under LexA control. We report here the time courses of expression of the genes surrounding the 26 documented lexA-regulated regions on the E. coli chromosome. We observed 17 additional sites that responded in a lexA-dependent manner and a large number of genes that were upregulated in a lexA-independent manner although upregulation in this manner was generally not more than twofold. In addition, several transcripts were either downregulated or degraded following UV irradiation. These newly identified UV-responsive genes are discussed with respect to their possible roles in cellular recovery following exposure to UV irradiation. Data from the set are presented and analysed in the manuscript " Comparative gene expression profiles following UV exposure in wild type and SOS deficient Escherichia coli.
