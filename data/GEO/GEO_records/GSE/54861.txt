TITLE
Gene expression profilings of normal human oral keratinocyte (HOK) and dysplastic oral keratinocyte cell line from a heavy smoker (DOK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our previous study, we identified global genetic and epigenetic aberrations in the tumors of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients who were habitual smokers. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke might play a role in oral malignant transformation. DOK cell line is a dysplasitc oral keratinocyte derived from a heavy smoker with OSCC. The differentially expressed genes between DOK and normal human oral keratinocytes (HOK) may provide important information about OSCC carcinogenesis mediated by cigarette smoking.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from DOK and HOK cells followed by gene expression microarray analysis.
