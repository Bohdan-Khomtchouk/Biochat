TITLE
Gene expression profiling of pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 induced by PAR-2 AP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trypsin and coagulant factors, plays broad spectrum of physiological and pathological roles especially in cancer development. In this study, we used PAR-2 activating peptide to mimic the action of trypsin to trigger PAR-2 signaling pathway and effects of PAR-2 activation on gene expression in human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 investigated by microarray analysis. Through DAVID bioinformatic resources, we observed that activated PAR-2-mediated genes are summarized to two different pathways, renal cell carcinoma and NFkB pathway. In renal cell carcinoma pathway, activated PAR-2 dysregulated hypoxia-inducible factors and its target genes, including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). In addition, activated PAR-2 induced MAPK signaling and transcriptional factors, such as JUN, MAP2K1 and ETS1. The regulation of these genes by PAR-2 assumed that PAR-2 signaling was associated with cancer progression. On the other hand, activated PAR-2 upregulated interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) related with NFkB activation, which indicated that PAR-2 signaling may cause cancer-related inflammation. In conclusion, PAR-2 may be a factor to regulate cancer progression and inflammation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control cells vs PAR-2 AP-treated cells.
