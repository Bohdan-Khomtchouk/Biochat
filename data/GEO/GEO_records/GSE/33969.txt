TITLE
Differential miroRNA expression in round spermatids of GRTH null mice compared to wild type.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles for round spermatids of wild type and GRTH knock-out mice were determined by Rodent TaqMan® Low Density miRNA Arrays A v2.0 (TLDA, Applied Biosystem).

DESIGN
Purified round spermatids were prepared from the testis of wild type and GRTH null mice (C57BL/6 strain).  Equal amount of total RNA from 20 mice (wild type or GRTH KO)  was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
