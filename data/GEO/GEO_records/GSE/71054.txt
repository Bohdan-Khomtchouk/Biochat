TITLE
A comprehensive 30K microarray platform to test transcriptomic responses in Biomphalaria glabrata

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Biomphalaria snail (whole body tissues) comparing BS90 strain untreated with sterile wounding and septic injury using a new comprehensive microarray platform design. Goal was to compare responses to differen immune challenges within one strain.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment one strain untreated vs. injury vs. septic injury, Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 3 injured replicates, 2 septic injury replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL20708 Agilent-030447 UNMBIOCETI Biomphalaria glabrata 30K v1.0
