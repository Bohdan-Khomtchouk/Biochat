TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of yeast cells lacking either the protein phosphatase Ptc6 or Ptc1 and Ptc6, members of the 2C family of protein phosphatases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Type 2C protein phosphatases are encoded in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by several related genes (PTC1-7). To gain insight into the functions attributable to a specific member of this gene family, we have investigated the transcriptional profile of ptc6 mutants under standard growth conditions. We have found that lack of Ptc6 did not alter the transcriptional profile when cells were in log phase in YPD medium. Only one gene, involved in iron transport (FIT3), in addition to PTC6 itself, was considered down-regulated. We also identified the transcriptional changes induced by the simultaneous lack of Ptc1 and Ptc6 proteins.

DESIGN
* In a first set of experiments we compared the expression profile of ptc6 mutant cells with that of wt cells. We performed 2 biological replicates, and for each experiment we performed two chips (dye swap). Overall we analyzed 4 chips: Biological replicate 1: GSM937247, GSM937248 Biological replicate 2: GSM937251, GSM937252 * In the second set of data we compared the expression profile of ptc1ptc6 double mutant cells with that of wt cells. We performed 2 biological replicates, and for each experiment we performed two chips (dye swap). Overall we analyzed 4 chips: Biological replicate 1: GSM937312, GSM937316 Biological replicate 2: GSM937319, GSM937320
