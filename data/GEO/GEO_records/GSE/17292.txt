SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_725 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: Analysis of copy number variation across modENCODE Drosophila cell line by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).  We observe numerous copy number variations for the different cell lines, with each cell line having a distinct ploidy signature. Keywords: CGH For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
