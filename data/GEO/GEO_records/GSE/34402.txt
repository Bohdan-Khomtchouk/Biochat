TITLE
Transcriptional analyses of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus Paxillus involutus during growth on various lignocellulose soil substrates

ORGANISM
Paxillus involutus

SUMMARY
In this study, examinations were performed on how the ECM fungus Paxillus involutus degrade complex, plant and litter material by using elemental analyses, FTIR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy together with microarray analyses screening 12,214 gene models, derived from 454 sequenced cDNA libraries.

DESIGN
A 18-subarray  study (data from 18 subarrays collected from two 12-plex microarrays (IDs 468335 and 468400) using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type glass-bead cultures after amendments of various soil-derived substrates.
