TITLE
Expression data from plant tissues during incompatible interaction between the rice host and its major pest, the Asian rice gall midge

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
During an incompatible or compatible interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and the Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae), a lot of genetic reprogamming occurs in the plant host We used microarray to know the changes occuring in the resistant host (indica rice variety RP2068-18-3-5) when challenged by avirulent biotype of gall midge (GMB 1).  During this incompatible interaction the resistance in the host is manifested by a hypersenstive response. Using microarray data, we identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Tissues from the stem region (feeding site of insect larvae) of the plants that were exposed to gall midge, were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetric microarrays. For control, tissues were taken from the corresponding region of plants that were not exposed to gall midge.
