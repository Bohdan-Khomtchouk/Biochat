TITLE
Transcriptome of Irradiated Microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole brain irradiation remains important in the management of brain tumors. Although necessary for improving survival outcomes, cranial irradiation also results in cognitive decline in long-term survivors. A chronic inflammatory state characterized by microglial activation has been implicated in radiation-induced brain injury, and here we present a comprehensive transcriptional profile of irradiated microglia. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate CD11b+ microglia from the hippocampi of C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice 1 month after 10Gy cranial irradiation. Affymetrix gene expression profiles were evaluated using linear modeling and rank product analyses. A conserved signature of irradiation was identified across strains, and gene set enrichment analysis was employed to functionally compare our signature to publically available mouse and human datasets.

DESIGN
FACS-sorted microglia samples from three mice were analyzed from each of four groups: sham irradiated C57BL/6 mice, 10 Gy irradiated C57BL/6 mice, sham irradiated Balb/c mice, 10 Gy irradiated Balb/c mice (12 total samples analyzed). All mice were analyzed 1 month after sham or 10 Gy irradiation.
