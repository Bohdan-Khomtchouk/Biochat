TITLE
The effects of exogenous RNAs on transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the potential functions of exogenous RNAs in circulation, we transfected several synthetic, double-stranded mature microRNA-like molecules selected from observed exogenous miRNA sequences and some highly abundant exogenous sequences (bacterial rRNAs) that have potential to form pre-miRNA-like secondary structures into a mouse, Dicer-deficient, fibroblast cell line. This provides a good tool for studying the function of miRNAs. By introducing individual miRNA into these cells and avoiding multiple interactions of microRNA and mRNA (Wang et al in preparation) it is possible to interrogate the cells for mRNA levels, which are informative as to specific miRNA function.
