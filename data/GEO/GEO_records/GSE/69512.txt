TITLE
Tetraspanin 3 is Required for the Development and Propagation of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Msi2 is a critical regulatior of myeoid leukemia, and these data identify genes that are changed following Msi2 deletion in bcCML and de novo AML stem cells.

DESIGN
Leukemic stem cells were extracted from wild-type and Msi2 mutant MLL-AF9 driven AML and BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 driven bcCML, in triplicate. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. The mouse strain was a genetic trap Msi2 mutant made by Center for Animal Resources and Development (CARD) of Kumamoto University. They call their strain B6;CB-Msi2Gt(pU-21T)2Imeg, see also
