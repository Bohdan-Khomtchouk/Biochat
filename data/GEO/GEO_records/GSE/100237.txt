TITLE
Gene expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (Ppard)-overexpressing RAW 264.7 macrophages treated vehicle, GW501516 or interleukin-4 (Il-4)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in GW501516 (a Ppard ligand) or Il-4 treated Ppard-overexpressing RAW 264.7 macrophages as compared to vehicle. Alternative activation of adipose tissue resident macrophages inhibits obesity-induced metabolic inflammation. In the current study we profile genes regulated by two M2 inducers, Il-4 or Ppard agonists and find that alternative activation promotes the cell survival program, while inhibiting that of inflammation-related cell death.

DESIGN
9 samples; 3 treatments in triplicate (Ppard-overexpressing RAW 264.7 cells are treated with vehicle, GW501516 or Il-4 overnight in triplicatet).
