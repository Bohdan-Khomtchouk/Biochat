TITLE
MicroRNAs are involved in the regulation of ovary development in the pathogenic blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
We report on the small RNA profiles of Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) miRNAs using small RNA deep sequencing in the key stages of male-female pairing, gametogenesis, and egg production.

DESIGN
Examination of different miRNAs between males and females in Schistosoma japonicum

PLATFORM
