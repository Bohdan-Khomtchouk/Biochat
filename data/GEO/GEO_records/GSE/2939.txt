TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of HHV-6 infeceted T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immune response to viral infection represents complex network of dynamic gene and protein interactions. We present here the dynamic gene network of host immune response during human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) infection in a adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cell line. Using a pathway-focused oligonucleotide DNA microarray, we found a possible association between chemokines genes regulating Th1/Th2 balance and genes regulating T-cell proliferation during HHV-6B infection. Keywords: Time course experiment
