TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of HHV-6 infeceted T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immune response to viral infection represents complex network of dynamic gene and protein interactions. We present here the dynamic gene network of host immune response during human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) infection in a adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cell line. Using a pathway-focused oligonucleotide DNA microarray, we found a possible association between chemokines genes regulating Th1/Th2 balance and genes regulating T-cell proliferation during HHV-6B infection. Keywords: Time course experiment

DESIGN
This study aimed to determine genes regulating immune response during viral infection using an in vitro model system. We utilized a CD4+ T cell line which shows an efficient propagation of HHV-6B, as a model of acute infection of HHV-6B as well as that of persistent infection We explored a pathway-focused oligonucleotide DNA microarray that contains genes closely related with inflammatory responses.
