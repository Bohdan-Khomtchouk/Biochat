TITLE
Thrombospondin-1: A Pro-Atherosclerotic Protein Augmented by Hyperglycemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diabetes is associated with a more aggressive form of atherosclerosis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein, is an acute phase reactant that induces vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) migration and proliferation in areas of vascular injury, and is also upregulated in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia amplifies the expression of genes induced by TSP-1 in VSMCs. Human aortic VSMCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1% antibiotics, cells were used between passages three and five. VSMCs were preincubated in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS with 5 mM glucose (normoglycemia), 25 mM glucose (hyperglycemia), 25 mM mannose (osmotic control), TSP-1 (20µg/mL), 25 mM glucose + TSP-1 (20µg/mL) or 25 mM mannose + TSP-1 (20µg/mL). Data analysis revealed that TSP-1 stimulates gene expression relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetic vascular disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from replicate cultures of human aortic VSMCs and microarray analysis performed for a total of 18 samples (3 replicates per condition) using the Human Gene Array ST.
