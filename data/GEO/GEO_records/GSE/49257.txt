TITLE
The transcriptome of erythromycin-resistant Campylobacter jejuni strain selected from NCTC 11168

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Campylobacter, a major foodborne pathogen, is increasingly resistant to macrolide antibibotics. Previous findings suggested that development of macrolide resistance in Campylobacter requires a multi-step process, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the process are not known. In our study, erythromycin-resistant C. jejuni mutant (R) was selected in vitro by stepwise exposure of C. jejuni NCTC11168(S) to increasing concentrations of erythromycin.The resistant were subjected to microarray and the the global transcriptional profile was analyzed. In this series, DNA microarray was used to compare the gene expression profiles of the macrolide-resistant strain with its parent wild-type strain NCTC11168. A large number of gene showed significant changes in R. The up-regulated genes in the resistant strains are involved in miscellaneous periplasmic proteins, efflux protein and putative aminotransferase, while the majority of the down-regulated genes are involved in electron transport, lipoprotein, heat shock protein and unknown function proteins. The over-expression of efflux pump and periplasmic protein was involved in the development of resistance to macrolide in C. jejuni.

DESIGN
An eight chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate resistant-type cultures of Erythrocin-resistant Campylobacter jejuni NCTC111168 (R) and four separate cultures of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC111168 (S). Each chip measures the expression level of 1634 genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168.
