TITLE
Transgenerational Gene Expression Changes Caused by Exposing Fetal Germ Cells to Endocrine Disruptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We treated gestating female mice with vinclozolin (VZ), bisphenol A (BPA), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), or control oil, during the time when the prospermatogonia of the exposed fetus undergo global de novo DNA methylation. Using genome-wide assays we detected changes in transcription and DNA methylation, respectively, in fetal prospermatogonia. Our results suggest that EDs exert direct epigenetic effects in the exposed fetal germ cells, but the germline corrects against deleterious effects in the subsequent generation.

DESIGN
Pregnant mice were administered endocrine distruptors (VZ at 100 mg/kg/day, DEHP at 750 mg/kg/day, and BPA at 0.2 mg/kg/day) startin g at 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) and tissue samples were collected at 17.5 dpc.
