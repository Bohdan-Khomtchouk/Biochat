TITLE
Transcriptional and functional profiling of human intestinal dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This file contains gene microarray data from subsets of human intestinal dendritic cells, as defined by their expression of CD103 and Sirpa. This will allow for better understanding of human intestinal DC subsets in general and will facilitate translation from findings in the mouse.

DESIGN
We analyzed transcript expression data from small intestine DC subsets isolated from de-identified human subject undergoing bariatric surgery.
