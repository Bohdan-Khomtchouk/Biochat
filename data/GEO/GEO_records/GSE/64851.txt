TITLE
long non-coding RNA expression profiles in Paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, using the next generation transcriptome sequencing and microarray analysis, we profiled expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a mouse model of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We identified 513 up-regulated and 204 down-regulated lncRNAs (fold-change ≥5.0) when comparing fibrotic to normal lung tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR, Gene Ontology analysis, Pathway analysis and Bioinformatics analysis were performed for further research. Furthermore, we predicted and verified the target genes of two up-regulated lncRNAs, uc.77 and 2700086A05Rik, as Zeb2 and Hoxa3 respectively, both of which are important regulators of EMT.

DESIGN
BALB/c mice (7-8 weeks, male, 19.8 g±0.63 g) were provided by Experimental Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University, China. A total of 20 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=10 in each group): the normal control and pulmonary fibrosis model group. Mice in the model group were administered 10mg/kg paraquat (SIGMA Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in sterile saline via intraperitoneal injection (once per day for 5 days). The normal control group were administered an equal volume of saline at the same time. Lung tissues were harvested on the 12st day following the first treatment. The motality of paraquat group was 70%. Three lung tissues from each group were pick up and mixed to prepare for the RNA extraction and the following microarray analysis.
