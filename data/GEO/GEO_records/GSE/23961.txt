TITLE
Stress response regulators identified through genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the (p)ppGpp-dependent response in Rhizobium etli

ORGANISM
Rhizobium etli CFN 42

SUMMARY
The impact on gene expression by the alarmone (p)ppGpp during growth and non-growth was determined by comparing the transcriptome of R. etli CFN42 wild type and rel mutant. This allowed us to better understand the pleiotropic stress phenotype of the rel mutant as well as identifying specific (p)ppGpp-dependent stress regulators.

DESIGN
In order to study expression, R. etli CFN42 wild type and rel mutant was grown at 30ËšC in acid minimal salts medium supplied with 10 mM NH4Cl and 10 mM succinate while monitoring the optical density (OD) of the culture. Samples were taken at OD600 = 0.3, 0.7 and 6 hours after reaching the maximum OD, representing early/late exponential and stationary phase, respectively.
