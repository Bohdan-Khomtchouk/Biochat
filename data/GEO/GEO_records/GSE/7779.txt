TITLE
Optimization and Clinical Validation of a Pathogen Detection Microarray

ORGANISM
Viruses ; Dengue virus 1 ; SARS coronavirus

SUMMARY
This series includes microarrays from 36 patient samples and 2 cell-culture controls, used to optimize and validate the pathogen detection microarray (Wong, et. al. 2007) Keywords: viral pathogen detection

DESIGN
The microarray contains tiling probes to 35 viruses, and was used to detect the viruses present in 36 patient samples.  Viruses were reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified using either primer A1 or AES-optimized primer A2 as described (Wong , et. al. 2007).  Those samples which were amplified using primer A2 are labelled with " A2 " in the sample title.  Patient samples #122 and #412 were hybridized on multiple arrays (technical replicates).  The SARS and Dengue samples were amplified using virus-specific primers as described in Wong, et al. 2007.
