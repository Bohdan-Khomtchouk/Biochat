SUMMARY
Quantitative Analysis of cortical transcriptomes through Next Generation Sequencing (RNA-Seq) from wild-type mice, wild-type mice treated with IL1b (200 ng/mouse, 14h), IL-1R8-/-  mice and IL-1R8-/- mice treated with IL1b antagonist Anakinra (25 mg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days, i.p. administration). mRNA profiles of cortical tissue from adult wild-type mice, wild-type mice treated with IL1b (200 ng/kg, 14h), IL-1R8-/- mice (Garlanda et al., 2004), and IL-1R8-/- mice treated with Anakinra (25 mg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days, i.p. administration) were generated by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) using Illumina HiSeq 2500 apparatus in paired-end configuration (2x125bp). Each condition was assessed in triplicate (12 mRNA-seq libraries) and, to reduce biological variability, each mRNA library was generated from pooled total RNA isolated from cortical tissue of 3 individual mice. In total, 9 mice per condition were used. Libraries were stranded and multiplexed. To increase sequencing depth, libraries were sequenced in two different lanes. All the libraries were loaded in each of the two lanes. Quality control of the raw data was performed with FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). Libraries were trimmed for adapter removal using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) and mapped to reference genome (Ensembl GRCm38) using TopHat2 (Kim et al., 2013) and Bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2009). Library sizes of primary mapped reads were between 70 and 96 million reads. Samtools was used to manipulate BAM files (Li et al., 2009). For calling of differentially expressed genes (DEG), mapped reads were counted with HTSeq v0.6.1 (Anders et al., 2014) and count tables were analysed using DeSeq2 v1.10.1 R-package (Love et al., 2014) with a design of one factor with four levels (“wild-type”, “wild-type + IL1”, “IL-1R8-/-”, “IL-1R8-/- + Anakinra " ), and differences between groups were tested using contrasts for wild-type + IL1b versus wild-type; IL-1R8-/- versus wild-type; IL-1R8-/- + Kineret versus wild-type. For consideration of differentially regulated genes between conditions, we used adjusted p-value < 0.1 or adjusted p-value < 0.05 as indicated in the manuscript.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles in adult mouse cerebral cortex of wild type (WT), WT mice treated with IL1b (200 ng/kg, 14h), IL-1R8-/- mice, and IL-1R8-/- mice treated with IL1b antagonist Anakinra (25 mg/kg per day for 3 consecutive days, i.p. administration) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Each sample was prepared by pooling cortical tissue from 3 idenpendent mice.
