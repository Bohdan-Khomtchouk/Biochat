TITLE
Transcriptional profile (mRNA and sRNA) of Clostridium acetobutylicum to metabolite stress, butanol and butyrate

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
The transcription profile of C. acetobutylicum to two major metabolite stress, butanol and butyric acid, was comprehensively investigated at three different concentrations of each metabolite and at four different time points (15, 30, 60 and 75 min post stress). All experiments were performed in 3 parallel biological replicates and the RNA extraction was perfomed in a manner to retain the small RNAs and hence, investigate their role and expression under stress.

DESIGN
Genome-wide small RNA and mRNA profiling was done by Illumina TruSeq sample preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.Â  Please note that all the samples were analyzed for both mRNAs and smallRNAs. We used the miRNeasy Kit from Qiagen to ensure the extraction of the low molecular weight small RNA during the extraction of the total RNA and hence, mRNAs and sRNAs were analyzed together in the total RNA-seq.
