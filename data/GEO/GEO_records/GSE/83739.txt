TITLE
Investigation of tolvaptan induced liver damage using expression data of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluate tolvaptan induced liver injury using 8-10 weeks old, male mice. We used microarray to study gene expression changes in mouse liver after tolvaptan treatment.

DESIGN
We examined liver transcriptome profiles from 354 mice (175 tolvaptan-treated, 179 vehicle-treated) after 24 hours of tolvaptan treatment.

PLATFORM
