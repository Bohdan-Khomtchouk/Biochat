TITLE
Microarray studies of pqqE disruption mutant vs wild type

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans

SUMMARY
This bacterial genome encodes pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) synthase enzyme required for the synthesis of PQQ in bacteria. The gene pqqE encoding PQQ synthase was annotated in Deinococcus radiodurans R1 genome and synthesis of PQQ was shown in this bacterium. PQQ roles as an antioxidant and as an inducer of protein kinase in bacterial system was shown. The pqqE disuption mutant showed several folds decrease in gamma radiation tolerance of wild type cells and strong impairment of DSB repair. Homology search analysis of PQQ binding domains showed the presence of multiple PQQ binding domains in proteins encoded by five uncharacterized ORFs of this bacterial genome. Many of these proteins are having STK domain of proteins kinases. The effect of pqqE mutation on gene expression under normal and post irradiation conditions was monitored by transcriptome analysis of mutant and compared with wild type cells.
