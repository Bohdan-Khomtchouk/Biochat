TITLE
Expression data from lung of mice bearing mutations of FGFR3 and FGFR4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of newborn lung tissue revealed few changes in compound FGFR3/FGFR4 deficient mice, consistent with their normal lung morphology at birth, suggesting the sequence of events leading to the phenotype initiates after birth in this model. Profiling of 4 week-old lung tissues revealed an induction of genes related to elastic fiber assembly in compound mutants.

DESIGN
Lung RNA isolated from three animals of each genotype-age group were pooled for each Affymetrix chip (n=3 chips for each, except n=2 for wild type at 4 weeks.
