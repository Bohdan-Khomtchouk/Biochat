TITLE
Expression data from SGBS human cells before and after 24 hours of stimulation with differentiation cocktail, with or without Scrambled (Scr) or Tenomodulin (TNMD) siRNA to knockdown the genes of interest.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a screen for upregulated adipocyte genes in insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive subjects matched for BMI, we identified the type II transmembrane protein tenomodulin (TNMD), previously implicated in glucose tolerance in gene association studies. TNMD expression was greatly increased in human preadipocytes during differentiation, while silencing TNMD blocked adipogenic gene induction and adipogenesis. We used microarrays to identify genes of interest that are differentially expressed after the addition of siRNA to tenomodulin or scrambled siRNA, in both preadipocytes and partially differentiated adipocytes.

DESIGN
SGBS preadipocytes were treated with scrambled or siTNMD. Cells either were kept undifferentiated or stimulated for 24 hours with differentiation cocktail. Cells were prepared with this protocol on three different occasions and total RNA was isolated to provide three biological replicates per sample.
