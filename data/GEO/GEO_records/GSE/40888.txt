TITLE
Gene expression data from PBMCs human childhood study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reveal differentially regulated genes and cellular pathways within allergic and non-allergic asthmatic children compared to healthy controls

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from allergic asthmatics (n=14), non-allergic asthmatics (n=8) and healthy controls (n=14) and kept with anti-CD3/CD28 (CD328), LpA or without stimulation (M).
