TITLE
VCAM1 promotes outbreak from dormant bone metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A weakly bone metastatic variant of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, SCP6, gave rise to highly bone metastatic sublines (PD1, PD2A-E) after long time dormancy in vivo. These cell lines were subjected to microarray analysis with data drawn from previous studies (Kang et al., 2003; Minn et al. 2005; Lu and Kang 2009; Lu and Kang 2010). Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
12 cell lines (parental MDA-MB-231 with biological repeats; weakly bone metastasis variants: SCP3, SCP4 and SCP6; post-dormancy sublines of SCP6: PD1, PD2A, PD2B, PD2C, PD2D, PD2E and PD2R) were cultured and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis. Data were analysed with Genespring software.
