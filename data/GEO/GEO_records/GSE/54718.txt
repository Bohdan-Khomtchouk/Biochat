TITLE
Characterization of 5-aminolevulinic acid effects on radiotherapy using mouse tumor model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B16-BL6 mouse melanoma that had been maintained in C57BL/6J mice were used to evaluate the 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) effects on radiotherapy. Mice were divided into 4 groups after implantation of B16-BL6 cells; (1) control group; (2) ALA treatment; (3) Xray treatment; (4) ALA and Xray treatment.

DESIGN
B16-BL6 mouse melanoma tumor gene expressions in 4 groups were measured after fractionated doses of radiation with local administration of 50mg/kg ALA prior to fractional irradiation.
