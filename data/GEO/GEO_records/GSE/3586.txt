TITLE
Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Non Failing Septal Biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cause of heart failure and a leading cause of cardiac transplantation in western countries. The robust predictive expression profile of cardiomyopathic and NF hearts as well as the functional classification can help to identify promising candidates for DCM and may improve the early diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
This series includes dual channel hybridizations of 28 independent heart biopsy samples on Unigene3.1 cDNA Arrays. The 28 septal myocardial tissue samples were collected from 13 DCM hearts at the time of transplantation and 15 NF donor hearts which were not transplanted because of palpable coronary calcifications. For every independent sample, two technical replicates were performed and further processed as mean values.
