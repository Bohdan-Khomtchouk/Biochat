TITLE
Expression data for 52 microsatellite stable (MSS) primary tumors from patients with proximal colon cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from surgically resected tumor specimens from patients with proximal colon cancer. The expression profiles were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array version 2. APC gene mutation status was determined using Sanger sequencing. A classifier for APC mutation status was trained using these expression data.

DESIGN
52 microsatellite stable (MSS) proximal colon cancers samples were analyzed. 17 samples were APC wild-type and 35 had APC protein-truncating mutations.
