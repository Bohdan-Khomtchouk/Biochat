TITLE
Determination of the Lef1 regulated tanscriptome in differentiating ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lef1 is a critical transducer of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway that is essential for mesoderm differentiation in vertebrate embryos. We established a doxycycline inducible ES cell line to over-express Flag-tagged Lef1 in differentiating ES cells which have the capacity to form mesoderm cells in vitro. The goal of this study was to identify the genes/gene networks regulated by Lef1 to understand how it regulates mesoderm differentiation and to establish the Lef1-regulated, Wnt/beta-catenin transcriptome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from ES cells after 3 days of differentiating following Lef1 over-expression from day 2 to 3. We compared the transcriptome of differentially expressed genes in untreated and doxycycline treated ES cells to identify Lef1 regulated genes.
