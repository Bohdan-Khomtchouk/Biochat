TITLE
Negative FACS sorted EC neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Embryo Cell Culture samples allowed to differentiate 3-5 days in culture.  Samples express a GFP reporter in cholinergic neurons (7.4 kb ChaGal4:UAS-GFP) or an RFP reporter (2.1 kb Gad1-RFP) in glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 expressing Neurons.  This  group of samples contains the negatively sorted FACS fractions (2 Cha and 2 Gad negative samples). Keywords: other
