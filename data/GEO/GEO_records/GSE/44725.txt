TITLE
CGH: HiPro_v_LoPro

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Two soybean near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing in seed protein content were genotyped to determine differential genetic introgressions from the wild relative Glycine soja. The CGH comparison reveals loci that are differentially introgressed between the two lines.

DESIGN
Comparison of HiPro (LD0-15154) and LoPro (LD0-15146) soybean NILs; the reported values show the log2 ratio of the normalized HiPro hybridization signal (Cy3) over the  normalized LoPro hybridization signal (Cy5)

PLATFORM
GPL11198 NimbleGen Soybean 700K CGH array (design 091113_Gmax_RS_CGH_HX3)
