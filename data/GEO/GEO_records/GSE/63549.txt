TITLE
Lentiviral expression of MiR-31 in CD8 T-cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: identify genes regulated by expression of miR-31 in primary mouse CD8 T-cells by exogenously expressing pre-miR-31 from the Plko.3g lentiviral vector. Cells infected with empty Plko.3g vectors were used as controls for infection.

DESIGN
Control vector and miR-31 transduced CD8 T-cells with 4 independent biological replicates/condition
