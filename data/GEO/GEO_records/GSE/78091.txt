TITLE
microRNA expression profiling  in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA array, we screened 3100 microRNAs abundant in the human gastric cancer and Adjacent normal gastric mucosa  tissues, and the function of differentially expressed microRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics. The enrichment results indicated that these microRNAs perhaps participated in the occurrence and development process of gastric cancer.
