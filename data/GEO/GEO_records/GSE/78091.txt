TITLE
microRNA expression profiling  in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRCURY LNA™ microRNA array, we screened 3100 microRNAs abundant in the human gastric cancer and Adjacent normal gastric mucosa  tissues, and the function of differentially expressed microRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics. The enrichment results indicated that these microRNAs perhaps participated in the occurrence and development process of gastric cancer.

DESIGN
In this study, three cases of  gastric cancer were used to acquire the microRNA expression profiling, and qPCR was employed to confirm the results of microRNA chip. The function of the differentially expressed microRNA were analyzed by bioinformatic methods. Finally,compared with the adjacent mormal moucosa tissues，the expression of  99 microRNAs  were up regulated,and 21 microRNAS were down regulated in gastric cancer.qPCR results showed an expression pattern consistent with that of the chip analysis.
