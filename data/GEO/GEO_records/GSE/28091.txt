TITLE
Expression profiles of mouse glioma-initiating cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify factors involved in glioma-initiating cells (GICs), we compared gene expressions between GIC-like cells and non-GICs.

DESIGN
p53-deficient Neural stem cells (NSCs), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and astrocytes (ASTs) were transfected with pCMS-EGFP-HRasL61 and pBabe-neo by electroporation and cultured in 0.5 mg/ml neomycin. The GFP-positive stable NSCs (NSCL61s), OPCs (OPCL61s) and ASTs (ASTL61s) were purified by flow cytometry. Total RNA was prepared using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and used for the expression analysis.ã€€
