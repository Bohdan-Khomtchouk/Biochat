TITLE
Transcript profiling in Paoenia ostii during chilling induced endo-dormancy release

ORGANISM
Paeonia ostii

SUMMARY
To better understanding the genetic and physiological changes behind the dormancy process in tree peony, we performed customized cDNA microarray to investigate gene expression profiling in tree peony ‘Feng Dan Bai’ buds during chilling induced dormancy release. Endo-dormant tree peony plants were exposed to 0-4°C from 5 November to 30 December 2009 in Qingdao, Shandong, China. Buds were collected after 0 d, 6 d, 12 d, 15 d, 18 d and 24 d chilling endured. DNA microarrays were customized using Agilent eArray 5.0 program, containing spots with 14,957 gene-specific 60-mer oligonucleotides representing 14,957 non abundant ESTs obtained from 454 sequencing normalized cDNA of tree peony buds during chilling duration (TSA, 65,217). Total 3,174 significantly differentially-expressed genes (P < 0.05) were observed through endo-dormancy release, and the number of up-regulated (1,611) and that of down-regulated (1,563) was almost same. Expression of differentially-expressed genes associated with GA biosynthesis and signaling, cell growth and development was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, which displayed similar trends pattern in expression.

DESIGN
Transcript profiling of tree peony was measured during chilling (0-4°C) induced dormancy release. Mixed buds, three buds for each individual, were collected after 0, 6, 12, 15, 18 (endo-dormancy release), 24 days (eco-dormancy) chilling requirement fulfilling. Three replications (3 plants/ replication) were harvested between November and December.
