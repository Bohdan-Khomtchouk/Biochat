TITLE
Gene expression in E13.5 mouse lower molar whole tooth germ and oral tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were generated from embryonic day 13.5 CD-1 mouse mandibular first molars whole tooth and non-tooth non-bone oral tissue.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates from embryonic day 13.5 CD-1 mice were generated from pooled tissues across multiple mice. The tooth germ and non-tooth oral tissues were paired from the same embryos.
