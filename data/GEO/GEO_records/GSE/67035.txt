TITLE
Profiling gene expression in M. tuberculosis under different in vitro conditions.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
This RNA-Seq study of gene expression in M. tuberculosis was done as part of the FLUTE project (NIH grant U19-AI107774, Eric Rubin, program director).

DESIGN
There are 3 replicates each for Mtb H37Rv grown under the following conditions: 0.1% butyrate, 0.4% glucose, butyrate+glucose, low iron, acidic conditions, and several RIF-resistant mutants of Beijing strain HN878 with different mutations in RpoB.
