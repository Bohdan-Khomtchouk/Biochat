TITLE
Rice whole transcriptome differences at two temperature levels surveyed by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
We report that TOG1 coordinates global changes of gene expression upon high temperature to support rice thermotolerant growth. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes in rice seedlings grown at 25 ℃ and 30 ℃ and found that when temperature increases, wild-type dramatically adjusts the expression level of hundreds of genes in GO terms polysaccharide metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, glucan metabolic process, carbon fixation, response to stimulus and organic substance metabolic process required for growth. However, in a tog1 mutant, the differentially expressed genes in response to the temperature increase significantly enriched in GO terms response to stimulus, response to oxidative stress and response to stress, whereas the coordination of primary metabolic processes and carbon fixation were largely impaired or undetectable.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed mRNA profiles of 22-day-old wild type (WT) and tog1 rice upon a temperature difference were generated by deep sequencing
