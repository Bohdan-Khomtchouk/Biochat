TITLE
Systems approach identifies HIPK2 as a critical regulator of kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used an integrated computational/experimental systems biology approach to identify upstream protein kinases that regulate gene expression changes in kidneys of HIV-1 transgenic mice (Tg26), which have significant tubulo-interstitial fibrosis (TIF) and glomerulosclerosis (GS). We identified the homeo-domain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) as a key regulator of TIF and GS. HIPK2 was upregulated in kidneys of Tg26 and patients with various kidney diseases. HIV infection increased the protein level of HIPK2 by promoting oxidative stress, which inhibited Siah1-mediated proteasomal degradation of HIPK2. The data contain two sets: kidney corticies from WT and Tg26 mice and HEK293 transfected with HIPK2, HIPK2-DN and wild type.

DESIGN
Gene expression comparison between kidney cortecies of Tg26 HIV mouse model and wild type. Gene expression comparison between 293 HEK cells with HIPK-DN, HIPK-KO and normal.
