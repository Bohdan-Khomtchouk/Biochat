TITLE
Comparative molecular assessment of implant adherent cells in smokers and non-smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: to Identify the effect of surface texture on the modulation of gene transcription of implant adherent cells as influenced by the smoking habits of the subjects.

DESIGN
Eighty four cp titanium implants with surface topographies exhibiting nanoscale features (Osseospeed-OS) and microrough surface without nanoscale features (TiOblast-TiO) were placed in the alveolar bone of 11 systemically healthy subjects and 10 smoking subjects and subsequently harvested at 3 and 7 days after placement. Total RNA was isolated from cells adherent to retrieved implants. A whole genome microarray using the Affymetrix Human gene 1.1 ST Array  was used to describe the gene expression profiles that were differentially regulated by the implant surfaces.
