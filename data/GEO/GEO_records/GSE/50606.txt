TITLE
Identification of genes expressed with temporal-spatial restriction to developing cerebellar neuron precursors by a functional genomic approach perspective of human cancers.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Swiss-Webster B mouse postnatal day 4-5 primary cerebellar culture (pooled from litter mates) treated with sonic hedgehog (Shh), controls (veh), growth arrested (arrest), cycloheximide (cyc) for 1, 3 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Different treatment conditions with biological replicates. Mouse cerebellar granule cell neuron precursors under different treatment conditions.
