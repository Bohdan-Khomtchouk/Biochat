TITLE
Expression data from adult Drosophila females [normoxia]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-fat diet (HFD) in normoxia causes a worsened phenotype in adult female flies compared to regular diet (RD). We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional changes occuring on a HFD compared to RD in normoxia.

DESIGN
Adult female Drosophila were collected at d3-5 and placed on RD or HFD and in normoxia for 1 week. Following this week,flies were immediately frozen on dry ice, RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
