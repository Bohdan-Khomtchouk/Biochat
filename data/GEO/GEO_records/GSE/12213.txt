TITLE
Human cholangiocarcinoma cells treated with Clonorchis sinensis excretory-secretory products.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clonorchiasis is associated with bile duct malignancy and the subsequent development of cholangiocarcinoma. Although this is likely caused by adult Clonorchis sinensis and its excretory-secretory products (ESP), the precise molecular mechanisms remain obscure. To evaluate the effect of C. sinensis infection on differential gene expression in host hepatocytes, we used cDNA microarrays in human cholangiocarcinoma cells through the mimicking of C. sinensis infestation, and analyzed differential mRNA expression patterns of host cells. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Metacercariae of C. sinensis were obtained from P. parva and then it infected into albino rabbits. Adult worms were collected from infected rabbits, and incubated in PBS. The supernatant was centrifuged and filtered with syringe-driven filter. HuCCT1 cell were treated with prepared ESP in order to profile the differentially expressed genes at five time points: 0 (T01), 1(T02), 3(T03), 9(T04), and 24(T05) hours.
