TITLE
Global phenotypic and genomic comparison of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to phenotype a collection of 27 S. cerevisiae commercial wine strains growing within temperatures (4-45ºC) in both minimal media (SD) and synthetic must (SM) and, taking into account µmax value, to select two strains with divergent phenotype in their capacity to grow at low temperature. To confirm this differential phenotype, we design a competition between both strains during wine fermentations. As expected, at low temperature fermentation, the strain showing a good performance out-competes to the strain growing badly in cold. Finally we aimed to decipher the molecular basis underlying this divergent phenotype by analyzing the genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic differences between both strains at low temperature (15ºC) and optimum temperature (28ºC).

DESIGN
Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with divergent phenotype in their capacity to grow and ferment at low temperature were analyzed (P5 strain as a candidate with a good performance in fermentations at low temperature (15ºC) and P24 as a candidate with a worse behavior at low temperature). All experiments were performed using triplicates arrays, and Cy5-dCTP and Cy3-dCTP dye-swap assays were performed to reduce dye-specific bias.
