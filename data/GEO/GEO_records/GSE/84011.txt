TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of  oligodendrocytes treated with demyelinating compound lysolecithin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed a series of ChIP-Seq analysis, and demonstrated that Olig2 and its downstream target Gpr17 were the key factors functioning in demyelination process. During demyelination, Olig2 was significantly up-regulated, and Gpr17 was the top ranking Olig2 transcriptional target.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis to examine the H3K27Ac and Olig2 recruitment to genome in oligdendrocytes
