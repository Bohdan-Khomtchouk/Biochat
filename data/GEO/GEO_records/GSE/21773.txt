TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of RNA Pol-II promoter usage in mouse tissues by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report active promoters in five adult mouse tissues - brain, kidney, liver, lung and spleen using ChIP-Seq aganist RNAP-II antibody. We identified 38,639 active RNAP-II transcribed promoters, including 12,270 novel promoters. Of these, 6384 promoters are tissue specific which are CpG poor and contain multiple core promoter elements. By identifying the RNAP-II bound promoter(s) we found that 37% of the protein coding genes use alternative promoters in the five mouse tissues. Roughly 34% of the novel promoters are loacted in CpG-islands suggesting that novel promoters are mostly tissue specific.
