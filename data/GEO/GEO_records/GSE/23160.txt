TITLE
Global transcriptomic profiling of ischemic/reperfusion injury in an in vivo wild-type mouse model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ischemic stroke triggers severe focal hypoperfusion accompanied with deprivation of oxygen and glucose to the cerebral tissue, together with loss of ATP, depolorization of neurons, elevated extracellular potassium concentration, and subsequently leads to excitotoxicity as well as increased oxidative stress promoting microvascular injury, blood-brain-barrier deregulation, post-ischemic inflammation and eventually the consequential neurological deficit. Although reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue is critical for restoring normal function, it can paradoxically result in secondary damage, called ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on the right striatum and cortex (corresponded to infarct area) of post-I/R injured brain tissues of wild-type (WT-MCAO) using Illumina mouse Ref8 V2 genechips. Suture-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced for 2h followed by reperfusion, with tissue extraction taking place 2h, 8h and 24h post-reperfusion (n=4 respectively). Sham controls were included in this study too (n=4 respectively).
