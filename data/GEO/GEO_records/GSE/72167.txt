TITLE
The gene expression changes by CID 70698683

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CID 70698683 is a novel broad-spectrum antiviral compound. To understand the broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism, the cellular gene expression changes by the treatment of CID70698683 was measured.

DESIGN
HEp-2 cells grown in 6-well plates were treated with 5 microM of CID 70698683 for overnight and the cellular RNA was extracted (Treatment group). For control, DMSO was used instead of CID 70698683 (final concentration of 0.25%). Three replicates per group used.
