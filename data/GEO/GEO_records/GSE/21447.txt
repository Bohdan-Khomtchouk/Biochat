TITLE
A global expression switch marks pachytene initiation during mouse male meiosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male spermatogenesis is an essential and complex developmental process with the purpose to gain totipotency and allow a whole new organism to develop upon fertilization. While single-gene based studies have provided insights into the mechanisms at work, global profiling is clearly required to deconvolute these processes. Here, by isolating highly enriched mouse meiotic cell populations, we report a comprehensive gene expression map of mammalian meiosis. Our data reveal in unique details the dynamic of fundamental expression patterns such as the global chromosome X inactivation and reactivation allowing to precisely dissect this unique process. It also reveals a rapid global expression switch at the initiation of the long pachytene stage reminiscent and coincident with the commitment to meiosis observed in budding yeast. Overall, this meiotic atlas provides an exhaustive blueprint and resource for deconvoluting mammalian gametogenesis and meiosis.
