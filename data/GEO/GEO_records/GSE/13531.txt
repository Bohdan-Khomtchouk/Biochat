TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1 ura3 parent strain and VNG1451C deletion mutant in response to growth in rich medium

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Gene regulatory networks play an important role in coordinating biochemical fluxes through diverse metabolic pathways.  The modulation of enzyme levels enables efficient utilization of limited resources as organisms dynamically acclimate to nutritional fluctuations in their environment.  Here we have identified and characterized a novel nutrient-responsive transcription factor from the halophilic archaea, VNG1451C. In this experiment we used whole-genome microarray analysis in the VNG1451C deletion mutant vs. H. salinarum NRC-1 ura3 parent strain in rich medium during growth to show that the expression of many metabolic genes is perturbed in the VNG1451C deletion mutant.

DESIGN
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 (ATCC700922) ura3 parent and VNG1451C strains were grown in complex medium (CM; 250g/L NaCl, 20g/L MgSO4.7H2O, 3g/L sodium citrate, 2g/L KCl, 10g/L peptone) at 37ÂºC under full-spectrum white light. Biological replicate samples were removed throughout the growth curve at early log, mid log, late log, and stationary phase to measure genome-wide transcription.
