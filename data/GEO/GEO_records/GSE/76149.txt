TITLE
Gene expression profiling of sensory epithelium of cochleas and vestibules of the inner ears of wild-type C57Bl/6J mice at post-natal day 0 (P0)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The sensory epithelium of cochleas and vestibules of mice were compared. The two tissues are quite similar in structure, but have distinct roles in hearing and balance. By comparing their gene expression, we hoped to identify key regulators of differentiation.

DESIGN
Cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelium was dissected from 20 inner ears of 10 P0 C57Bl/6J mice, generating 2.4 and 1.5 Î¼g of total RNA, respectively. 450 ng RNA from each sample was used to create libraries with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina), followed by high-throughput sequencing at 100 bp paired end (PE) at the Technion Genome Center, Haifa, Israel. Six samples were generated, 3 cochlear and 3 vestibular, for sequencing in triplicate.
