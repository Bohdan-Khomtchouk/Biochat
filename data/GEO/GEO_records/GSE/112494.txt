TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of TET2-disrupted T cells from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Following CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell infusion, TET2 disrupted CAR+ T cells exhibited an epigenetic profile consistent with altered differentiation.

DESIGN
Epigenetic profiling of CAR+ and CAR- CD8+ T cells and examination of chromatin landscape changes associated with TET2 dysfuction using lymphocytes expanded from a CLL patient.

PLATFORM
