TITLE
Transcriptome modulation analysis of cytomegalovirus-infected immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) at 6h and 48h after infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) versus non infected. CMV tends to induce immunosuppression followed by lasting immunity. DCs appear to play a role in this effect. Results provide insights into CMV/DC interactions and suggest mechanisms for CMV-regulated early immune response. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
In the present study, immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells were generated from CMV neg healthy blood donors and infected or not with an endotheliotropic CMV strain. Gene expression modulation by the CMV infection was studied in a time course assay (non-infected - NI - vs 6h or 48h post-infection.  Patient C has no 48h sample
