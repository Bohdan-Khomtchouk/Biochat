TITLE
Transcriptome comparison between Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 wildtype (WT), RpoN (Sigma 54) deletion mutant and the complemented strain.

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
RpoN was shown to have a pleiotropic role in different microorganisms. This study was performed to elucidate role in B. cereus. In this study we compared the transcriptomic profiles of the WT, rpoN mutant and the complemented strain in aerated and static growth conditions.

DESIGN
Matrix is compatible with the Agilent-017343 array design. Aerated cultures were sampled at two time points, upon reaching OD (600 nm) values of 0.2 (t1) and 1.0 (t2), which corresponded to mid-exponential and transition growth phases, respectively. Statically grown cultures were sampled at OD=0.2 (600 nm) corresponding to exponential growth (exp/static). Two independent biological replicates were hybridized on the arrays with either 2 (WT) or 3 (Δrpon and ΔrpoN-comp) technical replicates for each biological replicate.
