TITLE
Genome wide localizatoin of ORCA during G1 phase in U2OS cells and map of methyl-CpG sites in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ORCA is an ORC associated protein that plays important roles in replication initiation as well as heterochromatin organization. We carried out ORCA ChIP-seq in U2OS cells synchronized at different stage of G1 phase to determine its genome wide localization. To understand the genomic features of ORCA binding regions, we also carried out Methylated DNA IP (MeDIP) followed by deep sequencing in U2OS cells to determine the genome wide localizatoin of methyl-CpG sites in U2OS cells and how ORCA bidning regions co-localize with this important repressive mark.

DESIGN
ORCA ChIP-seq was carried out in U2OS cells that were synchronized at early, mid and late G1 phase. MeDIP-seq was performed in U2OS cells.
