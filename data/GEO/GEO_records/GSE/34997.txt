TITLE
Characterization of late-stage Drosophila grainy head IM-allele (grhIM) mutant embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To determine the genes directly and indirectly under the control of the Grainy head transcription factor during late stages of Drosophila embryogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from pre-larval (late stage 16 and early stage 17) grhIM homozygous (+; cn, grhIM, bw, sp; +) and wild-type (y; cn, bw, sp; +) embryos were compared.

PLATFORM
GPL7300 Agilent-018972 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
