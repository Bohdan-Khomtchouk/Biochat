TITLE
CpG Methylation profile of Invasive Pancreatic Cancer Cells compared to Non-invasive

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two established cell lines, PANC1 and HPAC, were invaded toward a stem cell media through Matrigel. DNA was isolated from Non-invasive cells and invasive cells.

DESIGN
Methylated DNA was isolated from each sample using the Methyl Collector kit from Active Motif. Methylated and Non-Methylated DNA was dye labeled and applied to 244K Human promoter tiling arrays.
