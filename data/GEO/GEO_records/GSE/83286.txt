TITLE
Expression profile of long non-coding RNAs in human earlobe keloids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs between 3 pairs of earlobe keloid and normal specimens. Results provide insight into involement of lncRNAs in the pathological process of earlobe keloid formation.

DESIGN
3 pairs of earlobe keloid and normal specimens.
