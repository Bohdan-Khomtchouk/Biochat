TITLE
KSHV miRNA transfection and inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of BJAB cells transfected with KSHV miRNAs and BCBL cells treated with KSHV miRNA inhibitors. To identify host RNA targets of KSHV miRNAs, we took advantage of the observation that RNAs targeted by miRNAs often display small reductions in their steady-state levels, perhaps as a result of their impaired translation. Accordingly, we examined cellular transcript accumulation by array-based expression profiling under four sets of conditions in which KSHV miRNAs were expressed or inhibited.

DESIGN
Cells transfected with negative control miRNA compared to KSHV miRNAs or negative miRNA inhibitor compared to inhibitors to KSHV miRs.
