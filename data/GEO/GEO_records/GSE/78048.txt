TITLE
Role of an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, PGN_0319, in hemin utilization by Porphyromonas gingivalis

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are known to play an important role in the bacterial response to various environmental stresses. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a prominent etiological agent in human periodontitis, possesses six putative ECF sigma factors. So far, information is limited on an ECF sigma factor, PGN_0319. It has been recently reported that the expression of genes encoding some of the ECF sigma factors including PGN_0319 was affected by hemin availability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PGN_0319 in hemin utilization by P. gingivalis. We evaluated the gene expression profile of the PGN_0319 mutant by DNA microarray, and then real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis was performed to assess genes with altered expression levels. The expressions level of hmuY and hmuR, which encode an outer-membrane protein involved in hemin utilization, and cdhR, a transcriptional regulator of hmuYR, were significantly decreased in the PGN_0319 mutant. The transcription of these genes was restored in the PGN_0319 complemented strain. We observed that the PGN_0319 mutant showed reduced growth in log phase compared with wild type under hemin-limiting condition. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated the recombinant PGN_0319 protein bound to the promoter region of hmuY and cdhR. In addition, we observed that PGN_0319 gene was upregulated in response to low cell density. These results demonstrate that PGN_0319 play an important role in the early growth of P. gingivalis, and directly regulates hmuYR and cdhR, thereby plays a role in the mechanisms involved in hemin utilization by P. gingivalis.
