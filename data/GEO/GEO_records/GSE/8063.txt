TITLE
endothelium-Transcriptome analysis of the tannin-producing cells in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra03-06_seed_endothelium - endothelium - Identification of all tannin metabolism functions. - Comparisons between wild type seeds and seed that have no endothelium, thus no tannin producing cells. This phenotype is obtained by specifically expressing the Barnase gene under the BANYULS promoter. Keywords: gene knock out
