TITLE
RNA sequencing of hiPSC derived neural crest populations from Familial Dysautonomia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated expression profiles of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neural crest populations from Familial Dysautonomia patients.  These profiles were compared to a normal iPSC line that does not harbor the IKBKAP mutation.

DESIGN
All cell types were differentiated from patient derived iPSCs.  Bulk iPSCs were harvested for RNA and the neural crest populations were sorted on day 18 for p75/HNK1 before RNA isolation.
