TITLE
microRNA expression in HeLa cells under a mild hyperthermia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated expression profiles of miRNAs in HeLa cells that were subjected to a mild hyperthermia as well as normal temperature by means of DNA microarray. The data suggested similar expression profiles to each other.

DESIGN
Small RNA samples prepared from HeLa cells exposed to a mild hyperthermia (40ºC) as well as normal temperature (37ºC) were examined by means of Genopal®-MICH07 DNA chips.
