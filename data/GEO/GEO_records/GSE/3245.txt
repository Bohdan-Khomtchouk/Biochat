TITLE
MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, or hrGFP expressed in 2C5/7 myoD-/-;myf5-/- fibroblast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes induced by MyoD or Myf5 were examined in a double-knockout fibroblast cell line lacking endogenous functional myoD or myf5 genes. Use of this cell line precluded the possibility of auto- or cross-activation of endogenous myoD or myf5. Myogenin or hrGFP were expressed in parallel samples as controls. Following infection with retrovirus - expressing the relevant myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) from the viral LTR promoter and hrGFP through an IRES element in the same mRNA transcript - GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS and harvested for total RNA. Keywords: other

DESIGN
this experiment include 4 samples and 12 replicates
