TITLE
Integrated Profiling of mRNAs and microRNAs to Identify Potential Biomarkers for Oral Malignant Transformation [mRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to systematically profile the expression of both mRNAs and miRNAs in OSCC and its premalignant disease to identify some novel potential biomarkers for the detection of malignant transformation.

DESIGN
NGS was applied to investigate the differential transcriptome. The expression of mRNAs and miRNAs were analyzed in tumor tissues, premalignant tissues and adjacent normal tissues obtained from same OSCC patients with long history of oral mucosal disease.
