TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profile in MPTP-treated mouse retina: Comparative analysis of short-and long-term gene regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize both short- and long-term (7 days and 28 days) gene expression profiling differences between control and MPTP-treated retina, we determined levels of gene expression using microarray analysis and real-time PCR. We found 60 genes relatively regulated in retinas treated with MPTP for 7 days (26 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated), whereas 54 genes were regulated in retinas treated with MPTP for 28 days (18 up-regulated and 36 down-regulated) when compared with the non-treated retina in each control groups. Total 26 annotated differently expressed genes were chosen for further validation by quantitative real-time PCR, and 4 genes in the 7-day treatment group (Clec2e; Dio2; Hmcn1; Rlbp1) and 3 genes in the 28-days treatment group (Pnmt; Tmem121; Ssxb3) were confirmed.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 mice  were randomly divided into four treatment groups (n= 6 in each group): the 7 days and 28 days saline-injection (control) groups (C-7 and C-28, respectively), and 7 days and 28 days MPTP-injection groups (M-7 and M-28, respectively). 4 retinas for 1 samples (1 gene chip),  (4 experimental group Ã— 2 samples of each experimental group = total 8 samples).
