TITLE
Peroxireduxin-4 is over-expressed in colon cancer and its down-regulation leads to apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to gain insights into the biological basis of colon cancer progression by characterizing gene expression differences between normal colon epithelium, corresponding colorectal primary tumors and metastases. We found a close similarity in gene expression patterns between primary tumors and metastases, indicating a correlation between gene expression and morphological characteristics. PRDX4 was identified as highly expressed both in primary colon tumors and metastases, and selected for further characterization. Our study revealed that Prdx4 (PrxIV, AOE372) shows functional similarities to other Prx family members by negatively effecting apoptosis induction in tumor cells. In addition, our studies link Prdx4 with Hif-1α, a key regulatory factor of angiogenesis. Targeting Prdx4 may be an attractive approach in cancer therapy, as its inhibition is expected to lead to induction of apoptosis and blockade of Hif-1α-mediated tumor angiogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiling of normal colon epithelium (5), primary colon tumors (12 with 1 replicate) and either lymph node metastases (9 with 2 replicates) or liver metastases (2) and cell lines (4) from twelve colon cancer patients.
