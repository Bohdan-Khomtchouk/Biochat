TITLE
Search for genes affected by mgtC leader expression in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028s Wu

SUMMARY
A set of genes are highly downregulated in the presence of extra copy of the mgtC leader. Provide a hint of potental target of the leader RNA

DESIGN
RNA expression profile of cells harboring a plasmid with the mgtC leader versus the empty vector, grown in minimal media, using Illumina HiSeq 2500
