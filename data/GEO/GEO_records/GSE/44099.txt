TITLE
NAC, Tiron and Trolox impair GBM tumorigenic cell survival by mechanisms independent from antioxidant activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to determine if, using antioxidant drugs, it is possible to interfere with the proliferative capabilities of the human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor-initiating cells (TICs).

DESIGN
To establish which cellular processes are activated in GBM TICs by the antioxidants NAC, Tiron and Trolox, we generated and analyzed the gene expression profiles after treatment with these compounds and with H2O and EtOH (vehicles).
