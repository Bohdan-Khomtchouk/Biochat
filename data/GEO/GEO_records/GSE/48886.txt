TITLE
Small RNAs from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
Small RNA expression from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was profiled with the primary goal of ascertaining microRNA isoform diversity for known, conserved families. A secondary goal was to provide a baseline small RNA expression atlas for this species and tissue.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of leaves from growth-room grown plants. The two libraries were each run twice on different runs, so there are a total of four datasets. For most analyses, it will be appropriate to combine the run1 and run2 versions for the libraries.
