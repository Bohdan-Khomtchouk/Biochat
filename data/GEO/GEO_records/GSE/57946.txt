TITLE
Role of AHR in cardiac developmental toxicity of PAHs

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptmic profiling of cardiac tissues in AHR2 knockdown and control zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to BaP, FL amd BaP+FL at 2,6,12, and 18 hours post dosing

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, AHR2 knockdown vs control knockdown, exposed to BaP, FL and BaP+FL. 3-4 replicates per time point, at four diferent time points (2,6,12 and 18 hpd) 11 raw data files were received truncated.
