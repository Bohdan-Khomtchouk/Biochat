TITLE
Naturally occurring tumours in the basal metazoan Hydra.

ORGANISM
Hydra oligactis

SUMMARY
The molecular nature of malignant tumors is well studied in vertebrates, while their evolutionary origin remains unknown. In particular, there is no evidence for naturally occurring malignant tumors in pre-bilaterian animals, such as sponges and cnidarians. This is somewhat surprising given that recent computational studies have predicted that all metazoans are prone to develop tumors. Here we provide first evidence for naturally occurring tumors in Hydra oligactis. Histological, cellular and molecular data reveal that these tumors are transplantable and caused by differentiation arrest of female gametes. Growth of tumor cells is independent from the cellular environment. Tumor bearing polyps have significantly reduced fitness. In addition, Hydra tumors show a greatly altered transcriptome that mimics expression shifts in vertebrate cancers. Therefore, this study shows, that invasive tumors have deep roots in animal phylogeny, and that early branching animals may be informative in revealing the fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
We compared four samples of Hydra oligactis tumor-bearing animals to three samples of female polyps undergoing oogenesis and six samples of female asexual control polyps
