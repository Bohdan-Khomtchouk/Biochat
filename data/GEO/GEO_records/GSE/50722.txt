TITLE
Effect of tumor conditioned medium of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray  to identify changes in gene expression in human MSCs exposed to tumor conditioned medium

DESIGN
Human MSC line (hMSC-TERT) was exposed to tumor conditioned medium (CM) from FaDu hypo pharyngeal cancer cell line for 7 day. Subsequently, RNA was extracted using Roche MagNA Pure automated nucleic acid purification system. Control RNA was collected from the same batch of MSCs exposed to normal medium. Extracted RNA was labeled and then hybridized to the one-color Agilent Human GE 4x44K v2 Microarray chip.
