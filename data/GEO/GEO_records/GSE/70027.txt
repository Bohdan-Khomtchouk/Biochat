TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in Calu-1 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that there would be a different response between the cell types to the bisphosphonate, the SREBP inhibitor fatostatin and an oxidoreductase inhibitor.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from cells following 24 hour exposure to the test agents
