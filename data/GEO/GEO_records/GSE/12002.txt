TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Ad-F7 transduced macrophages treated with anti-IFNAR2 antibody or control isotype (IgG)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determine the role of interferons in the transcriptional profile of Ad-F7 transduced primary human macrophages using neutralizing antibody for the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR2).

DESIGN
Primary human macrophage preparations were transduced with Ad-GFP or Ad-F7 and treated with control isotype (IgG) or neutralizing antibody for the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR2). RNA was collected 24 hours later and subjected to microarray analysis. Data represents the average of 5 donors.
