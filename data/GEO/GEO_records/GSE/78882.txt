ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Stressed samples: Strain MG1363 was exposed to abrupt glucose depletion in SA medium after balanced growth. Reference sample: Strain MG1363 was grown balanced in SA medium containing 1% glucose

DESIGN
Samples were taken from reference culture at OD450=0.15, and from glucose starved cultures 10 and 60 min after depletion.
