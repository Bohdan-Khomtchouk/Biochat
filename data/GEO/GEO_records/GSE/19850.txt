TITLE
edelfosine and wortmannin effect at 22°c and 4°c-PI4-kinase and phospholipase C signaling in cold response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs09-04_plc_2 - edelfosine and wortmannin effect at 22°c and 4°c - Is there an overlap between PI4-kinase and phospholipase C signaling in cold response ? - Experiments were carried out with Columbia suspension cells. Cells were treated or not with edelfosine (PLC inhibitor) or wortmannin (PI4-kinase inhibitor). These agents were added 15 min before cold stress. ARN were extracted 4h after stress. Controls were made at 22°C. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
