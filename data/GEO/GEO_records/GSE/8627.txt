TITLE
Genomic integrity of P493 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the genomic integrity of human P493 cells grown in vitro with those recovered from xenografts of P493 cells. Keywords: single nucleotide polymorphism, array comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
We used control, parental P493 cell lines (P493-parent and P493-luc expressing a luciferase construct for array CGH; P493-TR with tetracycline resistance for the SNP assays) and compared them to P493 cells recovered from xenografts.
