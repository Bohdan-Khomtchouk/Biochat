TITLE
Expression data for murine colon carcinoma cell line CT26.WT stimulated with S100a8 or S100a9 recombinant protein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules S100A8 and S100A9 with well-known functions in inflammation, tumor growth and metastasis. It has been found to have promote tumor cell proliferation activity at low concentration . However, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In the current study, we performed genome expression profiling analysis using the Affymetrix genome wide microarray system to identify broad scale changes in gene expression associated with S100a8 or S100a9 recombinant protein stimulation in murine colon carcinoma cell line CT26.WT.

DESIGN
Murine colon carcinoma cell line CT26.WT  cells exposed to serum-free medium for 12 hours, and then 4 ug/ml of S100a8 or S100a9 mouse recombinant protein  was added for an additional 24 hours respectively. Control serum-free medium was treated with normal saline. Total RNA were extracted and detected by Affymerix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
