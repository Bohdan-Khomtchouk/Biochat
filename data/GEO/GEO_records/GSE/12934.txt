TITLE
miRNA profiles of tonsilar B and T lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of human tonsilar B lymphocytes (naïve B cells, centroblasts and memory B cells) and tonsilar T cells, analyzing the 470 human miRNAs present in miRBase V9.1. B cell subpopulations and T cells were purified using specific antibodies, magnetic beads and the AutoMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec) from reactive tonsils obtained from routine tonsilectomies. Informed consents and the Institutional Review Board approval were obtained. Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion), and sent to LC Sciences facility for microarray hybridization using microfluidics technology. FirstChoice® Human Skeletal Muscle Total RNA (Ambion) was used as common reference for all hybridizations. Background substracted and normalized data from each channel was used to calculate log ratios sample/reference. Keywords: miRNA profiling
