TITLE
The insect midgut is not restful during the larva-to-larva molting stage

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
IMolting, a special period during which the old cuticle is shed and a new one is produced, is crucial to insect development. During their life cycles, insects that undergo complete metamorphosis may experience several larva-to-larva moltings to become larger, followed by larva-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult moltings to become adults. During the larva-to-larva molting stage, insect larvae stop consuming food and become restful. Whether any changes occur within the molting midgut before ecdysis remains known.

DESIGN
Total RNA from day 3 of 4th feeding, 4th molting and 5th feeding stages Bombyx midgut were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 48k Bombyx genome Array Genechips, representing about 23000 characterized genes

PLATFORM
GPL9527 Silkworm 23K oligo array version 2.0
