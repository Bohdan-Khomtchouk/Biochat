TITLE
The rat lncRNA microarray analysis of the 8 samples from control and NNK treatment group

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to assess the alteration in lncRNA expression in rat lung carcinogenesis induced by NNK, we determined the lncRNA expression profiles in 3 rat lung tumor samples and matched normal lung tissues and 2 blood samples from the control and NNK treatment group in the 95th week using Arraystar Rat lncRNA Microarray.

DESIGN
We induced lung cancer using 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) in a rat model and determined the lncRNA expression profiles in lung cancer tissues and rat blood samples.
