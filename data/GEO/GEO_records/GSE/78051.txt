TITLE
KLF12 overexpression effect in colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Kr√ºppel-like factor (KLF) family is transcription factors that play diverse biological roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.  KLF12 is frequently elevated in esophageal adenocarcinoma and has been reported to promote gastric cancer progression. To identify the downstream target of KLF12 in colorectal cancer cells, we carried out microarray.

DESIGN
KLF12 was over-expressed in LS174T colorectal cancer cells. Eath group is trplicate sample (Contro=3, KLF12 Over-expression=3)
