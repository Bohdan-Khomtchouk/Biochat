TITLE
Sex differences on the effect of Testosterone in songbirds

ORGANISM
Serinus canaria

SUMMARY
In this data set, we compare the expression data of the song nuclei from canaries treated with testosterone to untreated animals to identify gender specific stimulated gene expression. The gene expression profiles were compared to specie specific sexual dimorphic expressions.

DESIGN
A total of 12 HVCs isolated from treated and untreated animals were compared. The differential expression was analyzed by ChipInspector using the group-wise exhaustive analysis with False Discovery Rate set to zero and 10-significant probe minimum coverage. ChipInspector carries out significance analysis on the single probe level. Normalized probe set level data not provided for individual Sample records.
