TITLE
Erythroid-Specific Transcriptional Changes in PBMCs from Pulmonary Hypertension Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in this study was that chronic exposure of PBMCs to a hypertensive environment in remodeled pulmonary vessels would be reflected by specific transcriptional changes in these cells. The transcript profiles of PBMCs from 30 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (IPAH), 19 patients with systemic sclerosis without pulmonary hypertension (SSc), 42 scleroderma-associated PAH patients (SSc-PAH), and 8 patients with SSc complicated by interstitial lung disease and PH (SSC-PH-ILD) were compared to the gene expression profiles of PBMCs from 41 healthy individuals.

DESIGN
Gene expression is compared at a global level using total RNA from BPMC for pateints and controls using the Illumina microarray platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
