TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) after non-thermal plasma treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression in human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) following non-thermal plasma treatment for 20 s, 60 s, and 180 s compared to untreated and H2O2-treated controls. Microarrays were used to analyze and investigate the biological effects of non-thermal plasma on human keratinocyte cells. Using an argon plasma jet kinpen, regulated transcripts were analyzed and further described in Schmidt et al. (2014): “Transcript profiling identifies an important role for Nrf2/Keap1-pathway after non-thermal plasma treatment in human keratinocytes”.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA recovered from at non-thermal plasma treated-probes (n > 6), as well as H2O2-treated, argon-gas treated, and untreated HaCaT controls.
