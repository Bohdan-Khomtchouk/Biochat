TITLE
caArray_notte-00422: Molecular Dissection of Colon Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression data was generated as part of a colon cancer study. Samples were obtained from patients, including primary colon cancer, polyps, metastases, and matched normal mucosa (obtained from the margins of the resection). The RNA was extracted from tissue samples obtained from resections and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 arrays. RNA expression data was also obtained for a few cell lines.
