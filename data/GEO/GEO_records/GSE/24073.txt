TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida albicans during Hypoxic conditions.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray were used to generate the transcriptional profile of C.albicans in hypoxic condition.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from DAY286 grown in YPD medium in normoxia or hypoxia at 30 degree Celsius for 3.5 h, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Eight independent biological replicates were compared. 2 dye swaps were perfomed so that 6 out of 8 samples isolated from normoxic culture were labeled with Cy3, and 2 were labeled with Cy5.
