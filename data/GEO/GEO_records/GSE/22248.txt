TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis during endotoxin tolerance in PBMCs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy humans donors, four hours post stimulation of  a single or double treatment of LPS and compared to untreated control PBMCs. We show that a second treatment with LPS induces endotoxin tolerance, with a transcription profile similar to that seen during alternative polarization (M2) of mononuclear cells. Microarray processing was performed by the Genome BC Microarray Platform.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PBMCs from blood from healthy humans after single treatment with LPS, two treatments with LPS, or untreated. Comparison of LPS or LPS/LPS to untreated cells shows the gene expression pattern of endotoxin tolerance.
