TITLE
Gene expression comparison of microRNA-181d Transgenic and microRNA-181d Knock-in thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cell-specific over-expression of microRNA-181d reduced number of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.

DESIGN
Whole thymus tissues were isolated from the miR-181d transgenic (Tg-8) and miR-181d knockin (KI) mice, followed by total RNA isolation.
