TITLE
Single Cell Transcriptome Conservation in Cryopreserved Cells and Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Canis lupus familiaris ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sample preservation method that maintains transcripts in viable single cells and so allows to disconnect time and place of sampling from subsequent processing steps.

DESIGN
Single cell transcriptomes from 1,486 fresh and conserved cells from human blood, ovarian and lung tumor xenografts, mouse colon tissue, and human, mouse and canine cell cultures.
