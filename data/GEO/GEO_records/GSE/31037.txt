TITLE
Small RNA sequencing in normal and psoriatic skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina small RNA sequencing to normal human skin, as well as uninvolved and involved psoriatic skin. By obtaining over 600 million qualified reads from 20 healthy controls and 47 psoriasis biopsies (uninvolved/involved), we have generated a complete small RNA profile in normal and diseased human skin, with particular emphasis on miRNAs. We report the discovery of 284 putative novel miRNAs as well as 98 differentially expressed miRNAs in psoriatic skin.

DESIGN
miRNA discovery and expression profiling in 67 normal and psoriatic human skin biopsies
