TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the lymphoid and non-lymphoid leukemias induced by the Graffi murine leukemia retrovirus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarrays to obtain the cancerous signatures of T-cell, B-cell, erythroid and megakaryoblastic leukemias in mice. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
16 samples are included, 13 corresponding to leukemic samples and 3 corresponding to control samples. Each control sample corresponds to the pooled RNA of 12 mice.
