TITLE
Gene expression from mouse kras tumor-derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression of KR Primary and KR 1 cell lines KR Primary cells are established from lung tumors of Kras mice. This cell line was injected into B6 mice intratracheally and then KR 1 cell line was established.

DESIGN
Cells were collected and total RNAs from cells were subjected to hybridization for Affymetrix microarray.
