TITLE
A Time Course Analysis of the Effects of Prieurianin in the mouse preadipocytes 3T3-L1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling to examine the effets of prieurianin in a time-course study (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 288 hrs) on the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. The sharp rise in the incidence of obesity in the last two decades has become one of the most serious public health risks worldwide.  Currently approved therapies for obesity exhibit modest efficacy and limiting side effects.  We show here that prieurianin, a limonoid, causes weight loss by reducing energy intake in morbidly obese mice and in mice on high-calorie diet.  Prieurianin is also anti-adipogenic by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, and induces either dedifferentiation or delipidation of mature adipocytes.  Gene expression profiling shows that prieurianin suppresses the expression of genes involved in fat metabolism, and increases the expression of a transcription repressor, zinc finger protein 68 (Zfp68), which inhibits CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), master transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis.  The effects of prieurianin are reminiscent of several cytokines that regulate appetite and adipogenesis, and holds promise as an effective anti-obesity drug. Keywords: Time course, prieurianin, obesity, differentiation, adipogenesis, preadipocytes, adipocytes, Zfp68

DESIGN
L1 Cells were treated either with 0.5% DMSO or 2 µM of prieurianin for the following times: 0, 0.25, 0.5,1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 288 hrs, and then total RNA was purified at the indicated times using the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Samples were labeled and hybridized to the Mouse OneArray (Phalanx Biotech Group, Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed for gene expression changes, compared to untreated control undergoing normal differentiation.
