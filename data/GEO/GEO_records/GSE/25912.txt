TITLE
Classification of diet modified gene signatures at the colon cancer initiation and progression stages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to identify discriminative gene signatures for the purpose of classifying n-3 PUFA-fed, carcinogen injected Sprague Dawley rats at the initiation and progression stages.  Animals were assigned to three dietary treatments differeing only in the type of fat (corn oi/n-6 PUFA, fish oil/n-3 PUFA, or olive oli/n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid).  The effects of diet on colonic mucosal gene expression signatures during tumor initiation with the progression of colon cancer.  Each dietary lipid source exhibited its own unique transcriptional profile, as assessed by linear discriminant analysis.  Applying this novel approach we identified the single genes and the two- to three-gene combinations that best distinguished the dietary treatment groups.  For the chemoprotective fish oil diet, mediators of stem cell homeostasis, e.g., ephrin B1 and bone morphogenic protein 4, were the top-permorming gene classifiers. keywords: diet analysis

DESIGN
29 samples were analyzed.  10 samples had repeat arrays.  No control or reference samples were included.
