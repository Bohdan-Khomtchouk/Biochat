TITLE
An Integrated Approach to Reconstructing Genome-scale Transcriptional Regulatory Networks [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
By integrating sequence information from closely related bacteria with a compendium of high-throughput gene expression datasets, a large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks was constructed for Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Predictions from this network were validated in part using genome-wide analysis for 3 transcription factors (PpsR, RSP_0489 and RSP_3341).

DESIGN
Genome-wide protein-DNA interaction analysis of 3 transcription factors predicted to be involved in photosynthesis (PpsR), carbon metabolism (RSP_0489) and iron homeostasis (RSP_3341) were used to validate predictions from a large-scale reconstruction of R. sphaeroides transcriptional regulatory network.
