TITLE
miRNA data in human placentas from normal pregnancies and from pregnancies complicated by SGA and IUGR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Placental insufficiency leading to intrauterine growth restriction demonstrates perturbed gene expression affecting placental angiogenesis and nutrient transfer from mother to fetus. To understand the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying such placental gene expression changes, our objective was to identify key non-coding microRNAs that express biological function. To this end, we undertook microarray targeting microRNAs in placentas of appropriate (AGA, n=3) versus small for gestational age (SGA, n=3) weight infants and observed upregulation of 97 miRs in SGA versus AGA. In a larger cohort of samples, we validated by qRT-PCR, differential expression of three specific microRNAs that target genes mediating angiogenesis and nutrient transfer. We performed microarray on a small cohort of samples in order to identify differential expression in pathways involved with angiogenesis and nutrient transfer, essential processes for placental function that when perturbed, may result in intrauterine growth restriction.

DESIGN
Human placental samples were obtained immediately post-parturient. There were three samples from the AGA group (Bw > 10% and < 90%) and three samples from the SGA/IUGR (Birthweight < 10%) group. All placental samples were from term, singleton pregnancies.
