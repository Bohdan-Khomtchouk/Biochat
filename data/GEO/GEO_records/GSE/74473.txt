TITLE
Effects of Pseudorabies Virus Infection on the Tracheobronchial Lymph Node Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa domesticus

SUMMARY
RNA isolated from draining tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) from 5-week old pigs, either clinically infected with a feral isolate of Pseudorabies virus or uninfected were interrogated using Illumina Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling. Over 100 million tag sequences were observed, representing 4,064,189 unique 21-base sequences collected from TBLN at time points 1, 3, 6 and 14 days post-infection (dpi)

DESIGN
RNA isolated from draining tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) from 5-week old pigs (% per group pooled), either clinically infected with feral isolate FS268 of Pseudorabies virus or uninfected at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days post inoculation. Over 100 million tag sequences were observed, representing 4,064,189 unique 21-base sequences.
