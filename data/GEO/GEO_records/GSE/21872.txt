TITLE
Structural and molecular basis of the role of starch and sucrose in Streptococcus mutans biofilms development

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling to investigate the response of Streptococcus mutans biofilms to starch and sucrose.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and purified from four replicate samples of each biofilm sample of interest and labeled with Cy3. For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cells grown to mid-log.
