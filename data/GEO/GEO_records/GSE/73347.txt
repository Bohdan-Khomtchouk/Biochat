TITLE
miR-135b expression effect on myxoid liposarcoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-135b expression is higher in myxoid liposarcoma cell lines than in adipose-derived mesenchymal cell line, as well as in myxoid liposarcoma tumors than in adjacent normal prostate tissues.To further investigate the molecular mechanisms regulated by miR-135b, we performed mRNA microarray analysis of cell cultures from myxoid liposarcoma cell line after transfections with miR-135b mimic or negative control.

DESIGN
mRNA expression of cell cultures from myxoid liposarcoma cell line 2645-94 after transient transfection with miR-135b mimic or negative control were measured.
