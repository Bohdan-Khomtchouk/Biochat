TITLE
SNP array data for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify chromosomal alterations in ATL, SNP array analyses were performed in 19 leukemia cell samples from ATL patients and 9 ATL-related cell lines. ATL displayed complex chromosomal abnormalities, but it contained recurrent chromosomal amplification and deletion, including 14q11 and 14q32, which may be associated with the development of ATL. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved peripheral blood samples and from cell line samples.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp or 250K Sty arrays were performed for leukemic cell samples from 9 acute-type and 10 chronic-type ATL patients and 9 ATL-related cell lines.
