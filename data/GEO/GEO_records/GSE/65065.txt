TITLE
Expression data of BRPF3 depletion from the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Bromo-domain and PHD-finger protein, BRPF3, forms a complex with HBO1 and regulates the initiation of DNA replication. BRPF3-dependent histone H3K14 enriched in chromatin surrounding a fraction of replication origins may play an important role in origin firing. We used microarrays to evaluate whether replication defect due to the lack of BRPF3 is associated with transcriptional changes of replication genes.

DESIGN
Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted for BRPF3 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Cells were treated with either scamble siRNA (Control_1_B1) or siRNA against BPRF3 (BRPF3_B1) for 48 hours. Two samples in a biological replica set were prepared in exactly the same way and labeled as Control_1_B2 and BRPF3_B2 respectively.
