TITLE
Identification of Sox9-Regulated Pathways During the Secondary Transition Stage of Pancreas Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox9 target genes were identified during the secondary transition stage of pancreas development by comparing gene expression in Sox9-ablated versus wild-type pancreata using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Sox9 was conditionally ablated during the secondary transition in the developing pancreas via recombination of a Sox9-flox allele (Kist et al., 2002) using the tamoxifen-inducible Rosa26-CreER allele (Vooijs et al., 2001). Dams were injected with 6 mg/40 g tamoxifen in corn oil at e12.5. Pancreata were manually microdissected at e15.5. Total RNA was isolated and pooled from pancreata of e15.5 Sox9fl/fl; Rosa26-CreER (mutant) versus Rosa26-CreER (wild-type) littermates for four biological replicates.
