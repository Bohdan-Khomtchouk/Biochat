TITLE
Nanostring nCounter expression analysis of sea lamprey embryos and adult testes (Petromyzon marinus)

ORGANISM
Petromyzon marinus

SUMMARY
This project is designed to measure changes in gene expression during sea lamprey development and in the adult germline

DESIGN
RNA was extracted in biological triplicate from sea lamprey embryos at 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 days post-fertilization and in technical replicates from adult testes using trizol extraction. RNA was analyzed on the Nanostring nCounter gene expression assay to measure changes in gene expression across developmental time points and in adult testes
