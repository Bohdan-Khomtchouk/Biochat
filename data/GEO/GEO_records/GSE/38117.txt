TITLE
Exploring new pathways involved during experimental renal fibrogenesis in the Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a burden for Public Health and concerns millions of individuals worldwide. Independently of the cause, CKD is secondary to the replacement of functional renal tissue by extra-cellular matrix proteins (i.e fibrosis) that progressively impairs kidney function. The pathophysiological pathways that control the development of renal fibrosis are common to most of the nephropathies involving native kidneys or kidney grafts. Unfortunately, very few treatments are available to stop renal fibrosis and most of the therapeutic strategies are often barely able to slow down the progression of fibrogenesis in native kidneys. Therefore, it is mandatory to discover new therapeutic pathways to stop renal fibrosis. Our objective is to study new pathways involved in renal fibrosis. We thus decided to use the model of Unilateral Ureteral renal Obstruction in mice, a fast and reproducible  experimental model of  renal fibrosis.

DESIGN
We studied renal fibrosis using experimental model of ureteral unilateral obstruction in mice, which was performed by complete ligation of the left ureter. The control lateral right kidney served as internal control.
