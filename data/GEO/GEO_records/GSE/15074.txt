TITLE
Expression data from Rat heterotopic cardiac transplants

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Heterotopic cardiac transplants were constructed in male Wistar Furth (allograft donor) and ACI (host) rats. Rats were divided into three groups consisting of no treatment, treatment with a sub-therapeutic dose of cyclosporin A, and treated with combination of a sub-therapeutic dose of cyclosporin A and allochimeric peptide. The allografts were harvested at defined periods post-transplantation and RNA was harvested to monitor gene expression changes resulting from the various treatments in T-cells and in heart cells.

DESIGN
There are 3 distinct treatment groups, with three timepoints in each group. Two tissue samples are isolated from each group: allograft heart tissue and T-cells, for a total of 18 samples. The no-treatment group can be considered a baseline sample set for the determination of gene expression changes resulting from the two treatments.
