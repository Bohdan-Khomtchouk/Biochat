TITLE
Leptosphaeria maculans gene expression during in vitro growth and primary oilseed rape leaf infection

ORGANISM
Leptosphaeria maculans

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Leptosphaeria maculans was analyzed in mycelium and during oilseed rape (Brassica napus) leaf infection. The array probes were designed from gene models from the L. maculans whole genome annotation. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models in various conditions. Another goal was to monitor gene expression profiles during oilseed rape leaf infection and to highlight tissue-specific transcripts, e.g. in plant up-regulated transcripts, for further analyses.
