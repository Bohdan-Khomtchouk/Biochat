TITLE
Small RNA-seq of ago4 null and slicing-defective mutant in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of AGO4 upon small RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis, we analyzed small RNA accumulation in ago4, ago4/ago6/ago9 triple mutant, stable transgenic lines expressing wild-type AGO4 and slicing-defective AGO4 in ago4 and ago4/ago6/ago9 background.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates each from indicated mutant and stable transgenic lines are analyzed on a HiSeq2500 platform.
