TITLE
Leukemic hematopoietic stem cell FLA2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sca1+Lineage-cKit+ fetal liver (FL) and bone marrow (BM) cells were sorted and infected with Hoxa9+Meis retroviral particles, which provided fully leukemic complement to hematopoietic cells. These cells were injected into mice and leukemia onset was monitored in vivo. Leukemic stem cell (L-HSC) frequencies of these primary leukemias were evaluated using limiting dilution stem cell transfer in secondary recipients. The L-HSC frequency is near absolute for the FLA2 leukemia (around 1 L-HSC per 1.4 total leukemic bone marrow cells), whereas the other leukemias (FLB1, FLB2 and BM-derived leukemias) generated within the same experiment have a wide range of L-HSC frequencies.
