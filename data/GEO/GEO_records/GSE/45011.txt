TITLE
Experiment 3: Klf2a and  Klf2b  loss-of-function experiments at 30% epiboly Wild Type zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Morpholino injections were performed to investigate transcriptional targets of Klf2a, and Klf2b  in the blastula stage embryos (4,7 hours postfertilization) of wild type zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological duplicates. Cy3 and Cy5 channels were splitted in Genedata Analyst software, quantile normalised and used for independent comparisons.

PLATFORM
