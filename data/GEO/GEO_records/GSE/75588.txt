TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) in response to compound treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were treated with three newly synthesized compounds and DMSO as vehicle. Total RNA was isolated 6 and 24h after treatment and gene expression analysis was performed. Three independent experiments were performed, corresponding to rep1, rep2 and rep3. Experiment 1 (rep1) contained all substances at both time points tested. Experiment 2 (rep2) contained two of the compounds and control DMSO at both time points. Experiment 3 (rep3) contained the third compound and control DMSO at both time points.

DESIGN
18 samples were analyzed
