TITLE
Strain-dependent effects of alcohol on early mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EXPERIMENT: Microarray expression profiles derived from the cranial neural folds (headfold) of neurulation-stage mouse embryos 3.0h after maternal alcohol exposure on 8 d.p.c. ANIMAL MODEL: Pregnancies from 2 substrains of C57BL/6 mice that differ in relative risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS): C57BL/6J (B6J) high-risk condition, and C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) low-risk condition. EXPOSURE: Dams dosed with ethanol (EtOH) by intraperitoneal injection at 2.9 g EtOH per kg body weight. Controls received vehicle (saline) alone. A third group of dams received EtOH + 4.0 mg/kg PK11195, a specific high-affinity ligand to the 18 KDa mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor site. INTERVAL: High blood alcohol content must be sustained in dams for several hours to invoke FAS and is traditionally accomplished by a double injection of EtOH 4.0h apart. Since these embryos were harvested for genetic analysis 1h before dams would have gotten the second alcohol injection, the interval represents a snapshot of the critical response, prior to the second maternal injection that invokes greater risk. Counter-exposure to PK11195 significantly lowers the adverse response of B6J embryos to EtOH. PLATFORM: Two independent assays run. The first dataset (PE), run April 2002 – January 2003, used samples pooled from 2 litters (PE) and the platform was a two-channel MPS621 array ( http://www.lifesciences.perkinelmer.com/ ). This platform has 4800 sequence-verified gene elements derived from over 50 different human cDNA libraries reflecting a variety of well-annotated cellular processes and disease pathways. The second dataset (AF), run between May 2005 – November 2005, used samples pooled from 1 litter and the platform was Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array ( http://www.affymetrix.com/ ). The MG430A 2.0 platform has 45,102 oligonucleotide probe cells representing approximately 14,000 well-characterized genes in the draft mouse genome assembly. The corresponding GEO samples are GSM12218 - GSM12227 for the two-channel PE arrays, and GSM136067 - GSM136078 for the one-channel AF arrays.
