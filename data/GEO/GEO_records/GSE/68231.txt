TITLE
Expression data from human skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The accumulation of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is recognized as an important determinant of insulin resistance, and is increased by a high-fat diet (HFD). However, the effects of HFD on IMCL and insulin sensitivity are highly variable. We used microarrays to detail to identify the genes in skeletal muscle that are related to inter-individual variation of the effects with HFD on the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid and insulin sensitivity.

DESIGN
In order to identify the gene expression profile related with inter-individual variation of the effects with high fat diet on the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid and insulin sensitivity, we classified subjects who showed a large increase in intramyocellular lipid and a large decrease in glucose infusion rate by high fat diet as the high-responder (HR), and the subjects who showed a small increase in intramyocellular lipid and a small decrease in glucose infusion rate were classified as the low-responder (LR). In 5 subjects in each group, skeletal muscle sample selected at before (pre) and after (post) 3days high fat diet for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
