TITLE
Studying relative gene expression in Head and Neck (HNSCC) tumor under diverse culture conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profile in HNSCC tumor cultured under various conditions

DESIGN
Primary human HNSCC tumor was cultured for upto 72 hours in presence of Autologous Serum and combination of Autologous Serum and Tissue metalloproteinases ; angiogeneesis and tissue associated microenvironment signatures were studied
