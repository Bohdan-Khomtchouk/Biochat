TITLE
The effect of IFNÎ± on human CD8 T cells_with other concomitant signals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IFN alpha mediated gene expression pattern. The effect of IFN alpha on human CD8 T cells responding to antigen (signal 1) and costimulatory signals (signal 2) provided by beads coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. This analysis examined the effects of IFN alpha on human CD8 T cells responding to antigen (signal 1) and costimulatory signals (signal 2) provided by beads coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. Magnetically sorted untouched CD8+CD45R0- T cells from three different donors were unstimulated or stimulated with IFNa2b or with anti-CD3/CD28 Beads alone or along with IFNa2b or IFNa5 for 48 hours. Individual mRNA samples were analyzed using HG-U133A 2.0 array gene chips. Keywords: Gene expression analysis after different stimulation

DESIGN
Magnetically sorted untouched CD8+CD45R0-T cells from three different donors (named A, B and C) unstimulated or stimulated with IFN alpha 2b or with anti-CD3/CD28 beads alone or along with IFN alpha 2b or IFN alpha 5 for 48 hours.
