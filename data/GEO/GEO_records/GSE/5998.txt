TITLE
Identification of SRF binding sites in Three Human Cell types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with human promoter microarrays to identify 216 putative SRF binding sites in the human genome.  We performed independent quantitative PCR validation at over half of these sites that resulted in 146 sites we assert to be true binding sites at over 90% confidence.  Nearly half of the sites are bound by SRF in only one of the three cell types we tested, providing strong evidence for the diverse roles for SRF in different cell types. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
SRF binding was tested in three different cell lines.  It was validated by qPCR.  Using the proximal promoter arrays, we are assaying binding in approximately 19,000 human promoters.
