TITLE
Expression data from batch cultivations with the acidogenic Aspergillus niger wild type strain ATCC 1015 and the areB complete deletion strain constructed using ATCC 1015 as background strain with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
This approach aims at searching unidentified regulatory roles of the AreB transcription factor in the overall carbon metabolism of A. niger. A full areB gene deletion mutant was constructed and characterized in A. niger ATCC 1015. Both strains were grown on glucose or glycerol using ammonia as nitrogen source in batch cultivations and the transcriptome was analyzed using three biological replicated transcriptome experiments. Two areB gene deletion replicates, one on glucose and one on glycerol were discarded due to bad quality and therefore not included in the analysis. Samples for RNA extraction were collected and further processed for hybridization in custom designed Affymetrix microarrays containing probes for three Aspergillus species including A. niger.

DESIGN
Triplicate batch fermentations with the two Aspergillus niger strains used, the wild type A. niger strain ATCC 1015 and the areB complete gene deletion strain were carried out and transcriptome analysis was performed. Biomass from each batch cultivation was harvested in the exponential phase of growth and further processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
