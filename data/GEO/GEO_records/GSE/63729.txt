TITLE
Genomic Run On (GRO): determination of the nascent transcriptional rates and mRNA levels in several yeast mutants (PUB1 and NGR1)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analyzed the effect of PUB1 and NGR1 on the transcription rates, mRNA stabilities and mRNA levels by doing GRO experiments in a deletion mutants comparing with a wild type in both glucose (YPD) and galactose (YPGal) media. Some data for the wt in YPGal are not included because were already in GEO database:  GSE1002 accession number.

DESIGN
This study focus on the transcriptional activity of RNA pol II in yeast genes. S. cerevisiae cells grown in YPD or YPGal to exponential phase were subjected to Genomic Run On.  Data were normalized by the ArrayStat software. Home-made macroarrays containing 6035 ORF were used.
