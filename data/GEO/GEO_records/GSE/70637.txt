TITLE
Identification of gene expression changes in DLBCL cells by DNMT1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes in HT GCB-DLBCL cell lines transduced with non-silencing control shRNA or DNMT1 shRNA.

DESIGN
HT cells were transduced with lentivirus vectors expressing shRNA non-silencing control or shRNA targeting DNMT1 (shDNMT1) in duplicate for each shRNA.
