TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of WERI-Rb-1 (retinal cells) infected with Toxoplasma gondii over time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression patterms following infection of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in a clinically relevant retinal cell line over a time course of 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours. Parasites were washed off after 2 hours to ensure that gene expression changes are truly reflective of an on-going infection, and not on-going parasite invasion.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from Toxoplasma gondii infected for 2, 6 and 24 hours post-infected compared to mock-infected cells at the same time points
