TITLE
The S-adenosyl-homosteine hydrolase inhibitor DZNeP unspecifically affects histone methylation patterns in embryos and results in developmental aberrations

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNeP) is a promising cancer drug affecting the methylation status of histone lysine residues. To investigate the specificity and mode of action of DZNeP, zebrafish embryos displaying high histone methyltransferase activity were cultured with DZNeP and histone methylation (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3) was mapped by ChIP-chip genome-wide promoter at post-MBT stage (5.3 hpf) . We used a custom 2.1M probe HD promoter array (Nimblegen) for ChIP and input DNA hybridization. Peak detection was done using MA2C with P=10e-4 as cutoff.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip experiments were performed from  chromatin prepared by sonication after formaldehyde cross-linking, from embryos are the indicated developmental stages and ChIP DNA was hybridized onto the aforementioned Nimbegen promoter arrays.
