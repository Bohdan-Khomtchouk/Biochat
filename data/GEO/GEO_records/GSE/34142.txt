TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 88 microRNAs involved in human cell differentiation and development  in systemic sclerosis (SSc) dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal fibroblasts and SSc fibroblasts between the third and six subpassages were used for experiments. Total RNA was extracted from culture cells with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). MicroRNA isolation from total RNA was performed using RT2 qPCR-Grade miRNA Isolation Kit (SA Bioscience). For RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SABioscience), microRNAs were reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using RT2 miRNA First Strand Kit (SABiosciences). A mixture of equal amounts of cDNAs from 5 normal fibroblasts or 5 SSc fibroblasts was prepared. The cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix and the mixture was added into a 96-well RT2 miRNA PCR Array (SABiosciences) that included primer pairs for 88 human microRNAs.

DESIGN
Human dermal fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsy from the affected areas (dorsal forearm) of 5 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc and < 2 years of skin thickening. Control fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsies from 5 healthy donors. Control donors were each matched with a SSc patient for age, sex, and biopsy site.
