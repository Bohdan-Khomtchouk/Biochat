TITLE
Gene expression of polyoma middle T antigen induced mammary tumors [AKXD x PyMT]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse genetic crosses were established between the PyMT model of metastatic breast cancer and AKXD strain.  Tumors were harvested from the animals for gene expression analysis to identify genes and network modules associated with progression to distant metastatic disease.

DESIGN
Gene expression of  56 samples from the AKXD crosses were assayed on Affymetrix chips
