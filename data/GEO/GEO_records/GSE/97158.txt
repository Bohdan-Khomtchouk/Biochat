TITLE
Transcriptional responses induced by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood RNA-Seq was applied to investigate gene expression kinetics in Tanzanian males who underwent controlled malaria infection by intradermal injection with aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites.

DESIGN
