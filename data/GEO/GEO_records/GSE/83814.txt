TITLE
Transcriptional changes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis reactivation from persistence

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
We observe that M. tuberculosis reactivation is associated with a global gene expression program that defines the initiation of an ordered programmed reactivation process in the lag phase.

DESIGN
We characterized the global transcriptomic profiles of M. tuberculosis during reactivation from hypoxia-induced persistence, at day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, in triplicates, and performed network analysis.
