TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA profiling for identification of specific body fluid markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling of four kinds of body fluid samples (blood, saliva, semen and vaginal swab). The purpose of the present study was selection of specific mRNA markers for identification of the four body fluids. Results provide important information about gene expression level of each body fluid for forensic science.

DESIGN
Total RNAs isolated from four kinds of body fluid samples (blood, saliva, semen and vaginal swab) obtained from Korean volunteers

PLATFORM
GPL14951 Illumina HumanHT-12 WG-DASL V4.0 R2 expression beadchip
