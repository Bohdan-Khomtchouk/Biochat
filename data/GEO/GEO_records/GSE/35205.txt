TITLE
miRNA expression data from xlpra2 and normal canine retinas

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs associated with retinal development and degeneration in dogs affected with xlpra2, an early-onset canine retinal degeneration caused by a microdeletion in RPGRORF15. XLPRA2-mutant and normal retinas were selected at different ages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA-specific microarrays.
