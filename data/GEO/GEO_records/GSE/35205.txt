TITLE
miRNA expression data from xlpra2 and normal canine retinas

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs associated with retinal development and degeneration in dogs affected with xlpra2, an early-onset canine retinal degeneration caused by a microdeletion in RPGRORF15. XLPRA2-mutant and normal retinas were selected at different ages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA-specific microarrays.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was analysed at three crucial ages for the xlpra2 disease: 3, 7, and 16 wks. Three xlpra2-mutant and four normal retinas (biological replicates) were analysed at both 3 and 16 wks of age, while 4 biological replicates per group (both xlpra2 and normal retinas) were analysed at 7 wks of age.
