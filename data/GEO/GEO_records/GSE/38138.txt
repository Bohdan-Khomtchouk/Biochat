TITLE
Hepatic gene expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice fed a phloridzin diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phloridzin is a dihydrochalcone typically contained in apples. A diet containing 0.5 % phloridzin significantly improves hyperglycemia but not hypoinsulinemia and tissue lipid peroxidation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice after 14 days. The phloridzin diet has no effect on the alteration of hepatic gene expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. A quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed a reversal of the STZ induction of the sodium/glucose cotransporter gene Sglt1 and the drug-metabolizing enzyme genes Cyp2b10 and Ephx1 in the small intestine of mice fed a 0.5% phloridzin diet. These mice also showed a reversal of the STZ-mediated renal induction of the glucose-regulated facilitated glucose transporter gene Glut2. Dietary phloridzin improved the abnormal elevations in blood glucose level and the overexpression of Sglt1, Cyp2b10 and Ephx1 in the small intestine of STZ-induced diabetic mice.

DESIGN
Six-week-old male mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each, housed in groups of 3 per cage. After 1 week mice were intraperitoneally injected with STZ.  Mice (n=6) in the untreated control group did not receive any treatment. After 1 week, 18 mice showing non-fasting blood glucose levels of 330-590 mg/dL were divided into 3 groups: one group was fed with AIN93G only (control group), the others with an AIN93G diet containing 0.1% or 0.5% phloridzin (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 weeks.
