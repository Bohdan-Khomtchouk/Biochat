TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression during differentiation in C2C12 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigate the genome-wide gene expression profiles of 50% and 95% confluent C2C12 myoblasts and C2C12 myotubes differentiated for 24 and 48 hours.

DESIGN
Triplicate total RNA samples were obtained from 50% and 95% confluent C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes differentiated for 24 and 48 hours.
