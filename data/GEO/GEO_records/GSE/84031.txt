TITLE
Equine dendritic cells generated with horse serum have enhanced functionality in comparison to dendritic cells generated with fetal bovine serum

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
EqMoDC generated with horse serum-supplemented medium showed improved morphological characteristics, higher cell viability and exhibited a more robust performance in the functional T cell assays. The study is further described in A. Ziegler, H. Everett, E. Hamza et al., BMC Vet Research, 2016

DESIGN
A two chip study, comparing monocytes, iMoDC and mMoDC derived in vitro from three horses using total RNA extract
