TITLE
Functional Genomics of miR-2909 in HeLa229 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Since HeLa229 cells were found unable to express miR-2909 gene expression in their native state, these cells were used as archetype model to explore the functional genomics of miR-2909.

DESIGN
HeLa229 cells were transfected with either control vector or miR-2909 expression vector and subsequently these cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 nutrient medium for 48 hrs at 37Â°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of this incubation period the cells from each well were processed for RNA isolation followed by microarray analysis of the effector genes.
