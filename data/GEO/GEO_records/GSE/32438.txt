TITLE
Expression data from Porcine pregnant

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Gene differential expression in different pregnant periods and different tissues are detected.

DESIGN
Sow ovary and myometrium were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 9 pigs were divided into three time-points groups: non-pregnant (NP, n=3), early pregnant (EP, n=3), and late pregnant (LP, n=3). The differentially expressed genes in each group were identified.
