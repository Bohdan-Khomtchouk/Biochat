TITLE
Characterization of Dopaminergic Neurons Derived from A Tyrosine Hydroxylase Reporter Stem Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Generation of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons from human pluripotent stem cells provides a platform for inquiry into basic and translational studies of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). However, heterogeneity in differentiation in vitro makes it difficult to identify mDA neurons in culture or in vivo following transplantation. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, is a well-established marker for mDA neurons. Here, we report the generation of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line with a TH-RFP (red fluorescent protein) that was generated via insertion of an RFP sequence downstream of the TH coding sequence. We validated that endogenous TH expression was unaffected by genetic modification; RFP faithfully mimicked TH expression during differentiation. Use of this TH-RFP reporter cell line enabled purification of mDA-like neurons from heterogeneous cultures with subsequent characterization of neuron transcriptional and epigenetic programs (global binding profiles of H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)) at four different stages of development.  We anticipate that tools and data described here will contribute to development of mDA neurons for applications in disease modeling and/or drug screening and cell replacement therapies for PD.
