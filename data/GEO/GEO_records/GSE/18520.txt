TITLE
Whole-genome oligonucleotide expression analysis of papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To demonstrate the use of a whole-genome oligonucleotide array to perform expression profiling on a series of microdissected late-stage, high-grade papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinomas to establish a prognostic gene signature correlating with survival and to identify novel survival factors in ovarian cancer. Advanced stage papillary serous tumors of the ovary are responsible for the majority of ovarian cancer deaths, yet the molecular determinants modulating patient survival are poorly characterized. We identify and validate a prognostic gene expression signature correlating with survival in a series of microdissected serous ovarian tumors.

DESIGN
We identified 53 advanced stage, high-grade primary tumor specimens and 10 normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) brushings.
