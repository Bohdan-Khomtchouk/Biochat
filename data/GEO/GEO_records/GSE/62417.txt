TITLE
Gene expression data of human primary keratinocytes with control or DDX6 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stem and progenitor cells maintain the tissue they reside in for life by regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation. How this is done is not well understood. Here, we report that DDX6 is necessary for maintaining human epidermal progenitor cell self-renewal. Global gene expression profiling using U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to deteremine the genes perturbed by knockdown of DDX6.

DESIGN
For gene expression profiling, cultured primary human keratinocytes were knocked down for control (CTL) or DDX6. RNA was harvested from the cells 7 days after knockdown. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 plus arrays was performed on duplicate samples.
