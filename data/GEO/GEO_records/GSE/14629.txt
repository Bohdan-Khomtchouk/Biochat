TITLE
Effects of DEHP on the hepatic expression of a selection of mouse genes related to nuclear receptor signaling.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phthalates are industrial additives widely used as plasticizers. In addition to deleterious effects on male genital development, population studies have documented correlations between phthalates exposure and impacts on reproductive tract development and on the metabolic syndrome in male adults. In this study we investigated potential mechanisms underlying the impact of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) on adult mouse liver in vivo. A parallel analysis of hepatic transcript and metabolic profiles from adult mice exposed to varying DEHP doses was performed. Hepatic genes modulated by DEHP are predominantly PPARα targets. However, the induction of prototypic cytochrome P450 genes strongly supports the activation of additional NR pathways, including Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR). Integration of transcriptomic and metabonomic profiles revealed a correlation between the impacts of DEHP on genes and metabolites related to heme synthesis and on the Rev-erbα pathway that senses endogenous heme level. Keywords: Treatment effect

DESIGN
One-color macroarrays, 4 experimental conditions: Control mice (vehicle treated), mice treated with di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) at 30 mg/kg/day (D30), 180 mg/kg/day (D180) or 1100 mg/kg/day (D1100) for 14 days, Biological replicates: 6 controls, 4 D30, 4 D180, 5 D1100, One replicate per array
