TITLE
Global changes in Mycoplasma gallisepticum Phase-Variable Lipoprotein Gene vlhA Expression during in vivo infection of the natural chicken host

ORGANISM
Mycoplasma gallisepticum

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to assess the vlhA gene expression of M. gallisepticum at various time over the course of early infection in the chicken host, and in in-vitro culture before innoculation and after recovery

DESIGN
Assessment of vlhA gene expression from broth grown input cultures (n=1), M. gallisepticum collected directly from the trachea over 7 days (n=5 per day), and M. gallisepticum recovered and passaged in-vitro 5 or 10 times (n=2 per passage)
