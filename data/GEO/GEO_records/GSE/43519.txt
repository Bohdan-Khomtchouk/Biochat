TITLE
Peripheral circulating mRNA profiling in predicting the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral circulating mRNA expression levels in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The hypothesis test was that chemoradiation alters the circulating mRNA expression profiles and the profiling is predictive of pathological response. Results provide information on the response of circulating mRNAs to chemoradiation and identify novel biomarkers or targets in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from peripheral whole blood before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 21 patients with 42 samples were analyzed. The expression profiles from pathological complete responders were compared to non-complete responders.
