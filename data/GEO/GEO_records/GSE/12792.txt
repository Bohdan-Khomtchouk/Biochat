TITLE
Renal Proximal Tube Epithelial Cells at 24h and 1% oxygen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim of the study was to characterize the transcriptional response of human primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) to low oxygen stress.

DESIGN
Passage 4 renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were exposed to a humidified atmosphere consisting of either 5% CO2 and 95% air (20% O2, normoxia) or 5% CO2, 1% oxygen and 95% nitrogen (hypoxia) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted immediately after exposure. Three independent biological replicates were performed, resulting in 6 samples (3 control and 3 low oxygen).
