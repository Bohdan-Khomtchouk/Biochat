DNA Methylation in Paraganglioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a whole-genome DNA methylation assay (27K Illumina) in a large, well characterized Discovery Series of 123 PPGL with (n=24) and without (n=99) metastases.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 123 PPGL samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
