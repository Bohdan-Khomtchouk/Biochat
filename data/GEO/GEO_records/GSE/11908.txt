TITLE
Construction of a modular analysis framework for blood Genomics Studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We designed a strategy for microarray analysis that is based on the identification of transcriptional modules formed by genes coordinately expressed in multiple disease data sets. Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data.
