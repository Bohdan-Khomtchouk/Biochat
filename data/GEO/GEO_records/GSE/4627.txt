TITLE
Telomere dysfunction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze the prevalence of signalling induced by acute telomere dysfunction (as induced by TRF2DBDM expression = Dataset 1) and in TERC- compared to TERC+ HCC (Dataset 2). Keywords: acute telomere dysfunction, hepatocellular cancer

DESIGN
Presented are gene expression data from: Dataset 1:  Mouse liver 48h after i.v. infection of p53-/- mice with Ad TRF2DBDM compared to Ad GFP (2x10^10 PFU) (GSM103546, GSM103547) and Dataset 2:  p53-/- heptaocellular carcinoma (HCC) from mTERC+ HBs (GSM103548, GSM103549, GSM103553) compared to mTERC-, HBs  (GSM103550, GSM103551, GSM103552) transgenic mice. All mice were in a C57BL/6J background. Dataset 1: Liver RNA was extracted 48h after adenoviral infection (n=3 mice/group), samples were pooled for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Dataset 2: RNA was extracted from HCC of 12-15month old mTERC+ and mTERC- mice (n=3 mice/group). Individual tumors were hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Differentially expressed gene clusters were identified using Array Assist 4.0 (Stratagene).
