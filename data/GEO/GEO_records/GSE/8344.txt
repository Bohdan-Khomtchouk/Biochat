TITLE
Effect PPARb/d knockout in white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissue of PPARb/d knockout mice. Data may point towards putative target genes of PPARb/d and thus the function of PPARb/d in white adipose tissue. Datasets were used to identify glycogen synthase 2 as novel PPAR target. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count
