TITLE
Effect PPARb/d knockout in white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissue of PPARb/d knockout mice. Data may point towards putative target genes of PPARb/d and thus the function of PPARb/d in white adipose tissue. Datasets were used to identify glycogen synthase 2 as novel PPAR target. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Three month old male PPARb/d knock-out mice were on a mixed background (Sv129/C57BL/6). Wild-type littermates served as control animals. Animals received standard chow. Epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) was removed and total RNA was isolated and pooled afterwards (five animals per group). Pooled RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays arrays. Five microgram total RNA was labeled according to the ENZO-protocol, fragmented and hybridized according to Affymetrix protocols.
