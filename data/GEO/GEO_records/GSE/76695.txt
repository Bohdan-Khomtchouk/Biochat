TITLE
Role of IL33 on muscle regneration in aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compare the effect of IL-33 vs PBS on muscle regneration from 22-month old mice 8 days post-injury. These analyses from whole muscle provide insight into the role of IL-33 on regeneration in the context of aging.

DESIGN
The tibialis anterior muscle from male C57BL/6 mice (22 months old) were cryo-injured using a liquid nitrogen chilled metal probe for 8 seconds. Mice received 2 ug of rIL-33 via intraparitoneal injection the day prior and the day following cryoinjury. 8 days post-injury whole muscle was harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole muscle was then homogenized directly in TriZol and gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
