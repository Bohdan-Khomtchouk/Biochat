TITLE
Sequential expression of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum pathogenicity factors during infection of Brassica napus as revealed by RNA-Seq analysis

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum-infected B. napus leaves during a timecourse after inoculation.

DESIGN
This is a time course experiment.  Sclerotinia hyphae were place on detached B. napus leaves, then the combined tissues were harvested at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-innoculation.  3 biological replicates were collected for each time point, and sclerotinia from liquid medium was used as a control.
