TITLE
A High-Resolution Enhancer Atlas of the Developing Telencephalon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mammalian telencephalon plays critical roles in cognition, motor function, and emotion. While many of the genes required for its development have been identified, the distant‐acting regulatory sequences orchestrating their in vivo expression are mostly unknown. Here we describe a digital atlas of in vivo enhancers active in subregions of the developing telencephalon. We identified over 4,600 candidate embryonic forebrain enhancers and studied the in vivo activity of 329 of these sequences in transgenic mouse embryos. We generated serial sets of histological brain sections for 145 reproducible forebrain enhancers, resulting in a publicly accessible web‐based enhancer atlas comprising over 33,000 sections. We show how this large collection of annotated telencephalon enhancers can be used to study the regulatory architecture of individual genes, to examine the sequence motif content of enhancers, and to drive targeted reporter or effector protein expression in experimental applications. Furthermore, we used epigenomic analysis of human and mouse cortex tissue to directly compare the genome‐wide enhancer architecture in these species. This atlas provides a primary resource for investigating gene regulatory mechanisms of telencephalon development and enables studies of the role of distant‐acting enhancers in neurodevelopmental disorders.
