TITLE
Body size regulation and TGF-beta Sma/Mab pathway: sma L4 vs N2 L4

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To find genes downstream of the TGF-beta Sma/Mab pathway associated with body size regulation in C. elegans.

DESIGN
Three replicates comparing RNA from sma-2(e502) L4 whole animal with RNA from wild-type L4 whole animal, in which one is dye flipped. Plus one array comparing RNA from sma-4(e729) L4 whole animal with RNA from wild-type L4 whole animal.

PLATFORM
