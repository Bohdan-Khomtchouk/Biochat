TITLE
Gene expression of genetically related and unrelated human embryonic stem cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of sibling human ES cell lines are more similar to each other than unrelated cell lines. Undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells were used for analysis. We sought to determine whether genetic differences underly variations between different human ES cell lines. Sibling cell lines that are genetically closer than non-sibling cell provided the opportunity to determine this. We found that sibling cell lines are more similar in their gene expression patterns than unrelated cell lines.

DESIGN
16 Samples. HUES 55-58 are related, so are HUES 50 and HUES51, and so are HUES 62 and HUES 63.
