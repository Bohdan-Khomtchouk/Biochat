TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver tissue from SKH:QS mice treated with 68ZnO sunscreens

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZnO nanoparticles can elicit a range of perturbed cell responses in vitro.  Exposure to topically applied sunscreens containing ZnO particles may or may not elicit a biological effect in mice. We aimed to determine whether exposure to topically applied ZnO particles manufactured as either microparticles or nanoparticles could elicit a biological response in liver tissue isolated from treated mice, compared to the sunscreen formulation only or untreated mice.

DESIGN
Sunscreens containing 68ZnO microparticles, 68ZnO nanoparticles or no metal oxide particles at all (formulation only) were applied to the backs of SKH:QS mice six times over four days. On the fifth day mice were sacrificed and liver tissue was harvested for RNA isolation and whole genome transcriptional profiling, comparing the expression profiles of treated mice with untreated mice.  Two separate experiments were conducted, one using virgin mice and the other using pregnant mice (~17d gestation)
