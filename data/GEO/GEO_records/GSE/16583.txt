TITLE
Genomic landscape of meningiomas: genotyping

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Meningiomas are one of the most common adult brain tumors.  For most patients, surgical excision is curative.  However, up to 20% recur.  Currently, the molecular determinants predicting recurrence and malignant transformation are lacking.  We performed global genetic and genomic analysis of 85 meningioma samples of various grades. Copy number alterations were assessed by 100K SNP arrays and correlated with gene expression, proliferation indices, and clinical outcome.  In addition to chromosome 22q loss, which was detected in the majority of clinical samples, chromosome 18q and 6q loss significantly predicted recurrence and was associated with anaplastic histology.  Five " classes " of meningiomas were detected by gene expression analysis that correlated with copy number alterations, recurrence risk, and malignant histology.  These classes more accurately predicted tumor recurrence than Ki-67 index, the gold standard for determining risk of recurrence, and highlight substantial expression heterogeneity between meningiomas. These data offer the most complete description of the genomic landscape of meningiomas and provide a set of tools that could be used to more accurately stratify meningioma patients into prognostic risk groups.

DESIGN
Tumor biopsies from 53 female and 32 male subjects with sporadic meningioma were identified from the UCLA Neuro-oncology Program Tissue Bank through institutional review board approved protocols.  57 tumors were designated " benign " WHO I, 20 tumors were " atypical " WHO II, and 8 were " anaplastic " WHO III. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on DNA extracted from flash frozen meningioma tumors.
