TITLE
Genome wide gene expression profiles of Drosophila l(3)mbt larval brains and cultured tumors

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mutants in the Drosophila gene lethal (3) malignant brain tumor cause malignant growth in the larval brain. This data shows the changes in gene expression profile associated to mutations in l(3)mbt, both in situ in third instar larval brains and in tumors cultured for 1 5 and 10 (T1, T5, T10) rounds  of allograft culture

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of l(3)mbt[E2] and l(3)mbt[ts1] homozygous and transheterozygous larval brains raised at restrictive temperatures (29º C). We obtained three replicates for l(3)mbt[E2]  at 17ªC (MBT_E2_17), l(3)mbt[ts1] at 17ºC (MBT_TS1_17), l(3)mbt[E2]  at 29ºC (MBT_E2_29) and the transheterozygous at 29ºC (MBT_TS1_ME2), and six replicates l(3)mbt[ts1] at 29ºC (MBT_TS1_29). We also obtained three replicates for l(3)mbt[ts1] tumors at the first (T1), fifth (T5) and tenth (T10) round of allograft culture in adult flies, and six replicates for wild type w[1118] flies (WT).
