TITLE
Expression data generated from post-mortem human brain tissue originating from neurologically and neuropathologically control individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data set was generated by the UK Brain Expression Consortium and consists of gene expression data generated from post-mortem human brain samples, dissected from 10 brain regions and originating from a large cohort of neurologically and neuropathologically normal individuals. The UK Brain Expression Consortium has generated gene expression data on a large cohort of neurologically and neuropathologically normal individuals in order to better understand gene expression differences across the human brain. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
1231 samples are analysed in total and these samples originate from 134 Caucasian individuals. From each individual, up to ten brain regions were sampled and analysed. Gene-level and exon-level analyses result in 2462 GEO Samples.
