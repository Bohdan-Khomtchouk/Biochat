TITLE
Gene expression of Ovarian Tumor Samples measured by Agilent microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to collect ovarian cancer samples for gene expression profiling (n = 529). The data will be used in several publications, the first of which described molecular signatures associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtype

DESIGN
Ovarian tumors (n=529) were compared to a reference pool of 106 ovarian samples. Mixed reference includes normal, benign, borderline, and malignant sample of various histolgies.
