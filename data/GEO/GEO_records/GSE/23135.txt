TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of time-dependent gene expression in MCF-10A cells treated with the EGFR-specific inhibitor gefitinib for 45 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results of blocking EGFR kinase activity in MCF-10A cells by treatment with gefitinib and measuring gene expression as a function of time provides information as to what genes are regulated by EGFR in these nontransformed breast epithelial cells.

DESIGN
MCF-10A cells were treated with the EGFR-specific small molecule kinase inhibitor gefitinib for 45 hours.  Total RNA was collected every 3 hours from parallel cultures throughout the 45 hour duration of treatment and genome-wide analysis of expression was performed on RNA from each time point (total 16 time points, starting at 0 hours treatment).
