TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dental follicle cells after 48 hours of transfection in vitro with a DLX3 plasmid and an empty vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression profiles in dental follicle cells after 48 hours of overexpression with the transcription factor DLX3.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental follicle cells after 48 hours of transfection with a DLX3 expressions plasmid and for control with an empty vector.
