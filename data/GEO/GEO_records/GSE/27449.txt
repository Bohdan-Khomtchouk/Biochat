TITLE
Changes of mRNA expressin in rat kidney inner medulla in response to dDAVP stimulation/ withdrawal

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The E3 ubiquitin -protein ligases (E3s) plays a role as regulators of protein trafficking and degradation. We aimed to identify E3s in rat kidney which are associated with dDAVP-induced urine concentration.

DESIGN
Kidney inner medulla collected from vehicle treated control (n=2), dDAVP infusion for 5 d (D5d, n=2) and  3 h-withdrawal of dDAVP after 5 d-infusion (D5d-3h, n=2) groups were subjected to a transcriptome analysis.
