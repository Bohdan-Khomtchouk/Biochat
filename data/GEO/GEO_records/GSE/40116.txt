TITLE
mRNA profiling of glucose-repressed 14-3-3 and hdac yeast mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Previous results suggest that Bmh might inhibit the activity of the transcription factor Adr1 after binding to Adr1-dependent promoters. In a strain lacking the two major histone deacetylases, Hda1 and Rpd3 (hdac∆), Adr1 is bound to its target promoters recruiting what appears to be an inactive RNA ploymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC). To determine whether Bmh activity inhibits this inactive PIC and the generality of this effect on glucose-repressed gene expression, the mRNA profiles of wild type, bmh mutant, hdac mutant, and bmh hdac mutant cells grown in high glucose medium were compared.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were purified from triplicate cultures of W303-1A (wild type), YLL1087 (bmh1-ts bmh2∆), CTY-TY44 (hda1∆ rpd3∆) and KBY3 (bmh1-ts bmh2∆ hda1∆ rpd3∆) cells exponentially growing in YP broth containing 5% glucose and then profiled using Affymetrix Yeast 2.0 arrays.
