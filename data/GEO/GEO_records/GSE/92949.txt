TITLE
Profiling of AKVPL derived tumors after depletion of Lgr5+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) CD45 negative, EpCAM positive bulk tumor cells from Apcmin/+;KrasLSL-G12D/+;VillinCre; Lgr5DTReGFP;p53KO (AKVPL) intestinal tumours at different time points after a single dose of vehicle saline or diphteria toxin. The " SAMPLE_ID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech. The ID of this project in Genentech's ExpressionPlot database is PRJ0011163

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of cells from AKVPL murine derived intestinal tumours after Diphteria Toxin (DT) mediated depletion of Lgr5+ cells

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
