TITLE
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 : Control vs. norfloxacin treated

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter oleivorans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. oleivorans DR1 cells comparing control untreated wild type cells with norfloxacin treated wild type cells.

DESIGN
To identify genes important for norfloxacin stress response in A. oleivorans DR1, the cells were grown to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.5) and treated with norfloxacin (4Î¼g/ml) over a period of 15 min.
