TITLE
Reactive oxygen species induced gene expression changes on dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of ROS induced genes on dendritic cells Dendritic cells were incubated for 15 min with or without a ROS inhibitor (DPI), washed extensively and incubated for 30 min with a chemical allergen (DNFB), hydrogen peroxide, and vehicle alone in HBSS containing DPI or vehicle. After washed extensively, the samples were post-incubated for 5.5 h with DNFB, hydrogen peroxide, or vehicle in complete culture medium containing DPI or vehicle.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cells treated with a chemical allergen, hydrogen peroxide, and vehicle alone in the presence or absence of a ROS inhibitor.
