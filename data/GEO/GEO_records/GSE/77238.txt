TITLE
Expression profiling of E15.5 pancreases from pancreas-specific Jarid2 knockout (KO) embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Jarid2, a member of the Jumanji family of proteins, is a developmental regulator that is necessary for proper mouse development and stem cell differentiation.  To investigate the specific functions of Jarid2 during pancreas development, we generated pancreas-specific Jarid2 mutants. We used microarrays to determine gene expression changes resulting from deletion of the Jarid2 gene in the pancreas.

DESIGN
Pancreases from pancreas-specific Jarid2 KO and wild-type embryos were harvested at embryonic day 15.5. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
