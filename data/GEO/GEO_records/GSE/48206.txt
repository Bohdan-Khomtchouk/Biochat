TITLE
Gene Expression Profile for knocking down Tet1 in pre-iPSCs culturing in Vc medium.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tet1 is a hydroxylase known for its role in the conversion of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) involved in the possible active demethylation process and gene expression regulation. As somatic cell reprogramming involves the re-activation of pluripotency genes and the silencing of somatic ones, it remains unclear the role of Tet1 in the reprogramming process. Here, we performed RNAseq for WT and knocking down Tet1 in two pre-iPSCs cell lines, pre2-2 and pre3.

DESIGN
Using two pre-iPSCs cell lines: pre2-2 and pre3, cultured by mES medium(+lif), transfected siCtrl/siTet1 siRNA or non-treatment, then, after 16h, the medium were replaced by mES(+lif) medium plus Vc(50ug/ml), total RNA was extracted after another 32h later for RNAseq.
