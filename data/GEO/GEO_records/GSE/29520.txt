TITLE
ChIP-chip from Drosophila egg chambers using antibody recognizing tetra-acetylated histone H4

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of tetra-acetylated histone H4 followed by hybridization to genome-wide tiling microarrays demonstrated that tetra-acetylated H4 is enriched at the two chorion Drosophila amplicons in follicle cells (DAFC) as well as other non-amplified loci
