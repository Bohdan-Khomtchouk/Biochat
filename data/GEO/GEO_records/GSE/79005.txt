TITLE
Profile of microRNAs in human umblical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polychlorinated biphenyl exposure alters the expression profile of microRNAs in HUVECs

DESIGN
Primary human endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260, at 10 µM. After a 16-h exposure, RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 4.0 arrays for high throughput detection.
