Expt. B; Daily Rhythm in Expression of

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Biological processes are optimized by circadian and circannual biological timing systems.  In vertebrates, the pineal gland plays an essential role in these systems by converting time into a hormonal signal, melatonin; in all vertebrates, circulating melatonin is elevated at night, independent of lifestyle. We have analyzed the rat pineal transcriptome at mid-day and mid-night to identify genes that exhibit night/day changes in expression. Keywords: Time course (2 points)
