TITLE
Expt. B; Daily Rhythm in Expression of > 600 Genes in the Rodent Pineal Gland: Dominant Role of Adrenergic/cAMP Signaling

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Biological processes are optimized by circadian and circannual biological timing systems.  In vertebrates, the pineal gland plays an essential role in these systems by converting time into a hormonal signal, melatonin; in all vertebrates, circulating melatonin is elevated at night, independent of lifestyle. We have analyzed the rat pineal transcriptome at mid-day and mid-night to identify genes that exhibit night/day changes in expression. Keywords: Time course (2 points)

DESIGN
Rat pineal glands were obtained at mid-day and mid-night for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. Triplicates of pooled pineal glands were analyzed at each timepoint. A similar set of samples was taken from a transgenic rat line (DN-Fra-2; Smith et al. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 3704-3713).
