TITLE
Expression data from interleukin-stimulated HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the hematopoietic microenvironment, endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation and trafficking. We previously demonstrated that EC stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) induce the generation of dendritic cells from CD34(+) stem cells, whereas in contrast, interleukins were capable of inducing the proliferation of hematopoietic and myeloid progenitors. In order to identify potentially new soluble factors which greatly impact the self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), we examined the expression profiles of IL-1ß, IL-3 and IL-6 stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

DESIGN
we processed seven different umbilical cords and isolated 129 samples for total RNA, and pooled them into 18 groups corresponding to each stimulant, control and time point.
