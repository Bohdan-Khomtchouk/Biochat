TITLE
Analyzing cold tolerance mechanism in transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Low temperatures may cause severe growth inhibition and mortality in fish. In order to understand the mechanism of cold tolerance, a transgenic zebrafish Tg (smyd1:m3ck) model was established to study the effect of energy homeostasis during cold stress. The muscle-specific promoter Smyd1 was used to express the carp muscle form III of creatine kinase (M3-CK), which maintained enzymatic activity at a relatively low temperature, in zebrafish skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization showed that M3-CK was expressed strongly in the skeletal muscle. When exposed to 13°C, Tg (smyd1:m3ck) fish maintained their swimming behavior, while the wild-type could not. Energy measurements showed that the concentration of ATP increased in Tg (smyd1:m3ck) versus wild-type fish at 28°C. After 2 h at 13°C, ATP concentrations were 2.16-fold higher in Tg (smyd1:m3ck) than in wild-type (P < 0.05). At 13°C, the ATP concentration in Tg (smyd1:m3ck) fish and wild-type fish was 63.3% and 20.0%, respectively, of that in wild-type fish at 28°C. Microarray analysis revealed differential expression of 1249 transcripts in Tg (smyd1:m3ck) versus wild-type fish under cold stress. Biological processes that were significantly overrepresented in this group included circadian rhythm, energy metabolism, lipid transport, and metabolism. These results are clues to understanding the mechanisms underlying temperature acclimation in fish.

DESIGN
Gene expression in triplicate samples of m3ck-13°C, m3ck-28°C, wt-13°C, and wt-28°C was assessed. Twelve microarray experiments were performed, each with three fish.
