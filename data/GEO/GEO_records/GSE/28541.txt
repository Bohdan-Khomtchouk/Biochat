TITLE
Characterization of gene expression profiles of gastric cancer in MD Anderson Cancer Center cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical heterogeneity of gastric cancer reflected in unequal outcome of treatment is poorly defined in molecular level, and molecular subtypes and their associated biomarkers have not been established to improve prognostification and treatment of gastric cancer. Using microarray technologies, we analyzed gene expression profiling data from patients with advanced gastric cancer and uncovered potential prognostic subtypes and identify gene expression signature associated with prognosis.
