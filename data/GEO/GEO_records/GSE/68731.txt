TITLE
Expression analysis of RPA12Î” in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RPA12 is a subunit of RNA polymerase I. We used microarrays to know the effect RPA12 deltion in lipid metabolism and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Stationary phase cells were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetric microarrays

PLATFORM
