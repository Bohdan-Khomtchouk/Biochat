TITLE
POS-1 protects posterior gut specification by blocking GLD-3/2 polyadenylation of anterior factor neg-1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The Poly(A)-Tail focused RNA-seq, or PAT-seq approach was utilised to determine the gene expression, poly(A)-site and polyadenylation state of the transcriptome of early C. elegans embryos having been depleated for a series of RNA binding proteins. Namely;  pos-1 and mex-5 were independently knocked down using dsRNA expressing E. coli HT115(DE3) fed to ~100,000 starved/synchronized L1 larvae. When half of the population reached adulthood and half were still in the L4 stage, worms were bleached and embryos harvested and stored in Trizol. This ensured an enrichment of early embryos between 1 and 24 cell stage. mex-6(pk440) were synchronized and grown on OP50 until the same time point and embryos harvested in the same manner. Since prolonged gld-3 and gld-2 RNAi result in sterility, starved/synchronized L1 larvae were fed diluted OP50 (200uL of concentrated OP50 diluted in 2mL of M9 and starved L1s) for 16 hours. At that point the OP50 had been mostly consumed by the larvae and concentrated gld-3 or gld-2 dsRNA expressing E. coli were added to the plates. When half of the population reached adulthood and half were still in the L4 stage, worms were bleached and embryos harvested and stored in Trizol. Total RNA was isolated using standard procedures.
