TITLE
Characterization of transcriptional and fitness effects of a loss of function mutation in rho

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
In order to study the effects of a mutation to the transcriptional termination regulator Rho (referred to as rho*), we made use of expression microarrays to observe the direct and indirect effects of rho* on gene expression. In addition, we used arrays to map the fitness of strains from transposon mutagenized libraries under four conditions, showing that in each case the majority of genes with significant fitness effects were dependent on the genotype at rho.

DESIGN
For expression arrays, we performed two-color microarrays comparing transcript levels in rho* and wild type cells during exponential growth in glucose minimal media. For selection experiments, transposon insertions were mapped through selective amplification of genomic regions adjacent to them. We then measured the fitness effects of insertions throughout the genome using two-color microarrays, comparing amplified DNA from a population grown under a selective condition of interest to an isogenic control population grown under a reference condition (glucose minimal media). All arrays were performed in duplicate, and the source material for the duplicates came from separate biological replicates.
