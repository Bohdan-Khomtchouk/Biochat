TITLE
In utero cigarette smoke (IUS) exposure, sex differences and disease associations in the developing human fetal lung transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole human fetal lung microRNA transcriptome profiles from estimated gestational ages 54 to 137 days post conception. Maternal cigarette smoking status is indicated by cotinine levels measured in the corresponding placenta.
