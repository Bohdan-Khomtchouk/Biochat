TITLE
Hepatocytes-HepaRG reprogramming.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular mechanisms and environmental inducers contributing to reprogramming of hepatocytes into progenitors in HCC context, we used the HepaRG cell line as model.

DESIGN
We performed transcriptomic analysis at various time-points during this process; 0h, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 24h and 48h.
