TITLE
Cross species hybridization of human cancer cells co-cultured with mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts (Illumina mouse-6)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brain metastases are highly resistant to chemotherapy. Brain metastases are surrounded and infiltrated by activated astrocytes. To examine the genes whose expression is associated with chemo-resistance of brain-metastasized cancer cells, gene expression data were collected and analyzed from breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells co-cultured with astrocytes. Fibroblast cells were used as control.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from co-cultured cells and hybridized to human microarray and mouse microarrays to detect human cell and mouse cell specific gene expression data.
