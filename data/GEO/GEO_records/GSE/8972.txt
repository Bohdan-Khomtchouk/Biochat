TITLE
Expression profiling of the developing and mature Nrl -/- mouse retina (Yoshida et al. 2004, HMG)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The rod photoreceptor-specific neural retina leucine zipper protein Nrl is essential for rod differentiation and plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. In the mouse retina, rods account for 97% of the photoreceptors; however, in the absence of Nrl (Nrl-/-), no rods are present and a concomitant increase in cones is observed. Using mouse GeneChips (Affymetrix), we have generated expression profiles of the wild-type and Nrl-/- retina at three time-points representing distinct stages of photoreceptor differentiation. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Both the Nrl-/- mice and wild type controls were of a matched mixed genetic background (R1 and C57BL/6 strains).
