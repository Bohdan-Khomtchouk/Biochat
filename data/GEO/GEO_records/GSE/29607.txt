TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of effector T cells from leptin-receptor-deficient mice and wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes differentially expressed during leptin receptor deficiency, which is partly responsible for the inhibition of T cell effector functions. Mouse CD4+CD25- T cells were purified from leptin-receptor-deficient mice and wild type mice, and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 12h. Six mice of each genotype were used.

DESIGN
Leptin receptor deficiency-induced gene expression profiles were evaluated in mouse effector T cells from db/db mice and compared to the ones observed in their WT counterpart (db/+ mice). Two independent experiments were performed, and in each of them, 3 mice/group were pooled.
