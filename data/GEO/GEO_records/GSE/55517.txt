TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in CD4+CD8+ double pos (DP) thymocytes upon depletion of Ubiquitin specific protease 8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T-cell-specific deletion of USP8 (USP8ffCD4Cre) revealed that USP8 is required for thymocyte transition to the CD4+ and CD8+ single positive (SP) stages. To evaluate underlying mechanisms, gene expression profilling was performed in CD4+CD8+ double pos thymocytes derived from control (USP8ff and USP8ffCD4Cre) mice.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of two groups of USP8fl/fl and USP8fl/flCD4Cre thymocytes. Material from two mice was combined for each group (eight mice in total).
