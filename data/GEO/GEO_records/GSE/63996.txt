TITLE
Microarray analysis of Mef2c deficient and control bone marrow pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of mice bone marrow pre-B cells from both control and Vav-Cre Mef2cfl/fl mice (9 months old) We used these microarrays to identify the function of MEF2C in BM B lymphoid progenitors

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of freshly FACS sorted BM B cell progenitors using Affymetrix microarray analysis [pre-B cells]
