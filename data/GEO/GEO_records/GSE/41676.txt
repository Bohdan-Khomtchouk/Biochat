TITLE
Combinatorial treatment of DNMT inhibitor and LSD1 inhibitor results in cell growth inhibition and reexpression of epigenetically silenced genes (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A combinatorial treatment consisting of a DNMTi and a LSD1i shows synergistic effects in reactivating aberrantly silenced genes by enriching H3K4me2 and H3K4me.

DESIGN
24 Samples consisting of 3 cell lines hybridised to the Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
