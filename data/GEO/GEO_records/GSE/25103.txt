TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify biomarkers that contribute to genetic causes of OSCC, we attempt to identify copy number variation regions (CNV) in patients with OSCC. We identified and confirmed the clinical significance of amplification regions scattered from 8q22.2 to 8q24.3.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from normal oral tissues and OSCC specimens. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 112 OSCC specimens and 10 non-cancerous samples.
