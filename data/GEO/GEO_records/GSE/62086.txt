TITLE
Low dose of DNA-demethylating agents target colorectal cancer-initiating cells by activation of RIG1/MAVS signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 3 patient-derived colorectal cancer samples with different CIMP profiles. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 3 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
