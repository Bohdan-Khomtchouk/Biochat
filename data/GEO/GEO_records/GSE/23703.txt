TITLE
High Frequency of CNV Mutations in Combined Schizophrenia and Epilepsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Agilent custom designed array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on 235 samples with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and epilepsy and 80 samples with a dual diagnosis of bipolar and epilpsy. ArrayCGH on 191 psychiatric screened controls was also performed. A common male reference was used for all samples and controls. Samples and controls were obtained from the NIMH cell line repositories.
