TITLE
Microarray was used to study the gene expression of P. stutzeri A1501 under different growth conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501

SUMMARY
Nitrogen fixation is a highly energy-demanding process and highly regulated at multiple levels. The two major signals that regulate nitrogen fixation in most diazotrophs are oxygen and ammonia. In order to study the complex regulated mechanism and to highlight the complete nitrogen fixing system in genome level, here we present the transcriptional profiles of the nitrogen fixation genes of P.stutzeri A1501 in different growth conditions with a genome-wide DNA microarray. In this study, the three samples of " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 0.1mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension " , " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 0.1mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension-2 " and " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 0.1mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension-3 " were three repeat experiments, while, the other three samples of " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 20mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension-1 " , " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 20mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension-2 " and " P.stutzeri A1501 treated with 20mM ammonia and 0.5% Oxygen tension-3 " were three repeat experiments. The gene expressions under these two growth phases were compared to investigate which genes' expression were effected by different ammonia concentrations. Keywords: nitrogen fixation, nitrogen repression
