TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of in vivo differentiated and dedifferentiated mouse Schwann cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Schwann cells were acultely purified from intact nerves and the bridge and distal regions of transected nerves at different time-points following transection and sequenced to determine gene expression profiles of the differentiated and dedifferentiated state and its regulation by the wound microenvironment

DESIGN
The design comprises three independent packages: 1) Schwann cells sorted from 3 pooled nerves collected at day 6 post-injury for Intact, Distal and Bridge nerve regions (n=4 each). 2) 35 samples of Schwann cells sorted from single nerves for Intact nerves (n=5), Distal nerve regions (n=3 each ) at days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 post-injury, Bridge nerve regions (n=3 each) at days 4, 6, 8, 10 post-injury. 3) Rat Schwann cells in culture untreated (n=3) or treated with TfgÎ² (n=3).
