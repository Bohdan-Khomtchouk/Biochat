TITLE
ZNF217 is an oncogene that promotes a basal phenotype and expansion of a progenitor cell population during breast cancer progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amplification of 20q13 occurs in 20-30% of primary human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. The transcription factor ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene in 20q13. Patients with breast tumors expressing high ZNF217 had reduced survival and increased resistance to chemotherapy. Inducible Znf217 expression in the mammary epithelium of our transgenic mouse resulted in premalignant and invasive lesions. Znf217 overexpression in a mouse luminal breast cancer model generated primary tumors with heterogeneous epithelial and progenitor cell marker expression and promoted metastasis. The AKT inhibitor triciribine inhibited growth and restored sensitivity to a cytotoxic drug in cells expressing high ZNF217. Triciribine reduced tumor burden in vivo, suggesting that ZNF217 may be a novel drug target.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from samples overexpressing ZNF217 (4 NMuMG). RNA was also harvested from each cell line expressing a vector control to use as a reference for each microarray sample analyzed. Total RNA was hybridized to mouse MEEBO arrays as described ( ). Samples were verified to have strong overexpression of ZNF217 by qRT-PCR or Western analysis.
