TITLE
GPR120 mediates high-fat diet induced obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of GPR120 which play roles for the fatty acid sensor in adipose tissue. Results provide insight into the transcriptional effects caused by the loss of the GPR120 proteins and provide further insight into their functions.

DESIGN
GPR120 KO mice and the corresponding wild-type with normal diet(ND) or high fat diet(HFD), were subjected to Affymetrix Mus musculus microarrays. Epididymal adipose tissue and liver were analyzed in triplicates.
