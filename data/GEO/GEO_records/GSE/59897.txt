TITLE
Expression profile of HCT116 cells transfected with miR-204-5p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to screen potential target genes of miR-204-5p in colorectal cancer cell HCT116.  HCT116 cells were seeded in 6-cm2 tissue culture plates and transfected with the miR-204-5p mimic or negative control (NC) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). After propagation for 48 hours, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Expression profiling was performed using an Agilent human whole genome oligo microarray chip (4Ã—44K) (Agilent, USA)

DESIGN
Expression profiling in HCT116 cells was measured at 48 hours after transfection with miR-204-5p or negative control. Experiments were performed using the two samples without repeat experiment.
