TITLE
Transcriptomics profiling of Alzheimerâ€™s disease reveal novel molecular targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data provide a comprehensive list of transcriptomics alterations and warrant holistic approach including both coding and non-coding RNAs in functional studies aimed to understand the pathophysiology of LOAD

DESIGN
We performed directional RNA sequencing on high quality RNA samples extracted from hippocampi of 4 late onset Alzheimer's diseas (LOAD) and 4 age-matched controls.

PLATFORM
