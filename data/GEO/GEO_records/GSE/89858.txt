TITLE
Differential microRNA expression along with progression of diet-induced atherosclerotic plaque using Microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the changes in microRNA expression regulating specific genes at different stages of diet-induced atherosclerotic development, double knock out Apobtm2Sgy/Ldltm1Her mice were fed with either high-fat or normal chow diet. The microarray was performed using total RNA extracted from ascending aorta of the animals.

DESIGN
Double knockout mice fed with rich cholesterol diet and a normal diet were sacrificed after 0, 6, 1, 8 and 30 weeks and RNA was extracted for Microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL22383 Agilent-070155 Mouse miRNA Microarray (Feature Extraction Number version)
