TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of freshly isolated synovial fibroblasts in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomics of distinct subpopulations of synovial fibroblasts from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis arthroplasty tissues.

DESIGN
We gated synovial fibroblasts by protein surface markers and used RNA-seq to profile gene expression in 96 cells from each patient. This data includes 384 cells from 2 osteoarthritis patients and 2 rheumatoid arthitis patients. *** Raw data are not available for this Series due to patient privacy concerns. The raw data will not be available through controlled-access resources such as dbGaP. The patients did not consent to genomic data sharing. ***
