TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of submandibular salivary gland tumours of Smgb-Tag mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To reveal novel molecular factors behind the development of salivary gland cancer, we performed gene expression analyses from Smgb-Tag mouse salivary gland samples. The overall purpose was to apply these results for clinical use to find new approaches for both possible therapeutic targets and more accurate diagnostic tools in identification of salivary gland cancers. Smgb-Tag mouse strain, in which salivary neoplasms arise through a dysplastic phase in submandibular glands, was investigated using genome-wide microarray expression analysis, Ingenuity pathway analysis, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry.

DESIGN
3 normal, 3 dysplastic, and 3 adenocarcinomatous submandibular gland tumours of Smgb-Tag mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
