TITLE
Deep transcriptome sequencing of rhizome and shoot in Sorghum propinquum

ORGANISM
Sorghum propinquum

SUMMARY
Our study provides the first comprehensive insight into the comparative transcriptome between shoot and rhizome in sorghum propinquum. Using the deep RNA sequencing technique, more than 70% of genes were identified to be expressed. Comparative analysis revealed that a strong difference in gene expression patterns between shoot and rhizome organs, especially a set of organ-specific TF genes and cis-elements were determined, implying a unique complicated molecular network controlling shoot or rhizome growth and development. Furthermore, this data set including a deep coverage of the subterranean rhizome transcriptome, provided essential information for future molecular genetic dissection of rhizome formation.

DESIGN
A S. propinquum vegetative clone (unnamed accession) with abundant tillering and strong rhizomes cultured in the greenhouse was used in this experiment. Two organs, shoots and rhizomes, at active tillering stage were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
