TITLE
Altered RNA expression in parenteral nutrition mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported altered RNA expression profiles in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice upon parenteral nutrition treatment compared to saline infusion controls. RNA samples used were isolated from the livers of PN or saline infused mice. RNA samples from 3 saline or 3 PN mouse livers were pooled, respectively. Final fold change were calculated by normalize the signal intensity of each probe in PN sample to that of the saline sample.

DESIGN
On day 1, jugular vein catheterization survival surgery was performed on mouse (age 6-10 weeks).On day 2, the catheter was connected to an infusion line and the mouse was transferred to a metabolic cage. Surgical mice then started to receive saline infusion. On day 3, surgical mice started receiving either parenteral nutrion (PN), or saline infusion as control. Food was removed from the cage for mice in the PN group. Mice in saline group continue to have access to food. On day 11, PN and saline control mice were sacrificed and tissues (liver, ileum and colon) were collected for RNA isolation. After RT-qPCR verification, RNA samples from the same tissues from 3 PN mice and 3 saline mice were pooled, respectively. Pooled RNA samples for liver, ileum and colon tissues were then used for microarray analysis. Please note that only liver samples have been submitted and that sample data table contains the data filtered by 1.5-fold cutoff.
