TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the aorta from non-diabetic or STZ-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed with high fat diet in the presence or absence of PKC β inhibitor, ruboxistaurin (RBX, or  LY333531)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that hyperglycemia and elevated fatty acids in diabetes could activate protein kinase C-β isoforms and selectively induce insulin resistance via inhibiting vascular insulin signaling. To further investigate the effect of high fat diet and specific PKC β inactivation on STZ-induced atherosclerosis using the PKC β inhibitor, ruboxistaurin (RBX, or  LY333531), ApoE-/- mice were used and fed with high fat diet (42% of fat Kcal) with or without RBX after onset of diabetes. Isolated total RNA from whole aortas of each group was used and analyzed for gene expression. The gene expression profiles were processed by using the Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) with Affymetrix default analysis settings.

DESIGN
ApoE-/- mice were used as a rodent atherosclerosis model. Isolated total RNA from aortas of each ApoE-/- mouse fed with high fat diet for 10 weeks after STZ-induced diabetes or control groups were used for preparation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. There were total 4 different mice groups, which were fed with high fat diet with or without RBX. Each group had four individual mouse (N=4).
