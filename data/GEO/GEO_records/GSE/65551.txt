TITLE
miR-200 overexpression in colorectal cancer lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unsupervised classification of gene expression profiles has resulted in the identification of biologically and clinically distinct colon cancer subtypes (CCSs). The subtype that associates with poor clinical outcome displays a mesenchymal gene expression profile. No driver mutation has been identified for this category and patients are heterogeneous with regard to commonly used clinical markers. Here we report a regulatory network consisting of the miR-200 family members that tunes the majority of genes differentially expressed in the poor prognosis CCS, including genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our data indicate that the epigenetic silencing of the miR-200 family by promoter methylation is identifying the mesenchymal CCS and is predictive of disease-free survival in this malignancy. We demonstrate that the molecular features of poor prognosis colon cancer - expression of EMT-associated genes and miR-200 promoter methylation - can already be installed at the premalignant stage, suggesting a highly malignant potential of specific colon cancer precursor lesions.

DESIGN
Three colorectal cancer cell lines that display methylated miR-200 loci have been used to overexpress miR-200 family members from both loci separatedly or simultaneously.
