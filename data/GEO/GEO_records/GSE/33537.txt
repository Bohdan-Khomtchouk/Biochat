TITLE
Induction of microRNA expression and processing via ERK/MAPK signaling during monocytic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study produced a microarray-based screening for miRNAs responding to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) (for monocytic differentiation) treatment in various leukemia cell lines.

DESIGN
Using the microarray technique, global changes in miRNA expression after treatment of four leukemia cell lines (NB4, HL-60, U937 and K562) with TPA was profiled. This microarray chip contained 924 probes for 802 miRNAs from human, mouse and rat after discarding redundant sequences, and a further 122 predicted miRNA sequences from published data. To reduce individual variability, replicate array analysis used independently treated samples, and a technical replicate was also performed with the same sample.
