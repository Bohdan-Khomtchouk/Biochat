TITLE
Prior Knowledge Transfer Across Transcriptional Datasets Using Compositional Statistics [Cell lines]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compositional statistics and random gene-sets were used to assign the tumor site of origin and histopathology of 18 epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we applied Gene Expression Compositional Assignment (GECA) to epithelial ovarian cell lines, using first a reference library of solid tumors (expO [ http://www.intgen.org/expo/ ]) and then a second library of expert pathologically-reviewed epithelial ovarian cancer samples (GSE73551)
