TITLE
The yeast Snt2 protein helps coordinate the transcriptional response to hydrogen-peroxide mediated oxidative stress (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Snt2 is a yeast chromatin-interacting protein whose function has not been well characterized, that was recently shown to associate with Ecm5 and the Rpd3 deacetylase. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that in response to H2O2, Snt2 and Ecm5 colocalize to promoters of genes involved in various aspects of the environmental stress response. By integrating these ChIP-seq results with expression analysis, we identify a key set of target genes that require Snt2 for proper expression after H2O2 stress. Finally, by mapping Snt2 and Ecm5 localization before and after rapamycin treatment, we identify a subset of H2O2-specific Snt2 and Ecm5 target promoters that are also targeted in response to rapamycin. Our results establish a function for Snt2 in regulating transcriptional changes in response to oxidative stress, and suggest Snt2 may have a role in additional stress pathways.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis to look at gene expression levels in wild-type, snt2 deletion, or ecm5 deletion strains before or 0.5 hours after treatment with H2O2 (final concentration 0.4 mM). This sequencing was done on biological triplicate samples.
