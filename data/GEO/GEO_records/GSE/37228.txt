TITLE
miR-155 promotes Th17 development by targeting Jarid2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis was performed on microRNA 155+/+ and -/- Th17 cells to determine the differentially expressed transcripts that are regulated by miR-155. We found that Jarid2 was differentially expressed in absence of miR-155 and highlight the mechanism for the silencing of IL-22 by Jarid2 and PRC2 in miR-155-/- Th17 cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptome of Th17 cells in presence or absence of microRNA 155
