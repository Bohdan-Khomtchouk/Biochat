TITLE
Cardiac Transcriptome Dynamics and MEF2 Function in Response to Chronic Î²-Adrenergic Blockade During Heart Failure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
1) Profiling RNA expression in mice with surgically induced pressure overload (Transverase aortic contriction aka TAC) and/or Atenolol (AT) treated mice. 2)Profiling RNA expression in MEF2A depleted cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
1) Four groups of mice (Sham+Sol (Samples 4C,D,E), TAC+Sol (Samples 2C,D,E), Sham+AT (Samples 3A,B,D), TAC+AT(Samples 1B,E,F)) with three replicates. 2) Primary cardiomyocytes were transfected with scrambled control (scr) or siMEF2A in duplicate.
