Expression data from Ezh2 conditional C2 iMEFs

SUMMARY
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays a key role in controlling transcriptional repression. It is thought to act at the level of the chromatin, where its enzymatic subunits Ezh1 and Ezh2 catalyse the di/tri-methylation of histone H3 on its lysine 27 (H3K27me3). We sought to assess several parameters of PRC2-mediated transcriptional repression. To this end we performed a comparative analysis of mES and iMEF cells following deletion of Ezh2, a time-course analysis following deletion of Ezh2 in iMEFs as well as rescue experiments with Ezh1 and Ezh2 before or after deletion of Ezh2.

DESIGN
In a first experiment, we performed a transcriptome analysis of mES and iMEF cells either Ezh2 WT or Ezh2-mutant. In a second experiment, we performed a time-course analysis of a clone of Ezh2-conditional iMEFs (clone C2), 0 (control), 5, 18 and 32 days after addition of Tamoxifen. In a third experiment, we analysed the transcriptome of C2 cells either i) wild-type for Ezh2, ii) in the presence of overexpressed exogenous Ezh1 or Ezh2, iii) Ezh2-mutant, and iv) with Ezh1/Ezh2 rescue either pre- or post-deletion of endogenous Ezh2.
