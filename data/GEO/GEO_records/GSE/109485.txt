TITLE
Anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 efficacy in melanoma brain metastases depends on extracranial disease and augmentation of CD8+ T cell trafficking

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intracranial B16 melanoma tumors isolated from C57Bl6 mice were analyzed by mRNAseq. Four experimental groups were analyzed: (1) Mice with intracranial tumors receiving IgG; (2) Mice with intracranial tumors receiving anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 therapy; (3) Mice with intracranial plus extracranial tumors receiving IgG; (4) Mice with intracranial plus extracranial tumors receiving anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 therapy.

DESIGN
mRNAseq profiles of intracranial B16 tumours at day 9 post-cancer cell implantation were generated for 4 different experimental groups (biological triplicates)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
