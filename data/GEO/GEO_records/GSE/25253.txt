TITLE
Expression profiling of S. pyogenes in response to Glucose and mutation of the regulators CcpA and LacD.1

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes were measured in S. pyogenes strain HSC5 in response to glucose availability, taking samples from the wild type strain (HSC5) grown in carbohydrate poor medium (C medium) versus this same medium with 1% (w/v) Glucose added. Furthermore, the effects of deletion of glucose responsive regulators CcpA and LacD.1 were measured by using isogenic mutants in these genes (Delta CcpA and Delta LacD.1 respectively) compared to the wild type parent strain (HSC5), both grown in C medium with 1% glucose.

DESIGN
Experiments were carried out using two biological replicates for each variable tested (ie two independent RNA samples gathered on separate days),  and dye exchange experiments for each RNA sample tested were carried out.
