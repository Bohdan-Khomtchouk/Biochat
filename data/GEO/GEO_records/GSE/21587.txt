TITLE
Gene expression variation in Y-substitution lines in different genetic backgrounds of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We studied Y chromosomes from two geographically diverse populations of Drosophila melanogaster, and show that these Y chromosomes differentially modify the expression of hundreds of autosomal and X-linked genes. Genes showing Y-linked regulatory variation also show an association with immune response and pheromone detection, as well as proximity to the X chromosome euchromatin-heterochromatin boundary.

DESIGN
4-6 dual channel arrays per background, with males carrying two Y geographically diverse chromosomes competitively hybridized to each array. Dye-swap design was used.
