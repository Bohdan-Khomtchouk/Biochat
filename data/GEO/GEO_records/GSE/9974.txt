TITLE
The effect of the HDAC inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and adenocarcinoma cells I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Title: In vitro and in vivo effects of the orally bioavailable phenylbutyrate-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate nucleosomal packaging of DNA, thereby influencing gene transcription and multiple cancer-associated processes. Thus, we conducted microarray analysis at multiple time-points to assess the ability of OSU-HDAC42, the S enantiomer of the previously published compound HDAC-42,  to modulate key acid-induced changes as well as to impact other genes altered as the normal esophageal epithelium progresses along the metaplasia-dysplasia-esophageal adenocarcinoma continuum. Keywords: acid-pulsed cells pretreated with OSU-HDAC42 or vehicle

DESIGN
SEG-1 cells were pretreated for 24 hours with vehicle or OSU-HDAC42, pulsed with acidified media (pH 3.5; 20 mins at 37C), replenished with media or OSU-HDAC42, and harvested 3, 6 and 24 hours later.  Global gene expression analysis was conducted using the human genome chip U133 2.0 Plus.
