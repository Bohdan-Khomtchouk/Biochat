TITLE
De novo generation of somatic stem cells from differentiated cells [pancreatic]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of YAP/TAZ as factors able to convert differentiated cells into stem cells of the same tissue, we compared the expression profiles of pancreatic organoids (yDucts) obtained by doxycycline-inducible expression of YAP in pancreatic acini with original acini and native ducts (Ducts).

DESIGN
We collected RNA from Ducts, yDucts, and acini. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicas (A, B, C, D) were used for each sample, for a total of 12 samples.
