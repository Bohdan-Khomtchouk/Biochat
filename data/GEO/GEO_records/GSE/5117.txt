TITLE
Wilms' tumor 1 WT1(-KTS) isoform time course induction in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays important roles during development of several organs including metanephric kidneys. A number of WT1 target genes have been identified, but the detailed mechanisms by which WT1 orchestrates renal development remain elusive. To identify WT1 target genes relevant to development, genome-wide expression profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays representing 39,000 human transcripts Keywords: Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene, -KTS isoform; time course

DESIGN
Sample_source_name: UB27 cells, U2OS cells with Tetracycline-repressible WT1(-KTS) expression Sample_characteristics: U2OS cell line (osteosarcoma; female), Tetracycline-repressible WT1(-KTS) expression, time-course induction of WT1(-KTS) expression Sample_description: WT1(-KTS) expression was induced for 4, 8 or 12 hrs and the expression profile of each time-points was compared to the uninduced sample (0 hr).
