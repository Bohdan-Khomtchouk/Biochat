TITLE
Expression data for analysis of genes affected by PAX3-FOXO1 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PAX3-FOXO1 is a fusion transcription factor characteristic for the majority of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma tumors. It is the main oncogenic driver and deregulates expression of PAX3 target genes. The PAX3-FOXO1 target gene signature was determined in the Rh4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.

DESIGN
Rh4 cells were transfected with siRNA directed against PAX3-FOXO1 or scrambled control. RNA was isolated from these cells after 24, 48 and 72 h.
