TITLE
Gene expressional change along crypt-villus in rats jejunum

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of jejunal gene expression during the differentiation from crypt to villus cells in rats, using cryostat sections of the villus-crypt columns.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from each samples (Crypt part, Middle of villus part and Top of villus part), which were separated along the crypt-villus columns of rats jejunum by cryostat technique. In this study, we compared with the gene expression in different part of rats jejunum along the crypt-villus columns. Crypt vs. Middle of villus vs. Top of villus.

PLATFORM
GPL7292 Agilent-013328 Rat Oligo Microarray (V2) G4130B (Probe Name version)
