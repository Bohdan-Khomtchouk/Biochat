TITLE
Genome-wide maps of linker histone H1 lysine 85 acetylation in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify acetylation of linker histone H1 lysine 85 as a novel histone acetylation mark, which regulates chromatin structure and genome stability upon DNA damage. By performing a chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing assay, we identified the genome-wide distribution patterns of H1 lysine 85 acetylation in HCT116 cells. We found that H1K85ac largely bound intergenic regions (53%) and gene bodies (39%), whereas only 7% H1K85ac bound regions 2 kb upstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs). As the proportion of H1K85ac bound to potential promoter regions was not significantly different to that of the random peaks (~6%), these data suggest that H1K85ac may not be mainly involved in general transcriptional regulation.
