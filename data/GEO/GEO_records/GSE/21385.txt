TITLE
Culture effects on rheumatoid arthrits synovial fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between early passage to later passages of  rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast (RASF) populations using two different AtlasTM Human Arrays Gene expression changes during culture with increasing number of changes at higher passages depending on individual expression pattern of the respective cell populations

DESIGN
During every passage, half of the RASF populations were used for culture, the other half of the cells was used for RNA isolation. After collection of all RNA samples up to 8 passages, RNA was used for array analysis as described below. *********Only differentially expressed genes are reported in the Sample data tables. Complete data tables were requested and reported to be unavailable by the submitter.*********
