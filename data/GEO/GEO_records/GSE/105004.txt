TITLE
Genome-wide map of BrdU incorporation, SMC3 and SMC3(ac) binding in HeLa cells in early S phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential acetylation of SMC3 relative to BrdU as a function of ESCO2 motif PBMA deletion and depletion of ESCO1

DESIGN
SMC3 and SMC(ac) chromatin-immunoprecipitation and BrdU DNA-immunoprecipitation were performed from cells synchronized in G1/S by double thymidine arrest and 1-hour release in S phase.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
