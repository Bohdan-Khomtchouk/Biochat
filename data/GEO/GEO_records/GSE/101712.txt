TITLE
Single cell RNA-sequencing of Mbd3-null and control lymphoid progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the role of Mbd3/NuRD in lymphopoiesis, gene expression in single Mbd3-deleted and control lymphoid progenitor cells was analysed using single cell RNA-seq

DESIGN
Single Mbd3-deficient and control lymphoid progenitors were isolated from mouse bone marrow by flow cytometry, including lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs), all-lymphoid progenitors (ALPs) and B cell-biased lymphoid progenitors (BLPs). Single cell RNA-seq was performed as described previously (Picelli et al. (2014) Nature protocols 9:171).
