TITLE
Sugarcane Expression Data from Stress Time Series

ORGANISM
Saccharum hybrid cultivar (mixed)

SUMMARY
Sugarcane one-eyed seed sets obtained from a variety sensitive to drought conditions (cv. SP90-1638, CTC, Brazil) were cultivated on moist sand for 15 days. The plants were transferred to pots containing moist sand and were irrigated with Hoagland's solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Regular watering was maintained for 90 days and suppressed after this period for the experimental group. Leaves were collected 24 h, 72 h and 120 h after exposure to drought conditions for the control and experimental groups. Samples were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Leaves from six plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of stress response

DESIGN
RNA from experimental sample and from its respective control sample (untreated plants) was used for hybridization to dual channel arrays. Two biological replicates were used for each experimental point. The quantification of each hybridization was submitted in two files, one for each slide side (technical replicates).
