TITLE
CpG island methylation profiling of anaplastic gliomas compared to healthy control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CpG island methylation profiling of anaplastic gliomas compared to healthy control. Goal was to identify anaplastic glioma-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

DESIGN
Highly methylated DNA from cases and controls was enriched by methyl CpG-immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and co-hybridized. DMRs were defined by stepwise stringent criteria such as selecting top 5% vicinal array probes only. Anaplastic glioma specific DMRs were identified.

PLATFORM
GPL4126 Agilent-014791 Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K (G4492A) (Feature Number version)
