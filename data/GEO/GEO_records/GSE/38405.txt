TITLE
Genomic profiling of colorectal cancer from patients with Lynch syndrome and Familial colorectal cancer type X with comparison to sporadic microsatelite stable and instable colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lynch syndrome and Familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) are clinically diagnosed using the same criteria, but genomic differences exist between these two groups and the genomic profiles share similarities with their sporadic counterparts, mismatch repair (MMR) deficient and proficient tumors, respectively.

DESIGN
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 91 tumors, comprising 23 Lynch syndrome (AH), 23 FCCTX (AA), 23 sporadic MMR deficient (AM) and 22 sporadic MMR proficient tumors, in order to identify differences between Lynch syndrome and FCCTX.
