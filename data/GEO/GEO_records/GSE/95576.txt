TITLE
MicroRNA differentially expressed in diapausing versus HCl-treated Bombyx embryos

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were detected to explore the molecular mechanisms of diapause termination. The total small RNA (sRNA) of diapause-destined silkworm eggs and HCl-treated eggs was extracted and then sequenced using HiSeq/MiSeq high-throughput method. 44 novel miRNAs were discovered. Compared to those in the diapause-destined eggs, 61 miRNAs showed significant changes in the acid-treated eggs, with 23 being up-regulated and 38 being down-regulated. The potential target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by miRanda. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these potential target genes revealed that they were mainly located within cells and organelles, involved in cellular and metabolic processes, and participated in protein production, processing and transportation. Two differentially expressed genes, Bombyx mori SDH (BmSDH) and Bmo-miR-2761-3p, were further analyzed with qRT-PCR. BmSDH was significantly up-regulated in the HCl-treated eggs, while Bmo-miR-2761-3p was down-regulated. These results suggested that these two genes were well coordinated in silkworm eggs. Dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay demonstrated that Bmo-miR-2761-3p inhibited the expression of BmSDH.

DESIGN
