TITLE
5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment of Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The puropose of this experiment was to identify gene expression changes that result from 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine induced DNA demethylation of Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells.  The gene expression profiles of untreated Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells were compared to the gene expression profiles of Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells that were treated for 5 passages with a low dose of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (0.1uM).

DESIGN
Five chip study.  For these experiments, microarray was carried out on untreated (control) Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells (3 biological replicates), and microarray was also carried out on Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells  treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (2 biological replicates).
