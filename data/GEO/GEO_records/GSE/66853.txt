TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by EVI1 in the absence or presence of TPA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether and how expression of the oncogenic transcription factor EVI1 influences gene regulation by phorbol esters and vice versa, the human myeloid cell line U937 was transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control. Cells were treated with 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or its solvent ethanol as a control. RNA was extracted and subjected to gene expression microarray analysis.

DESIGN
U937 cells transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control were treated with 50 ng/ml TPA or an equivalent amount of ethanol (solvent) for 24 h prior to gene expression microarray analysis. 3 biological replicates were performed.
