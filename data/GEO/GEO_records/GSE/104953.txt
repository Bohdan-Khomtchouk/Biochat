TITLE
Measuring differential gene expression with RNA-seq in 1mM inorganic arsenic exposed and conreol sibling Tg(fabp10:nls-mcherry) livers at 5dpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare gene expression levels in the livers of larval Tg(fabp10:nls-mcherry) exposed to 1 mM inorganic arsenic from 4-120 hpf to the unexposed siblings

DESIGN
10-20 livers from 5dpf embryos were pooled per sample of either control or 1 mM inorganic arsenic exposed Tg(fabp10:nls-mcherry) zebrafish larvae and RNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA Micro Kit with on-column DNase treatment. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina Truseq RNA sample prep kit, version 2, followed by Ribo-Zero Gold treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
