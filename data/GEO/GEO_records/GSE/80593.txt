TITLE
Genome-wide KDM5A occupancy after MK2206/DMSO treatment of T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We perfomed ChIP-seq using KDM5A antibodies in T47D cells after 24 hour treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 or DMSO. We show that the cistrome of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5A is affected by AKT inhibition.

DESIGN
Comparison of genome-wide KDM5A binding after AKT inhibition vs vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
