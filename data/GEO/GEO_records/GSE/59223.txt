TITLE
Tumor cell-specific inhibition of MYC function using small molecule inhibitors of the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulated expression of MYC is a driver of colorectal carcinogenesis, necessitating novel strategies to inhibit MYC function. The ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 (HECTH9, ARFBP1,  MULE) associates with both MYC and the MYC-associated protein MIZ1. We show here that HUWE1 is required for growth of colorectal cancer cells in culture and in orthotopic xenograft models. Using high throughput screening, we identify small  molecule inhibitors of HUWE1, which inhibit MYC-dependent transactivation in colorectal cancer cells, but not in stem and normal colon epithelial cells. Inhibition of HUWE1 stabilizes MIZ1. MIZ1 globally accumulates on MYC target genes and contributes to repression of MYC-activated target genes upon HUWE1 inhibition. Our data show that transcriptional activation by MYC in colon cancer cells requires the continuous degradation of MIZ1 and identify a novel principle that allows for inhibition of MYC function in tumor cells.

DESIGN
MIZ1 and MYC ChIPseq experiments in HUWE1 inhibitor-treated Ls174T cells as well as RNAseq experiments in HUWE1- or MIZ1-depleted Ls174T cells after HUWE1 inhibitor treatment. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx.
