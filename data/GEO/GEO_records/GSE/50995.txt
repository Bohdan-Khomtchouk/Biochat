TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Puf knockouts in N. crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa ; Neurospora crassa OR74A

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed to compare RNA abundances in mycelium of Puf knockout strains compared to that in mycelium of wild-type N. crassa

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, total RNA from knockout vs total RNA from wild-type. Biological replicates: 5 x Puf3KO, 5 x Puf8KO, 4 x Puf4NtermKO, and 5 x Puf4pumKO. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL14949 GlassLab-Ncrassa-10k-V1
