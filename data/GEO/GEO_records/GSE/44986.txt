TITLE
Gene Regulation in Bob1-/- and miR-146a-/- Murine Pre-B Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5d IL-7-supported bone marrow cultures from C57BL/6 mice deficient for either the transcription factor Bob1 or microRNA-146a Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are required for many processes during hematopoietic development and activation, including B-cell differentiation. The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Bob1 is critical for the proper development and function of B cells. Bob1-/- mice are immunodeficient and lack germinal centers. Microarray expression analysis of Bob1-deficient B cells shows numerous up-regulated genes, suggesting that Bob1 may affect targets indirectly via the control of miRNAs. Using a gain-of-function/loss-of-function approach in WEHI-231 and primary pro-B and pre-B cells, we  identified miR-146a as a direct target of Bob1. Ttranscriptome-wide analysis of miR-146a-/- B cells shows a number of misregulated genes involved in immune regulation, while analysis of Bob1-/- cells shows increased expression of cell cycle-related genes. These results support previous evidence that Bob1 suppresses proliferation, a previously underappreciated role for Bob1 that is in line with the cancer-prone phenotype of mir-146a-/- mice.

DESIGN
8 samples in total; 2 biological duplicates each of Bob1wt, Bob1KO, wild-type C57BL/6Ncrl, and mir-146aKO
