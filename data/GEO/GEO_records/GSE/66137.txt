TITLE
Gene expression differences in mouse placenta tissue bewteen wild-type and Zfp36l3 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ZFP36L3 protein is a rodent-specific, placenta- and yolk sac-specific member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins.  These proteins bind to AU-rich elements in target mRNAs, and promote their deadenylation and decay.  Mice deficient in ZFP36L3 exhibited decreased neonatal survival rates, but no apparent morphological changes in the placenta or surviving offspring.  Zfp36l3 is paternally imprinted, with profound parent-of-origin effects on gene expression.  RNASeq of KO placental mRNA revealed many significantly affected transcripts, some of which exhibited decreased decay rates in differentiated trophoblast stem cells derived from KO blastocysts.  The type 1 transferrin receptor mRNA was unexpectedly decreased in KO placentas, despite an increase in its stability.  This receptor is critical for placental iron uptake from the maternal circulation, and its decrease was accompanied by decreased iron stores in the KO fetus, suggesting that this intrauterine deficiency might have deleterious consequences in later life.

DESIGN
