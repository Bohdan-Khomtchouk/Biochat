TITLE
Transcriptional effect of aft1 and aft2 mutation in iron depleted conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The paralogous transcription factors Aft1p and Aft2p activate the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism under iron depleted conditions. Both are able to bind to the same DNA consensus sequence in vitro. We used DNA microarrays and loss of function mutant strains to better understand the respective roles of Aft1p and Aft2p in the regulation of gene expression Keywords: other
