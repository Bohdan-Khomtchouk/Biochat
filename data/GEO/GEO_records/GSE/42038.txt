TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of T-lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was the principal investigation and frequency of RTK expression in primary T-ALLs. Primary initial  T-ALLs were assessed regarding their transcriptome-wide expression profiles and screend for prominent RTK expression.

DESIGN
Naive primary T-ALL samples were evaluated with regard to global mRNA expression and screened for prominent RTK expression. The dataset was used to investigate RTK expression frequencies in T-ALLs.
