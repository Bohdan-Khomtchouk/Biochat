TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in tumor-associated BMDCs induced by mouse ovarian and colon tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling in tumor-associated BMDCs induced by tumor cells 1D8 or CT-26 in comparison with those cultured in medium.

DESIGN
To prepare tumor-associated BMDCs(Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells), murine BMDCs were co-cultured with 1D8 or CT-26 cells in a transwell plate in 1640 medium supplemented with 3% FCS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin for 24 hrs. Total RNAs were isolated using the TRIZOL® Reagent(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.The samples were labeled using the miRCURY™ Array Power labeling kit (Exiqon). miRNA array hybridization was performed, and unbound miRNA Labels were washed away. Microarrays were analyzed using GenePix 4000B scanner and GenePix Pro 6 software (Molecular Devices).
