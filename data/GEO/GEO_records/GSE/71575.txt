TITLE
Identification of global regulators of T-helper cell lineage specification (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the dataset was to identify genome-wide regulators of gene expression in early differentiation of human cord blood derived CD4+ T cells cultured under Th1 (Act+IL12) and Th2 (Act+IL4) polarising conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA from naive CD4+ T cells was compared to total RNA from cells cultured in the following three conditions: activating (antiCD3+antiCD28)+antiIL4+antiIFNG; activating (antiCD3+antiCD28)+IL12+antiIL4; activating (antiCD3+antiCD28) +IL4+antiIFNG. Samples from 3 biological replicates were analysed.
