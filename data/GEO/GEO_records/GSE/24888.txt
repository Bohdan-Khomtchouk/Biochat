TITLE
Phytochemical variations in medicinal herbs affecting bioefficacy: Equisetum arvense extracts in the global market place as a case study

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We used phytochemical profiling techniques to generate a list of compounds present in each of 13 Equisetum arvense samples sourced globally. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the treatment of the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a chosen number of these extracts. A thorough bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the relationship between phytochemical and gene expression response profiles.

DESIGN
We analysed 18 Equisetum arvense microarrays. Six samples were chosen from the original 13 for microarray analysis, 5 of which were performed in duplicate and the sixth in quadruplicate. Control arrays were also performed in quadruplicate.
