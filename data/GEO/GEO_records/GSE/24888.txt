TITLE
Phytochemical variations in medicinal herbs affecting bioefficacy: Equisetum arvense extracts in the global market place as a case study

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We used phytochemical profiling techniques to generate a list of compounds present in each of 13 Equisetum arvense samples sourced globally. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the treatment of the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a chosen number of these extracts. A thorough bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the relationship between phytochemical and gene expression response profiles.
