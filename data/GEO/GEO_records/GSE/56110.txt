TITLE
H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in DNMT triple knock-out mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We immunoprecipitated formaldehyde crosslinked chromatin from DNMT triple knockout cells using an antibody against methylated lysine 27 on histone H3. Subsequent high-throughput sequencing allowed us to study the genome-wide distribution of this histone mark in the absence of DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Examination of a histone modification in mESCs lacking DNA methylation.
