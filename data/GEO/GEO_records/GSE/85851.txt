TITLE
Individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP and high-throughput sequencing for FOX2, TDP43 and hnRNP M in WT and P-KO H9 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) combined with high-throughput sequencing was used to generate a transcriptome-wide binding map of TDP43, FOX2 and hnRNP M in WT and P-KO H9 cells.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for FOX2, TDP43 and hnRNP M co-immunoprecipitated RNA after UV-crosslinking in WT and P-KO cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
