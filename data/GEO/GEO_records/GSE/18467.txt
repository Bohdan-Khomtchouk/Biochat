TITLE
A Microarray approach for Identification of Candidate Genes Involved in Gyration of the Pig Cerebral Cortex

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study we examined brain gyration using the pig brain as model. Pig cortical tissue from two time points in development representing a non-folded, lissencephalic, brain (embryonic day 60) and primary-folded, gyrencephalic, brain (embryonic day 80) were examined by whole genome expression microarray studies.
