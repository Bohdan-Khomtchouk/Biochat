TITLE
Mouse gene expression profile after transfected with miR-27a mimics and mimic NC in Raw

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarry analysis of mouse gene expression profile after transfected with miR-27a mimics (27a-7) and mimic NC (NC-9) Goal was to determine the effects of miR-27a transfection on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 27a-7 vs.NC-9.
