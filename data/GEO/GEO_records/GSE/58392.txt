TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) oocyte and embryo

ORGANISM
Gadus morhua

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses  were performed to assess temporal profiles of maternal and zygotic transcripts and their developmental roles. Results revealed the presence of multiple transcripts involved in patterning and development of tissues and organs long before activation of the zygotic genome. The switch from maternal to zygotic developmental programs is associated with large-scale modification of chromosomes.

DESIGN
Analyses included unfertilized and newly fertilized oocytes, mid blastulas and embryos at different stages of segmentation. Pooled organs of adult cod were used as common reference.
