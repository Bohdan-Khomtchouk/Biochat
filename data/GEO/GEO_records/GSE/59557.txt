TITLE
Expression data of in vitro generated regulatory T cells overexpressing E47

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E47 represses Foxp3 transcription, albeit indirectly through the activation of unknown negative regulatory of Foxp3 transcription. To identify target genes of E47 in regulatory T cells, we compared gene expression profiles of Treg cells overexpressing E47 compared to control-vector transduced cells.

DESIGN
Regulatory T cells were generated in vitro by stimulating MACS-purified CD4+CD25- T cells from the lymph nodes of C57BL/6 mice with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of IL-2 and TGF-beta overnight. The next day cells were retrovirally transduced with either pMIT-bHLH-ER or pMIT-E47-ER. Cells were further cultured under the same conditions for 24 hr and subsequently transduced cells were FACS sorted as CD4+Thy1.1+. Finally, cells were cultured for 6 hr with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of IL-2 and Tamoxifen for mRNA preparation. Three independent experiments with one set (control bHLH and E47) of RNA samples were analysed.
