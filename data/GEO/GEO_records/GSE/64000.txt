TITLE
TRPM7 maintains progenitor-like features of neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM7 on gene expression levels in SH-SY5Y and SH-EP2 human neuroblastoma cells. Results were used for the identification of neural-crest-associated transcription factors that were affected by TRPM7 knockdown.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from SH-EP2 and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA (control) or TRPM7 shRNA, experiment performed in duplicate.
