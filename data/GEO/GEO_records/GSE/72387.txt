TITLE
mRNA Expression data from rats treated with ANIT or vehicle

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated i.g. with 50 mg/kg alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) or vehicle (corn oil). Hepatobiliary liver injury occurred at 24 h postdose in ANIT rats with repair at 120h. Livers were extracted from rats at 24h and 120 h post ANIT exposure. This study investigated differences in mRNA expression between the injury and repair phases in the context of ANIT exposure.

DESIGN
8 week male Sprague Dawley rats were administered ANIT or vehicle for quantification of hepatobiliary injury via clinical chemistry biomarkers and pathology between 6 and 168 h postdosing. Rats sacrificed at 24 h and 120h postdosing coincided with peak injury and injury resolution, respectively.
