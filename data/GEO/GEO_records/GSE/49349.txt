TITLE
CHIP knockdown effect on breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 cell clones lacking the E3 ubiquitin liganse CHIP. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles effected by CHIP in human brest cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from CHIP or LacZ knockdown MCF7 and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
