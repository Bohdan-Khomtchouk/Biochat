TITLE
Copy number data from GIST with KIT mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In addition to KIT and PDGFRA mutations, sequential accumulation of other genetic events is involved in the development and progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Until recently, the significance of these other alterations has not been thoroughly investigated. The combination of gene expression profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number analysis offers a detailed molecular portrait of GISTs, providing an essential comprehensive knowledge necessary to guide the discovery of novel target genes involved in tumor development and progression. Fresh tissue specimens from 25 patients with GIST were collected and high-resolution genomic copy number analyses were performed using Affymetrix SNP array 6.0.

DESIGN
GIST tumor samples from mutated (KIT or PDGFRA) or Wild Type patients were labeled for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays was performed for 25 GIST samples, then compared to gene expression data.
