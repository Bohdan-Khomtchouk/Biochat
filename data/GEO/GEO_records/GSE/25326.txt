TITLE
Integrated mutation, copy number and expression profiling in resectable non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study aims: to identify critical genes involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pathogenesis that may lead to a more complete understanding of this disease and identify novel molecular targets for use in the development of more effective therapies. Methods: Both transcriptional and genomic profiling were performed on 69 resected NSCLC specimens and results correlated with mutational analyses and clinical data to identify genetic alterations associated with groups of interest.   Results: Combined analyses identified specific patterns of genetic alteration associated with adenocarcinoma vs. squamous differentiation; KRAS mutation; TP53 mutation, metastatic potential and disease recurrence and survival. Amplification of 3q was associated with mutations in TP53 in adenocarcinoma. A prognostic signature for disease recurrence, reflecting KRAS pathway activation, was validated in an independent test set.   Conclusions: These results may provide the first steps in identifying new predictive biomarkers and targets for novel therapies, thus improving outcomes for patients with this deadly disease.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of 82 samples of NSCLC using Peter MacCallum in-house 10,500 element cDNA microarray. RNA from 11 pooled cell lines used as reference for each sample. Replicate of 6 samples included.
