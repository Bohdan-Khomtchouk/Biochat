SUMMARY
In an ongoing translational research program involving microarray-based expression profiles in pediatric septic shock, we have now conducted longitudinal studies focused on the temporal expression profiles of canonical signaling pathways and gene networks. Genome-level expression profiles were generated from whole blood-derived RNA samples of children with septic shock (n = 30 individual patients) corresponding to days 1 and 3 of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Based on sequential statistical and expression filters, day 1 and day 3 of septic shock were characterized by differential regulation of 2,142 and 2,504 gene probes, respectively, relative to normal control patients. Venn analysis demonstrated 239 unique genes in the day 1 data set, 598 unique genes in the day 3 data set, and 1,906 genes common to both data sets. Analyses targeted toward derivation of biological function from these data sets demonstrated time-dependent, differential regulation of genes involved in multiple canonical signaling pathways and gene networks primarily related to immunity and inflammation. Notably, multiple and distinct gene networks involving T cell- and MHC antigen-related biological processes were persistently downregulated from day 1 to day 3. Further analyses demonstrated large scale and persistent downregulation of genes corresponding to functional annotations related to zinc homeostasis. These data represent the largest reported cohort of patients with septic shock, which has undergone longitudinal genome-level expression profiling. The data further advance our genome-level understanding of pediatric septic shock and support novel hypotheses that can be readily tested at both the experimental and translational levels.
