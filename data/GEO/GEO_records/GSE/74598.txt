TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis after transfection in murine genetically modified stem cells overexpressing the RAX gene (CCE-Rx cells) of either a siRNA against SOX2 or a scramble siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SOX2 is the main gene involved in anophthalmia. In order to identify genes regulated by SOX2 transcription factors (genes that could be good candidates to also be involved in ocular development), we studied transcriptomic profiles of murine genetically modified stem cells overexpressing the RAX gene (CCE-Rx cells) after transfection by a siRNA against SOX2 or a scramble siRNA.

DESIGN
murine genetically modified stem cells overexpressing the RAX gene (CCE-Rx cells) after transfection by a siRNA against SOX2 or a scramble siRNA
