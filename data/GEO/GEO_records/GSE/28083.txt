TITLE
Expression data from CH/LE Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are using genome-wide ChIP-seq with isoform-specific antibodies and chromatin from select tissues of mice challenged with different dietary conditions that enrich for specific SREBPs. We show  that hepatic SREBP-2 binds preferentially to two different gene-proximal motifs  as well as SREBP-2 directly activates autophagy genes during cell sterol depletion, conditions known to induce both autophagy and nuclear SREBP-2 levels.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out using the Mouse Gene 1.0 OST (Affymetrix) by hybridizing RNA from LE and Ch livers in triplicate at the Sanford-Burnham Genomics Core facility in Lake Nona Fl. Differential expression was then assessed using the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc.) and cyberT.
