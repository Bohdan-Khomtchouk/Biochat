TITLE
Nasal scrape gene expression profiling in asthmatics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed on nasal scrape samples obtained from asthmatics and matched healthy controls, to identify markers associated with various asthma subtypes.

DESIGN
Nasal scrape samples were collected from asthmatics and healthy controls and subjected to expression profiling using Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 microarrays.
