TITLE
Effect of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) on chicken DT40 cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
DT40 cells and a stable DT 40 cell line expressing OsTIR1 (clone 9) were treated with 500ÂµM IAA for 6 hours.  This experiment was conducued to see if auxin would induce a specific sets of genes in animal, like it does for plant cells.  We didn't observe a significant difference between the mock control and IAA  treatments in both DT40 cells and the stable cells.
