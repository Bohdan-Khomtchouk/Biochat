TITLE
Effect of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) on chicken DT40 cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
DT40 cells and a stable DT 40 cell line expressing OsTIR1 (clone 9) were treated with 500µM IAA for 6 hours.  This experiment was conducued to see if auxin would induce a specific sets of genes in animal, like it does for plant cells.  We didn't observe a significant difference between the mock control and IAA  treatments in both DT40 cells and the stable cells.

DESIGN
Exponentially growing DT40 cells or stable DT40 cells expressing OsTIR1 were treated with 500µM IAA for 6 hours.  This experiment was conducued to see if auxin would induce a specific sets of genes in animal, like its does for plant cells.
