TITLE
NaMYB8 regulates distinct, optimally distributed herbivore defense traits

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identifying whether NaMYB8 regulated genes in Nicotiana attenuata

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-MYB8 plants was measured at 1 h and 5 h after elicitation with Manduca sexta oral secretions and control (not treated). Three biological replicates were performed with both wild type and  ir-MYB8 plants. For each replicate, leaves from two samples were pooled. In total 24 microarraies were hybridized.
