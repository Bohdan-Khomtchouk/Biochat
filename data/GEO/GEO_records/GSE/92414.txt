TITLE
Identification of lipid-binding lncRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To comprehensively identify RNA molecules that are naturally associated with cellular lipid components, we isolated lipid fractions and their bound RNAs from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient tissues. Fresh frozen TNBC tissues and their normal counterparts were subjected to total RNA extraction, or in parallel, to whole cell fractionation via Hydrostatic Pressure Cycling to form a lipid-containing upper phase, a denatured protein-containing lower phase, and an insoluble fraction containing DNA and RNA (PBI Inc.) The RNAs extracted from the lipid fractions were applied to LncRNA Array v3.0 (Arraystar).

DESIGN
LncRNA profiling analysis of lipid-bound lncRNAs extracted from paired triple-negative breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal breast tissue by Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0.

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
