TITLE
Hox-C9 activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is associated with spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma [cell line_genex_44k]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-color gene expression profiles from 2 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. To gain insights into the molecular processes occurring upon HOXC9 re-expression, we analyzed gene expression profiles of IMR-32 and SK-N-AS cells after Hox-C9 induction using microarrays. We used gene ontology (GO) annotations to find classes of genes that are significantly over-represented in gene sets that were either up- or downregulated after HOXC9 re-expression. One-color gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Single-color gene expression profiles from 2 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. Total RNA of HOXC9- and GFP-expressing SK-N-AS and IMR-32 cells was isolated at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h using Trizol. To determine global differences in the expression profiles of HOXC9- and GFP-induced SK-N-AS and IMR-32 cells, mean expression levels of each gene between HOXC9-induced and control (GFP) cells were compared. Gene Ontology Tree Machine (GOTM) was used to identify functional categories associated with the condition of the respective cell line.
