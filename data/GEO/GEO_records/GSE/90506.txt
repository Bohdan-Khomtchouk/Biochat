TITLE
Angiocrine Bmp2 signaling in murine liver controls normal iron homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microvascular endothelial cells (EC) display a high degree of phenotypic and functional heterogeneity among different organs. Organ-specific EC control their tissue microenvironment by angiocrine factors in health and disease. Liver sinusoidal EC (LSEC) are uniquely differentiated to fulfil important organ-specific functions in development, under homeostatic conditions, and in regeneration and liver pathology. Recently, Bmp2 has been identified by us as an organ-specific angiokine derived from LSEC. To study angiocrine Bmp2 signaling in the liver, we conditionally deleted Bmp2 in LSEC using EC subtype-specific Stab2-Cre mice. Genetic inactivation of hepatic angiocrine Bmp2 signaling in Stab2-Cre;Bmp2fl/fl (Bmp2LSECKO) mice caused massive iron overload in the liver, and increased serum iron levels and iron deposition in several organs similar to classic hereditary hemochromatosis. Iron overload was mediated by decreased hepatic expression of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis. Thus, angiocrine Bmp2 signaling within the hepatic vascular niche represents a constitutive pathway indispensable for iron homeostasis in vivo that is non-redundant with Bmp6. Notably, we demonstrate that organ-specific angiocrine signaling is essential not only for the homeostasis of the respective organ, but also for the homeostasis of the whole organism.

DESIGN
Primary hepatocytes were isolated from three different mice and stimulated with BMP2 for 24 hours.
