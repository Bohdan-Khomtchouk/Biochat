TITLE
Ba/F3 cells expressing ETV6-PDGFRb and FIP1L1-PDGFRa treated or not with Glivec

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in Ba/F3 cells expressing ETV6-PDGFRB, FIP1L1-PDGFRA or a control vector, treated or not with imatinib (Glivec)

DESIGN
Ba/F3 cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA or ETV6-PDGFRB were cultured in the presence or absence of imatinib for 4 hours before RNA extraction followed by hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. In a control condition Ba/F3 cells were cultured in the presence of IL3  in the absence or in the presence of imatinib for 4 hours before RNA extraction. 4 hours treatment with imatinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing  ETV6-PDGFRB, FIP1L1-PDGFRA or a control vector
