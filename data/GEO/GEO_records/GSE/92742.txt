L1000 Connectivity Map perturbational profiles from Broad Institute LINCS Center for Transcriptomics LINCS Pilot PHASE I (n=1,319,138; updated March 03, 2017)

ORGANISM
Connectivity Map

SUMMARY
The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH program which funds the generation of perturbational profiles across multiple cell and perturbation types, as well as read-outs, at a massive scale. The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes. These files represent L1000 data generated during the LINCS Pilot Phase (2012-2015), as well as profiles generated for more specific purposes, such as assay development and validation projects or testing custom compounds or non-standard cell lines (not part of the core LINCS cell lines). Note: Related GEO projects include (a) Additional L1000 and RNA-Seq data used to validate the assay and improve the inference model, available at GSE92743 (b)  The LINCS “production phase” (also termed Phase II, 2015-2020) which is generating an additional cohort of L1000 data, available at GSE70138. The Platform is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilon For questions or assistance with this dataset, please email the CMap support team at: clue@broadinstitute.org
