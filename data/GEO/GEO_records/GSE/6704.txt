TITLE
Gene expression changes in BVDV2-infected BL3 cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to study the gene expression changes that occurred in BL3 cells that were infected with type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV2).  What happens within the cell and how the cell responds to the virus is completely unknown. Keywords: gene expression changes, BVDV2-infected cells, acute infection

DESIGN
This study compared the gene expression patterns in noninfected BL3 cells to that in cells that had been infected with BVDV2 for 18 hours.  The 2 SAGE libraries were compared to each other to determine which transcripts were present at altered levels in the infected cells.  This data will give clues to how the viral infection gives rise to the different pathologies observed in infected animals.
