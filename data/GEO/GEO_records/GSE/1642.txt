ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of M.tuberculosis was performed using 430 whole-genome microarrays to measure the effects of 75 different drugs, drug combinations or different growth conditions at various times relative to a sample of logarithmically growing MTb. Analysis of this data set revealed 150 underlying clusters of coordinately regulated genes as described in Boshoff et al., 2004.
