TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by putative aspartate racemases, YgeA and AspR, in Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Amino acid racemases are enzymes that catalyze the conversion between L and D- forms of amino acids. While the role of alanine and glutamate raemases in bacteria (specifically Salmonella) are well-studied, relatively less is known about the function of other non-canonical racemases. This study focuses on delineating the role of two such putative aspartate raceases viz. YgeA and AspR in Salmonella Typhimurium. For this purpose, Salmonella strains engineered to lack either one or both of these genes were compared to the wild type strain under planktonic and biofilm-inducing conditions to identify the global changes in gene expression orchestrated by these genes.
