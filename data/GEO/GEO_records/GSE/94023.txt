TITLE
MCF7 breast cancer cell response to estradiol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to uncover the response to estradiol (E2) in MCF7 breast cancer cells.  The first step was to create a reference sample in a ligand free environment.  For that, the cells were placed into estradiol free media for 3 days,  which reduced the binding between ER-alpha and E2. The cells were then ready to be re-exposed to E2.  Following the introduction of E2, the resultant changes were tracked by multiple ChIP-seq experiments.  The experiments were performed at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280 minutes after the stimulation.  Each ChIP-seq experiment was carried out with a different antibody to measure genome-wide changes in  genomic occupancy of their specific protein targets. Specifically, the studied protein factors and  histone modifications were: ER-alpha, H3K4me3, and H2AZ.  Other previously published data from the same set  of experiments are available for Pol-II ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq (GEO accession GSE62789 and GSE44800).
