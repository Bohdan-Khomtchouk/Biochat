TITLE
arcole / pgpr-Nitrogenous nutrition efficiency of canola in spring : identification of targets for plant breeding

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
pc_arcole - arcole / pgpr - What are the genes implicated in the efficiency of nitrogenous nutrition when A.thaliana is inoculated with a PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria)? - A.thaliana seeds germinated and grew during ten days until they were transfered in 6 different media: 0,5 mM nitrate with PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria), 0,5mM nitrate without PGPR, 2mM nitrate with PGPR, 2mM nitrate without PGPR, 20 mM nitrate with PGPR, 20 mM nitrate without PGPR. Young plantlets grew 7 days in these new mediums. Shoots are collected in eppendorf.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - dose response,organ comparison,treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
