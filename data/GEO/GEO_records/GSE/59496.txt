TITLE
Pharmacologic inhibition of histone demethylation as a therapy for pediatric brainstem glioma [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq analysis of a pediatric human diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cell line SF8628, harboring the K27M mutation. Goal was to obtain quantitative estimates of K27me3 immunoprecipitation change between vehicle-treated SF8628 cells [dimethyl sulfoxide, (DMSO)] and SF8628 cells incubated with 6 mM GSKJ4 at 24 hours and 72 hours.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: 72 h GSKJ4-treated cells vs. 24 h GSKJ4-treated cells vs. DMSO-treated cells. Biological replicates: 1 cell line, each with 2 technical replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
