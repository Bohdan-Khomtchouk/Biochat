TITLE
Integrative genome-wide gene expression profiling of clear cell renal cell carcinoma in Czech Republic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted whole-genome expression profiling on 101 pairs of ccRCC tumours and adjacent non-tumour renal tissue from Czech patients using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips to explore the molecular variations underlying the biological and clinical heterogeneity of ccRCC.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from frozen ccRCC tumour and adjacent non-tumour renal tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
