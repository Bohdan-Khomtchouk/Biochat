TITLE
Analysis of gene expression between monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid deficient (elo-5) and wild type N2 C. elegans L1 larvae hatched on food-free NGM plates

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Gene expresssion is not globally shut down in elo-5 as compared to N2 Many changes in metabolic and regulatory gene expression were detected between elo-5 and N2 L1 larvae.

DESIGN
RNA samples for hybridization with the C. elegans Affymetrix Gene Chips were prepared as follows. elo-5(gk208) and N2 control animals were grown from eggs for one generation on NGM plates spotted with 300µl OP50 overnight liquid culture supplemented with 1mM C17ISO in DMSO at 20°C. Gravid adults were washed off the plates with M9 and bleached. Eggs were plated on OP50/NGM plates supplemented with 1mM of either C13ISO or C17ISO and maintained at 20°C to obtain gravid adults. Adults were washed off the plates and bleached, and eggs were then plated on food-free NGM or OP50/NGM plates at 20°C. Twenty-four hours later, L1s from food-free plates were collected for RNA isolation with Trizol and Qiagen’s RNAse Easy Kit, according to the manufacturers’ protocols. On the following days, animals on OP50/NGM were checked for phenotypes to confirm C17ISO-deficiency in elo-5(gk208) grown with C13ISO supplement. Two biological replicates were prepared for each condition; elo-5(gk208) with C13ISO and C17ISO supplements and a control N2 with C13ISO supplement. Data analysis was performed with dChip analytical software (Li and Wong, 2001).
