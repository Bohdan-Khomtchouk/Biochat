TITLE
Murine chondrocytes cellsï¼šstiff gel vs. the soft gel

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse chondrocytes cells comparing control untreated chondrocytes cells with chondrocytes cells plated in stiff and soft ECM. Goal was to determine the effects of ECM stiffness on  gene expression.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: normal, stiff ECM, soft ECM. Biological replicates: 3 normal replicates, 3 stiff ECM replicates, 3 soft ECM replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15523 Phalanx Mouse OneArray Ver 2
