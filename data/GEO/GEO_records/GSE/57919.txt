TITLE
Microbiota modulate transcription in the intestinal epithelium without remodeling the accessible chromatin landscape

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled transcriptome and accessible chromatin landscapes in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from mice reared in the presence or absence of microbiota. We show that regional differences in gene transcription along the intestinal tract were accompanied by major alterations in chromatin organization. Surprisingly, we discovered that microbiota modify host gene transcription in IECs without significantly impacting the accessible chromatin landscape. Instead, microbiota regulation of host gene transcription might be achieved by differential expression of specific TFs and enrichment of their binding sites in nucleosome depleted CRRs near target genes. Our results suggest that the chromatin landscape in IECs is pre-programmed by the host in a region-specific manner to permit responses to microbiota through binding of open CRRs by specific TFs.

DESIGN
mRNA and accessible chromatin (DNase-seq) profiles from colonic and ileal IECs were compared between conventionally-raised (CR), germ-free (GF), and conventionalized (CV) C57BL/6 mice.
