TITLE
Expression data from C4-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of the genome wide impact on gene expression of DNA-PK knockdown or enzymatic inhibition. DNA-PK expression is elevated in multiple tumor types.  DNA-PK has recently been implicated in transcriptional regulation, so understanding genes modulated by DNA-PK may provide insight into disease progression

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed. A genome-wide expression array was performed on a GeneChip Human Gene 2.0ST Array (Affymetrix, 902112) with C4-2 cells depleted of DNA-PK or treated with DNA-PK inhibitor for 24 hours

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
