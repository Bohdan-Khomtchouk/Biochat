TITLE
De Novo assembly and transcriptome analysis of Atlantic salmon macrophage/dendritic-like TO cells following type I IFN treatment and Salmonid alphavirus subtype-3 infection

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN treatment and salmon alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV-3) infection in TO-cells, a macrophage/dendritic like cell-line derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) head kidney leukocytes.

DESIGN
analysis of a transcriptome of DEGs induced by type I IFN and SAV-3 in TO cells generated by RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL19548 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Salmo salar)
