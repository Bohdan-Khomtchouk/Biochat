TITLE
Epigenome analysis of primary MCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of primary MCL. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 132 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
