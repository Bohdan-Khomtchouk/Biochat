TITLE
Genes in nonpermissive temperature-induced cell differentiation of testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which nonpermissive temperature induces cell differentiation in testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells harboring temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells used in the present study were derived from transgenic mice harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. In the TTE3 cells, inactivation of the T-antigen by a nonpermissive temperature at 39˚C led to cell differentiation accompanying elevation of transferrin and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A. Of the 22, 690 probe sets analyzed, nonpermissive temperature up-regulated 729 probe sets and down-regulated 471 probe sets by > 2.0-fold. Keywords: Sertoli cell; differentiation; temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen; nonpermissive temperature

DESIGN
TTE3 cells were cultured at 39˚C for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with the Mouse Expression Array 430A which was spotted with 22,690 probe sets. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacture’s instructions.
