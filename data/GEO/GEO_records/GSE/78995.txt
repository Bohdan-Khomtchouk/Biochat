TITLE
Expression data from early passage UACC melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
eQTL is a powerful method to detect genotype-expression correlation. To be able to identify the genes whose expression levels are correlated with melanoma-associated common variants, eQTL analysis was performed in 59 early passage melanoma cell lines

DESIGN
To perform eQTL analysis, 59 early passage melanoma cell line collected through University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) were grown in culture and harvested at log phase. RNA was extracted using method described below.
