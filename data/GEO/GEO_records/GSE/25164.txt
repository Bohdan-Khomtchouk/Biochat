TITLE
UV effects in mouse melanocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major melanoma risk factor, yet underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we  introduce a mouse model permitting fluorescence-aided melanocyte imaging and isolation following in vivo UV irradiation. We use expression profiling to show that activated neonatal skin melanocytes isolated following a melanomagenic UVB dose bear a distinct, persistent interferon-response signature, including genes associated with immunoevasion. UVB-induced melanocyte activation, characterized by aberrant growth and migration, was abolished by antibody-mediated systemic blockade of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not type-I interferons. IFN-gamma was produced by macrophages recruited to neonatal skin by UVB-induced chemokine receptor Ccr2 ligands. Admixed recruited skin macrophages enhanced transplanted melanoma growth by inhibiting apoptosis; notably, IFN-gamma blockade abolished macrophage-associated melanoma growth and survival. IFN-gamma-producing macrophages were identified in 70% of human melanomas examined. Our data reveal an unanticipated role for IFN-gamma in promoting melanocytic cell survival/immunoevasion, and suggest IFN-gamma-R signaling represents a novel therapeutic melanoma target.

DESIGN
Biologic replicates of UVA- and UVB-treated mouse melanocytes, as well as untreated mouse melanocytes and mouse keratinocytes, were used to define melanocyte expression signatures associated with UV treatment.
