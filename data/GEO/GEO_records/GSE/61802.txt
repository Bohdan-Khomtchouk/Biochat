TITLE
Identify genes modulated by gemcitabine and/or GNE-783 in HT-29 tumors in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identified genes that were up- or down-regulated in HT-29 xenograft tissue in response to the indicated treatments.

DESIGN
Animals were administered 60 mg/kg gemcitabine or vehicle, and 24 hours later were administered 25 mg/kg GNE-783 or vehicle. Tumors were harvested 24 hours later.
