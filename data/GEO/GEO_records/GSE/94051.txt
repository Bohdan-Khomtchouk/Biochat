TITLE
Eomes related gene regulation in Definitive Endoderm (NG Capture-C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Precisely co-ordinated activation of lineage specific transcription factors direct cell fate decisions during mouse early development. The T-box transcription factor Eomes is dynamically expressed during mouse gastrulation and is a key regulator of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), cardiac mesoderm and definitive endoderm (DE) lineages. The cis-acting regulatory elements that direct spatiotemporally restricted Eomes expression domains have yet to be elucidated. To understand transcriptional regulation of Eomes in Definitive Endoderm open chromatin data was generated by ATAC-seq and histone modifications identified by ChIP-seq. Interactions at the Eomes locus and the loci of two related transcription factors Foxa2 and Lhx1, was also determined by NG Capture-C.

DESIGN
NG Capture-C combines 3C library preparation with oligonucleotide capture for the desired viewpoint restriction fragments. The method was applied to biological triplicates of embryonic stem cells, definitive endoderm cells, and erythroid cells capturing either promoter or enhancer elements.
