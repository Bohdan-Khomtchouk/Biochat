TITLE
Mouse Sirt6-/- RelA+/- tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We harvested spleen tissue from Sirt6-/- or Sirt6-/- RelA+/- animals and then completed genome-wide microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and amplified with Amino Allyl MessageAmp II Amplification kit. Amplified age-matched wild-type tissues were used as reference RNA for analysis. Array hybridization of mouse MEEBO arrays is as described (Hendrickson et al., PLoS ONE, 2008). Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
