TITLE
mRNA Expression data from A549 cell line post non-thermal plasma treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although accumulated evidence suggests that NTP induces death of various cancer cell types, thus offering a promising alternative treatment, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is little understood. To understand basic molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by plasma treatment, we firstly investigated biological effects of helium plasma on human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line. The presented data of the tumor transcriptome help identifying the key players of modulated gene expression following exposure to plasma at the molecular level and interpreting the downstream process.

DESIGN
We set several groups including 1 min plasma treatment, 3 min plasma treatment and sham control. In 1 min group, we collected samples at 4 hr postr the stimulation, and in 3 min group, the samples at 1, 2, 4 h after treatment have been collected for analysis.
