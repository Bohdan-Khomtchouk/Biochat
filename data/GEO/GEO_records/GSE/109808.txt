TITLE
Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies TSC1 and DEPDC5 that control HIV-1 latency via the mTOR Signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of factors that control HIV-1latency

DESIGN
CRISPR activation technology was used to identify genes that control HIV-1 latency. The complete sgRNA library (plasmid sample) were packaged into lentivirus and used to transduce C11 cells (transduced sample). The proportion of GFP positive C11 cells increased after infection with CRISPRV2.0. GFP positive cells were sorted for 4 rounds and enriched genes. In three independent biological replicates( samples Screen1, 2, and 3),  the sgRNAs enriched in Initial,GFP negative andGFP postive populations were sequenced.
