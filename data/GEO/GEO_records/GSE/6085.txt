TITLE
Expression data from Murine T cell in response to IL-2 at 10 time points in 24 hours after IL-2 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cytokine IL-2 determines T cell fate by controlling T cell proliferation and differentiation, but the expression files of IL-2 regulated genes are not defined Using Affymetrix mouse genome array and mouse T cell line CTLL-2, we analyzed the expression profiles of IL-2 regulated genes over 10 time points in 24 hours after IL-2 treatment. A total of 2,813 genes were differentially expressed (?2-fold change) at least at one time point in response to IL-2 stimulation. Clustering analyses showed that these genes consist of 9 clusters, suggesting that the IL-2 regulated genes in mouse T cells have 9 expression patterns. These genes involve in many biological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, apoptosis, cell cycle, transcription, transport, biosynthesis and various metabolisms. Two supplementary tables are linked to this series: Table 1:  IL-2 responsive genes over the first 24 hours post-stimulation Table 2:  Newly identified IL-2 regulated genes function in a variety of biological processes Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line CTLL-2, derived from a C57BL/6 mouse, is an IL-2 dependent cell line. Cells were cultured in D10 medium in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37oC to mid-log phase (~2 X 105 cells/mL), and collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen), resuspended at 1 X 106 cells/mL in the medium without IL-2 (IL-2 starvation) and cultured for 14 hours (No IL-2 stimulation, T0, 5 reps). After adding human rIL-2 (100 U/mL, Chiron, IL-2 stimulation), cells were collected at time point 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours, at least 3 biological replicates were carried out for each time point.Total RNA were extracted from the cells and was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
