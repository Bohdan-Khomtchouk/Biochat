TITLE
Expression data from Murine T cell in response to IL-2 at 10 time points in 24 hours after IL-2 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cytokine IL-2 determines T cell fate by controlling T cell proliferation and differentiation, but the expression files of IL-2 regulated genes are not defined Using Affymetrix mouse genome array and mouse T cell line CTLL-2, we analyzed the expression profiles of IL-2 regulated genes over 10 time points in 24 hours after IL-2 treatment. A total of 2,813 genes were differentially expressed (?2-fold change) at least at one time point in response to IL-2 stimulation. Clustering analyses showed that these genes consist of 9 clusters, suggesting that the IL-2 regulated genes in mouse T cells have 9 expression patterns. These genes involve in many biological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, apoptosis, cell cycle, transcription, transport, biosynthesis and various metabolisms. Two supplementary tables are linked to this series: Table 1:  IL-2 responsive genes over the first 24 hours post-stimulation Table 2:  Newly identified IL-2 regulated genes function in a variety of biological processes Keywords: stress response
