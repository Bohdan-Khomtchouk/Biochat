TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of gibberellin-signaling mutants in rice [Oryza sativa]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Gibberellins control a wide range of aspects of plant growth and development. Although a series of mutant of the signaling pathway has been identified, the global regulatory network underlying gibberellin signal transduction has not been revealed. To address this issue, we performed microarray analysis with rice gibberellin signaling mutants, gid1, gid2, slr, and the parental cultivar Taichung 65.

DESIGN
We analyzed gid1-3, gid2-1, slr1 (k1001), and their parental cultiver Taichung 65. In each line, we prepared 3 biological replicates. Thus, 12 samples were analyzed in this experiment
