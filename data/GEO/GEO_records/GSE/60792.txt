TITLE
ChIP-seq of erythroid progenitors treated with vehicle or the HDAC1/2-selective inhibitor ACY-957

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establish the DNA binding profiles of HDAC1, HDAC2 and Gata2 in erythroid progenitors derived from human CD34+ bone marrow cells.  Determine the effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition on the DNA binding profiles of Gata2.

DESIGN
5 samples in total. Cells have either been treated with vehicle or ACY-957 (an HDAC1/2 selective inhibitor) prior to immunoprecipitation. Sample 1 is chromatin from vehicle treated cells immunoprecipitated with anti-HDAC1 antibody. Sample 2 is chromatin from vehicle treated cells immunoprecipitated with anti-HDAC2 antibody. Sample 3 and 4 are chromatin from vehicle treated or ACY-957 treated cells immunoprecipitated with anti-Gata2, respectively. Sample 5 is the input sample, which is a mix of non-immunoprecipitated chromatin from vehicle treated and ACY-957 treated cells.
