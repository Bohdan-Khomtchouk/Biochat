TITLE
Phanerochaete chrysosporium gene expression on different substrates

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP-78

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarrays based on the annotated genomes of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, we monitored the changes in its transcriptomes relevant to cell wall degradation during growth on three chemically distinct Populus trichocarpa (poplar) wood substrates. Results of this study are sumbitted for review in Biotechnology for Biofuels
