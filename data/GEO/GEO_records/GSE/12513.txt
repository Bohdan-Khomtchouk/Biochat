TITLE
Genes regulated by AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines FA6 and MiaPaCa2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have shown that AGR2 is frequently upregulated during the development of pancreatic cancer. We used microarray to look at the target genes regulated by AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines FA6 and MiaPaCa2. Keywords: gene knock-down, overexpression

DESIGN
We transiently down-regulated AGR2 expression in FA6 pancreatic cancer cells using INTERFERin transfection reagent and either AGR2 siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA for 48 hours. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We looked for new target genes regulated by AGR2. We generated stable cell lines by introducing control vector pCEP4 or AGR2 overexpressing vector pCEP4-AGR2 into the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2, single cell clones were then isolated. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.We looked for new target genes regulated by AGR2.
