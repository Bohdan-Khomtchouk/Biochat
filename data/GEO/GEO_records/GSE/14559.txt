Timed induction of 50 transcription factors in ES cells reveals a common mechanism to initiate differentiations

SUMMARY
To decipher the structure and behaviors of the transcription factor (TF) network, we created 50 permanent mouse ES cell lines, in each of which one of the 50 transcription factors tagged with FLAG, is inserted into the doxycycline (dox)-repressible ROSA26 locus. Expression profiling reveals Cdx2 as the most potent inducer of transcriptome perturbation in ES cells, followed by Esx1, Sox9, Tcf3, Klf4, and Gata3. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with a FLAG-antibody in Cdx2-induced ES cells, identifies NuRD in CDX2-associated protein complexes; and chromatin-IP-sequencing identifies CDX2-binding sites predominantly in genes up-regulated by CDX2. Compendium analyses of Cdx2- and the other TF-inducible ES cells suggest a central role of the POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG protein complex in a swift-acting control mechanism to down-regulate a common set of genes at the beginning of multi-lineage ES cell differentiations. These ES cell lines will be a valuable resource to study biological networks in ES cells and mice.
