TITLE
Genome-wide Transcriptional Responses of the Filamentous Fungus Aspergillus niger to Lignocellulose (Wheat straw) using RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
We have studied the physiological response of the fungus Aspergillus niger when exposed to wheat straw as a model lignocellulosic substrate. Using RNA-sequencing we showed that, 24 hours after exposure to straw, gene expression of known plant cell wall degrading enzymes represents a huge investment for the cells (about 20 % of the total mRNA). Our results also uncovered new esterases and surface interacting proteins that might form part of the fungal degradative arsenal. We also show that antisense transcripts are abundant and that their expression can be regulated by conditions.

DESIGN
Triplicate samples of A. niger N402 taken at each of three timepoints: After  48 h growth in minimal media with Glucose as sole carbon source, After transfer to Wheat Straw media for 24 h and  5 h after after the exogenous addition of glucose to the wheat starw media.

PLATFORM
GPL14910 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Aspergillus niger)
