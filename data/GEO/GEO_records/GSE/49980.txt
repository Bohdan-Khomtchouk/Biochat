TITLE
The transcriptomic response of rat hepatic stellate cells to endotoxin: implications for hepatic inflammation and immune regulation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Located in the perisinusoidal space of Disse, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) communicate with all other liver cell types by physical association and / or by producing cytokines and chemokines. In liver disease and folllowing liver transplantation, elevated levels of endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide: LPS) stimulate HSCs to produce increased amounts of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptomic analysis of cultured HSCs stimulated with LPS yields a survey of expression changes which potentially modulate the hepatic inflammatory and immune responses.

DESIGN
In two independent experiments, rat HSCs were cultured with or without 10 ng/ml LPS for 1h and 24h, then harvested for microarray analysis (i.e., 8 samples). In the first of these experiments, cells also were also harvested after 3, 6 and 12 hours of LPS treatment, for a total of 11 samples.
