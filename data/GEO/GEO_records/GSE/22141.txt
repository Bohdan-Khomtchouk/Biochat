TITLE
MicroRNA signature during the time course of regeneration of the human airway mucociliary epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regeneration of the airway mucociliary epithelium involves several sequential events including migration, proliferation, polarization and final differentiation (i.e ciliogenesis). The airway mucociliary epithelium is consituted of three main cell types : ciliated cells, secretory cells and basal cells. We used microRNA microrrays to investigate the signature of microRNA during the four step of regeneration of the airway epithelium.

DESIGN
Four time points (ALI-D0, ALI-D7, ALI-D14, ALI-D21) of regeneration of the airway epithelium for 3 donors.
