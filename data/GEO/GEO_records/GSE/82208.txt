TITLE
Gene expression markers differentiating between malignant and benign follicular thyroid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential diagnosis between malignant follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and benign follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) is a great challenge for even an experienced pathologist and requires special effort. Molecular markers may potentially support a differential diagnosis between FTC and FTA in postoperative specimens. The purpose of this study was to derive molecular support for the differential diagnosis, in the form of a simple multigene mRNA-based classifier that would differentiate between FTC and FTA tissue samples.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in 27 follicular thyroid cancers and 25 follicular thyroid adenomas.
