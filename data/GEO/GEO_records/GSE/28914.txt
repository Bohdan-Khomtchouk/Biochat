TITLE
Human Skin Transcriptome during Epidermal Wound Healing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to clarify the human response of re-epithelialization, we biopsied split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds immediately before and after harvesting, as well as during the healing process 3 and 7 days thereafter. Altogether 25 biopsies from 8 patients qualified for the study. All samples were analysed by genome-wide microarrays. Here we identified the genes associated with normal skin re-epithelialization on time-scale, and organized them by similarities according to their induction or suppression patterns during wound healing.

DESIGN
Overall 25 samples were analyzed
