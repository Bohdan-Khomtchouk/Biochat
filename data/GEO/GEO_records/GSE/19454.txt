TITLE
Expression data from P7 and adult wt and Tenascin-R (Tnr) deficient mice brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray to investigate the lack of Tenascin-R in brain of adult and P7 mice. The aim was to find differential expressed genes which could explain the behaviour differences between the tenascin wt and ko mice. The data show that not many genes are dysregulated in the Tnr deficient mouse in comparison to the wt mouse brain. Gas5 was one of the dysregulated genes. Gas5 was dysregulated in the P7 and 2 month old mice.
