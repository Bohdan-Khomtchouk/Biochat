TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gemin2 mutant transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of gemin2 Arabidopsis mutant with wild type plants grown under continous light conditions

DESIGN
WT and gemin2 mutant plants were grown for nine days under continuous white light at 22 degrees centigrades and the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed using RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
