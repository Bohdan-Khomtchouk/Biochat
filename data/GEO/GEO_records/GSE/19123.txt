TITLE
Lactic acidosis triggers starvation response with distinct metabolic profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
[1] Lactic acidosis time course: MCF7 cells were exposed to lactic acidosis for different length of time. We used microarrays to examine the genomic programs of cells incubated under lactic acidosis for different length of time [2] Metabolic profiling: MCF7 cells were exposed to control condition, 25mM lactic acidosis, glucose deprivation (zero glucose) and hypoxia (1% oxygen level). [3] Mouse study: Lactic acidosis triggers starvation response with paradoxical induction of TXNIP through MondoA. Wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and TXNIP-null MEFs were exposed to Ctrl versus lactic acidosis conditions for 24hrs and the RNAs from cells were extracted with MiRVana kit (Ambion) and applied to Affymetrix 430A mouse chips We used microarrays to examine the genomic programs of cells incubated under different microenvironmental stresses.

DESIGN
[1] Lactic acidosis time course: MCF7 cells were exposed to lactic acidosis for 1, 4, 12 and 24 hours. [2] Metabolic profiling: MCF7 cells were exposed to lactic acidosis, glucose deprivation and hypoxia for 4hours. [3] wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and TXNIP-null MEFs were exposed to Ctrl versus lactic acidosis conditions for 24hrs.
