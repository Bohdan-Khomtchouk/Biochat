TITLE
Identification of genes associated with bone metastatic breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used comparative RNA hybridization (Affymetrix) analysis between Bone metastatic derivatives isolated in vivo and parental cells and focused on changes affecting the expression of potential bone metastasis genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA from biological and technical replicates of parental MCF7 and BoM2 bone metastasis derivatives grown for 48 hours in regular media (see growth protocol) was isolated from in vitro cultured control and MAF expressing MCF7 parental cells. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzolÂ® Plus RNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies).
