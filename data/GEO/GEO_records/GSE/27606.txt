TITLE
Resection of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Reverses Tumor-Induced Gene Expression Changes in the Peripheral Immune System

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have examined the changes that occur in microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from  paired pre- vs. post-tumor removal samples in order to characterize the way lung tumor removal affects gene expression in peripheral immune cells.  5 miRNAs were expressed at significantly higher levels before vs. after tumor removal. Significant number of genes that were identified computationally as targets of the miRNAs and negatively correlated with the miRNA expression were transcription factors.

DESIGN
miRNA expression changes were compared between 11 pre and post surgery NSCLC lung cancer samples.
