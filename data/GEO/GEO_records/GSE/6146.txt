TITLE
Expression data from CD34+CD38- stem cells and more differentiated CD34+CD38+ progenitor cellsmbryo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of CD34+CD38- stem cells and more differentiated CD34+CD38+ progenitor cells were compared. Comparison of expression profiles of hematopoietic stem cells from fetal liver, umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized pheripheral blood allowed us to identify a unique set of genes with conserved expression during ontogeny. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
CD34+CD38- en CD34+CD38+ cell populations were isolated by cell sorting from human Bone Marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood and fetal liver. Total RNA was isolated from each cell population followed by the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA. After fragmentation the biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to affymetrix U133A chips.
