TITLE
Expression data of 10-day-old wild-type and chl1-5 plants exposed to 25 mM nitrate for 0h or 0.5h

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CHL1 is one of major nitrate transporters responsible for nitrate uptake and some studies suggest that it may be also play a role in regulating the nitrate response, its influence was analyzed in a global transcriptome study using Affymetrix ATH1 array. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of 10-day-old Arabidopsis root tissue from wild-type and chl1-5 plants were performed to explore differences  in gene expression between the wild-type and chl1-5 mutants exposed to 25 mM nitrate for 0h (T0) or 0.5h (T0.5) using Affymetrix ATH1 microarray.
