TITLE
Expression profiling of small intestine lamina propria dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells play a vital role in initiating robust immunity against pathogens as well as maintaining immunological tolerance to self antigens, food antigens and intestinal commensals. However, the intracellular signaling networks that program DCs to become tolerogenic are largely unknown. To address this, we analyzed gene expression profiles using microarray analysis of purified intestinal lamina propria DCs (CD11c+ CD11b+ DCs and CD11c+ CD11b- DCs) from mice. Keywords: Lamina propria, DCs, cell type comparison

DESIGN
We sought to determine the expression profile of small intestine lamina propria CD11c+ cells. RNA was extracted from DCs sorted from mouse small intestine (CD11c+CD11b- and CD11c+CD11b+ cells) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
