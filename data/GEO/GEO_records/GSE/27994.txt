TITLE
Expressed sequences and polymorphisms in rohu carp (Labeo rohita, Hamilton) revealed by mRNA-seq

ORGANISM
Labeo rohita

SUMMARY
An integrated approach was used to identify genes associated with resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila, an important bacterial pathogen causing aeromoniasis in rohu Labeo rohita. DNA polymorphism and gene expression profiling in lines of L. rohita selected for resistance or susceptibility to challenge with A. hydrophila, and grown in a common environment, were studied using Illumina mRNA-seq of selectively pooled RNA samples.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq of pooled samples from resistant and susceptible lines of rohu for expression characterisation and SNP detection

PLATFORM
GPL13291 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Labeo rohita)
