TITLE
Gene expression profiles of GPR15 knock out macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To confirm the changed gene expression profiles in GPR15 knock out (KO) macrophages, we applied a SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression service from Takara Bio Inc (Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) to analyze gene expression profiles in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated GPR15KO macrophages, comparing with wild type (WT) macrophages. Most significantly up-regulated genes in GPR15KO macropahges included Il6, Il17a, Il23, Tnfsf8, Il1b, Ifna2 and Ccnd2. On the contrary, several inflammation-related genes, including Ccl17, Itgax, Nrp1 and Rasgrf2, were down-regulated in WT macrophages, compared to GPR15 KO macrophages.

DESIGN
Abdominal macrophages from WT and GPR15 KO mice were stimulated with PBS or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs. Total RNA were extracted using a TRIzol-chloroform based method.
