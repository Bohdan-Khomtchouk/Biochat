TITLE
Comparing global transcriptional changes that resulted from loss of Ypk1 or Ypk2 activity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by the AGC kinases Ypk1 and Ypk2

DESIGN
Experiment is designed to identify genes regulated by the kinases Ypk1 and Ypk2.  These are functionally redundant AGC kinases such that yeast cells can grow in the presence of either one but the absence of both is lethal.  We used a chemical genetic approach to selectively inhibit engineered ATP analog sensitive alleles (AS alleles) of each kinase.  Experimental design is such that wild type (WT) Ypk1 or Ypk2 or (AS) Ypk1 or Ypk2 genes are expressed individually on plasmids in a strain background that is deleted for both Ypk1 and Ypk2 (ypk1 delta ypk2 delta).  Cultures expressing these plasmids are treated with an ATP analog that is specific for AS Ypk1 or AS Ypk2.  Thus, cells expressing wild type Ypk1 or Ypk2 are not sensitive but cells expressing their AS counterparts are sensitive.  Arrays typically compare expression patterns in WT versus AS expressing cells at the same time point following inhibitor treatment.
