TITLE
Expression analysis of blastocysts in Kdm4b-PEs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the genes that are controled by H3K9me3 modification in PEs, we conducted transcriptome analysis using Egfp-, Kdm4b-PEs, and IVF embryos at blastocyst stages.

DESIGN
Kdm4b or Egfp mRNA injected oocytes were parthenogenetically activated.  IVF embryos were generated according to standard protcol. All embryos were cultured in KSOM medium for 120 hours after activation or sperm insemination. Five blastocysts per one biological replicate were pooled and analyzed.
