TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Traf6 function in early zebrafish embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In order to study Traf6 function during early zebrafish embryogenesis, transcriptome expression profiling was performed at 30% epiboly using a morpholino based knock-down approach.

DESIGN
Two-factorial design with the factors 'Treatment' (5 levels:'Phenol Red', 'Standard Control', 'Mismatch', 'Morpholino1' and Morpholino 2') and 'Dose' (3 levels: 'Low', 'Middel' and 'High') with the factor 'Dose' only being applicable to the morpholino injections and not to the 'Phenol Red' control.
