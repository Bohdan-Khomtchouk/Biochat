TITLE
miRNA expression in blood of 15 schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study profiles genome-wide miRNA expression in blood from 15 early-onset SZ (EOS) cases and 15 healthy controls. A total of 1070 miRNAs were detected by the microarrays in our samples. We profiles miRNA expression in 15 schizophrenia samples and 15 healthy controls to explore the alteration of miRNAs in schizophrenia.

DESIGN
15 schizophrenia samples and 15 healthy controls were used to acquire blood expression profiles of a total of 1065 unique miRNAs
