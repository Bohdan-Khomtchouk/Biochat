TITLE
CGH analysis of chemical induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of CiPSCs (clone CiPS-57 and CiPS-58) and OSKM-iPSCs. C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genome DNA as a reference. No consistent copy number variations (CNVs) among CiPSCs and OSKM-iPSCs.

DESIGN
Genome DNA of CiPSCs and OSKM-iPSCs (both of them induced form C57BL/6 MEFs) was isolated and compared with C57BL/6 MEFs genomic DNA reference by the NimbleGen Mouse CGH 3x720K Whole-Genome Tiling Array.
