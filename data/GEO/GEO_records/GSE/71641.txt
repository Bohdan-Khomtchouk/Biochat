TITLE
Human periheral blood-derived monocytes and unstimulated as well as IL-4-stimulated differentiating macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD14+ monocytes were separated from human peripheral blood and exposed to IL-4 for 12 or 72 hours then subjected to microarray analysis We used Affymetrix miRNA1.0 microarray to obtain global miRNA expression data of human monocytes, unstimulated and IL-4-stimulated differentiating macrophages.

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were separated from human peripheral blood and exposed to IL-4 for 12 or 72 hours. The global miRNA expression patterns of human monocytes, unstimulated and IL-4-stimulated differentiating macrophages were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.
