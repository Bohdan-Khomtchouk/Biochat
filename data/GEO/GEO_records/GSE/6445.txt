TITLE
velvetleaf/corn competition study

ORGANISM
Abutilon theophrasti

SUMMARY
This study was designed to look for differential gene expression in the annual dicot weed velvetleaf when it is grown in competition with corn relative to when it is grown in monoculture. Keywords: weed/crop competition

DESIGN
There were three biological replicates for each treatment [growth with corn (W1, W2, and W3) and growth in monoculture (C1, C2, and C3)]. These were compared directly in a rolling circle dye swap design and included two additional cross circle hybridizations.

PLATFORM
GPL4043 CSIRO cotton whole plant cDNA array
