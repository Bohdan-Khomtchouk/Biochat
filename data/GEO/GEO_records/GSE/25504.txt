TITLE
Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of host molecular networks in neonatal sepsis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify the gene network and pathway biology associated with neonatal sepsis by determining genome-wide alterations in host RNA in infected infants

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from control and infected human neonates.
