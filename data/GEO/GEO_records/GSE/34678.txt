A Genome-wide Study of Cytogenetic Changes in Colorectal Cancer Using SNP Microarrays: Possibilities for Future Personalized Treatment

SUMMARY
In colorectal cancer (CRC), chromosomal instability (CIN) is typically studied using comparative-genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. We studied paired (tumor and surrounding healthy) fresh-frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illuminaâ€™s Infinium-based SNP array. This method allowed us to study CIN in CRC, with simultaneous analysis of copy number (CN) and B-allele frequency (BAF), which is a representation of allelic composition.  This data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations, some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF. We identified associations between CN abnormalities and different CRC phenotypes (MSI, histological diagnosis, location, tumor grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node metastasis). We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in CRC and the regions reported in previous studies of other solid cancers (e.g., amplifications of 20q, 13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p). From the Therapeutic Target Database we found relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with CN changes, approved or in trials for other cancers and common diseases. These drugs may be considered for future therapeutic trials in CRC, based on personalized cytogenetic diagnosis. We also found many regions harboring genes which are not currently targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery studies. Our study shows the application of high-density SNP arrays for cytogenetic study in CRC  and its importance for personalized treatment.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from colon tissue samples provided by 86 CRC patients. Each patient provided paired CRC tumor tissue and adjacent normal colon mucosa samples, which were fresh-frozen after resection. Samples were genotyped using Illumina's Infinium-based 610 Quad and CytoSNP 12 microarray chips. The genotype data from paired tumor and normal samples was used to detect tumor-specific chromosomal instabilities in copy number, including copy-neutral LOH, which cannot be assessed by many other cytogenetic methods.
