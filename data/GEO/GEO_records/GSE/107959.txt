TITLE
Expression analysis of Wild-type, lncGata6 deficient and Ehf deficient ISCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially expressed genes in lncGata6 deficient and Ehf deficient ISCs

DESIGN
mRNA and lncRNA expression profiling of GFP+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs), GFP- non-ISCs, LncGata6mut ISCs and Ehf-/- ISCs.  Intestinal crypts from Lgr5GFP-CreERT2 mice were isolated for ISCs enrichment by FACS. Total RNA from each samples was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray were performed in accordance with the Affymetrix ClariomTM D mouse array analysis protocol (previously known as GeneChipâ„¢ Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0)
