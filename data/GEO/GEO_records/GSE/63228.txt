TITLE
Xenopus Piwi protein associated transcripts indicate regulation beyond transposons

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
This study examines the population of transcripts associated with the Xenopus Piwi proteins, Xiwi and Xili, from X.laevis and X.tropicalis. RIP-seq, CLIP-seq, piRNA-seq, and mRNA-seq datasets were integrated to determine how the Xenopus Piwi proteins where using piRNAs and binding interactions to associate with  transcripts in gonadal cells.

DESIGN
We performed several replicates of a Piw CLIP-Seq experiment to isolate RNA fragments as CLIP-tags to discover which transcripts are preferentially bound by the Piwi protein.  Then we performed several types of mRNA expression profiling experiments using several forms of mRNA-Seq library construction formats.  Finally, we sequenced the piRNAs from the OSS cells
