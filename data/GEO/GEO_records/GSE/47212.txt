TITLE
Murine HCC development: comparison of wt, krt18+/- and krt18-/- liver tumors hybridized against non-affected wt liver tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the different genotype tumors revealed enhanced chromosomal aberrations in all tumors. The most chromosomal aberrations were found in the krt18-/- tumors.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: wt (non-affected) liver tissue vs. wt tumor / krt18+/-tumor / krt18-/- tumor

PLATFORM
GPL17189 Agilent-028916 Mouse 8x60k CGH [ProbeName version]
