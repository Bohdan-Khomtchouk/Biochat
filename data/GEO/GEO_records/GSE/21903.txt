TITLE
Nuclear orphan receptor TAK1/TR4-deficient mice are protected against obesity-linked inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The nuclear receptor TAK1/TR4/NR2C2 is expressed in several tissues that are important in the control of energy homeostasis. TAK1-deficient (TAK1-/-) mice are resistant to the development of age- and high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome. Biochemical analysis showed significantly lower hepatic triglyceride levels and reduced lipid accumulation in adipose tissue in TAK1-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) mice. Gene expression profiling analysis revealed that the expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in lipid uptake and triglyceride synthesis and storage, including Cidea, Cidec, Mogat1, and CD36, was greatly decreased in the liver of TAK1-/- mice. Moreover, TAK1-/- mice exhibit reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory genes in adipose tissue and were resistant to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. TAK1-/- mice consume more oxygen and produce more carbon dioxide than WT mice suggesting a higher rate of energy expenditure. Together, these results indicate that TAK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of energy and lipid homeostasis and potentiates the development of metabolic syndrome. Our study suggests that TAK1 might provide a novel therapeutic target in the management of metabolic syndrome.

DESIGN
For microarray liver total RNAs were purified from WT and TAK1 KO mice and applied on Agilent mouse genome chip. Liver from 1 year old- WT and TAK1 KO mice.
