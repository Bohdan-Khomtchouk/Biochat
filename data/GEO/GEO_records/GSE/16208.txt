TITLE
AIN-2::GFP IP of mRNAs associated with miRISC in stage sychronized C. elegans populations

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
AIN-2::GFP IP were used to purify miRISC from stage sychronized C.elegans populations (Egg, L1, L2, L3 and L4 stages). The mRNA composition of the IP results and the corresponding total RNA samples were analyzed by WUSTL Caenorhabditis elegans Whole Genome 23k Oligo Array. The miRISC associated mRNAs (miRNA targets) in each stage were identified by measuring the relative enrichment of each mRNA in the IP sample versus the corresponding total RNA sample

DESIGN
The mRNAs in AIN-2::GFP IP results (IP) and the corresponding input total lysate (tot) were analyzed for each stage (Egg, L1, L2, L3, and L4 stages). At least three independent biological replicates were analyzed for each stage.
