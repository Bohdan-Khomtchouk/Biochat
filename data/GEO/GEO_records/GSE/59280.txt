TITLE
Microarray Analysis Reveals a Role of the Notch System in Ciona Siphon Regeneration

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis indicated many changes in gene expression, including genes related the the Notch signaling system, during oral siphon regeneration in adult Ciona. Subsequent qPCR gene expression and inhibitor of experiments confirm a role of the Notch system, probably in the formation of a regeneration blastema.

DESIGN
To identify the genes defferentially expressed in degenerating siphone, gene expressions in intact siphones and excised siphones (after 3 days, 6 days and 9 days) were examined.
