TITLE
A Genome-wide DNA Methylation Study in Colorectal Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of tumor and surrounding healthy colonic mucosa from patients with colorectal carcinoma. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 27,578 CpG loci covering 14,475 genes.

DESIGN
Samples included a total of 48 paired normal and tumor samples from 24 patients.  The paired samples were put on the same chip.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
