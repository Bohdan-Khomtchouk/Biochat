TITLE
Mechanisms of TGFB1 induced atrial fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This project aims to compare gene expression in transgenic mice that overexpress TGFB1 to wild type mice. Transgenic mice have a fibrotic response in the atria, but not the ventricle.

DESIGN
This is a 2 color design; dye swaps and a loop design were incorporated. Each group has N=4, with the exception being WT atria which has N=3 and was hybridied twice, the groups are Wt atria, WT ventricle, Transgenic atria, Transgenic ventricle. Comparisons of interest : Tg atria vs WT atria, Tg ventricle vs WT ventricle, WT atria vs.dWT ventricle, Tg atria vs Tg ventricle
