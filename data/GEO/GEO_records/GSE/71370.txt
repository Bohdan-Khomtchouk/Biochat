TITLE
Profiling of CD14+ monocytes from paired rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-patient peripheral blood and synovial fluid samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD14+ monocytes sorted from the synovial fluid or peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients were analyzed by full transcriptome microarray analysis. Monocytes from healthy control samples (peripheral blood) were also profiled.

DESIGN
A total of 26 samples consisting of 16 paired and 2 un-paired synovial fluid and peripheral blood derived CD14+ monocytes from RA-patients, as well as peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes from 8 healthy control subjects were compared. Sorted monocytes (at least of 95% purity) from each of the donors were obtained individually, and compared by full transcriptome profiling.
