TITLE
Early transcriptional response to phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris by susceptible cabbage host

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea var. capitata

SUMMARY
Black rot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is one of the most devastating diseases of cruciferous crops worldwide. The pathogen infects and multiplies in plant vascular tissues and, as the disease progresses, the veins of infected tissues turn black and characteristic V-shaped lesions appear along the margins of leaves.The aim of this work is to identify differentially expressed genes from Brassica oleracea during early infection by Xcc, in an attempt to identify proteins related to resistance.

DESIGN
Cabbge seedlings were inoculated with Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc) suspension and cabbage gene expression at 6h., 24h. And 48h. After inoculation was assessed with help of Brassica 95k EST microarray chip.

PLATFORM
GPL20168 Agilent-018073 Custom Brassica 60-mer two-color microarray [Probe Name version]
