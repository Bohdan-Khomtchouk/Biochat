TITLE
Early transcriptional response to phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris by susceptible cabbage host

ORGANISM
Brassica

SUMMARY
Black rot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is one of the most devastating diseases of cruciferous crops worldwide. The pathogen infects and multiplies in plant vascular tissues and, as the disease progresses, the veins of infected tissues turn black and characteristic V-shaped lesions appear along the margins of leaves.The aim of this work is to identify differentially expressed genes from Brassica oleracea during early infection by Xcc, in an attempt to identify proteins related to resistance.
