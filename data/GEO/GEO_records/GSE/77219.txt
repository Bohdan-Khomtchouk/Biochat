TITLE
RNA Sequencing Reveals Immunosuppressive Role of Anthrax Lethal Toxin in Human Lung Epithelial and Monocytic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report here that anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) induces immunosuppression in human lung epithelial cell line A549 and monocytic cell line U937.

DESIGN
Examination of LeTx-treated A549 and U937, generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (101 cycles PE lane).
