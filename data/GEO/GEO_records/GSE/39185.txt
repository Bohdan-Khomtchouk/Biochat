TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of an evolutionary strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to cobalt 10mM

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes implicated in the resistance to cobalt in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The evolved strains and the wild type were harvested in exponential phase

DESIGN
WT (CEN.PK), the evolved strain (CI25E) and the evolved strain delta Cot1 harvested in exponential phase (DO 600nm=3) ; three independant replicate for each.

PLATFORM
GPL9294 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
