TITLE
Influence of manufacturing processes on cell surface properties of probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35®

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus rhamnosus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in  Lcr35® pharmaceutical formulations, compared to the native strain.

DESIGN
A nine chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of  Lcr35® native strain or of the two different formulations restituo capsule and packet.  Each chip measures the expression level of 7303 genes from 25 Lactobacillus with 2 or 3 45-60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.

PLATFORM
GPL18863 Lactobacillus_135k array
