TITLE
Expression analysis of Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 grown in glucose or xylose

ORGANISM
Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 grown aerobically in xylose, compared to the same strain grown aerobically in glucose.

DESIGN
A six array study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 grown in glucose and three separate cultures of Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 grown in xylose.  Each array measures the expression level of 362,487 probes (average probe length 54.5 +/- 4.0 nt) tiled across the Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 genome with a median spacing distance of 29 nt.  During data processing, probes are filtered to include only those probes corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes.
