TITLE
The human skeletal muscle transcriptome assessed with RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The amount of RNA sequencing data on skeletal muscle is very limited. We have analyzed a large set of human muscle biopsy samples and provide extensive information on the baseline skeletal muscle transcriptome, including completely novel protein-coding transcripts.

DESIGN
Analyze of transcriptome in 24 skeletal muscle biopsy samples, 12 individuals and one biopsy per leg per individual

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
