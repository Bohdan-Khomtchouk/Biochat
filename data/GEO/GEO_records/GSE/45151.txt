TITLE
Influence of developmental stage and genotype on liver mRNA levels among wild, domesticated, and hybrid rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
A 44K salmonid oligoarray was used to examine the influence of genotype and developmental stage on mRNA expression in wild-type (age matched and size matched to domesticated), domesticated and wild-domesticated hybrid populations. Significant differences were found in mRNA expression between genotypes. The largest proportion of differentially expressed mRNAs were found in comparisons of domesticated and wild-type groups. Significant differences were also noted in pairings of wild-domesticated hybrid progeny to both parental strains. Differences in gene expression were found in comparison of both wild-type age and size matched to each other and in combination with genotype analysis, showing a strong effect of fish developmental stage on differential gene expression. Domestication was found to modify biological pathways associated with transport, metabolism, cell tissue structure and development, stress and immune response and protein synthesis. Genotype analysis of hybrid progeny inheritance patterns showed similar levels of recessive, dominant and additive effects.
