TITLE
Development of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) genotyping array

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
Genotyping arrays are tools for high throughput genotyping, which is required in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since the first cucumber genome draft was reported, genetic maps were constructed mainly based on simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) or on combinations of SSRs and other sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). In this study we developed the first cucumber genotyping array which consisted of 32,864 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These markers cover the cucumber genome every 2.1Kb and have parents/F1 hybridizations as a training set. The training set was validated with Fludigm technology and had 98% concordance. The application of the genotyping array was illustrated by constructed a genetic map of 600 cM in length based on recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population of a 9930XGy14 cross of which compromise of 11564 SNPs. The markers collinearity between the genetic map and genome references of the two parents estimated as R2=0.97. Moreover, this comparison supports a translocation in the beginning of chromosome 5 that occurred in the lineage of 9930 and Gy14 as well as local variation in the recombination rate. We also used the array to investigate the local allele frequencies along the cucumber genome and found specific region with segregation distortions. We believe that the genotyping array together with the training set would be a powerful tool in applications such as quantitative-trait loci (QTL) analysis and GWAS.

DESIGN
The samples included 6 replicates of 9930, 5 replicates of GY14 and 5 replicates of the F1 progeny of these two strains. In addition, 134 recombinant inbred lines (F7 and F8) from the same cross.
