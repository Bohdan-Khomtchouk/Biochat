TITLE
Development of a glycan microarray based method for ABO blood typing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to develop a novel method to assign ABO blood type.  The method will then be applied to samples from patients treated with PROSTVAC to determine if blood type correlates with survival Results:  Many blood group A and B antigens correlate with blood type.  Blood typing is best achieved using a combination of 10 signals Conclusion: ABO blood type can be determined with greater than 97% accuracy using only 4 microliters of serum.

DESIGN
Sera from 220 healthy subjects was divided into a training set (n=60), and test set (n=40), and a validation set (n=120).  The training set was used to evaluate various methods for assigning blood type.  The best methods were then further evaluated and refined with the test set.  Finally, the best blood typing method was applied to the validation set to more extensively assess accuracy.
