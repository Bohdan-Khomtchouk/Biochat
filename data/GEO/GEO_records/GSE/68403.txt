TITLE
Development of a glycan microarray based method for ABO blood typing

ORGANISM
Quercus alba

SUMMARY
Purpose:  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to develop a novel method to assign ABO blood type.  The method will then be applied to samples from patients treated with PROSTVAC to determine if blood type correlates with survival Results:  Many blood group A and B antigens correlate with blood type.  Blood typing is best achieved using a combination of 10 signals Conclusion: ABO blood type can be determined with greater than 97% accuracy using only 4 microliters of serum.
