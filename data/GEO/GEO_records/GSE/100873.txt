TITLE
Mouse macropahge RNA-seq with or without virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of lncRNAs in viral infection and their relationship with the IFN-I system, we profiled lncRNA expression in wild type (WT) and IFN-I receptor deficient (Ifnar-/-) cells infected with or without vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

DESIGN
Examination of RNA transcriptome of mouse macrophage in VSV infection through high throughout sequencing.

PLATFORM
