TITLE
Genome-wide identification of CRISPR/Cas9 off-targets in human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By a robust unbiased ChIP-seq approach, we demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 had crRNA-specific off-target binding activities in human genome. However, most of those binding off-targets could not be efficiently cleaved both in vivo and in vitro which suggested the cleavage off-target activity of CRISPR/Cas9 in human genome is very limited. We provided a valuable tool to further investigate the molecular mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 and to optimize its in vivo targeting

DESIGN
sgRNA binding sites were identified with ChipSeq by using GFP antibody (there are 2 replicates for egfa-t1 sgRNA,emx1 sgRNA and control without sgRNA in Hek293T cells, one egfa-t1 sgRNA,emx1 sgRNA and control without sgRNA in HeLaS3 cells)
