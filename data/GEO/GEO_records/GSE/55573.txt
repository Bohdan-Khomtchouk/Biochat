TITLE
Using DNA microarray to screen intracellular signal pathways of hypoglycemic activity by electroacupuncture of Zusanli (ST36) acupoints in streptozotocin-induced rats with diabetes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to screen the possible effective intracellular signaling pathways of EA on bilateral Zusanli acupoint (ST36) by DNA microarray in rats with diabetes.  Streptozotocin (STZ) rats with diabetes were randomly assigned to the experimental (EA) group or the control (non-EA) group. The exploratory methods for analysis in this study were the following points: (i) detecting plasma glucose levels (ii) pathway analysis by DNA microarray in rats' gastrocnemius muscle. The pathway analysis of DNA microarray showed that the insulin signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway or Wnt signal pathway might be related to the hypoglycemic effect of STZ rats with diabetes induced by EA. Using DNA microarray would be helpful in screening the possible targets of signaling pathways. The hypoglycemic effect of EA was close relative to insulin and relative intracellular signal pathways. Further research will be required to determine the details of the intracellular signaling pathways of the hypoglycemic effect induced by EA.

DESIGN
STZ-induced diabetic rats were punctured at ST36 acupoint with 1.27 cm, 32 gauge acupuncture needles. After a 5-min needling period, EA was performed for 60 minutes at a frequency of 15 Hz with amplitude of 10 mA. Total RNA was then extracted from skeletal muscle for microarray analysis.
