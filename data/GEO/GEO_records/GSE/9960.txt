TITLE
Gene-expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in sepsis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify signature genes that help distinguish (1) sepsis from non-infectious causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, (2) between Gram-positive and Gram-negative sepsis. Keywords: Class prediction study

DESIGN
A total of 70 critically ill patients were enrolled in a single-centre observational study.  Gene-expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarray (U133plus2) with 54,675 transcript.  Data was divided into a training set (n=35) and a validation set (n=35).  A molecular signature was developed in the training set and was then validated in the validation set.
