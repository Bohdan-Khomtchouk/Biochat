TITLE
Microarray profiling of gene expression in ageing murine skeletal muscles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously documented a time-course of sarcopenia development in female C57Bl/6J mice, with significant loss of quadriceps muscle mass by 24 m that is more pronounced by 27-29 m. The present study used gastrocnemius muscles from female C57Bl/6J mice aged 3, 15, 24 and 29 months to investigate the expression of genes that coincide with, or potentially precede, muscle loss. The microarray analyses of ageing gastrocnemius muscle indicated that the Functional Theme Protein catabolism was first discernable in 15 and 24 age contrast and then again in the age contrast between 24 m and 29 m.  A common Functional Theme in all age contrasts from the microarray analysis was extracellular matrix suggesting continual remodeling of skeletal muscle during ageing. Metabolic traits, particularly those involving altered fatty acid and glucose metabolism were apparent in the contrast between 24 m and 29 m. This may reflect inefficiency of lipid metabolism with ageing caused by altered mitochondrial function, which has been implicated in ageing processes in other studies. There were no functional themes associated with oxidative stress, inflammation or immune cell infiltration in any age contrast, likely indicating that these factors are not primary drivers of sarcopenia. Ageing was also associated with increased global gene expression variance, consistent with generalised decreased control of gene regulation.

DESIGN
Microarray profiling was performed in gastrocnemius muscles from female C57Bl/6J mice aged 3, 15, 24 and 29 months.
