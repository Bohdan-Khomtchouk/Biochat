TITLE
Drug-tolerant cancer cell persisters survive lethal exposures by silencing transposable elements [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishing and maintaining phenotypic heterogeneity within cell and organismal populations is an evolutionarily conserved strategy that ensures survival of the population following stressful exposures. We previously identified a transient, reversible, drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulation that survives otherwise lethal drug exposures. Here we show that these drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) assume a highly heterochromatic state, which requires factors that modify or bind trimethylated H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3). The increased H3K9me3 in DTPs is largely restricted to evolutionarily young Long Interspersed Repeat elements (LINEs). This transcriptionally repressive state, which decreases the expression of these retrotransposable elements, is critical for DTP survival, and disruption of this heterochromatic state results in re-expression of LINE elements and ablation of this subpopulation. Together, these findings establish a role for epigenetic silencing of transposable elements as a population survival strategy to maintain genomic integrity in subpopulations of cancer cells during lethal drug exposures.

DESIGN
Investigation of 2 histone modifications by ChIPseq in 1 cell type in control or drug-treated samples (2 treatments).
