TITLE
Genome-Wide Landscapes of DNA Methylomes in Bovine Muscle Tissue

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification in mammals, have essential and important roles in muscle development. Here, using cattle as a model, we investigate the systematic association between DNA methylation and muscle development. We sample longissimus thoracis tissues from a famous elite native breed of Chinese Qinchuan cattle living within comparable environments under fetal and adult stages. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) , we generate and provide a genome-wide landscapes of DNA methylomes for muscle studies. The analysis shows global similarity and difference among fetal and adult stage and identifies the differentially methylated regions. The differentially methylated regions in promoters are highly associated with muscle development via expression repression of both known muscle-related genes and novel genes. This comprehensive map provides a solid basis for exploring epigenetic mechanisms of muscle growth and development.
