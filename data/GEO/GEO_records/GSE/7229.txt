TITLE
RML Prion and mock-infected murine neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix genechip profiling analsysis (MOE430A and MOE430B) of murine neuroblastoma cells infected with either RML prion strain or mock brain homogenate Keywords: Affymetrix gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Parental N2a cells were split into 6 aliquots, 3 of which were infected with RML prions and 3 of which were mock-infected with normal brain homogenate.  There are three biological replicates in total for each experimental group.
