TITLE
Steady-state in vitro transcriptomic profiling of P. falciparum from 10-20 HPI

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
This dataset pertains to a steady-state in vitro transcriptomic profiling of artemisinin-resistant (6A-R, 11C-R) and artemisinin-sensitive (6A, 11C) P. falciparum parasites from 10-20 HPI

DESIGN
Parasitized red blood cells (RBCs) from highly synchronized parasite lines (6A-R, 11C-R, 6A and 11C) were harvested at 2-hr intervals from 10 - 20 HPI (10 HPI, 12 HPI, 14 HPI, 16 HPI, 18 HPI and 20 HPI). Extraction of total RNA and amplification of total cDNA was carried out as  described in Bozdech, Z., S. Mok & A. P. Gupta, (2013) DNA microarray-based genome-wide analyses of Plasmodium parasites. Methods in molecular biology 923: 189-211.
