TITLE
Role of thioredoxin reductase in the Yap1p-dependent response to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yap1p transcription factor is required for the H2O2-dependent activation of many antioxidant genes including the TRX2 gene encoding thioredoxin 2. To identify factors that regulate Yap1p activity, we carried out a genetic screen for mutants that show elevated expression of a TRX2-HIS3 fusion in the absence of H2O2. Two independent mutants isolated in this screen carried mutations in the TRR1 gene encoding thioredoxin reductase. Northern blot and whole-genome expression analysis revealed that the basal expression of most Yap1p targets and many other H2O2-inducible genes is elevated in Deltatrr1 mutants in the absence of external stress. In Deltatrr1 mutants treated with H2O2, the Yap1p targets, as well as genes comprising a general environmental stress response and genes encoding protein-folding chaperones, are hyperinduced. However, despite the elevated expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, Deltatrr1 mutants are extremely sensitive to H2O2. The results suggest that cells lacking thioredoxin reductase have diminished capacity to detoxify oxidants and/or to repair oxidative stress-induced damage and that the thioredoxin system is involved in the redox regulation of Yap1p transcriptional activity.
