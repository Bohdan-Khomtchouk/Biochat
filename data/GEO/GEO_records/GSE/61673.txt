TITLE
Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Olig2, and Gli3 genomic binding regions in neural progenitors [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, and Olig2 are transcriptional repressors regulating somatic motor neuron and interneuron subtypes in neural progenitors. The purpose of this study was to identify their target genes and to elucidate their gene regulatory mechanisms, including their relationship to Sonic Hedgehog/Gli pathway.

DESIGN
Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Olig2, and Gli3 binding profiles were determined by ChIP-seq in neural progenitors derived in vitro from mouse embryonic stem cells
