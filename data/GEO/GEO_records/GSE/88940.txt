TITLE
Analysis of obesity-induced DNA methylation in visceral adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to use global gen expression to identify obesity-induced changes in gene expression profiles of lean and obese adolescent females. Visceral adipose tissue was extracted during abdominal surgeries on Lean and Obese adolescent females of african-americam, caucasian, and hispanic descent.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from visceral adipose tissue of lean and obese adolescent females. Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChips were utilized global methylation profiles in visceral adipose tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
