TITLE
The association between gene expression and whole genome histone H3K4 mono-, di, and trimethylation: ChIP-seq data

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These ChIP-seq data files are part of a study where a comparison was made between the change in transcription and H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation levels  in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome when plants are subjected to water deficit stress. Keywords: stress response, histone modification

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana DNA histone modifications were immonuprecipitated from control (watered) and treatment (water-deficit) samples for Illumina 1G Solexa sequencing.
