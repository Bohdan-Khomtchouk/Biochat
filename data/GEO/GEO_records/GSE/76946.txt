TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of sterile daf-2; mes-1 double vs. mes-1 single mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The germ lineage is considered to be immortal.  In the quest to extend lifespan, a possible strategy is to drive germline traits in somatic cells, to try to confer some of the germ lineage’s immortality on the somatic body.  Notably, a study in C. elegans suggested that expression of germline genes in the somatic cells of long-lived daf-2 mutants confers some of daf-2’s longevity.  Specifically, mRNAs encoding components of C. elegans germ granules (P granules) were up-regulated in daf-2 mutant worms, and knock-down of individual P-granule and other germline genes in daf-2 young adults modestly reduced their lifespan.  We investigated the contribution of a germline program to daf-2’s long lifespan, and also tested if other mutants known to express germline genes in their somatic cells are long-lived.  Our key findings are:  1) We could not detect P-granule proteins in the somatic cells of daf-2 mutants by immunostaining or by expression of a P-granule transgene.  2) Whole-genome transcript profiling of animals lacking a germline revealed that germline transcripts are not up-regulated in the soma of daf-2 worms compared to the soma of control worms.  3) Simultaneous removal of multiple P-granule proteins or the entire germline program from daf-2 worms did not reduce their lifespan.  4) Several mutants that robustly express a broad spectrum of germline genes in their somatic cells are not long-lived.  Taken together, our findings argue against the hypothesis that acquisition of a germ cell program in somatic cells increases lifespan and contributes to daf-2’s longevity.

DESIGN
