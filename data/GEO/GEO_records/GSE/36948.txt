TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of transcription factor FoxO1-responsive gene expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression regulated by FoxO1 in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of wildtype and knockout mice. Results provide important information of gene expression in the VMH. The transcription factor FoxO1 contributes to leptin and insulin action, including cells in the brain. However, the neurons mediating these effects and the identity of the molecular targets through which FoxO1 exerts metabolic actions remains to be defined.

DESIGN
For the gene expression profiling, total RNA was obtained from the VMH of WT and VMH-specific FoxO1 KO mice using Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Maryland) and Phase Lock Gel (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To make sure reproducibility and biological significance, triple hybridizations were performed for each genotype with the RNA from three independent VMH samples, each sample contains RNA from three animals (biological replicates). Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at UT-Southwestern ( http://microarray.swmed.edu/ ) checked RNA quality with Bioanalyzer Chip and processed the samples for hybridization with Illumina Mouse-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).  We used Partek Genomics Suite 6.5  (Partek Inc., St Louis, MO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA) for data analysis.
