Gene expression profiles of various tissues under different physiological conditions

Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice is one of important crop and, the genome has been already completely sequenced. Moreover we collected more than 30K rice FL-cDNA clones as transcriptome resources. However, the cDNA collection did not reveal the transcription activity and specificity of expression. So, we designed 60-mer oligo array based on the array system of Agilent Technologies (GPL477) as custom array. For validation of the array, we tested the reproducibility of labeling and hybridization. After this validation, 22K rice oligo array was supplied from Agilent Technologies (GPL892). 1: reproducibility of labeling: mRNA of shoot sample was amplified and labeled more than 10 times with Cy3 and Cy5, and both Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNA was hybridized on a slide (self-hybridization), and validate the reproducibility of labeling. In addition, we also amplified and labeled mRNA of other samples with Cy3 and Cy5, and made a self-hybridization. The intensity data of these array was also indicated transcription activity of genes in these samples. Keywords: variety among tissues
