TITLE
Klf4 cooperates with Oct3/4 and Sox2 to activate the Lefty1 core promoter in embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize Klf4 downstream genes, we performed microarray analyses of the ES cells knocked down by siRNA of Klf4 gene. Keywords: individual genetic characteristic design
