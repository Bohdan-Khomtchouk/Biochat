TITLE
Klf4 cooperates with Oct3/4 and Sox2 to activate the Lefty1 core promoter in embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize Klf4 downstream genes, we performed microarray analyses of the ES cells knocked down by siRNA of Klf4 gene. Keywords: individual genetic characteristic design

DESIGN
ES cells grow without feeders on gelatin coated in complete ES medium. Cells were incubated at 37 0C; 5% CO2. ES cells were transfected with siRNA and pCAGEGFP-IP plasmid. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 hours, following to drag selection for more 24 hours in the presence of puromycin to ensure concentration of transfectants. Total RNA were extracted with Trizol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
