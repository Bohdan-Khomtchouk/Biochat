TITLE
camv treatment-Gene profiling durinig CaMV infection.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06-mirna_camv_treatment - camv treatment - Which genes (including miRNA genes) are differentially regulated by CaMV? Requirement of 21nt, 22nt, 24nt virus-derived siRNAs in this differential gene regulation?  - 4/5 weeks old seedlings (Col-0, dcl2/dcl3, dcl2/dcl4, dcl3/dcl4, dcl2/dcl3/dcl4) infected with CaMV and harvested 21 days post infection.

DESIGN
7 dye-swap - gene knock out,normal vs disease comparison

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
