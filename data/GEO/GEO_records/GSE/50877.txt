TITLE
Functional dissection of Bmi1 independence of MN1 leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MN1 leukemia is a poor prognosis leukemia occuring as MN1 overexpression or fusion with TEL (MN1-TEL), MN1 and MN1-TEL show different biology in terms of dependence of known self-renewal associated genes in leukemia, c-kit positive murine primary bone marrow cells were retrovirally transduced with MN1, MN1-TEL or MN1-TEL mutant MN1-TELdelDBD showing biological similarity with MN1, after retroviral transformation of cells and 10 d culture RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was assessed

DESIGN
3 samples with 3 replicates each sample: gene expression array comparing expression profiles of MN1, MN1-TEL and MN1-TEL del DBD trasformed murine c-kit+ bone marrow cells

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
