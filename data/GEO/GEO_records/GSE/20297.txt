TITLE
The effects of terbutaline or GW9508 on TNF-alpha and IFN gamma (TNF-alpha + IFN gamma) stimulation by HaCaT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have diverse roles in physiological processes, including immunity. Gs-coupled GPCRs increase  while Gi-coupled ones decrease intracellular cAMP. Previous studies suggest that, in epithelial cells, Gs-coupled GPCRs enhance whereas Gi-coupled GPCRs suppress pro-inflammatory immune responses. In order to examine the issue, we chose beta2 adrenergic receptor and GPR40 as representatives of Gs- and Gi- coupled GPCRs, respectively, and examined their effects on TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma-(TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma) induced gene expression by HaCaT. We used microarrays to detail the global changes of gene expression induced by a beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline or GPR40 agonist GW9508 pre-treatment in TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma - stimulated HaCaT cells.

DESIGN
HaCaT cells were pre-treated with terbutaline or GW9508, TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma were then added, and cultured for another 24 h. Cells were then used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to clarify changes in gene expression after 1) TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma, 2) TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma + terbutaline, and 3) TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma + GW9508 treatment. To this end, we set 4 groups of samples; 1) unstimulated group, 2)  TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma-stimulated group, 3) TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma + terbutaline-stimulated group, and 4) TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma + GW9508-stimulated group. In each group, HaCaT cells were stimulated in triplicate wells (n=3).
