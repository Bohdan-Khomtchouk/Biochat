TITLE
Expression profile of plasma microRNAs in esophageal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to detect the expression profile of plasma microRNAs, we have employed microRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs with the potential to distinguish the different microRNA profiles from ESCC patients and healthy controls. Three pairs of plasma samples from ESCC patients and healthy controls without any digestive tract disease history were collected for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Six samples in total, including plasma from three ESCC patients and three healthy controls
