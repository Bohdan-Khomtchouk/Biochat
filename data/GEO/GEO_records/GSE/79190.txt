TITLE
The transcriptional profile analysis of mice peritoneal cavity B1a cells from p40-/-CD25-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have found many differences between B1a cells from p40-/-CD25-/- mice and control mice. To better understand the whole change of transcriptions profile between B1a cells in PC of  p40-/-CD25-/- mice and control mice. By using flow cytometry and high-resolution microarrays, we have studied qualitative and quantitative characteristics of B1a cells of p40-/-CD25-/- mice and control mice.

DESIGN
There are 2 group of cells, each group have triplicate samples. At least 6 independent experiments were performed for all sample, and each sample with a minimum of 3 mice.
