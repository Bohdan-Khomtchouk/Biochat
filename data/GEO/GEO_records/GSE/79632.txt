TITLE
Transcriptome of Zfp36l1-deficient MZ B cells, WT MZ B cells and WT FO B cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to identify the effects on the transcriptome of deleting ZFP36L1 in MZ B cells

DESIGN
Method (MZ B cells): RNAseq libraries were prepared from 5ng RNA isolated from sorted ex-vivo MZ B cells. Total RNA samples were sent to Aros Applied Biotechnology A/S and were prepared using the Clontech SMARTer kit. Libraries were sequenced (100bp paired end) on the Illumina Hiseq. Method (FO B cells): RNAseq libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from sorted ex-vivo FO B cells. Total RNA samples were sent to Aros Applied Biotechnology A/S and were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced (100bp single end) on the Illumina Hiseq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
