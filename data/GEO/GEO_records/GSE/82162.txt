TITLE
Transfer RNA (tRNA) processing profiles of mouse embryonic frontal lobes at E13.5/E18.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: High-throughput RNA sequencing has accelerated discovery of the complex regulatory roles of small RNAs, such those derived from tRNAs. Also recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed the complex RNA modification landscape and the complex role these nucleosides modifactions have in cell signalling, stem cell biology and development. The goal of this study is to establish how tRNA-derived small RNAs can affect stem cell function. Methods: four replicates of tRNAs sequencing of wild-type (WT) and NSun2 -/- mouse embryonic frontal lobes at E18.5 were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq platform. Results: Our analyses reveal that deletion of the cytosine-5 tRNA methylase NSUN2 increases tRNA cleaveage of NSUN2 tRNA substrates.
