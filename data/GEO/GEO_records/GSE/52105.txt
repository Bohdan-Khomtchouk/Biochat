Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU02/2009(H1N1) is a strain of the swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus isolated during the human swine flu outbreak of 2009. To analyze the miRNA expression profiles of A549 cells infected with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU02/2009(H1N1) at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (hpi) and investigate the relation between the miRNA expression profile and its pathogenesis, Human MicroRNA Array v2.0 was applied. At 24 hpi, 174 miRNAs were detected to change their expression compared with 0 hpi, 28 of them increased and 146 decreased. At 48 hpi, 214 changed miRNAs were detected, 21 of them increased and 193 decreased. At 72 hpi, 282 changed miRNAs were detected, 19 of them increased and 263 decreased. Targets of the 21 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics technology. The function categories of the predicted targets were analyzed by GO(Gene ontology) annotation. The signaling pathways involving the changed miRNAs were analyzed by KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO annotation. Four key signaling pathways were identified, namely, the MAPK, apoptosis, JAK_STAT, and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. The apoptosis and MAPK signaling pathways were activated by all miRNAs, whereas the JAK_STAT and toll-like receptor signaling pathways were activated by some miRNAs but inhibited by the others, suggesting balance in the hostâ€“virus interaction. We also constructed and analyzed the protein-protein interaction network of all the predicted targets and found some key nodes. This finding provides a picture of miRNA expression in A549 cells infected with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU02/2009(H1N1) as complete as possible, which may provide important information for investigation of H1N1 pathogenesis and therapeutic method.
