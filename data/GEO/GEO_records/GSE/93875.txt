TITLE
An integrative analysis of different histone acetylation in ethylene response in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We reported that ethylene specifically elevated acetylation of histone H3 at K14 and the non-canonical acetylation of histone H3 at K23,but not H3K9ac.Thus, we further performed Chip-sequencing of H3K9Ac, using chromatins isolated from 3-day old etiolated ein2-5 seedlings treated with ethylene or air gas.

DESIGN
Examination of 1 histone modification (H3K9Ac) in 1 Arabidopsis line which under 2 different treatment.

PLATFORM
