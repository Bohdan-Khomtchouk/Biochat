TITLE
Global transcriptional changes during S. mutans biofilm dispersal

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
We used whole-genome microarrays to identify the global transcriptional changes during biofilm dispersal and also to investigate the molecular mechanism that regulating biofilm dispersal.

DESIGN
S. mutans biofilms at different dispersal stages were collected for microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL23120 Agilent-033229 Streptococcus mutans whole-genome 15k array (Probe name version)
