TITLE
Comparative FAIRE-seq analysis reveals distinguishing features of the chromatin structure of ground state- and primed pluripotent cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We utilized FAIRE-seq to identify accesible chromatin in mouse embryonic-, epiblast-, and neural- stem cells in addition to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of these data sets reveal cell type specific chromatin signatures that differentiate na√Øve and primed pluripotency. Functional analysis of type-specific peaks revealed cell-type specific enhancers.

DESIGN
FAIRE-seq of mESC, EpiSC, NSC and MEF

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
