TITLE
Infection of Macaques with SIVmac251 in vivo

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Viral infection results in an overall downregulation of gene expression that is greatest by the viral set point. Of the 3647 genes downregulated at the viral set point, 1033 are upregulated as the result of successful ARV treatment Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Affymetrix Rhesus Genome array were used to assay gene expression profiles at baseline, and 2-, 20- and 26- weeks after infection. Drug therapy started at week24

PLATFORM
GPL3535 [Rhesus] Affymetrix Rhesus Macaque Genome Array
