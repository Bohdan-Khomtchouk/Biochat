TITLE
Functional characterization of Arabidopsis WRKY15 overexpressor plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Col4WT and WRKY15 overexpressor (WRKY15OE) plants, grown under controlled and mild salt stress conditions in order to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the increased salt stress sensitivity of WRKY15OE plants.

DESIGN
Two genotypes x two conditions experiment, including Arabidopsis Col4WT and WRKY15OE plants grown on half-strength MS plant medium supplemented with 0 or 50 mM NaCl. Three biological replicates. Each sample was hybridized to one GenechipÂ® Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R array.
