TITLE
Comparison of genetic differences between Streptomyces scabies and turgidiscabies strains

ORGANISM
Streptomyces scabiei ; Streptomyces turgidiscabies ; Streptomyces reticuliscabiei

SUMMARY
Bacteria isolated from potato scab lesions in Finland or northern Sweden were analyzed using microarrays, PCR, and sequencing. Data indicate wide genetic variability in pathogenicity islands among S.turgidiscabies and S.scabies strains.

DESIGN
Thirteen Streptomyces scabies and turgidiscabies strains from two different growings, Streptomyces reticulisabiei reference strain DSM41804 and Streptomyces scabies reference strain ATCC49173 were hybridized. Data were analyzed in single channel mode.
