TITLE
Comparison of genetic differences between Streptomyces scabies and turgidiscabies strains

ORGANISM
Streptomyces scabiei

SUMMARY
Bacteria isolated from potato scab lesions in Finland or northern Sweden were analyzed using microarrays, PCR, and sequencing. Data indicate wide genetic variability in pathogenicity islands among S.turgidiscabies and S.scabies strains.
