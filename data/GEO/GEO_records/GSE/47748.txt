SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina short RNA sequencing for characterization and discovery of miRNAs and moRNAs in two Italian Large White pig backfat tissue.

DESIGN
Short RNAs sequencing for miRNA quantification, discovery and characterisation. Sequenced reads from the two samples were pooled together for the bioinformatic analysis.
