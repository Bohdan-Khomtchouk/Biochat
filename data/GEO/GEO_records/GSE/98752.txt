TITLE
A Complex Association between DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Human Placenta at First and Third Trimesters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed DNA methylome analysis by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq for both first and third trimester human placenta tissues.The correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression was non-linear and complex, depending on the genomic context (promoter or gene body) and gene expression levels. A wide range of DNA methylation and gene expression changes were observed at different gestational ages. The non-linear association between DNA methylation and gene expression indicates that epigenetic regulation of placenta development is more complex than previously envisioned.
