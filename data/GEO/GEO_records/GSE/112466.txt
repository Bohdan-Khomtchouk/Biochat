TITLE
Tumor-independent host gene expression changes induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was used to identify tumor-independent changes after treatment with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

DESIGN
8 week old Balb/c mice were treated for 7 days with sunitinib (60 or 120 mg/kg/day), crizotinib (50mg/kg/day), axitinib (100mg/kg/day), or combination of sunitinib (60mg/kg/day) and crizotinib. Lung tissue was collected and total RNA was isolated for whole genome expression analysis.
