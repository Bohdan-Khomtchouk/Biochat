TITLE
Transcript Analysis of E. coli ATCC 35218 suggest a Role of cranberry Juice in Inhibiting the growth of E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Several different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the possible role of cranberries, cranberry juice, and cranberry extracts in inhibiting bacterial growth.  In this report, we showed that Escherichia coli showed slower growth rate in response to the presence of cranberry juice in the growth media. By compareing the global transcript profiles, significant modulation of several genes of E. coli grown in LB broth with 10% cranberry juice were identified and provided identification of the potential mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effects of cranberry juice.  The results presented clearly demonstrate that the inhibitory effect on bacterial growth observed in the presence of cranberry juice/extracts is primarily a result of the iron chelation capacity of PACs and direct disruption of metabolic enzymes.  The results are discussed with a focus on the genes associated with iron chelation capability. Keywords: growth inhibition of cranberry juice

DESIGN
For transcriptome profiling, there were 15 Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® E. coli genome 2.0 arrays total.  There were five conditions:  E. coli grown in LB broth, E. coli grown in LB broth with 10% cranberry juice to generation 50, 160, 210, and 230.  Each condition was done in triplicate.  Five conditions done in triplicates resulted in 15 samples that went onto 15 microarrays.
