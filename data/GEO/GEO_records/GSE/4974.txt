TITLE
thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocyte differentiation with and without nicotinamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Culture of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the presence of thrombopoietin induces megakaryocytic differentiation.  Addition of nicotinamide to thrombopoietin-stimulated cultures results in significant increases in megkaryocytic differentiation including greater polyploidization and enhanced proplatelet formation.  This study focuses on understanding the differences in the temporal gene expression pattern during differentiation with and without nicotinamide.  Nicotinamide was added on day 5. Keywords: treatment response
