TITLE
FOXO regulates RNA interference in Drosophila and protects from RNA virus infection

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Determination of dFOXO binding sites genomewide identified RNAi  genes as direct targets

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of DNA precipitated with antibodies to Drosophila FOXO were compared to 3 replicates of input DNA for enrichment.
