TITLE
Monitoring of functional gene responses to biostimulation from a TCE-contaminated site

ORGANISM
Shewanella

SUMMARY
A functional microarray targeting 24 genes involved in chlorinated solvent biodegradation pathways has been developed and used to monitor the gene expression in a contaminated site (site B) under ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) treatment. The microarray format provided by NimbleGen and used in this study is 12x135K. 4 Âµg of labelled antisense mRNA from 3 groundwater samples were hybridized on the microarray.
