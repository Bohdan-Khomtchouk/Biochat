TITLE
Monitoring of functional gene responses to biostimulation from a TCE-contaminated site

ORGANISM
groundwater metagenome

SUMMARY
A functional microarray targeting 24 genes involved in chlorinated solvent biodegradation pathways has been developed and used to monitor the gene expression in a contaminated site (site B) under ERD (enhanced reductive dechlorination) treatment. The microarray format provided by NimbleGen and used in this study is 12x135K. 4 µg of labelled antisense mRNA from 3 groundwater samples were hybridized on the microarray.

DESIGN
A 3-chip study was performed, each corresponding to hybridization with 4 µg of labelled antisense mRNA retrieved from a monitoring well of a contaminated site (site B). Each probe (760nt) on the microarray was synthesized in eight replicates, and a total of 5,707 random probes was used to determine the background noise. Groundwater samples were collected from a contaminated site (site B) from three monitoring wells (P1, P2 and P3). P1: well located upstream to the contamination source. P2: well in the contamination source. P3 : well located downstream to the contamination source.
