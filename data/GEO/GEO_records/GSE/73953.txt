TITLE
Microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from IgA nephropathy patients, membranous nephropathy patients and healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To search for new markers of active lesions that might help better understand the molecular basis of MN and IgAN and aid in their diagnosis, DNA microarray analysis was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

DESIGN
1-color microarray experiments were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 IgAN patients, 8 membranous nephropathy patients and pooled healthy subjects.
