TITLE
Comparative genomics of Staphylococcus aureus and the application of a “pan-genome” for assigning RNA-Seq transcript reads from divergent strains and in vivo human nasal samples

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
in vitro comparison between two MRSA grown in rich (BHI) and poor media (SNM), compared with the nasal metatranscriptome reads of S. aureus.

DESIGN
Global expression profile of two MRSA strains of S.aureus harvested in two different growth phases and compared with a metatranscriptome nose sample of a S. aureus carrier.
