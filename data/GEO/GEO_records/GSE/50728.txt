TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus var. carlsbergensis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces pastorianus

SUMMARY
During fermentation Saccharomyces yeast produces various aroma-active metabolites determining the different characteristics of aroma and taste in fermented beverages. Amino acid utilization by yeast during brewerÂ´s wort fermentation is seen as linked to flavour profile. To better understand the relationship between the biosynthesis of aroma relevant metabolites and the importance of amino acids, DNA microarrays were performed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S81 and Saccharomyces pastorianus var. carlsbergensis strain S23, respectively. Thereby, changes in transcription of genes were measured, which are associated with amino acid assimilation and its derived aroma-active compounds during fermentation.
