TITLE
Gene expression profling of human breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts treated with paclitaxol or doxorubicin at therapeutically relevant doses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic chemotherapy inflicts cytotoxic injuries on breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. We profiled the transcriptomes of human breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts before and after clinically relevant cytotoxic stimuli induced by chemotheraputic agents.

DESIGN
Breast cancer associated fibroblasts (BCAFs) were isolated from the tumor specimen by mechanical dissociation and differential centrifugation. The cells at early passages were treated with paclitaxol or doxorubicin at clinically revealent concentration. Total RNA was extracted from the cells at different time points post-treatment for gene expression profiling.
