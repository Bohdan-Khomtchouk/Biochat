Global expression profiles in one hour biopsy of human kidney transplantation from donors after cardiac death

SUMMARY
Because of world-wide shortage of renal grafts, kidney transplantation (KTx) from donors after cardiac death (DCD) is an alternative way to KTx from brain-dead donors. Although the prognosis of DCD KTx is gradually improving, the graft often undergoes delayed graft function (DGF) rendering the control of DGF essential for post-KTx patient care. To know the etiology of the DGF, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling using renal biopsy samples performed at 1 hour after KTx from DCD and compared the data with those of KTx from living donors (LD). A total of 526 genes were differentially expressed between them. Genes involved in acute inflammation were activated, while metabolic pathways were consistently down-regulated in DCD. All of these findings imply inferior performance of the DCD grafts relative to LD grafts. We identified several genes of which expression levels were correlated well with parameters indicating short- and long-term prognosis of the DCD patients. In addition, we identified several genes encoding secretory proteins that might reflect the performance of the graft and be potent non-invasive biomarkers. Our data provide good source for candidates of biomarker that are potentially useful for control of DGF. Keywords: disease state analysis
