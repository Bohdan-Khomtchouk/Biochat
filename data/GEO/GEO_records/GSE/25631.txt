TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of microRNA expression in surgical specimens of primary glioblastoma multiform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA has a great potential in predicting survival of cancer patient. We used a genome-wide microRNA expression profiling to identify a miRNA signature for the prediction of clinical outcome of primary GBM patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 82 surgical specimens of primary glioblastoma multiform and 5 normal brain tissues from areas surrounding arteriovenous malformations (AVM) as control.

PLATFORM
