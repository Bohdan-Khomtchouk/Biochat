TITLE
functional characterization of vvmyb82-Functional characterization of the transcription factor VvMYB82

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra07-05_myb82 - functional characterization of vvmyb82 - Functional characterization of the transcription factor VvMYB82 which is a regulator of the different phenolic compound biosynthesis.  - To compare wt with a surexpressor of VvMYB82 (Line A311 = 35s::VvMYB) and wt with a loss of function mutant AtMYB82

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - wt vs mutant comparison

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
