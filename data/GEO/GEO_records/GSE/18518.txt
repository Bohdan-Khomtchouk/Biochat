SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in soybean under aluminum stress: mechanisms of magnesium amelioration of aluminum toxicity at gene expression level. Micro-molar concentrations of magnesium in culture solution has been shown to ameliorate Al toxicity in soybean and other leguminous species. Different theories have been proposed to explain the chemical mechanisms of how the two ions interact to neutralize the toxic effect of aluminum in the plant root system. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the phenomenon at the gene expression level in soybean, we undertook a comparative transcriptome analysis in Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive genotypes treated with aluminum alone or aluminum plus magnesium using DNA microarrays. The results revealed magnesium enhances Al-tolerance level in the Al-tolerant genotype by down-regulating genes commonly induced in response to Al toxicity. We hypothesized that the magnesium-mediated alleviation of Al toxicity in the Al-tolerant genotype emanates from reduction in energy expenditure of gene expression induced in response to Al stress. Conversely, magnesium appears to ameliorate Al toxicity in the sensitive genotype by dual mechanisms of increasing the expression level of several genes involved in Al-tolerance and decreasing the expression level of most genes.
