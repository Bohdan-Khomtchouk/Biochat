TITLE
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. delta-rocG delta-gudB

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of the rocG gudB double null mutant during log growth phase in LB medium.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. delta-rocG delta-gudB. The experiment was conducted two times using three independent total RNA preparations (biological triplicates). For each paried comparison, WT was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and the rocG gudB double mutant was with Alexa Fluor 647.
