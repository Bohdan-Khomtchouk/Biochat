TITLE
Transcriptional targets of p16INK4A in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of 17 melanoma cell lines were analysed to identify genes differentially expressed between cell lines harbouring wild-type or mutant p16INK4A. Relevant paper: Pavey et al. (2007). Note: all of these cell lines contained wild-type p14ARF, so that the transcriptional effects of p16INk4A could be determined without interference from p14ARF. Keywords: Affymetrix Hu133_Plus microarrays

DESIGN
The aim of this study was to identify genes which are transcriptional targets of p16INK4A in melanoma.
