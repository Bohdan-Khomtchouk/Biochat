TITLE
Expression data on Treg cells isolated from wildtype mice and miR-125a deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found miR-125a was a key regulator that stabilizes the commitment and immunoregulatory capacity of Treg cells.To gain insights into the general functional features of miR-125a-deficient Treg cells, we performed a genome-wide gene array analysis on Treg population isolated from the spleens of 6 to 8-week-old miR-125a-deficient and WT mice

DESIGN
We sorted CD4+CD25hi Treg population from the spleens of 6 to 8-week-old miR-125a-deficient and their littermate WT mice. Cells were collected and total RNA was extracted for Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
