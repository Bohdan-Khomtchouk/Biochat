TITLE
Molecular markers of breast cancer progression in a MMTV-PyMT hyperplasia transplant mouse model of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary cause of mortality in breast cancer is metastasis, a process which is still poorly understood.  To study the process of breast cancer metastasis, we isolated focal hyperplasias from the MMTV-PyMT transgenic breast cancer model and transplanted to syngeneic hosts.  The transplants underwent stereotyped progression to adenoma, early carcinoma, and late carcinoma at 5, 8 and 18 weeks post-transplant, respectively.   We compared the gene expression profiles of adenomas and late carcinomas by microarray.  Analysis of the data revealed that the most differentially expressed gene family between adenomas and late carcinomas were luminal differentiation genes, among them GATA-3.  In this report, we characterized the role of GATA-3 in breast cancer. Keywords: spotted oligonucleotide
