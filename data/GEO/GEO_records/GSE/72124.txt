TITLE
Dissection of the F. graminearum transcriptome in response to an active or passive host identifies new pathogen-specific genes.

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum PH-1

SUMMARY
Comparing RNA Seq- Data of all three sample types- pathogenic growth, saprophytic growth on same plant substrate, axenic growth under starvation after consumption of the mycotoxin inducing nitrogen source L-ornithine- allows to distinguish between genes whose transcription is affected by nutrient starvation or plant matrix effects from those that respond to defense mechanisms deriving from the active, living plant and thus may allow new insights into pathogenicity of the fungus.

DESIGN
Three different growth conditions with two to three replicates
