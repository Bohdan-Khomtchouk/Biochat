TITLE
Gene expression study in CLL of B-cell receptor triggering (mRNA Study)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The B-cell receptor (BCR) plays an important role in pathogenesis and progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We investigated the BCR triggering-dependent mRNA modulation by stimulating CLL cells with immobilized anti-IgM. miRome of immobilized anti-IgM stimulated CLL cells (n=16) identified a substantial upregulation of miR-132 in both unmutated (UM) and mutated (M) IGHV subgroups. A parallel gene expression profile and an in-silico analysis to identify miR-132 target genesÂ¸ allowed us to focus on SIRT1, that encodes for a histone deacetylase targeting several proteins including TP53. We defined a reduction of SIRT1 protein levels upon immobilized anti-IgM stimulation (P=0.001), and a concomitant increase in TP53 acetylation (P=0.0072). The TP53 target gene CDKN1A was consistently up-regulated in immobilized anti-IgM stimulated CLL cells. Of note, the miR-132 constitutive expression levels in CLL cases (n=134) were of similar magnitude of those obtained in in vitro immobilized anti-IgM stimulated CLL cells.  Additionally, high miR-132 expression levels retained a favorable prognostic impact in M (P=0.005), but not in UM CLL patients (P=0.968). The described miR-132/SIRT1/TP53 axis, sequentially characterized by BCR triggering, miR-132 up-regulation, SIRT1 down-regulation and TP53 acetylation, should be considered in the light of emerging drugs targeting the BCR pathway in CLL.

DESIGN
