TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of CDCP1, KDM3B, and SDC1 knockdown in human marrow stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate functions of CDCP1, KDM3B and SDC1 molecules in HS5 human marrow stromal cells, global gene expression profiles were obtained and analyzed after knocking down the gene transcripts by using siRNA technology.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles were obtained from HS5 marrow stromal cells after knocking  down mRNA of CDCP1, KDM3B or SDC1 by using siRNA technology.
