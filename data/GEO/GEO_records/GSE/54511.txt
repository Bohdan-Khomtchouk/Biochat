TITLE
Different molecular pathways along with pathogenesis of three subtypes of Leiomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm of smooth muscle and is an aggressive soft tissue tumor, have complex genetic abnormalities and could be defined as three molecular subtypes. Since that the molecular heterogeneity of LMS, the pathogenesis analysis per subtype will be highly necessary and helpful to understand the etiology of this more common sarcoma.

DESIGN
Within this study, we collected four Myometrium, three Leiomyoma, three LMS cell lines and 99 LMSs (GSE45510), performed the system-wide gene expression profiling by 3'end RNA Sequencing, and found that there are significant different molecular pathways along the pathogenesis for those three molecular subtypes.
