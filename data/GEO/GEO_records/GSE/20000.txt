TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in staged Drosophila embryos and cell lines.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-seq data generated on Solexa Genome Analyzer for several Transcription Factors and Chromatin associated Proteins. This dataset is called February_1st_datafreeze and is part of the regular datafreezes we produce for the modENCODE project. Keywords: Epigenetics For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each experiment, at least 2 replicates of ChIP have been performed (except Caudal in Adult Female and E4-8h) and compared to an Input sample(s). The factors analyzed in this freeze are: CTCF in S2 cells, Caudal in embryos 0-4h, embryos 4-8h, L3 larvae and Adult Female,  EcR in White Pre-Pupae (10 to 11 hours and 30 to 33 hours) and HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC4a and HDAC11 in Embryos 0-12h. ChIP samples have been sequenced on the Solexa Genome Analyser  (36 bp reads) following the standard Illumina protocol.
