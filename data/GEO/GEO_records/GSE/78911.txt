TITLE
Long non-coding RNA in liver of HCC mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt/b-catening dependent HCC mouse models was used to assess T-UCR profiles in mice HCC downstream of Wnt/b-catening pathway.

DESIGN
APC fl/fl (n=3) mice developed Wnt/b-catenin dependent HCC and were compared to APC +/+ (n=3) control mice (no tumour). Sample tables include normalized data for both mRNA and lncRNA probes.
