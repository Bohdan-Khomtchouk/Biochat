SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). The ChIP-Seq method was used to assay chromatin fragments bound by specific or general transcription factors as described below. DNA isolated by ChIP-Seq was size-selected (~225 bp) and sequenced. Short reads of 25-36 bp were mapped to the human reference genome, and enriched regions of high read density relative to a total input chromatin control reads were identified. The sequence reads with quality scores (fastq files) and alignment coordinates (BAM files) from these experiments are available for download.
