TITLE
Murine Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, PPE Model: Transcriptional Profiling of Sham vs. AAA at Day 7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of infrarenal aortic tissue from Male 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice after AAA-induction with porcine pancreatic elastase, compared with sham-operated mice. Includes samples obtained 7 days after aneurysm induction. Goal was to examine gene expression in developing AAA in this model, and compare with miRNA profiling performed using the same tissue.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, one infrarenal aorta per array. Sham vs. PPE at Day 7 post-operatively. Total 10 arrays: 5 sham D7, 5 PPE D7.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
