TITLE
Comparison of transcripts from the anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, and liver of glycogen synthase WT, GSL30 or KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior tibialis removed from 3-month old muscle glycogen synthase WT or knockout mouse. RNA was extracted using GibcoBRL TRIzol Reagent and a Quiagen RNeasy kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 5ug of total RNA. GSM40057-GSM40063 AND GSM40956. Liver removed from 3-month old muscle glycogen synthase WT or knockout mouse. RNA was extracted using GibcoBRL TRIzol Reagent and a Quiagen RNeasy kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 10ug of total RNA. GSM40064-GSM40071. Medial gastrocnemius removed from 3-month old muscle glycogen synthase WT or knockout mouse. RNA was extracted using GibcoBRL TRIzol Reagent and a Quiagen RNeasy kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 5ug of total RNA. GSM40072-GSM40079. Medial gastrocnemius removed from 8-month old muscle glycogen synthase WT or overexpressing mouse. RNA was extracted using GibcoBRL TRIzol Reagent and a Quiagen RNeasy kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 5ug of total RNA.  GSM40080-GSM40089 Keywords: other
