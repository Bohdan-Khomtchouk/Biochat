TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of human whole-blood samples during acute dengue disease and early convalescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dengue patient whole blood samples were analyzed during onset of disease, at defervescence and at early convalescence. Availability of samples at very early time points of disease allows to study the onset of the innate immune response. The main objective of the study is to understand early events during acute dengue disease, and how these events can eventually lead to the obsereved pathology including vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia and lyphocytopenia.

DESIGN
Patients with suspected dengue disease gave a blood sample within 72h after onset of fever (DK1). The sample was used to confirm dengue infection by RT-PCR and RNA was stored for microarray. The patients returned for a second sample between 4 and 7 days after onset of fever (DK2) and 15-25 days after onset of fever (DK3). These longitdinal samples were all analyzed by microarray for inter-sample comparison and accross sample comparison. In total eleven patients were analyzed at the three time points indicated.
