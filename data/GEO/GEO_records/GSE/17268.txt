TITLE
Polidocanol injury wildtype versus Myd88 KO trachea

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nf-kB activity is associated with the key pathological features of chronic respiratory diseases including epithelial remodelling, excess mucous production, and submucosal gland hyperplasia.  However, the role of Nf-kB activity in airway epithelial differentiation remains controversial.  In the present study we demonstrate that Nf-kB adaptor protein Myd88 deficiency promotes increased airway submucosal gland abundance and abnormal epithelial differentiation in proximal adult airways.  Abnormal airway differentiation was not developmentally determined, became exacerbated following acute lung injury, and did not involve altered epithelial proliferation or apoptosis.  Instead, we demonstrate that tracheal Myd88 deficiency promotes upregulation of a unique gene expression profile that includes activation of alternate, Myd88-independent Nf-kB signalling.  Finally, we show that these effects are not intrinsically maintained in vitro using an air-liquid interface epithelial culture.  This finding indicates that Myd88 deficiency promotes adult airway remodelling by regulating non-epithelial, non-cell autonomous Nf-kB activity.
