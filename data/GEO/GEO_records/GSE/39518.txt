TITLE
array-CGH on single blastomeres from day-4 human preimplantation fresh and frozen embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In total, 240 single blastomeres from nine top-quality day-4 embryos frozen at day 3 of development and four fresh top-quality day-4 embryos that had one-cell biopsy on day 3 for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) were collected. Blastomeres' DNA was amplified using SurePlex DNA Amplification System (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK) . Array-CGH was carried out using 24Sure Cytochip microarrays following the standard protocol (BlueGnome, www.cytochip.com).

DESIGN
BAC array-CGH on single blastomeres amplified by SurePlex amplification Kit.
