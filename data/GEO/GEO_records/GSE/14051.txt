TITLE
Expression signatures and cytogenetic aberrations in HPV16 E6, E7 and E6/E7-positive immortalized human epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genetic/cytogenetic alterations and differentially expressed cellular genes in HPV16 E6, E7 and E6/E7 positive human foreskin keratinocytes Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) transfected with retroviral vectors harboring the human papillomavirus type 16 oncogenes E6, E7, or E6/E7 in comparison to HFK containing the empty vector control pLXSN.
