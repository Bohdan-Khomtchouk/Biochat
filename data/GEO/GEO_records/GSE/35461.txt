TITLE
Expression profile of human ESC, ESC-drived definitive endoderm and endodermal progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endodermal progenitor cells (EP cells) are derived from human embryonic stem cell(ESC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE) cells. EP cells are cultured in high BMP media and DE cells are in high Activin media. Both cells can be further differentiated to liver, pancreas, etc. We used microarray to detail the global gene expression profile of DE cells and EP cells to delineate the difference of DE cells and EP cells.

DESIGN
ESCs were sorted by SSEA3 and SSEA4. DE cells and EP cells were sorted by CXCR4 and CD117. Sorted cells were lysed in RLT buffer. RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affimetrix microarrays. Each group had 3 biological replicates.
