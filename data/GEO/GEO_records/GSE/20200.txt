TITLE
Exon-Level Expression Data from Primary B Cells, Early Proliferating EBV-infected B Cells and Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eptstein-Barr Virus, an oncogenic herpesvirus, infects and immortalizes human B cells in culture into indefinitely-proliferating LCLs. We examined the gene expression of primary B cells during the process of infection and growth transformation at the exon level to analyze early and late virus-induced changes in expression and exon usage.

DESIGN
4 samples each of total RNA were extracted from purified resting B Cells, sorted early-proliferating EBV infected cells, and monoclonal LCLs, for a total of 12. Human Exon Array 1.0 data was then RMA normalized and analyzed in XRay and GenePattern.
