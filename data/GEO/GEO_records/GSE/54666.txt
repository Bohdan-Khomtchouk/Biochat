TITLE
Gene expression in primary human macrophages and foam cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to determine the effects of 48 hours of treatment with oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) on gene expression in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages.

DESIGN
6 independent biological replicates were processed. From each replicate half of the cells were treated with oxLDL and the other half were treated with the control buffer. For foam cell formation (after 7 days) macrophages were treated with oxLDL (50mcg/ml, enodtoxin free, Copper oxidized). Control macrophages were treated with a matching buffer without oxLDL. Treatment duration - 48 hours.
