TITLE
microRNA160 resistant AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR10 (mARF10) germinating seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Comparisons among the Col-0, ARF10 and mARF10 sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by ARF10. Keywords: Potential upregulated and downregulated genes

DESIGN
Germinating seeds (22 hr imbibition) from three independent biological replicates of Col-0, ARF10 and mARF10 samples, which contain three independent seed lots each, were analyzed.
