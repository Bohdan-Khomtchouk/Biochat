TITLE
Microarray analysis of chimeric CD4+CD28null and CD4+CD28+ T-cells in humanized mice.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The major goal of this experiment was to identify the overall changes in gene expression of human CD4+CD28 null T-cells that develop after repetitive [xeno] antigen stimulation, in comparison to normal CD4+CD28+ T-cells.  These cells were derived by adoptive transfer of human CD4 T-cells from a normal donor (all CD28+) into immunodeficient mice.

DESIGN
Chimeric human CD4+CD28+ were isolated from 4 mice, and chimeric human CD4+CD28 null cells from two of these animals after expansion and T-cell differentiation in vivo.  Animals were euthanized, and single cell suspensions of splenocytes derived.  CD4 T-cell subpopulations were isolated by fluoresence activated cell sorting, RNA was extrated, labeled and hybridized to whole human gene expression arrays. Overall changes in the gene expression were identified using GEDI (gene expression dynamic inspector). 603 genes were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) between the CD4+CD28+ and CD4+CD28null cells. Candidate genes were validated using qRT-PCR
