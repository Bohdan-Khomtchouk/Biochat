TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for practical radiation biodosimetry

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of miRNA expression was performed in Activin A and Wnt3a-treated mouse ESCs during the different stages of DE differentiation to identify candidate miRNAs likely to be involved in Wnt3a and Activin A induced DE formation. Our analysis exhibited a distinct miRNA expression finger print. Furthermore, we found that forced expression of a subset of synergistically regulated miRNAs could partially mimic the roles of Wnt3a and Activin A. Pathway analyses also revealed the involvement of histone acetylation in Activin A/Wnt3a-driven DE differentiation, which is further confirmed by treating the cells with small molecular weight HDAC inhibitors as well as ChIP experiments. Our study established a regulatory cascade from extracellular cytokine treatment to miRNA expression to histone modification in cell nucleus during DE differentiation.

DESIGN
ESCs were treated with 100ng/ml Activin A, or 50ng/ml Wnt3a, or 100ng/ml Activin A plus 50ng/ml Wnt3a, and the samples were collected at 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days after treatment, respectively. Cells treated with the same medium without growth factors were used as the negative controls for each time point.
