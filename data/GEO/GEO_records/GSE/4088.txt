TITLE
Neuronal Differentiation of Primary Myoblast Sphere Cultures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult mouse muscle was enzymatically dissociated. Muscle derived stem cells proliferate unattached, in spheres, in the proliferation medium. Cells from spheres were also incubated in a differentiation medium. They differentiated into neurons after 7 days in culture. Keywords: neuronal differentiation

DESIGN
this experiment include 2 samples and 12 replicates
