TITLE
A glycoanalysis of WEHI 231 B cell line to determine if there is a different profile of carbohydrates following apoptosis, especially if there is an exposure of fucose residues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined that there is a carbohydrate change on CD44 on leukocytes during apoptosis.  This change is important for phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells and is inhibitable by fucoidin but not mannan or monosaccharides.  In addition, this occurs without new protein synthesis.

DESIGN
We want to immunoprecipitate CD44 from apoptotic and control cells and determine whether there is a different profile of carbohydrates, especially exposure of fucose residues.  We have used a lectin to isolate a protein consistent with the molecular weights of CD44. We would also like to do a profile of the apoptotic versus control membranes from the B cells as a comparison. RNA preparations were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.  Data was provided to Dr. Mills' laboratory for analysis.
