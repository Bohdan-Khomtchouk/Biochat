SUMMARY
The effect of dietary calcium and dairy proteins on adipose tissue gene expression profile in diet induced obesity Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
9-week-old C57Bl/6J-mice were divided into two groups (n=10/group). The control diet was a standard high-fat diet (60% of energy) low in calcium (0.4%). The whey protein diet was a high-calcium (1.8%) high-fat diet with whey protein isolate. After the 21-week treatment, the adipose tissue transcript profiling (2 mice/group) was carried out using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.
