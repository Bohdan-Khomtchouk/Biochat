TITLE
Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis Induces a Unique Pulmonary Inflammatory Response: Role of Bacterial Gene Expression in Temporal Regulation of Host Defense Responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Virulent Francisella tularensis induces a unique pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by temporal regulation of innate immune pathways correlating with altered bacterial gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
The pulmonary transcriptional response to aerosolized virulent F. tularensis was compared to other lethal and non-lethal respiratory pathogens.
