TITLE
A Metagenomics Analysis of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Infection in Patients in North America

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Virochip microarray (version 4.0) was used to detect viruses in patients from North America with unexplained influenza-like illness at the onset of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

DESIGN
We used metagenomics-based technologies (the Virochip microarray) and deep sequencing to analyze nasal swab samples from individuals with 2009 H1N1 infection. This Series includes the Virochip microarray data only.
