TITLE
Reversal of microRNA-150 silencing disadvantages crizotinib-resistant NPM-ALK-positive cell growth.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used bisulfite conversion and Illumina sequencing to analyse miR-150 DNA methylation pattern lost in cells treated with decitabine, a demethylating agent, Crizotinib, an inhibitor of  of ALK activity or siALK

DESIGN
Targeted bisulfite conversion and Illumina sequencing in two cell lines bearing the t(2;5)(p23;q35)

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
