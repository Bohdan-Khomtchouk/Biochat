TITLE
Small RNAs from the moss Physcomitrella patens

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of endogenous small RNAs from the moss Physcomitrella patens.  This dataset encompasses microRNAs and other small RNAs of ~20-24 nucleotides expressed in the moss P. patens. SAMPLES UPDATED JULY 9, 2007 TO INCLUDE DATA ON SEQUENCED SMALL RNAS THAT DO NOT MATCH THE P. PATENS GENOME Keywords: High throughput small RNA sequencing

DESIGN
Small RNA cDNA libraries derived from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) fractionated total RNA, adapter ligation, reverse transcription, and pyrosequencing was used for microRNA and endogenous siRNA discovery in wild-type tissues of the moss Physcomitrella patens.  See Axtell et al. (2006) A two-hit trigger for siRNA biogenesis in plants.  Cell 127: 565-577. for details.
