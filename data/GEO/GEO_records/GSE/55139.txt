TITLE
Identification of a novel biomarker serum miRNA from the patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to have a potential for cancer diagnosis lately. The main objective of this study is to identify a novel biomarker serum miRNA from the patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Microarray analysis of miRNA expression was performed using paired pre- and post- operative serum from 10 CRC patients. Two miRNAs (let-7a, miR-199a-3p) decreased significantly in the post-operative serum when compared to pre-operative serum (P=0.015 and 0.029, respectively).

DESIGN
Microarrays were performed for paired pre- and post- operative serum from 10 CRC patients.
