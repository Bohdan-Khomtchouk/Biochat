TITLE
Recipient myeloid cell subsets in transplanted allografts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Balb/c donor hearts were transplanted into C57/BL6 recipients as previously described (Corry et al, 1973). Recipient mice were treated with 250Î¼g anti-CD40L mAb for tolerance induction on days 0, 2, and 4 as previously described (Jiang et al., 2011) or left untreated. On day 5 after transplantation graft infiltrating myeloid subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Affymetrix Mouse Gene arrays were run in triplicate with the samples of interest. Raw CEL file data from Affymetrix Expression Console were background corrected, normalized, and summarized using RMA.

DESIGN
18 Samples, 9 treated and 9 untreated, 3 replicates each

PLATFORM
