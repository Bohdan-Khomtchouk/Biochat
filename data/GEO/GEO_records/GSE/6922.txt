TITLE
Non-coding RNA tiling array in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The 1 Mb tiling array was used to represent the 10.0 Mb to 11.0 Mb region of japonica rice Chromosome 10. A tile path was designed with 36-mer probes at a step of 5 nt. All 388,994 probes were retained and synthesized into a single array. This array was hybridized to the cDNA target used for the full-genome tiling array as well as targets prepared from non-coding RNA sample I and II. Keywords: noncoding RNA
