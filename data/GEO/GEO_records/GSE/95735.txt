TITLE
Regulation of microRNA in myositis skeletal muscle after exercise (microRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify changes in skeletal muscle microRNA expression after exercise and associate the identified microRNAs with mRNA and protein expression to disease-specific pathways in polymyositis and dermatomyositis

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from vastus lateralis before and after 12 weeks of endurance exercise (n = 3) compared to before and after nonexercise, control group (n = 3)
