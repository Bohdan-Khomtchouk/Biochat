TITLE
H3K4me3 involvement in long-term effects of sulfomethoxazole on Caenorhabditis elegans over 11 consecutive generations and their first non-exposed progeny

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, were exposed to sulfomethaxozale (SMX) for 11 consecutive generations. The F11 nematodes and their first non-exposed progeny (F14’) went through chromatin immune-precipitation at H3K4me3 site and a subsequent DNA-sequencing. Results showed that F11 and F14’ nematodes had 3-fold more H3K4me3 biding genes than the control. These genes showed the highest enrichment in the promoter region with 42.11% and 73.72% in F11 and F14’ nematodes, respectively, indicating increased activity of their regulated genes. In F11 nematodes, the genes regulating metabolic and biosynthetic processes of phospholipid, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid were significantly activated with a mean enrichment fold change of 50.57. The genes regulating nervous system and development were also activated with a mean enrichment fold change of 65.03 and 58.14, respectively. In F14’ nematodes, 96 and 67 genes showed up- and down-regulations compared with those in F11 nematodes. In the up-regulation, genes regulating development, reproduction and transmembrane transport showed mean enrichment fold changes of 2.52, 22.41 and 34.47, respectively. The down-regulated genes were also related with development, reproduction and transmembrane activities with mean enrichment fold changes ranging from 1.51 to 8.32. Our findings demonstrated the epigenetic involvement in the SMX trans-generational effects.

DESIGN
Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, were exposed to sulfomethaxozale (SMX) for 11 consecutive generations. The F11 nematodes and their first non-exposed progeny (F14’) went through chromatin immune-precipitation at H3K4me3 site and a subsequent DNA-sequencing.
