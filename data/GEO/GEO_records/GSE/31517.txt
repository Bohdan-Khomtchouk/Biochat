TITLE
A plasma membrane calcium ATPase functions in FLS2-mediated immunity

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plasma membrane promote plant immunity through the detection of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). In plants, the PRR for bacterial flagellin (flg22) is encoded by the receptor kinase FLS2. One of the earliest MAMP responses is the rapid and transient increase of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) ions, which is required for many of the well-described downstream responses, e.g. generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the transcriptional activation of defence-associated genes. Despite its relevance, the molecular components regulating the Ca2+ burst remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the plasma membrane P2B-type Ca2+ ATPase ACA8 forms a dynamic complex with the PRR FLS2. ACA8 and its closest homologue ACA10 are required for immunity against virulent bacteria. Mutant aca8 aca10 plants are reduced in the flg22-induced Ca2+ burst, show reduced ROS production and exhibit altered transcriptional reprogramming. In particular, flg22-induced gene expression is elevated downstream of signalling mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, but reduced downstream of the calcium-dependent protein (CDP) kinase cascade. These results demonstrate that the fine regulation of Ca2+ fluxes in the cytosol is critical for the coordination of the downstream MAMP responses and provide for the first time a link between the FLS2 receptor complex and signalling kinases via the secondary messenger Ca2+. ACA8 also interacted with the BRI1 and CLV1 receptor kinases, which correlated with the developmental phenotypes of aca8 aca10 mutants suggesting a broader role for Ca2+ ATPases in receptor-mediated signalling. We used Affymetrix Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R Array to compare global transcript levels in 7 days-old sterile grown seedlings.
