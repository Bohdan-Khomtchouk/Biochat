TITLE
MEK5D-transfected HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We expressed a constitutively active mutant of MEK5 (MEK5D) in human primary endothelial cells (EC) to study the transcriptional and functional responses to Erk5 activation under static conditions.

DESIGN
HUVEC were infected with either empty vector or constitutively active MEK5D and RNA was processed for microarray analysis 40 h post infection.
