TITLE
Linezolid Exerts Greater Bacterial Clearance but No Modification of Host Lung Gene Expression Profiling: a Mouse MRSA Pneumonia Model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using the stringent criteria (fold change â‰¥ 1.5 up or down, P < 0.01, FDR < 0.05) to filter significantly differentially expressed genes, we did not identify any genes whose expression levels were significantly different between the PBS and PBS+LZD groups or between the LAC and LAC+LZD at Day 1 or Day 3 post MRSA infection. However, a remarkable difference was demonstrated (Figure 5A) between PBS and LAC groups at either Day 1 or Day 3 post MRSA infection.

DESIGN
Four independent mouse lung tissue samples at Day 1 and Day 3 post MRSA infection with and without Linezolid therapy were randomly selected from each group for microarray analysis.
