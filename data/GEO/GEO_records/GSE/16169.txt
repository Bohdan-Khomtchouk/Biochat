TITLE
Effect of Ovarian Hormone on Gene Expression in Laser Captured Serotonin Neurons from Monkeys

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Ovariectomized monkeys were treated with placebo, estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone for one month. The brain was perfused with RNA Later plus 20% sucrose. Sections through the dorsal raphe nucleus were immunostained for TPH and then TPH positive neurons were laser captured. The RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Rhesus Affymetrix chip.

DESIGN
Each chip represents one monkey. N=2 monkeys per treatment.
