TITLE
The Retinoblastoma Binding Protein RBP2 is an H3K4 demethylase

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The roles of histone demethylase RBP2 in gene expression were assessed using gene expression profiling experiments with wild type and RBP2-/- primary MEFs. Several cytokine genes including SDF1 and Kit ligand were upregulated upon inactivation of RBP2. Keywords: mouse embryonic fibroblasts, gene expression profiling, microarray, Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0, cell type comparison
