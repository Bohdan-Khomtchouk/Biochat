TITLE
Young and old HSCs from WT and Lnk-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The adaptor protein Lnk is an important negative regulator of HSC homeostasis and self-renewal. This study aims to investigate the role of Lnk in HSC aging. Here we performed expression profiling of bone marrow CD150+CD48-LSK LT-HSCs from young and old WT and Lnk-/- mice. Results identify select Lnk-mediated pathways with potential involvement in HSC self-renewal and aging.

DESIGN
CD150+CD48-LSK HSCs were double sorted from WT and Lnk-/- mice at both young and old ages (2 months and 20 months, respectively). RNA was isolated using miRNeasy kit from QIAGEN and processed using the NuGEN Pico kit. The microarray analysis was performed at the Penn Molecular Profiling/Genomics Facility using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0ST array (Affymetrix).
