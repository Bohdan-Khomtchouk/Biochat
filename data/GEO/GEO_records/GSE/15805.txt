TITLE
Duke-UNC-Texas-EBI ENCODE expression project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These samples are being analyzed by the Duke-UNC-Texas-EBI ENCODE consortium. Expression from these cell types will compared to three whole genome open chromatin methodologies: DNaseI hypersensitivity (DNase-seq), Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) . For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
These were processed on Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST arrays to obtain expression data from all cell types being analyzed for open chromatin.
