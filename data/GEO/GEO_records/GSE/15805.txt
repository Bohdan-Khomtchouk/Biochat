Duke-UNC-Texas-EBI ENCODE expression project

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
These samples are being analyzed by the Duke-UNC-Texas-EBI ENCODE consortium. Expression from these cell types will compared to three whole genome open chromatin methodologies: DNaseI hypersensitivity (DNase-seq), Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) .
