TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes induced in wild-type or Atf6a-/- mice by treatment with tunicamycin for 8h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protein misfolding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the liver, and ER stress is associated with human diseases that are accompanied by hepatic lipid accumulation, including obesity, alcoholism, and viral hepatitis; yet the pathways leading from ER stress to the regulation of lipid metabolism are poorly understood. Working exclusively in vivo, we used a “bottom-up” approach to infer pathways in the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism by the UPR. We used a functional genomics to link gene expression patterns taken from microarray data to the severity and persistence of ER stress, using mice lacking the UPR signaling molecule ATF6α. This approach revealed that functionally related genes clustered into a small number of distinct expression profiles, and that lipid oxidation and efflux were targets for coordinated transcriptional suppression during ER stress.Our results establish a framework for hepatic gene regulation during ER stress.

DESIGN
Atf6a-/- or +/+ mice of variable age and gender were injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg/kg tunicamycin or vehicle. 3 separate mice were used in each group. 8h after injection, mice were sacrificed and total RNA was prepared from resected livers.
