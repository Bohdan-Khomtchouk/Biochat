TITLE
Gene expression profiling of circulating plasma RNA from colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of circulating plasma RNA is a valuable tool to detect cancer and a potential clinical instrument to study tumor progression and therapy responsiveness. In this study, differential gene expression analysis was used to identify genes specifically increased in cancer patients. Keywords: Disease state analysis
