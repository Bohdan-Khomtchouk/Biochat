TITLE
White adipose tissue and brain microarray from eIF6 heteroxygotes and wild-type 5 weeks-old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
White adipose tissue is primary involved in the response to insulin after feeding, while brain is not directly sensitive to insulin levels. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in white adipose tissue upon eIF6 haploinsufficiency and compare the gene expression profiles to brain. We identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes and up-regulated genes in the two tissues.

DESIGN
White adipose tissue and brain of 5 weeks-old mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
