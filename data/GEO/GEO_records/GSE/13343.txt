TITLE
Intracellular proliferation and virulence gene expression of Salmonella are influenced by pre-invasion growth conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Salmonella invasion of non-phagocytic cells is a dynamic process that requires the translocation of effector proteins into host cells by a type III secretion system (T3SS1) encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). The signals involved in T3SS1 induction in vivo are not known, but SPI1-induced invasive Salmonella can be prepared by growth in synthetic media. Here we compared two different methods of preparing SPI1-induced bacteria by using a combination of transcriptome analysis, a single-cell reporter assay and intracellular gene expression analysis to reveal clear differences between these two bacterial populations that are reflected in their ability to interact with cultured epithelial cells. Invasion efficiency and intracellular replication were greater for bacteria grown with aeration to late-log phase compared to those grown without aeration to stationary phase. No significant differences in SPI1 regulon expression were revealed by transcriptome analysis. By contrast, surface appendage and stress response genes were considerably changed. Single cell analyses of gene expression revealed variation in the frequency of SPI1-induced bacteria and a correlation between SPI1-induction and the presence of flagella. The expression of virulence genes following invasion of cultured epithelial cells was also found to be predetermined by pre-invasion growth conditions.
