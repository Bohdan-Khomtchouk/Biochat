TITLE
The Tasmanian devil transcriptome reveals Schwann cell origins of a clonally transmissible cancer (small RNA sequencing)

ORGANISM
Sarcophilus harrisii

SUMMARY
The Tasmanian devil, a marsupial carnivore, is endangered due to the emergence of a clonally transmissible cancer known as Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD). This fatal cancer is clonally derived and is an allograft transmitted between devils by biting. We performed a large-scale genetic analysis of DFTD with microsatellite genotyping, mitochondrial genome analysis, as well as deep sequencing of the DFTD transcriptome and miRNAs. These studies confirm that DFTD is a monophyletic clonally transmissible tumor, and suggest that the disease is of Schwann cell origin. On the basis of these results we have generated a diagnostic marker for DFTD, and identify a suite of genes of relevance to DFTD pathology and transmission. We provide a genomic dataset for the Tasmanian devil, which is applicable to cancer diagnosis, disease evolution and conservation biology. This submission contains only small RNA sequence data from this study.
