TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of gene expression in Ezh2-deficient and control murine lung epithelial and stromal cell populations at day E16.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial (CD31-CD45-EpCAM+) and stromal (CD31-CD45-EpCAM-) lung cells were derived by FACS from ShhCre;Ezh2fl/fl and control ShhCre;Ezh2fl/+ mouse embryos at day E16.5 (3 biological replicates per genotype-tissue combination). Total RNA extracted from the samples was subjected to NGS library preparation using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero (Illumina). Completed libraries from different samples were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 TruSeq with SBS Kit v3 - HS reagents (Illumina) as 100 bp single end reads at the Australian Genome Research Facility.

DESIGN
RNA-seq gene expression profiles from Ezh2 deficient and control lung epithelial and stromal cell populations at day E16.5 (3 replicates per genotype-tissue combination).
