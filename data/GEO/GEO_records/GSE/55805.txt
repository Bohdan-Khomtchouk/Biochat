TITLE
A Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Surface N-Glycoprotein resource including New Markers, Extracellular Epitopes, and Drug Targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detailed knowledge of cell surface proteins for isolating well-defined populations of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) would significantly enhance their characterization and translational potential. Normal H9 human embryonic stem cells and the KB3 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines were analyzed by Cell Surface Capture Technology, and in parallel transcript profiles from five independent samples (i.e., Replicas 1-5 for each) were performed to facilitate protein and transcriptomic comparisons.

DESIGN
The study compared gene expression profiles of pluripotent stem cells with Cell Surface Capture technology generated N-glycoprotein surfaceome analyses of the same cell types.
