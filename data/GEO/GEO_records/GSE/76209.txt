TITLE
ChIP-Seq-Data from MEFs overexpressing Fbxl10

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of Fbxl10 leads to enhanced migration in mouse embryonic fibroblast

DESIGN
To analyse the role of histone demethylase Fbxl10 we generated gain of function model overexpressing HA-tagged Fbxl10 and identified target genes by Chip-Seq and transcriptome analysis.
