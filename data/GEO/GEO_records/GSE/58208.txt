TITLE
Gene expression profiling of PBMC from normal individuals, chronic hepatitis B carriers and hepatocellular carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant gene expression analysis between peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from healthy individuals and patients with chronic hepatitis B carriers and HCC were identified using Affymetrix gene arrays.Â 

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from healthy individuals, patients with patients with chronic hepatitis B carriers and HCC were isolated and total RNA was extracted for Affymetrix gene microarray analysis.
