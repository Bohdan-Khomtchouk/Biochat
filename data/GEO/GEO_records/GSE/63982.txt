TITLE
Transcriptomic responses of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to environmental enrichment during juvenile rearing

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Captive rearing programs (hatcheries) are often used in conservation and management efforts for at-risk salmonid fish populations. However, hatcheries typically rear juveniles in environments that contrast starkly with natural conditions, which may lead to phenotypic and/or genetic changes that adversely affect the performance of juveniles upon their release to the wild. Environmental enrichment has been proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficacy of population restoration efforts from captive-rearing programs: in this study, we examine the influence of environmental enrichment during embryo and yolk-sac larval rearing at the level of the transcriptome in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Full siblings were reared in either a “simple” environment devoid of structure or a “complex” environment enriched with gravel substrate. At the end of endogenous feeding by juveniles, we examined patterns of gene transcription in head tissues using the cGRASP-designed Agilent 4×44K microarray. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) indicated that 808 genes were differentially transcribed between rearing environments and a total of 184 gene ontological (GO) terms were over- or under-represented, several of which are associated with mitosis/cell cycle and muscle and heart development. However, there were also pronounced differences among families in gene transcriptional response to rearing environment, with the number of genes significantly differentially transcribed by juveniles in our independent analyses of each family ranging from zero to 3445 (FDR of 5%). Overall, our results suggest that rearing environment enrichment can profoundly change patterns of gene transcription during salmon development, but that the degree of response depends on genetic background.

DESIGN
This was a two-condition experiment in which a total of 30 RNA samples isolated from the heads of developing salmon were analysed: 15 juveniles reared in a traditional hatchery environment and 15 reared in a hatchery environment enriched with gravel substrate.
