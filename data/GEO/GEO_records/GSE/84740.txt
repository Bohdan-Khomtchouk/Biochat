TITLE
Monocyte-derived dendritic cells response to mycobacterial glycolipid, phosphatidyl-inositol mannosides (PIM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Phosphatidyl-inositol mannosides (PIM) are unique mycobacterial glycolipids. However, the PIM-induced immunostimulatory activities remain controversial. Here we report on gene expression analysis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with tri-acylated PIM2 (AcPIM2) or tetra-acylated PIM2 (Ac2PIM2). Results provide evidence for the adjuvant activity of PIM.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with tri-acylated PIM2 (AcPIM2) or tetra-acylated PIM2 (Ac2PIM2) for 8 hours.
