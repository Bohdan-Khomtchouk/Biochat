TITLE
Individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP and high-throughput sequencing to map hnRNP L-RNA interactions in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) combined with high-throughput sequencing was used to generate a transcriptome-wide binding map of hnRNP L. Supplementary file GSE37560_hnRNPL_crosslink_site.bed includes filtered crosslink sites of hnRNPL: combining data from all 3 experiments.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of hnRNP L-specific and control (Flag) co-immunoprecipitated RNA after  UV-crosslinking in HeLa cells

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
