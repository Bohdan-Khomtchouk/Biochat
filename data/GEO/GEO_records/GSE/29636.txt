TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Tbx20 (GFP-tagged) in adult mouse whole heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tbx20 is a transcription factor important for heart development. To assess the role of Tbx20 in the adult heart, we sought to identify regulatory regions, gene targets and pathways regulated by this TF. To this end, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Tbx20 fused to GFP to locate binding sites in the genome of 8 weeks whole heart mouse tissue.

DESIGN
Analysis of 1 Tbx20-GFP ChIP sample of adult mouse whole heart against whole heart input
