TITLE
BET bromodomain inhibitors synergize with ATR inhibitors to induce DNA damage, apoptosis, senescence-associated secretory pathway and ER stress in Myc- induced lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the project was to determine the expression profiles of murine Myc-driven lymphpma cells (Lambda-820) treated with vehicle (DMSO, 1:1000), a BET inhibitor (RVX2135), an ATR inhibitor (VE-821) or a combination of RVX2135 and VE-821. All experimnets were performed in presence of 10uM Q-VD-OPH to block apoptosis. Cells were harvested 24 h after treatment start.

DESIGN
4 samples (DMSO, RVX2135, VE-821 or RVX2135/VE-821) in duplicates
