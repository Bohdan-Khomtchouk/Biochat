TITLE
Maternal diabetes alters transcriptional programs in the developing embryo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to maternal diabetes during pregnancy alters transcriptional profiles in the developing embryo.  The enrichment, within the set of de-regulated genes, of those encoding transcriptional regulatory molecules provides support for the hypothesis that maternal diabetes affects specific developmental programs. We compared E10.5 cntrol embryos to E10.5 embryos from diabetic pregnancies in the FVB mouse strain.

DESIGN
Diabetes was induced in 7-9 week old female FVB mice by streptozotocin. Dams whose blood glucose levels exceeded 250 mg/dl were set up for mating. Embryos were dissected at E10.5 and total RNA was isolated. Equal amounts of RNA prepared from 3 individual embryos were pooled into one sample; each embryo was from a different pregnancy. Three pools were constructed for a total of nine embryos from diabetic pregnancies, and independently three pools for control embryos.
