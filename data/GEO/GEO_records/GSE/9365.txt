TITLE
Expression data from barley maturing and germinating grains

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Plant seeds prepare for germination already during seed maturation. We performed a detailed transcriptome analysis of barley grain maturation, desiccation and germination in two tissue fractions (endosperm/aleurone = e/a and embryo = em) using the Affymetrix barley1 chip. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Barley developing and germinating seeds were harvested at different time points after flowering (developing) and imbibition (germinating). To further disseect the influence of different tissues, seeds were dissecte and tissues were analyzed individually.
