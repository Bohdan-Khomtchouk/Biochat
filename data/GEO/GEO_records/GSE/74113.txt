TITLE
Reduced insulin production relieves endoplasmic reticulum stress and induces beta-cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We define the effects of reduced insulin production in beta-cells from tamoxifen-treated Ins1-/-:Ins2f/f:Pdx1CreERT:mTmG mice studied at a time point when insulin production was reduced by ~50%.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome of adult pancreatic islets from mice with acute Ins2 gene knockout out on an Ins1 null background

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
