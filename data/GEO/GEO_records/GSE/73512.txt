TITLE
Expression data from skin of controls and patient with Curth–Macklin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ichthyosis Curth–Macklin is a rare genetic disorder that is clinically characterized by severe palmoplantar keratoderma. We have described previously a severe familial phenotype caused by a novel mutation in the KRT1 gene. In this study, we analyzed the skin of one patient using gene expression microarrays. We used microarrays to study the differences of gene expression between normal skin and skin affected by Ichthyosis Curth-Macklin

DESIGN
Skin biopsies were obtained from controls and patient, total RNA was extracted and gene expresion was determined using Gene Expression Microarrays (Affymetrix - Prime View)

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
