TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of multiple myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that a small molecule inhibitor of PRMT4 inhibited cell growth of a subset of multiple myeloma cell lines. To identify biomarkers that predict the sensitivity of myeloma cells to PRMT4 inhibition, we performed transcriptomic analysis of multiple myeloma cell lines.

DESIGN
Amplicon sequencing of thirteen multiple myeloma cell lines was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. Steady-state gene expression profile of sensitive cells were compaired with that of insensitive cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
