TITLE
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in placental tissues of Pre-eclampsia Using microarray combined with Connectivity Map database

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE), which affects 2-7% of human pregnancies, causes significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. To better understand the pathophysiology of PE, gene expression profiling of placental tissue from 5 controls and 5 PEs were assessed using microarray. A total of 224 transcripts were identified as being significantly differentially expressed (fold change > 2 and q value < 0.05 in the SAM software), GO enrichment analysis indicated that genes involved hypoxia, oxidative and reductive processes were significantly changed. Ten differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in these biological process were further verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Finally, the potential therapeutic agents for PE were explored via Connectivity Map database . In conclusion, the data obtained in this study might provide clues to better understand the pathophysiology of PE and found potential therapeutic agents for PE patients.

DESIGN
gene expression profiling of placental tissue from 5 controls and 5 PEs were assessed using microarray.
