TITLE
SIRT1 impact on global gene expression in the brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared expression of genes in brains of SIRT1 brain-specific knockouts (BSKO) to those of wild-type littermate controls (WT).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from whole brain tissues of SIRT1 brain specific knockout mice (BSKO) and their wild-type littermates (WT). 3 months old males were used, four biological replicates per genotype were used. RNA was verified for integrity and processed according to Affymetrix guidelines, using kits and reagents supplied by Affymetrix. Total of 8 Affymetrix.GeneChip.Mouse430A_2 chips single channel were used.
