TITLE
Gene expression profile of SKOV3 cells cultured with a novel 3D cell culture method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preclinical cancer drug discovery efforts have employed two-dimensional (2D)-cell-based assay models, which fail to forecast in vivo efficacy and contribute to a lower success rates of clinical approval.  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are recently expected to bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models. We have developed a novel 3D culture method that improves the growth of spheroid-forming cancer cells under anchorage-independent condition by leveraging a feature of FP001, a bacteria-derived polysaccharide. Gene microarrays were used to observe the global gene expression in SKOV3 cells cultured with adhesion condition (2D, control) or with low adhesion condition (FP001) and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cells were cultured for 11 days in normal attachment plates with normal medium (as control) or low-attachment plates with FP001 containing medium. Each sample was collected three times.
