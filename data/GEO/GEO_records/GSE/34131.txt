TITLE
Gene expression profile of peripheral blood leukocytes of 60Co gamma-ray accidently-irradiated persons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identified as candidate biomarkers for early  diagonosis or as therapeutic targets in late damages of ionizing radiation, gene expression profile was analyzed in the peripheral blood of three 60Co γ-ray accidently-exposed persons. The results showed that there were 285 up-regulated and 446 down-regulated genes in irradiated samples compared with control samples. The large majority of those differentially expressed genes encode proteins that are associated with immune response, inflammation, cell structure, oxidative stress, neuro-hormone regulation, reproduction, susceptibility of psychiatric disorders, and transcriptional regulators. The expressions of IL3, KDR, CEACAM8 and OSM were validated by real-time RT-PCR method. The findings of our study should help us understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the late effects of ionizing radiation and to develop better diagonostic and therapeutic strategies for those damages.

DESIGN
Fresh blood samples were collected from three 60Coγ-Ray accidentally-exposed persons(3 years post irradiation) and three non-irradiated healthy donors. Leucocytes cells were isolated and total RNA was extracted. Four RNA samples, from three accidently-exposed persons and a RNA mixture extracted from a combination of three healthy donors` leucocytes (ratio 1:1:1, each 3.3×106 cells) in EL buffer, were subjected to Agilent gene expression microarray assay.
