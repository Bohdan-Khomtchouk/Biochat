TITLE
Protein expression in primary murine dermal fibroblasts grown on fibronectin vs. plastic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in identifying proteins that are regulated in response to the extracellular matrix molecule, fibronectin, in dermal fibroblasts.  To determine proteins regulated by exposure to fibronectin, primary murine dermal fibroblasts were cultured on tissue culture plastic or on tissue culture plates coated with a thin layer of fibronectin (2 Î¼g/cm2).  Fibroblasts were seeded at 35,000 cells/10 cm2 and were harvested 48 hours later. Cell pellets from these fibroblasts were shipped to Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp. (Vancouver, B.C.) where they were lysed and analyzed using the Kinex TM Antibody Microarray (KAM 1.2), which contains 800 (500 pan-specific and 300 phosphorylation site-specific) antibodies. This enabled us to identify candidate proteins regulated by exposure to fibronectin.
