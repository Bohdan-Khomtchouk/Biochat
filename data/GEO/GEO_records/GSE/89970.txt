TITLE
Genome-wide map of HAEC chromatin landscape under resting and TNFa, IL1b, and OxPAPC stimulation, with corresponding transcription factor binding and RNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the dynamic enhancer landscape of HAEC at baseline and under inflammatory stimulation, and also show the cistromes of ETS, AP-1 as well as key signal dependent transcription factors, with corresponding gene expression. We also describe the inflammatory transcriptional profile caused by inhibition of the ETS factor ERG with siRNA.

DESIGN
We use ChIP-seq for two histone modifications and ATAC-seq datasets to describe EC enhancers, poly-A selected RNA sequencing to show gene expression, and ChIP-seq to characterize the binding profile of EC transcription factors in relation to enhancers. ERG siRNA knockdown followed by RNA-seq was used to characterize the ERG knockdown phenotype.
