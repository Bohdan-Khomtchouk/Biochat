TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of WERI-Rb-1 (retinal cells) infected with Toxoplasma gondii over time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of DNA methylation patterns following infection of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in a clinically relevant retinal cell line over a time course of 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours. Parasites were washed off after 2 hours to ensure that methylation changes are truly reflective of an on-going infection, and not on-going parasite invasion.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA extracted from Toxoplasma gondii infected for 2, 6 and 24 hours post-infected compared to mock-infected cells at the same time points

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
