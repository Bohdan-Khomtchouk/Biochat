TITLE
Expression analysis of Reh cells after transfection with shRNA targeting CBFA2T3 and/or constitutively active IKKβ(EE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of Reh cells following transfection with shRNA targeting CBFA2T3, constitutively active IKKβ(EE), or both in combination.

DESIGN
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays were hybridized to determine the gene expression profile of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived Reh cells following transfection with i) control shRNA construct, ii) shRNA construct targeting CBFA2T3, iii) a constitutively active variant of the IkB kinase β (IKKβ(EE)), or iv) shRNA targeting CBFA2T3 in combination with IKKβ(EE). All hybridizations were done in biological duplicates.
