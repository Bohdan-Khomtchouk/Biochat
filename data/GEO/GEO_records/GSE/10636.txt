TITLE
RBP2 location analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBP2 (JARID1A/RBBP2) enrichment at proximal promoter regions in differentiating promonocytic U937 cells and in the osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells Keywords: differentiation treatment, ChIP-on-chip analysis

DESIGN
We sought to determine transcriptional regulation by RBP2 genome-wide by using location analysis. We describe that RBP2 target genes are separated into two functionally distinct classes: differentiation independent and differentiation dependent genes.Three condition experiment, U937 cells treated with 100 nM 12-O-tetradeconoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) for two different time points (27 hrs and 96 hrs) and untreated (0 hrs time point or no TPA treatment). In addition, processed data for the unrelated SAOS-2 cells are included. Biological replicates: threechromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) performed independently in parallel
