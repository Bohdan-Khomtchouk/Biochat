TITLE
Mapping gene regulatory networks in Drosophila eye development by large-scale transcriptome perturbations and motif inference. [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome control is operated by transcription factors (TF) controlling their target genes by binding to promoters and enhancers. Conceptually, the interactions between TFs, their binding sites, and their functional targets are represented by gene regulatory networks (GRN). Deciphering in vivo GRNs underlying organ development in an unbiased genome-wide setting involves identifying both functional TF-gene interactions and physical TF-DNA interactions. To reverse-engineer the GRN of eye development in Drosophila, we performed RNA-seq across 72 genetic perturbations and sorted cell types, and inferred a co-expression network. Next, we derived direct TF-DNA interactions using computational motif inference, ultimately connecting 241 TFs to 5632 direct target genes through 24926 enhancers. Using this network we found network motifs, cis-regulatory codes, and new regulators of eye development. We validate the predicted target regions of Grainyhead by ChIP-seq and identify this factor as a general co-factor in the eye network, being bound to thousands of nucleosome-free regions.

DESIGN
RNA-seq gene expression profiling across Drosophila 3rd instar larval wild type tissues (brain, eye-antennal and wing discs), specific cell types from the eye-antennal disc, sorted by FACS, and genetic perturbations (TF mutants, TF over-expression, and TF RNAi knockdown).
