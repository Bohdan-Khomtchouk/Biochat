TITLE
Expression data from human hepatocarcinoma HCC-1.2 cell line treated by erlotinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent a new generation of targeted drugs for cancer treatment and chemoprevention. The EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib is under discussion for chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma. A comprehensive analysis of gene expression and respective pathways regulated by erlotinib is needed.

DESIGN
Human hepatocarcinoma cell line HCC-1.2 was treated in vitro by erlotinib  and changes in gene expression were analysed by microarray technique.
