TITLE
Expression data from APA+ and APA- progenitors and SSEA5+ human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be differentiated into progenitors resembling trophoblast upon exposure to BMP4. Putative trophpblast progenitors express APA cell surface marker Using FACS sorting and microarray we analysed the gene expression of APA-positive trophoblast progenitors, APA-negative progenitors and SSEA5-positive undifferentiated hESC and identified genes that contribute to the trophoblast fate

DESIGN
Undifferentiated hESC and hESC treated with BMP4 for 2.5 days (cell line H9) were FACS-sorted to isolate APA+, APA- and SSEA5+ cell populations. Sorted cells were subjected to RNA isolation and microarray protocol. The experiment was conducted using 3 independent differentiation experiments
