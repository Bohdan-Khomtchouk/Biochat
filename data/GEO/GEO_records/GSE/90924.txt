TITLE
Expression data of human lymphoid progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used whole genome transcriptome as gene discovery to dissect the developmental organization of human lymphopoiesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression of human CD127-CD7-/+ (CD34++CD45RA+ITGB7++CD127-CD2-CD115-CD116-CD123-CD10-CD19-CD24-) or CD127+CD7-/+ (CD34++CD45RA+ITGB7++CD127+CD2-CD115-CD116-CD123-CD10-CD19-CD24-) Early Lymphoid Progenitors (ELPs) as compared to Lymphoid-Mono-Dendritic Progenitors (LMDPs: CD34++ CD45RA+CD7-ITGB7-CD127-CD2-CD115-CD116-CD123-CD10-CD19-CD24-). Cells were extracted from the bone marrow of NSG mice engrafted with neonatal UCB CD34+ HPCs (NSG) or from of 21-week-old fetal donor (PRIM).
