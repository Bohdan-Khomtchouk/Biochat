TITLE
Septic shock patients: outcome at D1 (24 hours after inclusion)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed on PBMC with an inflammatory dedicated slide of 340 genes, and target samples labelled with Cy3 for day 0 (reference) and with Cy5 for the other days. Changes in expression levels were evaluated by the ratio Dx/D0. According to outcome and time evolution, a two-dimensional clustering was performed. Keywords: dead vs alive septic shock patients at D1 post-inclusion

DESIGN
The day of inclusion corresponded to the first blood sampling (15 ml) quoted day 0. The following blood samples were performed at days 1, 7, and 28. Since the pre-sepsis expression of the genes as a control cannot be obtained, the day 0 sample was used patient per patient as a reference value for the next days samples for micro-array study. Patients outcome (dead or alive of evolution) was considered, as the time evolution when the patients survived.
