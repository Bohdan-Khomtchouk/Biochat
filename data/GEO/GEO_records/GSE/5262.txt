TITLE
Septic shock patients: outcome at D1 (24 hours after inclusion)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed on PBMC with an inflammatory dedicated slide of 340 genes, and target samples labelled with Cy3 for day 0 (reference) and with Cy5 for the other days. Changes in expression levels were evaluated by the ratio Dx/D0. According to outcome and time evolution, a two-dimensional clustering was performed. Keywords: dead vs alive septic shock patients at D1 post-inclusion
