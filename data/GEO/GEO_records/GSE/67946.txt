TITLE
small RNAseq in donor BMDCs and BMDCs that received exosomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
small RNAseq was preformed on Wt bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and miR-155 and miR-146a double knockout (DKO)  BMDCs that received Wt exosomes to investigate the differences in transferred miRNA

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles were generated from Wt donor BMDCs and DKO BMDCs given Wt exosomes 3 replicates in each group
