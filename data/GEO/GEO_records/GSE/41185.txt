TITLE
Potentiation of regulatory T cell stability and function via a neuropilin-1:semaphorin-4a axis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Treg) represent a critical immunoregulatory component of the immune system. The signals that maintain Treg stability and potentiate their function remain obscure. Here we show that the immune cell surface ligand semaphorin-4a (Sema4a)

DESIGN
Sema treated and NRP1 knock outs were compared to untreated wild type T cell controls
