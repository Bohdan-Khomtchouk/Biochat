TITLE
Gene expression profiling analysis of murine Villin-Gremlin villi compared to age-matched control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to assess the global transcriptional differences between villin-Grem villi compared to normal villi of age-matched mice. We found changes in key gene signatures asscoiated with tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated villi from Villin-Gremlin mouse (n=6) and wildtype controls (n=6)
