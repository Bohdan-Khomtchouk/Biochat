SUMMARY
Two independent exposures (labeled T1 and T2) to pH 5.0.  Samples were harvested at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes and used to make cDNA.  Arrays are set up such that each time point was hybridized to the individual T=0 starting culture. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
