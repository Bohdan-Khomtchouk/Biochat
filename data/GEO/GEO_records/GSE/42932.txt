TITLE
TGF-beta 1 effect on primary bovine aortic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary bovine aortic endothelial cells treated for 24 hours with TGF-beta 1 5 ng/ml. TGF-beta 1 has been shown to induce endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and to be implicated in differentiation of endothelial cells into smooth muscle-like cells as occurred in vascular neointimal formation.

DESIGN
Primary aortic endothelial cells seeded on 10 mm diameter plates were incubated with TGF-beta 1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours or left under basal conditions. Triplicates from three different cultures.
