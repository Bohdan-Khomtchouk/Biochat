TITLE
Gene expression of livers from Lpcat3fl/fl and Lpcat3fl/fl Albumin-Cre mice on chow diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The total abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is known to influence lipoprotein production.  However, the role of specific phospholipid species in lipid transport has been difficult to assess due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane composition in vivo.  Here we show that the LXR-regulated phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of membrane phospholipid composition and lipoprotein production.  Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver show defects in lipoprotein production. The objective of generating this dataset was to analyze the effects of Lpcat3 loss of function on baseline gene expression in mouse liver.

DESIGN
This dataset compares gene expression in Lpcat3fl/fl and Lpcat3fl/fl Albumin-Cre liver samples from 12-week old male mice that were subjected to 6 hr fasting. Each sample contains tissues from 5 mice.
