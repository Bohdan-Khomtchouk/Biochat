TITLE
Induction of inflammatory cytokines by a keratin mutation  in a mouse model   for EBS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a skin disorder caused by mutations in keratin (K) 5 or K14 genes. It is widely regarded as a mechanobullous disease, resulting from a weakened cytoskeleton, causing extensive cytolysis. It was postulated by others that certain K14 mutations induce TNF-alfa and increase apoptosis. Here, we report that in K5-/- mice , the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-alfa remain unaltered. Transcriptome analysis of K5-/- mice revealed however, that the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level in K5-/- mouse skin. These results were confirmed by TaqMan real-time PCR and ELISA assays. We hypothesize that keratin mutations contribute to EBS in a mouse model by inducing local inflammation that mediates a stress response. Keywords: comparative gene expression profile
