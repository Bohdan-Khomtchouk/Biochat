TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human adenomas.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out in 7 matched colon adenoma samples and normal mucosa to characterize the molecular mechanisms relevant to the etiology ofadenoma and human colorectal carcinoma development.

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of the 7 matched colon adenoma samples and normal mucosas.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
