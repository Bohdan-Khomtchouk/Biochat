TITLE
Expression data from high-fat diet feeded WT and LIGHT Tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
effect of over-expression LIGHT on T cells for the liver gene expression We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying WT and LIGHT Tg liver Keywords: genetic difference

DESIGN
mice were selected at 4-8 wks old after 2 weeks HFD feeding for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The total liver were used.
