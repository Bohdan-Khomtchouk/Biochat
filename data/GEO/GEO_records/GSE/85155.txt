TITLE
DHX9 suppresses spurious RNA processing defects originating from the Alu invasion of the human genome [uvCLAP CLIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transposable elements increase genetic diversity thus making them an important part of evolution and gene regulation in all organisms that carry these sequences. Bulk of our nascent transcriptome is comprised of transposable elements that have the propensity to form strong secondary structures. It is essential to resolve such strong secondary structures to maintain normal cellular function. Here, we show that the major nuclear RNA helicase DHX9/RHA interacts and remodels embedded Alu retrotransposable elements in the human transcriptome and B1 retrotransposable elements in the mouse transcriptome. To understand the function of DHX9 we used uvCLAP (UV crosslinking and affinity purification) to identify the in-vivo targets of human and mouse DHX9 and its drosophila ortholog MLE.

DESIGN
UV crosslinking and affinity purification (uvCLAP) for 16 proteins in 3 organisms.
