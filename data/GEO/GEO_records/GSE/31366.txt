TITLE
Responses to multi-inhibitors in industrial stain of yeast and the adapted strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Furfural, phenol and acetic acid, generated during the cellulosic material pretreatment, are the representative inhbitors to yeast used for ethanol production. The responses to multi-inhbitors in industrial yeast and the tolerant strain were analyzed. We analyzed the transcriptome of the parental and tolerant strains in the presence of multi-inhibitors.
