TITLE
Responses to multi-inhibitors in industrial stain of yeast and the adapted strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Furfural, phenol and acetic acid, generated during the cellulosic material pretreatment, are the representative inhbitors to yeast used for ethanol production. The responses to multi-inhbitors in industrial yeast and the tolerant strain were analyzed. We analyzed the transcriptome of the parental and tolerant strains in the presence of multi-inhibitors.

DESIGN
Parental and tolerant strains were collected at the exponential stage in the presence of multi-inhibitors. The reference samples for industrial yeast and adapted strains were collected at the same growth stage in the absence of inhibitors.
