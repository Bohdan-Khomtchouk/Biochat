TITLE
Identification of odorant receptors activated by odorants in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Odorants are thought to activate sets of odorant receptors in vivo, but capturing sets of responsive receptors in vivo has never been accomplished. GeneChip microarrays were used to identify the odorant receptor mRNAs enriched in samples from activated olfactory neurons

DESIGN
olfactory neurons, which each express only one odorant receptor allele, marked by an activity reporter after odorant stimulation were captured by FACS; these samples were hybridized to GeneChip arrays
