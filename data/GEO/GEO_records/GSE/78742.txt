TITLE
Expression data from Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell SUNE1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of FOXO1 on miRNAs in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we used miRNA chip on SUNE1 cells after FOXO1 overexpression. This analysis identified 82 miRNAs which were markedly dysregulated in FOXO1 overexpressing cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA (6â€“7 mg) was isolated from FOXO1-overexpressing and control SUNE1 cells and Micro RNA Array was used to search the differential expression miRNAs
