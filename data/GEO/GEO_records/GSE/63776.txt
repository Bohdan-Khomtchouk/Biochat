TITLE
Altering cancer transcriptomes using epigenomic inhibitors [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have compared the genome-wide effects on the transcriptome after treatment with ICG-001 (the specific CBP inhibitor) versus C646, a compound that competes with acetyl-coA for the Lys-coA binding pocket of both CBP and p300. We found that both drugs cause large-scale changes in the transcriptome of HCT116 colon cancer cells and PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells, and reverse some tumor-specific changes in gene expression. Interestingly, although the epigenetic inhibitors affect cell cycle pathways in both the colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, the WNT signaling pathway was affected only in the colon cancer cells. Notably, WNT target genes were similarly down-regulated after treatment of HCT116 with C646 as with ICG-001.

DESIGN
To identify genes affected by direct targeting of a component of the transcriptional complex implicated in WNT regulation, we used siRNAs to knockdown TCF7L2 in PANC1 cells. Cells were treated with control siRNAs or siRNAs specific for TCF7L2 and RNA was analyzed by RNA-seq.
