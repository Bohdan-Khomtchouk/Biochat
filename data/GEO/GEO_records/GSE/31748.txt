TITLE
Carbon Source Induced Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E (ActE) when grown on different carbon sources.  The results of this study demonstrate that ActE upregulates a small number of genes specific for the utilization of the avaliable carbon source. Cellulolytic Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E (ActE), isolated from the pinewood-boring wasp Sirex noctilio, has a genome enriched for biomass utilization. The secreted proteomes obtained from growth on pure polysaccharides catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose, mannan, and xylan with specific activities comparable to Spezyme CP, a commercial cellulase preparation. During reaction of an ActE secretome with cellulose, reducing sugar release was markedly stimulated in the presence of O2. ActE also expresses and secretes an expanded repertoire of enzymes during growth on natural and pre-treated biomass. These results indicate a new microbial contribution to biomass utilization that is widely distributed in natural environments by insects

DESIGN
Streptomyces sp. ActE was grown in minimal medium supplimented with 0.5% carbon source (glucose, sigmacell-20, xylan, chitin, cellobiose, or AFEX).  Cells were grown for 7 days and total RNA was extracted from the cell pellet.  At least 3 biological replicates were performed for each carbon source (glucose, 3; sigmacell, 3; xylan, 5; chitin, 3; cellobiose 3; AFEX 3).  Each biological replicate contained 3 technical replicates. The complete dataset were RMA Background Corrected, quantile normalized, the RMA algorithm was utilized by DNAStar ArrayStar.
