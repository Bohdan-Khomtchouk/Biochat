TITLE
ChIP-chip analysis of GBF1 in the presence and absence of its heterodimerizing partners, HY5 and HYH

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcription factors are key components of light signalling as they amplify the signal, which results in massive changes in genome-wide expression during photomorphogenesis. Three bZIP transcription factors (TFs), namely GBF1, HY5, and HYH, form heterodimers with each other and regulate photomorphogenesis in an interdependent manner. GBF1 acts as both a positive and negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, whereas HY5 and HYH mainly act as positive regulators of photomorphogenesis. In this study, the impact of heterodimerization of GBF1 with HY5 and HYH was analyzed for genome-wide binding of GBF1 through ChIP-chip in GBF1. We identified more than 2000 direct targets of GBF1 in the presence of HY5 and HYH. However, in the absence of HY5, very few binding sites were found, and in the absence of functional HYH protein, the number of GBF1 direct targets reduced to only half compared to when functional HYH was present.

DESIGN
ChIPed DNA with GBF1 antibody from GBF1OE, hy5 GBF1OE, and hyh GBF1OE lines vs. ChIPed DNA with GBF1 antibody from wild-type.
