TITLE
Data expression of  young and senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of hMSC in late passages was compared to hMSC in early passages. Both hMSC were obtained from the umbilical vein of three donors, two of hMSC have a normal karyotype (MSC/n) and another has a constitutional paracentric chromosomal inversion (hMSC/inv).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and marked with the GeneChip ® 3 'IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix Inc.). Subsequently, the fragmented aRNA was hybridized on the microarranjo Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). The statistical analysis of differential gene expression was performed to each groups hMSC senescent vs young by the Partek Genomic Suite software, version 6.4 (Partek Inc.). Was considered statistically significant differences in expression to p-value Bonferroni correction  ˂.01. Only signals with fold change ˃ 3.0 were included in the list of differentially expressed. Differences in gene expression data obtained from microarrays were confirmed by Real Time RT-PCR.
