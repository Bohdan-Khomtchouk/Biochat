TITLE
Generation of neural crest cells by direct lineage conversion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural crest cells (NC cells) are multipotent cells that emerge from the dorsal region of a fusing neural tube and migrate throughout the developing embryo. Due to their multipotency and divergent roles during embryogenesis, the generation and differentiation of NC cells should be elucidated in more detail. However, difficulties have been associated with isolating and manipulating NC cells for investigation because a limited number of NC cells are generated in a short period of embryogenesis. To overcome this issue, we attempted to directly convert mouse fibroblasts into NC cells using transcription factors specifically expressed in NC cells. We analyzed the molecular profiles of NC cells and neural tube cells in 9.5-day mouse embryos, and identified the transcription factors that were strongly expressed in NC cells. Among these transcription factors, Sox10 together with c-Myc and Klf4 directly converted mouse fibroblasts into NC cells. The converted NC cells differentiated into neurons, glial cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and osteoblasts, exhibiting differentiation abilities similar to those of in vivo NC cells. They also displayed a self-renewal ability while maintaining their differentiation ability. In in ovo transplantation, the converted NC cells migrated along NC cell migration pathways. Therefore, directly converted NC cells can contribute to the progression of NC cell studies.

DESIGN
3 samples, duplicated. Sox10-positive cells were compared with Sox1-positive cells and/or whole embryo (control).
