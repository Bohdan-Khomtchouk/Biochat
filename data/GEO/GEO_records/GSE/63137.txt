TITLE
Epigenomic Signatures of Neuronal Diversity in the Mammalian Brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed an affinity purification approach to isolate tagged nuclei in mice (similar to INTACT; [Deal R.B. and Henikoff S. A simple method for gene expression and chromatin profiling of individual cell types within a tissue. Dev. Cell 18,1030-1040. (2010)]) and used it to characterize genome-wide patterns of transcription, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility in 3 major neuron classes of the neocortex (excitatory pyramidal neurons, parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive GABAergic interneurons). By combining cell purification and integrative analysis, our findings relate the phenotypic and functional complexity of neocortical neurons to their underlying transcriptional and epigenetic diversity.
