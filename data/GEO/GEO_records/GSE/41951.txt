TITLE
Gene expression profile of the human leukemia cell line Reh after treatment with bortezomib, valproic acid or a combination of both.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
New therapy options are required for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL patients in order to improve survival and reduce adverse acute and late effects. We observed a synergistic anti-leukemic activity of concomitant treatment with bortezomib and valproic acid in BCP-ALL cells.  In this experiment we aimed to identify the pathways modulated after concomitant treatment with bortezomib and valproic acid.

DESIGN
Reh cells treated with either bortezomib, valproic acid, or the combination of both normalized to a untreated control.
