TITLE
Influence of Nod Factors on early developmental stages of root development in Medicago truncatula

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We would like to know how symbiotic molecules such as Nod Factors (NF) influence lateral root (LR) development in M. truncatula. We have preliminary evidence that this action is through early stages of root development. Auxin is the major phytohormone controlling LR development and we also have evidence that NF interfere with auxin for the control of LR development. This transcriptomic study aims at finding new molecular targets that would be responsive to auxin and NF treatment, even at a higher level by the combination of both auxin and NF. Such targets could be involved in the control or early development stages of LR that would be controlled both by auxin and NF treatment. - 2 day old M. truncatula (accession A17) plantlets grown on M medium were transferred for 2 days on M medium+ 10-5M NPA (1-N-Naphthylphthalamic acid, auxin transport inhibitor) then transferred for 10 h on M medium containing 10-6 M NAA (naphthalene-1-acetic acid, permeant auxin analog) or 10-7 M Nod factors (NF) or a combination of both (10-6 M NAA + 10-7 M NF). These are compared to mock treated (solvent only) plants.
