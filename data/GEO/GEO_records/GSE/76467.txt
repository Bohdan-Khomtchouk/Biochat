TITLE
Histone H3 Lysine 27 methylation Regulates Skeletal Growth by Suppressing Wnt and TGF-Î² Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) controls maintenance and lineage determination of stem cells by suppressing genes that regulate cellular differentiation and tissue development.  However, the role of PRC2 in lineage-committed somatic cells is largely unknown.  In this study, we ablated Eed, an essential component of PRC2, in growth plate chondrocytes to study the role of PRC2 in skeletal development. In this study, we profiled genes assocaited with H3K27me3 histone 3 modification in primary rib chondrocytes.

DESIGN
Mouse primary chodnrocytes were subjected to ChIP analysis using H3K27me3 antibody.  ChIP'ed DNA and Input DNA were sequenced by Otogenetics (Necros, GA)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
