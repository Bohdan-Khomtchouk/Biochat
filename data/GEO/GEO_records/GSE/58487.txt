TITLE
The microRNA-200 family regulates pancreatic beta-cell survival in type 2 diabetes (Min6 cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microRNAs miR-141 and -200c were co-overexpressed in the Min6 beta-cell line, which caused pro-apoptotic gene expression and subsquently apoptosis. We used Affymetrix Chip analysis to address which genes are regulated upon miR-200-overexpression to define target genes of miR-200 and pro-apoptotic genes upregulated by miR-200 to induce apoptosis.

DESIGN
Min6 cells were infected with a control Adenovirus or Adenovirus overexpression miR-141/200c. Cells were harvested with Trizol and RNA extraction was performed. RNA from n=3 wells was pooled for each condition and subjected to Affymetrix chip analysis
