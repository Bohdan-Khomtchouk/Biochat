TITLE
Lateral ventricle SVZ: 3xTg vs WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the microdissected SVZ from 7-month-old mice Adult neurogenesis is suppressed in the SVZ of 3xTg mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of this suppression, the goals of this experiment were to compare the transcriptional profiles of the SVZ neural stem cell niche in 3xTg-AD mice versus strain controls. We used early middle-aged mice (7-months-old) rather than old mice, in order to identify genetic changes that are not caused secondarily to other degenerative changes occurring in these mice.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 3xTg vs WT SVZ. Biological replicates: 4 for each.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
