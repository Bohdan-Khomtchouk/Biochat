TITLE
The effects of Lactobacillus plantarum and E. coli on Caco2 human colonocytes genes expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined Caco-2 cell gene expression after infection with E. coli (Ec), Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and the combination of the two (mix) Keywords: Lactobacillus plantarum and E. coli influences on Caco2 cells gene expression

DESIGN
Cells were washed in PBS and re-fed with experimental DMEM without serum or antibiotics before the experiments.  Caco-2 cells were infected with E. coli (10 9 CFU/ml at 1:10 multiplicity ratio), and/or L. plantarum (1010 CFU/ml, 1:100 multiplicity ratio), and incubated for 2 hr
