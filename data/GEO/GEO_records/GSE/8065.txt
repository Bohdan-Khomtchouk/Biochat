TITLE
Gene expression during early postnatal development of the small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It was the purpose to analyse the changes in gene expression which occur in the mouse small intestine from the pre-weaning to the post-weaning stage. The gene expression was accordingly followed from postnatal day 4 to postnatal day 32. Keywords: Time-course

DESIGN
6 time-points were defined corresponding to postnatal day 4, 7, 9, 11, 24 and 32. Ileal samples were taken from individual mice at each time-point. All layers of the small intestine were included in the sample. Three samples from individual mice were analysed by hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips.
