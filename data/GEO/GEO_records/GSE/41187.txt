TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of FNR and σ70 in E. coli under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655star

SUMMARY
We found many binding sites for FNR under glucose fermentative anaerobic growth conditions. Also, many binding sites were identified for σ70  under both aerobic and anaerobic growthin conditions. Descirbed in the manuscript " Genome-scale Analysis of E. coli FNR Reveals the Complexity of Bacterial Regulon Structure "

DESIGN
Examination of occupancy of FNR adn σ70 under aerobic and anaerobic growth in conditions.

PLATFORM
