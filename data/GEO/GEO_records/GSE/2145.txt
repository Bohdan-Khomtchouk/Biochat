TITLE
30% O2 vs PS 10W/m2

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
Comparison of wild-type (2.4.1) R. sphaeroides gene expression in 30% O2 aerobic respiration vs. photosynthesis 10W/m2 light, to identify candidate photosynthesis genes. RNA preparation:  pellet cells from exponential phase cultures using 5% phenol in ethanol stop solution; lysozyme + SDS to lyse; phenol/chloroform extraction + DNase treatment + RNeasy kit clean up.  Manuscript in preparation. The below normalized data was generated using GeneSpring software with the following settings: A data: Data Transformation: set all values less than 0.01 to 0.01 Per Chip: normalize to 50th percentile, and then Per Gene: normalize to median B data: Data Transformation: set all values less than 0.01 to 0.01 Per Chip: normalize to 50th percentile Values from independent replicates were averaged Keywords = Rhodobacter sphaeroides Keywords = photosynthesis Keywords = purple bacteria Keywords: other
