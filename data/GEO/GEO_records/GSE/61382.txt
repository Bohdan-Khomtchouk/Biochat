TITLE
Identifying actionable targets through integrative analyses of GEM model and human prostate cancer profiling [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we prolife prostate cancers derived from GEM models of prostate cancer representative of human prostate cancer

DESIGN
Total DNA was isolated from established prostate cancers in 4 GEM models of prostate cancer - PB-MYC, Pten-/-, Pten-/- p53-/-, Pten-/- Rosa26-ERG, and 3 cell lines derived from GEM models including CaP8, MYC CaP, and MPC3 and normalized to wild-type prostate of litter-mate mice of same genetic background strain
