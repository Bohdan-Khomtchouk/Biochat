TITLE
Gene expression profile after injection of recombinant deleted non-virion protein gene (NV) VHSV

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The function of the non-virion protein (NV) of the Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has been long questioned but it still remains unknown. We report here the differences in gene expression profiles of trouts infected with deleted NV VHSV or wild type VHSV so that it could shed some light on the issue.

DESIGN
Eight fingerlings of rainbow trout were used for the experiment. Four of them were injected with deleted NV VHSV and the rest were injected with wild type VHSV as a control. Head kidney and spleen of each trout were collected 2 days post-injection and total RNA was extracted.
