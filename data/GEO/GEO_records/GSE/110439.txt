TITLE
Study of the function of COX17 by transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana cox17-2 mutant plants with COX17-1 silenced by amiRNA (amiCOX17-1/cox17-2 plants)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
COX17 is a soluble protein from the mitochondrial intermembrane space that participates in the transfer of copper for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly in eukaryotic organisms. The function of both Arabidopsis thaliana AtCOX17 genes were studied using plants with altered expression levels of these genes. Silencing of AtCOX17-1 in a cox17-2 knockout background generates plants with smaller rosettes and decreased expression of genes involved in the response of plants to different stress conditions, including several genes that are induced by mitochondrial dysfunctions. These results together with other experiments indicate that AtCOX17 is required for optimal expression of a group of stress-responsive genes, probably as a component of signalling pathways that link stress conditions to gene expression responses.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. Silenced Plants. Biological replicates: 2 control, 2 silenced.
