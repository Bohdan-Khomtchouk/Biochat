TITLE
Dexamethasone stimulated gene expression in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome gene expression data (baseline and following GR-stimulation with 1.5 mg dexamethasone p.o.) were analysed to identify glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
A Dexamethasone Suppression Test was performed in 297 subjects. Baseline and stimulated (3 hours after 1.5 mg dexamethasone p.o.) whole blood samples were analyzed using Illumina Human HT-12 v3 and v4 arrays.
