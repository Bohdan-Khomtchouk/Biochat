TITLE
Drop-Seq analysis of ERCC spike in capture

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
A bead supsension and a solution of ERCC spike-ins at a concentration of ~100,000 molecules per droplet was used in Drop-Seq, a novel technology for high-throughput single cell mRNAseq

DESIGN
An estimated 84 beads were selected for amplification.
