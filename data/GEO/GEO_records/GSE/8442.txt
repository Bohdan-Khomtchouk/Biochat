TITLE
Profiling of Angiotensin II Rapid Response Genes in Human, Bovine, and Rat Adrenocortical Cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Bos taurus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II (Ang-II) regulates adrenal steroid production and gene transcription through several signaling pathways. Changes in gene transcription occur within minutes after Ang-II stimulation, causing an acute increase in aldosterone production and subsequent increase in the overall capacity to produce aldosterone. Our goal was to compare the Ang-II regulation of early gene expression and confirm the upregulation of selected genes using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) across three species: human, bovine, and rat. Keywords: species comparison, adrenal glomerulosa, microarray, angiotensin II

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed using samples from control and Ang-II-(10 nM) treated (1 hour) cells from human adrenocortical tumor cell line H295-R, and primary adrenal glomerulosa cells from bovine and rat, applied respectively to human HG-133 + 2 , bovine, and rat 230-2 Affymetrix chips. qPCR was performed to confirm upregulation of selected genes using mRNA. Dye Swap was not used. Human samples (H295R) include 3 replicates of Basal (controls) and 3 repeats of Angiotensin II samples. Human H295R cells include also a group of cycloheximide (protein synthesis blocker) and angiontensin II + cycloheximide in order to check if the genes were direct targets of angiotensin II.
