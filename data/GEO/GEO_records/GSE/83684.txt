TITLE
Ribosome Profiling analysis of Follicular B (FoB) cells purified from WT, miR-17~92 transgenic and  miR-17-92 tKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated a miR-17~92 transgene and fl/fl allele whose expression can be turned on and off conditionally by Cre recombinase. The mice were crossed to CD19-Cre mice to turn on and off the expression of miR-17~92 specifically in B cells and stimulated LPS/IL-4 for 25.5hr. tKO mice were generated in the miR-106a-363-/-;miR-106b-25-/- background, so that all three homologous cluster of miR-17~92 family miRNAs are deleted in B cells.

DESIGN
Follicular B(FoB) cells were purified from CD19-Cre;miR-17~92 fl/fl;miR-106a-363;miR-106b~25 mice (tKO1, tKO2, tKO3), WT (WT1, WT2, WT3) and transgenic (TG2, TG2, TG3) mice by MACS depletion of cells positive for CD9, CD43, and CD93 (also known as AA4.1). The purified B cells were stimulated with LPS/IL-4 for 25.5hr in B cell media.
