TITLE
Lignocellulose-induced regulation of Phanaerochaete chrysosporium genes

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP-78

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on ball-milled aspen or ball-milled pine were analyzed. Array design based on the DoE's Joint Genome Institute's v2.1 annotation. Goal is to define genes involved in lignocellulose degradation.
