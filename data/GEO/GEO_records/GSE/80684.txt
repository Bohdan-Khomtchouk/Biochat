TITLE
Heritability and Reversibility of DNA Methylation Induced by in vitro Grafting between Brassica juncea and B. oleracea

ORGANISM
Brassica juncea ; Brassica juncea x Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
We found that compared with the expression of siRNAs in leaves of TTT, 3284, 4789, and 6208 unique siRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and 3420, 3850, and 4245 unique siRNAs were significantly down-regulated in GS1, GS3, and GS5, respectively through the high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing were performed in tuber mustard (TTT) and selfed progenies GS1, GS3, GS5 (GS=grafting-selfing, n=generations) of TTC [LI-LII-LIII, LI=outer layer of shoot apical meristem (SAM), LII=middle layer, LIII=inner layer, T=tuber mustard, C=red cabbage] was created by in vitro grafting between tuber mustard and red cabbage. Two biological replicates per sample combined 3 plants each
