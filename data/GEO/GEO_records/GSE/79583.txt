TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and dek35 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dek35 mutant influence the expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation associated genes. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of mitochondrial complexes assembly proteins, translational elongation factors and genes associated with other biological processes.

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 18DAP wild type (WT) and dek35 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
