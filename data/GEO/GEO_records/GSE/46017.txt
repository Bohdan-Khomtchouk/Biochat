TITLE
Transcriptional response to Smarcb1 re-expression in murine derived Smarcb1 deficient p53 null tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SMARCB1 (Snf5/Ini1/Baf47) is a potent tumor suppressor, the loss of which serves as the diagnostic feature in Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors (MRT) and Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors (AT/RT), two highly aggressive forms of pediatric neoplasms. Here, we restore Smarcb1 expression in cells derived from Smarcb1-deficient tumors which developed in Smarcb1-heterozygous p53-/- mice. Profiling Smarcb1 dependent gene expression we find genes which are dependent on Smarcb1 expression to be enriched for ECM and cell adhesion functions. We identify Igfbp7, which is related to the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins family, as a downstream target of Smarcb1 transcriptional activity, and show that re-introduction of Igfbp7 alone can hinder tumor development.

DESIGN
Two cancer cell lines, 167 and 365, derived from Smarcb1-deficient tumors which developed in Smarcb1-heterozygous p53-/- mice were re-infected with a retro-viral vector for Smarcb1 re-expression or an empty retro-viral vector as control. Total-RNA was collected 3 days post infection so as to enrich for direct targets of Smarcb1 transcriptionaly regulated genes
