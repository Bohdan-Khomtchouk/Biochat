TITLE
Comparison of microarray to RT-PCR

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
mRNA used for the analysis of these microarrays were previously analyzed for 34 genes by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction in Desai BJ et al., J.Orthop.Trauma 17: 689-698, 2003.  These two data sets were subsequently studied to compare the results from these two different methods for mRNA quantitation.  The comparison was publised in " Comparison of mRNA gene expression by RT-PCR and DNA microarray " by W. Etienne, M.H. Meyer, J. Peppers, and R.A. Meyer, Jr., BioTechniques 36 (4): 618-626, April 2004. Keywords = rat Keywords = fracture Keywords = age Keywords = time Keywords = femur Keywords = RT-PCR Keywords: time-course
