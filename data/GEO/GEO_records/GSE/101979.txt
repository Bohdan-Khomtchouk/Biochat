TITLE
Expression data from CHRNA5 knockdown A549 lung cancer cells compared with control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nicotine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are considred to be involved in the progression of lung carcinomas. α5-nAChR is believed to be associated with lung cancer risk and onset, however its function and physiologic roles is far from clear. We use microarry to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying knockdown CHRNA5, encoding α5-nAChR, in human lung cancer A549 cells compared with control.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from lung cancer cells transfected with scrambled siRNA or α5-nAChR -specific siRNA (3 replicates each).RNA samples were analyzed by microarray expression profiling using the Affymetrix array. We sought to obtain gene profiling coupled with functional pathway analysis
