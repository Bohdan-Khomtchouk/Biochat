TITLE
CovR-regulated genes in Streptococcus mutans strain UA159

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify subsets of the genes, which are up-regulated and down-regulated by CovR regulator in UA159 strain.

DESIGN
Two independently isolated RNA samples from each of the wild-type UA159 strain and its covR mutant strain grown until mid-exponential phase were analyzed. Each sample was hybridized with 5 blocks of NimbleGen arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL8671 Streptococcus mutans strain UA159 9.8K whole-genome array
