TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the cell death induced by heat stress in DNA-PK-knockdown human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study is to investigate the role of DNA-PK inhibition in cell death induced by heat stress (44°C, 60 min). Comparative gene expression analysis was performed with mock cells, negative control siRNA-treated cells and DNA-PK siRNA-treated cells. The expression of DNA-PK was confirmed by Western blotting. Gene expression was analyzed using GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools.

DESIGN
DNA-PK-knockdown human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were treated with heat (44°C, 60 min) and then were cultured at 37°C for 6 h. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer's instructions.
