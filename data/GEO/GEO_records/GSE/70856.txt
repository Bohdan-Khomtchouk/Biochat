TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis for validation of miRNAs expressed during osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs versus healthy donors MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total small RNA was isolated from BM-MSCs obtained from OA diagnosed patients (n=10) and non-OA (n=10 after osteogenic induction for 1, 10 and 21 days. miRNAs, were initially screened and those with consistent differential expression were selected for further validation by qRT-PCR analysis.

DESIGN
From an initial screening of 246 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change ≥± 2, P ≤0.05) between OA and non-OA BM-MSC samples 21 were selected and validated by qRT-PCR
