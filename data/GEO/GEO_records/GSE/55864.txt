TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of copy number variations in Chinese sheep using array comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
CNVs have been recognized as a very important source of genetic variability.Some CNVs have been shown to play an important role in gene expression and impact phenotypes. The aCGH experiment was used to obtain a sheep map of CNVs based on the ovine genome.

DESIGN
comparison of Kazakh sheep, two Mongolian sheep, Tibetan sheep, Hu sheep against Dorper sheep reference

PLATFORM
GPL18417 NimbleGen Sheep CGH 3x1.4M Whole-Genome Tiling Array [121109_Sheep_oviAri1_WG_SW_CGH]
