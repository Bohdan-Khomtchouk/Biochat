SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x deltoides) leaves to methyl jasmonate treatment over a 24 hour time course.  Experiments were conducted using clonal trees under greenhouse conditions at the University of British Columbia.  We used the 15.5K poplar cDNA microarray platform previously described by Ralph et al. (Molecular Ecology 2006, 15:1275-1297).  Differentially expressed genes were determined using three criteria: fold-change between methyl jasmonate-treated and tween-treated control leaves > 1.5-fold, P value < 0.05 and Q value < 0.05.  This study identified > 1,000 differentially expressed genes in response to methyl jasmonate treatment.

DESIGN
A factorial hybridization design was chosen to assess gene expression between tween-treated control leaves, and leaves subjected to methyl jasmonate treatment.  For each tree, all but the lowest five mature leaves were covered with a light-weight plastic bag and then sprayed with either methyl jasmonate or tween, the solvent control.  Leaves were harvested 2, 6 or 24 hours after the initiation of each treatment and total RNA was individually isolated from each tree.  For each treatment and time point, equal amounts of total RNA were combined from each of the five biological replicate trees prior to cDNA microarray analysis.  A total of 18 hybridizations were performed to directly compare total RNA from methyl jasmonate-treated and tween-treated control leaves at each time point, as well as among methyl jasmonate-treated leaves across time points, with dye balance.
