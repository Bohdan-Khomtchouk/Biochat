TITLE
mRNA expression after knockdowwn of UICLM in SW620 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to identify the disregulated mRNAs after knockdown of UICLM (up-regulated in colorectal cancer liver metastasis, accession number: NR_033841) in SW620 cells. A total of 188 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed after knockdown of UICLM in SW620 cells

DESIGN
SW620 cells (control) or SW620 cells knockdown of UICLM (siRNA) were subjected to microarray to select differentially expressed mRNAs

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
