TITLE
Transcriptome effects of silencing a MAPK (SIPK) in tobacco

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Wildtype and SIPK -silenced (RNAi) tobacco cell suspension cultures were grown in MS medium at 25 C in the dark. Cell suspension cultures were transferred to fresh growth medium 3 days prior to pooling each genotype and dividing the pool into 3 x 10ml volumes per genotype. A 30 minute pre-incubation was used with xanthine (for abiotic controls and treatments), but no pre-treatment was used for the biotic stressors. For each treatment and abiotic/biotic controls, the cells were harvested by vacuum filtration at the appropriate time points (controls sampled at 0 hrs) and frozen in N2(l) for RNA extraction. In order to discern the effect of silencing SIPK on the transciptome in defence response, biological replicates of WT and SIPK-Ri were randomly paired on 3 slides per treatment or control group.
