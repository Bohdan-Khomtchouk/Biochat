TITLE
Gene expression profiles of individual blastomeres of early Ciona embryos

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression profiles of individual blastomeres of early Ciona embryos using microarrays.

DESIGN
We examined gene expression profiles of individual blastomeres of the 8-cell, 16-cell and 32-cell embryos by dissecting with a fine glass needle. We also examined gene expression profiles of unfertilized eggs and embryos from the 1- to 32-cell stages.
