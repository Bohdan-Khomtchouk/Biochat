TITLE
Gene expression from human prefrontal cortex (BA10)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the oligonucleotide microarray analysis in bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, and control subjects using postmortem prefrontal cortices provided by the Stanley Foundation Brain Collection. By comparing the gene expression profiles of similar but distinctive mental disorders, we explored the uniqueness of bipolar disorder and its similarity to other mental disorders at the molecular level. Notably, most of the altered gene expressions in each disease were not shared by one another, suggesting the molecular distinctiveness of these mental disorders. We found a tendency of downregulation of the genes encoding receptor, channels or transporters, and upregulation of the genes encoding stress response proteins or molecular chaperons in bipolar disorder. Altered expressions in bipolar disorder shared by other mental disorders mainly consisted of upregulation of the genes encoding proteins for transcription or translation. The genes identified in this study would be useful for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, as well as the common pathophysiological background in major mental disorders at the molecular level.
