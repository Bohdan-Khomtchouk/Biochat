TITLE
Regulation of FAS Exon Definition and Apoptosis by the Ewing Sarcoma Protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Ewing’s sarcoma protein EWS belongs to the TET family (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) of RNA and DNA binding proteins, implicated in DNA transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and maintenance of genomic integrity. Translocations of these genes are characteristic of particular neoplasias, including Ewing’s sarcoma. To identify physiological RNA targets of EWS, we performed in vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (HITS-CLIP/CLIP-Seq) in HeLa cells. Sequencing identified EWS binding sites characterized by guanosine-rich motifs in nearly 9000 genes, with particular enrichment in exonic regions near 5’ splice sites. Exon 6 of the Fas/CD95 receptor, which is alternatively spliced to generate isoforms with opposing activities in programmed cell death, was found as a prominent EWS CLIP target, as well as by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and functional analysis. Manipulation of EWS levels and mutation of EWS binding sites led to changes in alternative splicing consistent with EWS promoting exon 6 inclusion and leading to the synthesis of the pro-apoptotic Fas/CD95 isoform. Biochemical characterization of factors associated with FAS exon 6 are consistent with the notion that EWS binds to exonic sequences near the 5’ splice site and promotes the recruitment of U1snRNP, favoring also recognition of the upstream 3' splice site by U2AF and thus exon definition.  Consistent with a role for EWS in the regulation of programmed cell death, cells depleted of EWS show decreased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. We discuss the potential implications of this novel function of EWS in Ewing’s sarcoma.
