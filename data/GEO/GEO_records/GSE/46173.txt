TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of non-transgenic and OsEREBP1 over-expressed transgenic plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Overexpression of a transcription factor OsEREBP1 results in attenuation of disease symptoms upon infection with bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and tolerance to drought stress in transgenic rice plants. Microarray analysis was performed to identify genes regulated by the rice transcription factor OsERBP1.

DESIGN
Three independent replicates of the experimental OsEREBP1-ox transgenic plants and the control non-transgenic Kitaake plants were grown under normal conditions.

PLATFORM
