TITLE
Transcriptome drift of FADU after expression of HIF-1a, Twist1 or Bmi1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of HIF-1a or Twist1 or Bmi1 in human hypopharyngeal cancer cell line FADU results in the drift of transcriptome profile from an epithelial cell-like signature to a mesenchymal stem cell-like signature.
