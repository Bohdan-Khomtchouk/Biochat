TITLE
Transcriptome drift of FADU after expression of HIF-1a, Twist1 or Bmi1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of HIF-1a or Twist1 or Bmi1 in human hypopharyngeal cancer cell line FADU results in the drift of transcriptome profile from an epithelial cell-like signature to a mesenchymal stem cell-like signature.

DESIGN
Stable transfection of pHA-HIF1a(dODD), pFLAG-Twist1 or pcDNA3-Bmi1 in FADU cell and analyzed the transcriptome by cDNA microarray. FADU transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector was used as a control of experiment.
