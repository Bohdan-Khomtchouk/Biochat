TITLE
Expression data from Xenopus embryos treated with TTNPB (RAR-agonist), AGN193109 (RAR-antagonist), or Control Vehicle

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Percellome analysis of whole Xenopus embryos at developmental stage 18

DESIGN
Xenopus embryos were treated with TTNPB (RAR-agonist), AGN193109 (RAR-antagonist), or Control Vehicle at Nieuwkoop and Faber Stage 7.  Embryos were collected at stage 18, followed by RNA extraction, hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, and Percellome analysis.
