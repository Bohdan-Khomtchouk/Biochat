TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Ischemic Stroke at 0-24 hours and 24-48 hours after known onset of symptoms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to provide insight to the molecular mechanisms chaging in the peripheral blood after acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome.

DESIGN
Peripheral whole blood samples were collected from N=34 MRI diagnosed ischemic stroke patients > =18 years of age within 24 hours from known onset of symptom and again at 24-48 hours after onset. RNA was extracted from whole blood stabilized in Paxgene RNA tubes.
