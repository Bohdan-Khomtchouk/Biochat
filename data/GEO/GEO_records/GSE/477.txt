Alternatively activated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Similar to asthma, nematode infections are commonly associated with production of Th2 cytokines and hyporesponsive T cells.  This T cell phenotype has been reported to be induced by IL-4 dependent macrophages termed alternatively activated macrophages (AAM).  Additionally, AAM have been implicated in several pulmonary diseases, including allergic asthma.  This study examines the potential importance of AAM as immune regulatory cells in both infectious and noninfectious disease contexts. Keywords: other
