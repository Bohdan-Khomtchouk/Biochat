TITLE
Large scale analysis of apple development within HIVW apple progeny

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
Based on sensorial analysis, 8 apple genotypes with contrasted fruit texture for mealiness were selected among a progeny. Apple samples were collected at 60 days after flowering (60DAF), 110 days after flowering (110DAF), harvest (Rec), and after 1 or 2 months of cold storage (1M and 2M respectively).

DESIGN
The 8 apple hybrids were analysed in 38 dye-swap made of 4 mealy vs non-mealy pairs (I062 vs V083, W029 vs V034, H097 vs I095, I016 vs H74) for each time point (60DAF, 110DAF, Rec, 1M, 2M) when possible. Biological replicates are fruits from 2 plots (PH and P12).
