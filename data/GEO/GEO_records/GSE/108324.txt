TITLE
Gene expression analysis to find molecular mechanisms underlying the role of miR-342-5p in HER2 breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms behind the miR-342-5p-induced HER2 pathway regulation are not known. Here, we aimed to further investigate the role of miR-342-5p in HER2 driven breast cancer cells. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 hours, and total RNA were run on mRNA arrays.

DESIGN
Two HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines were transiently transfected with miR-342-5p mimic or scrambled negative control miRNA. Transfections were done in three separate biological replicates.
