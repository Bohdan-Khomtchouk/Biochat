TITLE
MRI-localized biopsies reveal subtype-specific differences in molecular and cellular composition at the margins of glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained radiographically-localized biopsies during glioma resection surgeries to sample the tumor core and margins from multiple glioma patients. We also procured fresh, non-neoplastic brain tissue specimens from multiple patients having procedures to relieve epilespy symptoms or to place shunts to treat normal pressure hydrocephalus.  We then used RNA-Seq to compare expression patterns between geographically distinct regions of gliomas and computational deconvolution to estimate cell type-specific expression patterns in different disease subtypes.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis in 39 contrast-enhancing glioma core samples, 36 non-enhancing FLAIR glioma margin samples, and 17 non-neoplastic brain tissue samples.

PLATFORM
