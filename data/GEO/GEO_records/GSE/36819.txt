TITLE
Expression data from BAC transgenic mice overexpressing Glo1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated mice with a transgenic BAC on a B6 background. The BAC contains Glo1, and the transgenic mice were found to overexpress Glo1. We performed a microarray on whole-brain RNA of adult mice to identify differentially expressed genes resulting from Glo1 overexpression.

DESIGN
Wild type (WT) and transgenic (Tg) littermates were used. Mice were adult males, and RNA was extracted from whole brains.
