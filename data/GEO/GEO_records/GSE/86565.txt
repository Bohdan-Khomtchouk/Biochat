Comparing the expression profiles of the genes in response to 17b-estradiol (E2) and lignans (sesamin (SE), enterodiol (ED), enterolactone (EL), matairesinol (MR), pinoresinol (PR)).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, E2- or each lignan-treated vs. control cells. Three biological replicates, independently grown and harvested. Three replicates per array.
