TITLE
Gene expression during metabolism of sugars by Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius

ORGANISM
Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize carbon metabolism and gene regulation in Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius during growth on monosaccharides in an effort to determine whether carbon catabolite repression was active.  Chemostat studies and global transcriptome analysis were used to accomplish this goal.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three sets of triplicate chemostat experiments using Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius ATCC27009/DSM446 growing using xylose and glucose, fructose and glucose or xylose and arabinose.  Each chip measures the expression level of 3,554 genes from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius ATCC27009/DSM446 with seven 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
