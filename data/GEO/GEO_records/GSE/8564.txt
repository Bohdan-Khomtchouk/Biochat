TITLE
Analysis of Aire effects on individual mice of different genetic backgrounds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of aire-deficient and wild-type littermate thymic medullary epithelial cells. This was done in order to determine whether Aire's effects differed among strains, and also among individuals of the same strain. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Individual thymi were digested with collagenase, dispase and DNAse, and meduallary epithelial cells with the phenotype CD45-G8.8+Ly51intMHCclasssIIhi were isolated by FACS.
