TITLE
Gene expression by cyotosolic DNA stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STING molecule has been reported to be important adaptor molecule for cytosolic DNA sensing. We investigated gene expression by cytosolic DNA stimulation using bone marrow derived dendritic cells. We comparared gene expression profile between WT and STING knock out BMDCs after cytosolic DNA stimulation.

DESIGN
We generated BMDCs by culturing in the presence of GM-CSF. BMDCs were stimulated by purified tumor-cell derived DNA using lipofectamine. After 7 hrs incubation, total RNA was isolated using Rneasy kit (Qiagen) and microarray was performed at genomic core facility in university of Chicago
