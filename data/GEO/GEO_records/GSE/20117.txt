TITLE
Gene expression in leaves of a Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross population

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis of whole-genome gene expression in leaves was carried out  in a (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides) X Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree. Genetic variation in gene expression was quantified for 55,793 predicted gene models based on a single probe per gene. Resultant data contributed to the analysis of the genetic architecture of gene expression in leaves of  Populus.
