TITLE
Comparison of gene expression signatures between Cre- KTC organoid organoid and Cre+ KTC organoid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify downstream genes involved in cholangiocarcinoma development by genetic manipulations of Kras, TGFbR2, and CDH1, we cultured the biliary organoid from the extrahepatic bile duct of Cre-negative LSL-KrasG12D;Tgfbr2flox/flox;CDH1flox/flox (KTC) mice, and induced gene recombination using a lentivirus expressing Cre-recombinase (Cre+ KTC organoid) or control lentivirus (Cre- KTC organoid). Then, we compared gene expression signatures between Cre- KTC organoid organoid and Cre+ KTC organoid.

DESIGN
Biliary organoids isolated from KTC mice were infected with Cre-expressing or control lentivirus, and transduced cells were selected using puromycin. Two weeks later, we compared gene expression signatures between Cre- KTC organoid organoid and Cre+ KTC organoid.
