TITLE
Cytoplasmic Accumulation of Incompletely Glycosylated Sex Hormone-binding Globulin (SHBG) Enhances Androgen Action in Proximal Convoluted Tubule Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of androgen-responsive genes that are influenced by the presence of a functional SHBG versus a steroid-binding-deficient SHBG mutant (SHBG S42L) in the cytoplasm of PCT cells. The hypothesis tested in the study was that SHBG enhances androgen action. Results provide important information that intracellular SHBG enhances androgen-dependent stimulation or repression in PCT cells.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted for gene expression profiling from PCT cells expressing wild-type human SHBG or the human SHBG S42L mutant after treatment with testosterone or DHT, and hybridized to Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 expression bead chips. Three replicates each.
