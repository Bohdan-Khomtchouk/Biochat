TITLE
Colonic gene expression data of TIMP1 knock out colitis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increased levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) have been detected in fibrotic strictures in Crohnâ€™s disease. In a murine model of chronic inflammation, fibrosis was associated with an increase in TIMP-1 and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated degradation. We investigated the effect of TIMP-1 deficiency on the colonic gene expression in acute and chronic murine models of colitis, using whole genome gene expression arrays.

DESIGN
Colitis was induced via oral administration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to B6.129S4-Timp1tm1Pds/J knock-out (KO) and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice. Total RNA extracted from snap frozen colon was used to analyze mRNA expression via Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays
