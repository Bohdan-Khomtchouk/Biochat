TITLE
Human RELA haploinsufficiency results in autosomal dominant chronic mucocutaneous ulceration: the transcriptional profile of RelA haploinsufficient patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The treatment of chronic mucocutaneous ulceration is challenging and only some patients respond selectively to inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). TNF-a activates opposing pathways leading to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis as well as NF-kB-dependent cell survival. We investigated the etiology of autosomal dominant mucocutaneous ulceration in a family whose proband was dependent on anti-TNF-a therapy for sustained remission. A heterozygous mutation in RELA (NM_021975: c.559+1G > A), encoding the NF-kB subunit RelA (p65), segregated with the disease phenotype and resulted in RelA haploinsufficiency. The patients’ fibroblasts exhibited increased apoptosis in response to TNF-a, impaired NF-kB activation, and defective expression of NF-B-dependent anti-apoptotic genes. We show that Rela+/- mice have similarly impaired NF-kB activation, develop cutaneous ulceration from TNF-a exposure, and exhibit severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis ameliorated by TNF-a inhibition. These findings demonstrate an essential contribution of biallelic RELA expression in protecting stromal cells from TNF-a-mediated cell death, thus delineating the mechanisms driving the effectiveness of TNF-a inhibition in this disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from human dermal fibroblasts from two patients with RelA haploinsufficiency  (in duplicates) as well as three healthy controls after they were treated with TNF-α for 24 hours and the transcriptional profile of the samples was determined.
