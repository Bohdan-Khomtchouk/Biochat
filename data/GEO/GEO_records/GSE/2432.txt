EBV-Host interaction in nasal NK/T lymphoma and chronic acvtive EBV infection

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Extranodal NK/T-cell, nasal type (hereinafter, nasal T/NK lymphoma), is a distinct clinicopahtologic entity highly associated with EBV.  Among nasal T/NK lymphoma, some cases are developed from the long-lasting EBV infection termed chronic active EBV (CAEBV) infection.The clonal expansion of EB infected T- or NK cell are seen in patients with both nasal T/NK lymphoma and CAEBV infection, suggesting that two diseases might partly share the similar mechanism by which EBV affect host cellular genes. Question has thus arisen why a subset of patients with CAEB infection develop into nasal T/NK lymphoma. This study aimed to investigate the virus-host interaction in EBV-associated lymphoma.
