TITLE
EBV-Host interaction in nasal NK/T lymphoma and chronic acvtive EBV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extranodal NK/T-cell, nasal type (hereinafter, nasal T/NK lymphoma), is a distinct clinicopahtologic entity highly associated with EBV.  Among nasal T/NK lymphoma, some cases are developed from the long-lasting EBV infection termed chronic active EBV (CAEBV) infection.The clonal expansion of EB infected T- or NK cell are seen in patients with both nasal T/NK lymphoma and CAEBV infection, suggesting that two diseases might partly share the similar mechanism by which EBV affect host cellular genes. Question has thus arisen why a subset of patients with CAEB infection develop into nasal T/NK lymphoma. This study aimed to investigate the virus-host interaction in EBV-associated lymphoma. Keywords = nasak NK/T lymphoma Keywords = chronic active EBV infection Keywords: other

DESIGN
For dual color analysis, normal human lymphocyte mRNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA), and utilized as a reference, and then cellular gene expression were compared among SNK/T cells. (1) We first investigated the common molecular signature of SNK/T cells. (2) We next compared the gene expression pattern between two groups, one with cells from NK/T lymphoma and the other from CAEBV infection.
