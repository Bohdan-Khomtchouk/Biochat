TITLE
The gene expression in the skeletal muscle affected by TBP-2/Txnip deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate how TBP-2/Txnip regulates insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle, we performed microarray analyses.

DESIGN
The gene expression in the skeletal muscle from WT, TBP-2-/-, ob/ob, ob/ob TBP-2-/-  at 10 weeks age were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
