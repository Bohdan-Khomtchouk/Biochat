TITLE
Microarray analysis of GFP-SAS cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for Akt1 (siAkt1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of Akt1 markedly inhibited the growth of GFP-SAS cells. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibitory effect by siAkt1 using Affymetrix GeneAtlasTM System.

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix GeneAtlas System, we determined the gene expression profiles of GFP-SAS cells treated with siAkt1 or non-targeting siRNA (siNT).
