TITLE
Identification of a gene expression signature in colorectal adenocarcinoma in comparison with normal mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We showed that a large number of genes were deregulated in colorectal adenocarcinomas in comparison with colorectal normal mucosae.

DESIGN
9 paired tumor-normal colorectal samples were analyzed. We generated a comparison between adenocarcinomas and normal mucosae.
