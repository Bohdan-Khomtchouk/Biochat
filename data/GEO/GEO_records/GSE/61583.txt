TITLE
The effect of Vdr gene ablation in the mouse placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse placenta retrieved at day 18.5pc from vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (Vdr) knockout, heterozygous and wild-type mice. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of vitamin D on placental function.

DESIGN
Vdr heterozygous males and females were mated to generate Vdr knockout, heterozygous and wild-type offspring. At day 18.5pc, mouse placentae were collected and RNA was extracted and assayed on Affymetrix MoGene 2.1 ST arrays to measure the effect of Vdr on global gene expression.
