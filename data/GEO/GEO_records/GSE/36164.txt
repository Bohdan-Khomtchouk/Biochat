TITLE
Differential expression analysis of HFF cells in G0 phase compared to cells in G1 [TileShuffle]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome differential expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide changes occurring at the transition from G0 phase to G1 phase detected. Expression data and fold changes were processed with our new permutation approach TileShuffle variant B.

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set each for HFF cells in G0 phase and cells in G1 phase
