TITLE
Increases in Insulin Sensitivity among Obese Youth are Associated with Gene Expression Changes in Whole Blood.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lifestyle intervention can improve insulin sensitivity in obese youth yet few studies have examined the biological mechanisms underlying improvements. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore biological pathways associated with intervention-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity. Fifteen (7M/8F) overweight/obese (BMI percentile=96.3±1.1) Latino adolescents (15.0±0.9 years) completed a 12-week lifestyle intervention that included weekly nutrition education and 180 minutes of moderate-vigorous exercise per week. Insulin sensitivity, estimated by an oral glucose tolerance test and the Matsuda Index, increased 29.2% post intervention (2.4±0.3 to 3.1±0.3, p=0.01). Global microarray analysis profiling from whole blood was performed to examine changes in gene expression and to explore biological pathways that were significantly changed in response to the intervention. A total of 1,459 probes corresponding to mRNA transcripts (717 up, 742 down) were differentially expressed with a fold change≥1.2 and P < 0.05. Among the genes identified were hexokinase 3 (HK3), ATPase, H+ transporting V0 subunit e2 (ATPV0E), and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), and endothelial cell adhesion molecule  (ESAM). There were 8 pathways identified that met the criteria for significance, including insulin signaling, type 1 diabetes, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Participants that increased insulin sensitivity exhibited five times the number of significant genes altered compared to non-responders (1,144 vs. 230). These findings offer insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying health improvements among high-risk Latino youth. Lifestyle interventions may contribute to improved insulin sensitivity through pathways related to insulin signaling and immune response. Further, genetic factors may mediate response to lifestyle intervention.
