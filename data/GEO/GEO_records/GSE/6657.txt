TITLE
fiber transformation in electric-stimulated culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of day 3 of in vitro cultured FDB fibers subjected to slow-fiber-type pattern of electrial stimulation was compared to that of day 3 control FDB fibers without stimulation, with amplified RNA (cRNA probes). Keywords: cell treatment

DESIGN
3 independent experiments (bilological replicates) of dye-swap design. comparing day 3 of cultured FDB fibers with or without 3 days of slow-type electrical stimulation.

PLATFORM
GPL4712 Schneider MF lab mini microarray of mouse skeletal muscle (all spots)
