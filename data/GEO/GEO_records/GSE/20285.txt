TITLE
Gene profiles induced by overexpression of wild-type and mutant Notch1 variants in MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of a constitutively active Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) in MCF-10A cells was found to induce two distinct types of 3D structures: large, hyperproliferative structures and small, growth-arrested structures with reduced cell-to-matrix adhesion.  These heterogeneous phenotypes reflect differences in Notch pathway activation levels.  High Notch activity caused loss of cell adhesion and inhibition of proliferation, whereas low Notch activity maintained matrix adhesion and provoked a strong hyperproliferative response. In order to gain insight into the dosage-dependent transcriptional events triggered by Notch1 activation, gene expression profiles induced 48 hours after infection of MCF-10A cells with retroviral vectors expressing full-length Notch-1, L1601P+∆P, or NICD were compared.  Full-length Notch-1 induced the weakest effect,  L1601P+∆P induced an intermediate effect and NICD induced the strongest effect.  Results provide insight into the dichotomous activites of Notch during development and tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Twelve samples were harvested 48 h after retroviral infection with either vector control, full-length Notch1, Notch1 L1601P+∆P, or NICD.  Each condition was performed in triplicate.
