TITLE
Expression data from colon cancer specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastases are responsible for more than 90% of cancer deaths. microRNAs are critical regulators during the metastatic process. We used microarrays to identify the microRNAs which are implicated in metastasis.

DESIGN
Colon cancer and surrounding control tissue specimens were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
