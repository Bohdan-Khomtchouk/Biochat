TITLE
Gene expression data of OsGRAS23 overexpression transgenic rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
GRAS transcription factors are plant-specific proteins that play diverse roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses, over-expression of OsGRAS23, a GRAS gene in rice, showed improved drought resistance. To search the downstream genes of OsGRAS23, we performed microarray analysis of the OsGRAS23-overexpressing and wild-type plants under both normal and drought stress conditions using Affymetrix Rice Genome Genechip. 21-day-old plants of the OsGRAS23-overexpressing line OE1 as well as the wild-type plants were used in the drought treatment.

DESIGN
The OsGRAS23 overexpression plants and the wild-type plants were cultured in the culture solution for 21 days. Half of the plants were sampled as the untreated control for RNA isolation, and the others were transferred onto filter papers to induce drought stress. Two biological replicate samples each from the OsGRAS23 overexpression and wild type lines were profiled using rice whole-genome microarrays.
