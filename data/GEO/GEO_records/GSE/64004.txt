TITLE
Expression data from ileum of mice suffered from subchronic and mild social defeat stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to investigate the effects of depression on transcriptome in ileum using a subchronic and mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) model. In addition to exhibiting social deficit and hyperphagia-like behavior, the sCSDS mice keep much more water in their body than control mice. In order to investigate the effect of social defeat stress on not only central nervous system but also function of gastrointestinal tract, the gene expression in ileum of stressed mice was compared with control mice. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression after 10 days of social defeat stress and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
The duration of physical contacts was set at 5 min after the first attack bite at Day 1, and then was reduced 0.5 min per day from Day 2 to Day 10.
