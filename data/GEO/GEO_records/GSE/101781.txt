TITLE
Microarray analyses using bone marrow-derived macrophages from Batf2−/− and wildtype mice that had been stimulated with R848

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed the role of basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 2 (Batf2), particularly its positive transcriptional activities via TLR signals. Because TLR7 agonists are clinically used against tumors and have proven effective as antitumor drugs, we assessed effect of Batf2 on the responses to the TLR7 ligand (R848).

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Batf2-/- and wildtype (WT) mice that had been stimulated with R848 (100 ng/ml).
