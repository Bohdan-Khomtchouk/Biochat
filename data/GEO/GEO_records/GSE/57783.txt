TITLE
Gene expression profiles of TIE2 expressing Monocytes (TEMs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expressing profiles of TIE2 expressing Monocytes(TEMs), we have employed the Agilent lncRNA Gene Expression 4Ã—180K(Design ID:042818) microarray. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in  venous blood from healthy donors were isolated by Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield, Norway). Human monocytes in PBMCs, identified as cells that expressed CD14, were enriched by positive immunomagnetic selection using anti-CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Germany). TEMs (TIE2+CD14+) and TIE2-Monocytes (Tie2-CD14+) were then isolated by FACS-sorting (Aria II, BD Biosciences) using FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 (BD Biosciences, USA) and APC-conjugated anti-TIE2 (R & D System, USA) antibodies.Three TEMs samples together with their paried TIE2-Monocytes were detected.Expressions of sixteen genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern.

DESIGN
The gene expressions of three independent paried TEMs and TIE2- Monocytes samples from different donors were measured.
