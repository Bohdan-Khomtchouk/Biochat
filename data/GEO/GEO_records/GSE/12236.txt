Whole Genome Exon Arrays Identify Differential Expression of Alternatively Spliced, Cancer-related Genes in Lung Cancer

SUMMARY
Alternative processing of pre-mRNA transcripts is a major source of protein diversity in eukaryotes and has been implicated in several disease processes including cancer. In this study we have performed a genome wide analysis of alternative splicing events with the GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array from Affymetrix in lung adenocarcinoma. We found that ~13.3% of the 17800 core Refseq genes appear to have alternative transcripts that are differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma versus normal. According to their known functions the largest subset of these genes (30.8%) is believed to be cancer related. Detailed analysis was performed for several genes using PCR, quantitative RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. We found overexpression of ERG variant 2 but not variant 1 in lung tumors and overexpression of CEACAM1 variant 1 but not variant 2 in lung tumors but not in breast or colon tumors. We also identified a novel, overexpressed variant of CDH3 and verified the overexpression of a novel variant of P16. These findings demonstrate how analysis of alternative pre-mRNA processing can shed additional light on differences between tumors and normal tissues as well as between different tumor types. Such studies may lead to the development of additional tools for tumor diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Keywords: Alternative splice analysis of exon data with ANOVA compared tumor and matched normal
