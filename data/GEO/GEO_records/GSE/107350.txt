TITLE
Identification differentially expressed genes in the mouse testis caused by Prss55 deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Testes from three wt and three Prss55-/- mice were used for gene expression analysis using whole mouse genome 4 × 44 k microarray (Agilent Technologies). A total of 72 genes were identified to be differentially expressed significantly (p < 0.05, fc ≥ 2). Fold changes of ten genes (seven up-regulated genes and three down-regulated genes) were examined by qRT-PCR for data validation.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from testes of wt and Prss55-/- mice (n = 3 each genotype, 6-8 weeks old).
