TITLE
Divergent residues within histone H3 define a unique chromatin structure in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Histones are among the most conserved proteins known, but organismal differences do exist. In this study we examined the contribution that divergent amino acids within histone H3 make to cell growth and chromatin structure in S. cerevisiae. We show that, while amino acids that define histone H3.3 are dispensable for yeast growth, substitution of residues within the histone H3 alpha 3 helix with the human counterparts results in a severe growth defect. Mutations within this domain also result in altered nucleosome positioning, both in vivo and in vitro, which is accompanied by increased preference for nucleosome favoring sequences. These results suggest that divergent amino acids within the histone H3 alpha 3 helix play organismal roles in defining chromatin structure.

DESIGN
Mnase-seq for two replicates each of wildtype and H3 c-terminal mutants.
