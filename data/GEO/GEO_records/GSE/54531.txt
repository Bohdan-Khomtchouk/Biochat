TITLE
RNA Microarray data from embryonic mouse brains wt vs foxf2 mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brain of the foxf2 mutant mouse embryo shows microvascular aneurysm, underdeveloped blood brain barrier and also significant defects in the tissue integrity. Foxf2 expresses in the pericytes of the brain and seem to play an important role in proper development of the BBB.

DESIGN
Brains of E18.5  wt and foxf2 mutant mouse embryos dissected and RNA extracted from the brains using Sigma mammalian total RNA extraction kit. The RNA then been sent to th core facility for hybridization.
