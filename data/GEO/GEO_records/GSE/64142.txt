TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression dynamics in monocyte-derived dendritic cells following infection with a panel of intra-cellular bacteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA sequencing to assess the expression dynamics of miRNAs and their isoforms over time upon infection with a panel of six intracellular bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strain GC1237, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Salmonella typhimurium strain Keller, Staphloccocus epidermidis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis)

DESIGN
Study of miRNA expression dynamics of monocyte-derived dendritic cells upon bacterial infection using RNA sequencing
