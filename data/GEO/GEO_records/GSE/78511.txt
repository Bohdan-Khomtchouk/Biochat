TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in wild-type and rpl-1 Arabidopsis inflorescence apices

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana REPLUMLESS gene (RPL), also known as PENNYWISE (PNY) and BELLRINGER (BLR) encodes a BEL1-like TALE homeodomain (BLH) transcription factor that controls multiple aspects of meristem and floral development, including meristem maintenance, phyllotaxis, the transition to flowering, stem development and floral organ patterning [1-3]. As part of a screen for genes that mediate the function of RPL in the processes above, we compared gene expression in inflorescence apices of wild-type (Landsberg-erecta) and the rpl-1 mutant [2].     1.

DESIGN
Plants were grown in a controlled environment room at 20-22 °C, 16 h light (100 µE) until they flowered and the inflorescences were around 12 cm tall. Immediately after dissecting the terminal 1-2 cm of the inflorescences (1-2 g per sample, three biological replicates each for wild-type Landsberg-erecta and rpl-1 [1]), RNA was extracted with Trizol (Sigma) and purified using QIAGEN RNAeasy columns (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were prepared from 10 µg total RNA using a standard Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip © 3’  IVT Express kit) and hybridised to Affymetrix AGROMONICS1 oligonucleotide arrays. Data were normalized and analyzed statistically with the affylmGUI package ( ) using LIMMA (Linear Models for MicroArray data) [2] with a chip description format (CDF) file for the AGRONOMICS1 array and TAIR10 [3]. 1.
