TITLE
Transcriptome changes in Emericella nidulans due to oxidative stress - normalized experimental data (flip-flop)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptional changes observable under oxidative stress caused by menadione in Emericella nidulans. Keywords: time-course

DESIGN
Late exponential growth phase (18 h) Emericella nidulans mycelia were transferred to minimal media also supplemented with 0.8 mM menadione (sodium bisulfite addition compound) and transcriptome profiles were recorded at 6 h incubation time. Double printed EST-based (3533 unique sequences) DNA chips were used to monitor changes in cDNA populations prepared from mRNA pools isolated from oxidative stress exposed and untreated control cultures. Gene expression ratios were estimated according to the protocol adapted from Biotechniques 29(3) Sept 2000, 548-562. Expression data were read with a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). Intensity ratios were calculated with GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Gene expression ratios were subjected to LOESS-type block-by-block normalization using SAS for Windows, version 8. (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.) software.
