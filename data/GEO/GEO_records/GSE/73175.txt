TITLE
RNA sequencing of primary thymic, bone and skin mesenchymal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose : Elucidate post-natal role of SCA1+ thymic mesenchymal cells (tMCs) and evaluate the functional overlap between thymic, bone and skin MCs. Method : By high speed cell sorting, we isolated primary MCs (Lin- SCA1+ cells) from mouse thymus, bone and skin. We extracted their respective total RNA and compared their transcriptome by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. Results : We found a total of 2036 differentially expressed genes (FC > 5, p-adj < 0.1 and RPKM > 1) between the 3 MC populations. IPA analyses revealed that each MC population was enriched for genes associated to phagocyte chemotaxis. We also denoted 2850 genes with shared expression across MC populations. IPA analysis of those shared genes also revealed an enrichment for genes influencing phagocyte migration, chemotaxis and function. Finally, MC transcriptomes showed that all 3 MC populations were expressing genes associated with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) support, strongly suggesting that MCs from thymic, bone and skin all possess the ability to support HSPCs. Conclusion : Overall, our study highlighted 3 potential novel roles for tMCs : 1) Promoting macrophage/monocyte chemotaxis, 2) Enhacing the apoptotic cell clearance process and 3) setting an inviting niche for hematopoietic progenitors. These novel biological roles for tMCs could have substantial effets on thymic biology. Finally, our RNA-seq data offer a valuable resource to the community that can be mined to explore multiple questions related mesenchymal cell biology.
