TITLE
Activity-dependent transcriptional changes in human neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used genome-wide sequencing methods to identify activity-regulated gene expression and regulatory elements in human neurons.  Sensory stimuli drive the maturation and function of the mammalian nervous system in part through the activation of gene expression networks that regulate synapse development and plasticity.  These programs of gene transcription have primarily been studied in mice, and it is not known if there are neuronal activity-regulated genes that control features of brain development and function that are unique to humans.  In this study, we used genome-wide sequencing methods to identify activity-regulated gene expression and regulatory elements in human neurons.

DESIGN
Total RNA-seq data was obtained from primary human, mouse, and rat neuronal cultures that are depolarized for 0, 1, and 6 hours, as well as ChIP-seq data using H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac antibodies.
