TITLE
ISR target genes in the liver of either LFD and HFD-treated Alb::GC mice and AP20187-treated TTR::Fv2E-PERK mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms linking the stress of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) to glucose intolerance in obese animals are poorly understood. In this study enforced expression of a translation initiation 2alpha (eIF2a)-specific phosphatase, GADD34, was used to selectively compromise signaling in the eIF2(Î±P)-dependent arm of the ER unfolded protein response in liver of transgenic mice. The transgene resulted in lower liver glycogen levels and susceptibility to fasting hypoglycemia in lean mice and glucose tolerance and diminished hepato-steatosis in animals fed a high fat diet. Attenuated eIF2(aP) correlated with lower expression of the adipogenic nuclear receptor PPARgamma and its upstream regulators, the transcription factors C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, in transgenic mouse liver, whereas eIF2alpha phosphorylation promoted C/EBP translation in cultured cells and primary hepatocytes. These observations suggest that eIF2(aP)-mediated translation of key hepatic transcriptional regulators of intermediary metabolism contributes to the detrimental consequences of nutrient excess.

DESIGN
The high expressing Ttr::Fv2E-Perk transgenic mice was injected by either mock or AP20187. Wildtype and Alb::GC transgenic mice were fed by either Low Fat Diet (LFD) or High Fat Diet (HFD) . bred into the Atf4 knockout strain and the derivative compound heterozygous mice (in the mixed FvB/n; Swiss Webster background) were backcrossed to the Atf4+/- parental stock and Ttr::Fv2E-PERK positive siblings with Atf4+/+ and  Atf4-/- genetypes were analyzed.
