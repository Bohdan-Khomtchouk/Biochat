TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of SRT1 and H3K9ac in MH63 and srt1 RNAi.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of H3K9ac and SRT1 in MH63 and SRT1 RNAi. By obtaining about 8 million pair-end reads from H3K9ac and 6 million pair-end reads from SRT1, we find that about 45% of rice genes are marked by H3K9ac in 11 day-old seedlings. There are 1824 genes may be bound directly by OsSRT1. OsSRT1 is a site-specific deacetylase involved in deacetylation of H3K9 over specific genes. Overlapping between increased H3K9ac peaks in the RNAi plants and that of OsSRT1-binding was found over 37 genes, suggesting that OsSRT1 directly targeted to these genes for H3K9 deacetylation. The observations that H3K9ac was enriched at the 5â€™ end of genes larger than 1.5 kb and OsSRT1 RNAi enhanced the enrichment at that position. However, the OsSRT1-binding was found to be enriched over gene bodies. While the meaning of this binding profile is not yet clear, it is speculated that OsSRT1 may contribute to maintain the low level of H3K9ac in the gene body.  In addition, this work revealed that OsSRT1 is enriched over retrotransposons.
