TITLE
Gene Expression Patterns of Dengue Virus-Infected Children from Nicaragua Reveal a Distinct Signature of Increased Metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection with dengue viruses (DENVs) leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3â€“6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity.

DESIGN
We analyzed 44 HEEBO arrays on which were hybridized RNA amplified from whole blood collected into PAXgene tubes. 34 samples were collected from DENV-infected patients who presented between days 3-6 of illness. Six convalescent samples collected 14-19 days after onset of symptoms were from two dengue fever patients, one dengue hemorrhagic fever patient and three dengue shock syndrome patients. Additionally, samples from four normal healthy individuals were also analyzed.
