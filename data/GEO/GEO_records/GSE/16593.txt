TITLE
Differential expression associated with GB virus C in HCV/HIV co-infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differential gene and protein expression associated with GBV-C that may be of importance in reduction of HCV-related liver disease. GB virus C (GBV-C) infection leads to improved outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Furthermore, GBV-C has been shown to reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease in HCV/HIV co-infection.

DESIGN
We aimed to identify differential gene expression associated with GBV-C in HCV/HIV co-infection by comparing RNA expression from liver biopsies of HCV/HIV co-infected patients with and without GBV-C infection. Liver biopsies were obtained from 10 Patients with HCV/HIV co-infection; 4 of these patients were positive for GBV-C infection and 6 were negative for  GBV-C infection.  The tissue was stored in RNAlater and RNA was extracted for hybridisation to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 microarrays at the University of Texas Medical Branch Molecular Genomics Core Laboratory.  The data was analysed for genes differentially expressed between GBV-C positive and negative patients using Partek Genomics suite and applying a custom CDF file (Hs133P_Hs_UG_8), available from Molecular and Behavioural Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan.
