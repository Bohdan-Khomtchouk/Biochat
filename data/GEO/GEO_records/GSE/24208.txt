TITLE
Reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells with Bmi1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, plus c-Myc. Recently, Sox2 plus Oct4 were shown to reprogram fibroblasts and Oct4 alone to reprogram mouse and human neural stem cells (NSCs) into iPS cells. Here we report that Bmi1 leads to dedifferentiation of mouse fibroblasts into NSC-like cells and, in combination with Oct4, replaces Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc during reprogramming fibroblasts to iPS cells. Furthermore, activation of sonic hedgehog signalling (by Shh, purmorphamine, or oxysterol) replaces the effects of Bmi1, and, in combination with Oct4, reprograms mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into iPS cells. One-and two-factor iPS cells are similar to mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into iPS cells in global gene expression profile, epigenetic status, in vitro and in bibo differentiation into all three ferm layers, as well as teratoma formation and germline transmission in vivo. These data support that fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into iPS cells by Oct4 alone.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from indicated cells and labeled with Cy3. Hybridization was performed once for each sample.
