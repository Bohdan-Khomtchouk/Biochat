TITLE
Differences between NOR1 and EWS/NOR1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the differences between NOR1 and its fusion gene product EWS/NOR1, we compared the gene expression profiles of NOR1- and EWS/NOR1-overexpressing 293 cells. Keywords: gene comparison

DESIGN
We established 293-tet-On clones stably transfected NOR1- or EWS/NOR1-expressing plasmid. Total RNA was collected from the clones cultured with or without doxycycline.
