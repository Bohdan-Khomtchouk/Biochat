TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Capan-1 and Pt45P1 cells treated or not with alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF) were measured by gene expression profiling of Capan-1 and Pt45P1 cells.

DESIGN
4 samples: Capan-1 cells +/- asTF, Pt45P1 cells +/- asTF.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
