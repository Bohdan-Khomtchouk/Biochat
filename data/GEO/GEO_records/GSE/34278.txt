TITLE
Whole esophagi of WT, Nrf2-/- and Keap1-/- mice on C57BL background at E11.5, E15.5, P0 and P7,  and esophageal epithelium of adult (8 weeks old) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse esophageal development. Goal was to globally profile critical genes and signaling pathways during the development of mouse esophagus and determine how Nrf2/Keap1 pathway regulates the morphogenesis of the esophageal epithelium.

DESIGN
Mutiple-comparison. WT-E11.5 vs. WT-E15.5 vs. WT-P0 vs. WT-P7; WT-P7 vs. WT-adult; WT-adult vs. Nrf2-/--adult; WT-P7 vs. Nrf2-/--P7 vs. Keap1-/--P7 vs. Nrf2-/-Keap1-/--P7. Biological replicates: 3 replicates for each group.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
