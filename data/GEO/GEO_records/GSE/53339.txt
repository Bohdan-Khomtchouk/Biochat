TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in colon cancer tissues vs normal colon tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of miRNAs in the progression of colon cancer, we performed comprehensive miRMA microarray analysis on RNA derived from colon cancer tissues and normal colon tissues. We identified a novel set of colon cancer-related miRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from colon cancer tissues and normal colon tissues. Six-condition experiment: H normal tiss vs. H tumor tissue, S normal tiss vs. S tumor tissue, W1 normal tiss vs. W1 tumor tissue, M normal tiss vs. M tumor tissue, W2 normal tiss vs. W2 tumor tissue, and Y normal tiss vs. Y tumor tissue. Biological replicates: 1H normal tiss, 1H tumor tissue, 1S normal tiss，1S tumor tissue, 1W1 normal tiss，1W1 tumor tissue, 1M normal tiss，1M tumor tissue, 1W2 normal tiss，1W2 tumor tissue, 1Y normal tiss and 1Y tumor tissue, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
