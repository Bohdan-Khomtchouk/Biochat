TITLE
Expression data from rice under salinity stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group ; Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Expression Data of Rice Crown and Growing Point Tissue Under Salt Stress imposed during the Panicle Initiation Stage Keywords: genotypes and growth conditions (control and salt stressed)

DESIGN
Rice Genotypes a sensitive japonica, m103, tolerant japonica agami, sensitive indica ir29 and tolerant indica ir63731 were used for expression anlaysis using the tissue from crown and growing point under control and salt stressed conditions at the sensitive early reproductive stage (panicel initiation).
