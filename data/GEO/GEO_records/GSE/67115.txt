TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of SiHa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study assessed the transcriptional profile of SiHa cells. SiHa is a cervical cancer cell line with integrated HPV16, and was used as a model to study human gene expression in the context of integrated virus. Gene expression in SiHa, calculated by Cufflinks, was scored in windows around the locations of known viral integrations in patients or cell lines to determine if there was an association between gene expression and viral integration. We found that SiHa gene expression was higher near loci of integration for HPV18 vs. HPV16, cervical tissues vs. head and neck cancers, and cervical cancers vs. in vitro integrations. This study provides insight into the factors that may influence where viruses integrate in the human genome.

DESIGN
Gene Expression in untreated SiHa cells.
