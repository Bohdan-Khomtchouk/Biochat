TITLE
Gene expression profiling of FOXP1-silenced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes regulated by FOXP1 in DLBCL cells via gene expression profiling of GCB-DLBCL (DB, K422) and ABC-DLBCL (OCI-Ly3, HBL-1) cell lines treated with siRNA targeting FOXP1 or non-silencing siRNA control.

DESIGN
Two GCB-DLBCL (DB, K422) and two ABC-DLBCL (OCI-Ly3, HBL-1) cell lines were each treated separately with two independent siRNA oligonucleotides targeting FOXP1 (siFOXP1_308, siFOXP1_309) or non-silencing siRNA (siCtrl). Biological replicates derived from three independent experiments were obtained, RNA-extracted and subsequently hybridized into a human microarray platform for gene expression profiling.
