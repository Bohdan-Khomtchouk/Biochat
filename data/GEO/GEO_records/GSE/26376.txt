TITLE
Microarray profiling of monocytic differentiaion reveals miRNA-mRNA intrinsic correlation (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Since the expression profile of miRNAs is specific in different tissues or under different physiological conditions, the correlations between miRNAs and mRNAs could vary under different biological circumstances. This is a study also used expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA during monocytic differentiation to explore the correlations between the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNA, either negative or positive.

DESIGN
After treatment of TPA, U937 cells present functional differentiation markers as well as specific cell morphology, which were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and Wright-Giemsa staining.Here we use a miRNA microarray (CapitalBio, Beijing, China) containing 509 well-characterized human, mouse and rat miRNAs and various controls to profile the expression levels of miRNA in normal U937 cells and differentiated U937 cells. Three independent biological experiments were performed, and for each differentiated and control sample, two hybridizations were performed by using a reversal fluorescent strategy.
