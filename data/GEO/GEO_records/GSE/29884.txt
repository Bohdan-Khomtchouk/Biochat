TITLE
Gene expression data from cultured cells or from nude mice xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we performed gene transcription analysis of parental MACF7 cell and MCF7 engineered to overexpress oncoprotein RAF1. We demonstrate that overexpression of RAF1 leads to development of ivasive phenotype.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from culturued cells or from nude mice xenografts.
