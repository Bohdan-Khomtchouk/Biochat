TITLE
Spleen transcriptome response to infection with avian pathogenic Escherichia coli in broiler chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of male broiler chickens exposed to APEC O1.  Comparisons were made between Day 1 and Day 5 of all treatment groups, between differences in pathology and effect of vaccine on spleen gene expression.  The goal was to determine expression differences that could convey genetic resistance to APEC O1.
