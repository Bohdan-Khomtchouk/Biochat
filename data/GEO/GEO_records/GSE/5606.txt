TITLE
Expression data from Normal (control) and Diabetic animals LV heart tissue (At 16wks)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in the LV of a rodent heart that occur with uncontrolled diabetes We used microarrays to detail the global changes that occur in gene expression in the LV of the heart as a result of STZ-induced diabetes. Keywords: single time point, comparison control animal v. diabetic animal

DESIGN
Male wistars were anaesthetised (Halothane 2-5%) and randomly received a tail vein injection of either saline or STZ 60mg/kg. Animals were recovered and housed in pairs on fibrecycle bedding (12 hr light:dark cycle, 50-70 % humidity, 19-21 Â°C) for the duration of the study. Animal weight and blood glucose were recorded weekly. After 16wks the whole heart was excised from the animal after cervical dislocation and perfused with 60ml of DEPC treated PBS pH 7.4 at 15ml/min. LV was dissected away and stored in RNA later (Qiagen) at -80C.RNA from 7 animals from each of the two groups was hybridised to an Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Genechip and the resulting changes in gene expression were analysed.
