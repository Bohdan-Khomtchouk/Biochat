TITLE
Brain microvessels ontogeny-ERI-INSERM28

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enriched forebrain microvessels from P5, P10 and adult mice. Transcript comparisons identified 5873 genes with FC > 2 between ages and 93 pathways. The observations were confronted to proteome study using NanoLS-MS/MS and deposited on proteomeXchange platform under # PXD001718. The 2 techniques converge towards extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and junction pathways, indicating early changes in development.  The difference are examined as putative structural basis of very preterm intracerbral hemorrhage,
