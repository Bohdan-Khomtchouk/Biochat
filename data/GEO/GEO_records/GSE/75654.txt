TITLE
Expression data on F0 and F1 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In our study, we seek to understand the differences in growth physiology between wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 (F0 strain) and its PB1-phage resistant derivative (F1 strain).

DESIGN
F0 and F1 cells were harvested at mid-log for RNA extraction for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip P. aeruginosa genome array. A total of 4 biological replicates (4 F0 and 4 F1 samples were used).

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
