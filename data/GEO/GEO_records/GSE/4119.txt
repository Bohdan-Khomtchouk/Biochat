TITLE
Expression profiling of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mononuclear cells were isolated on a density gradient and RNA extracted using Trizol and the Promega SV column RNA purification. Affymetrix U133A chips were hybridised using standard procedures at the core facility of Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
This series includes samples of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia from 24 patients with Down Syndrome, 28 patients without Down Syndrome, 9 samples with acute myelomonocytic leukemia of patients without Down Syndrome, 8 samples from neonates with Down Syndrome and with transient myeloproliferative disease
