TITLE
SHAE003: SARS-CoV, SARS-dORF6 and SARS-BatSRBD infection of HAE cultures.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HAE cultures were infected with SARS-CoV, SARS-ddORF6 or SARS-BatSRBD and were directly compared to A/CA/04/2009 H1N1 influenza-infected cultures.  Cell samples were collected at various hours post-infection for analysis.

DESIGN
Time Points = 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hrs post-infection for SARS-CoV.  Time Points = 0, 24, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hrs post-infection forSARS-ddORF6 and SARS-BatSRBD.  Time Points = 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hrs post-infection for H1N1.  Done in triplicate/quadruplicate for RNA  Triplicates/quadruplicates are defined as 3/4 different wells, plated at the same time and using the same cell stock for all replicates.  Time matched mocks done in triplicate from same cell stock as rest of samples.  Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) will be used for the mock infections.  Infection was done at an MOI of 2.
