TITLE
Effects of polyglutamine expansion and subcellular localization of C-terminal fragment of Cav2.1 in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Polyglutamine(polyQ) expansion of Î±1A voltage-dependent calcium channel (Cav2.1) is the causative mutation of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). The C-terminal fragment (CTF) of Cav2.1 makes aggregates in the cytoplasm of SCA6 Purkinje cells and may relate to the pathogenesis. In order to identify genes associated with polyQ expansion and subcellular localization of CTF, we analyzed gene expression profiles of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells using Tet-off system.

DESIGN
We exmined gene expression profiles of Tet-off PC12 cells using the following four recombinant C-terminal fragments (rCTFs): rCTF-Q13-NLS, rCTF-Q13-NES, rCTF-Q28-NLS and rCTF-Q28-NES. We obtained gene expression data of both Dox (+) and Dox (-) conditions for each CTF. All assays were performed in duplicate.
