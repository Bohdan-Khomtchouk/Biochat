TITLE
Effect of Spot14 Overexpression on Gene Expression Profile of MMTV-Neu Mouse Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Thyroid Hormone Responsive Protein Spot14 (Spot14) overexpression on the gene expression profiles of tumors from MMTV-Neu mice.  Hemizygous MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Spot14 mice were bred and 1 cm tumors from Neu control or Neu/Spot14 bitransgenic offspring were profiled using Affymetrix gene arrays.  Tumors from Neu/Spot14 mice emerged significantly earlier than controls, but expressed many genes associated with lactogenic differentiation and were not highly metastatic.  These results from the mouse model are consistent with observations from primary human breast tumors, which indicate that high Spot14 gene expression was directly correlated with a luminal subtype and a positive ER status.  Overexpression of Spot14 in cultured mammary epithelial cells stimulated proliferation but not differentiation.  Together, these data suggest that, in vivo, Spot14 is expressed in well-differentiated cells, and promotes the expansion of this population in the context of oncogenic signaling pathway activation.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on 13 mammary tumors from MMTV-Neu mice and 9 tumors from MMTV-Neu/MMTV-Spot14 mice.
