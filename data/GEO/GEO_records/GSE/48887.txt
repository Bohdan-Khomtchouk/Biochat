TITLE
Saccharopolyspora erythraea RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Saccharopolyspora erythraea

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of saccharopolyspora erythraea including a industrial strain HL3168 E3 and a wild-type strain NRRL23338. The aim was to evaluate the difference in expression of sRNA predicted in silico related to secondary metabolites in Saccharopolyspora erythraea.

DESIGN
Comparison of the gene expression difference in 2 Saccharopolyspora erythraea strains.
