TITLE
Wheat " Chinese Spring " natural antisense transcription survey

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array currently provides the most comprehensive coverage of the wheat genome for a microarray. In addition to using this resource for transcript expression studies and hybridization-based DNA marker discovery, we endeavored to use the GeneChip to discover the expression of natural antisense transcript (NAT) pairs. By using alternative target preparation schemes, both the sense- and antisense-strand derived transcripts were labeled and hybridized to the Wheat GeneChip. To enable maximum discovery, five different tissue types were selected for assay, and the wheat cultivar ‘Chinese Spring’ was used considering that most of the GeneChip probe sequences were based on sequencing of this genome. [PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Tristan Coram.  The equivalent experiment is TA21 at PLEXdb.]
