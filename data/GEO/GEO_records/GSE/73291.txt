TITLE
Muscle transcriptome analysis of the large yellow croaker under fasting treatment by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Larimichthys crocea

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 2 muscle samples of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) taken from normal feeding fish and fasting stress treatment fish, respectively, to investigate the transcriptome and comparative expression profiles of the large yellow croaker muscle undergoing fasting.

DESIGN
Muscle mRNA profiles of control group (M7C) and 21-day fasting group (M7E) were generated by RNA-seq using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
