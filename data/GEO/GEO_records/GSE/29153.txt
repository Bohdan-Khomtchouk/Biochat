TITLE
Differential gene expression in the Pancreatic lymph node of Deaf1 knockout mice vs. wild type littermate controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the the pancreatic lymph node of 4, 12, and 30 week old Deaf1-knockout (KO) mice compared to BALB/c littermate controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in the pancreatic lymph nodes of 4 wk old Deaf1 KO mice (2 replicates), 12 wk old Deaf1-KO mice (3 replicates), and 30 wk old Deaf1-KO mice (3 replicates).
