TITLE
The three-component system EsrISR regulates a cell envelope stress response in Corynebacterium glutamicum

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
When the cell envelope integrity is compromised, bacteria trigger signaling cascades that result in the production of proteins that counteract these extracytoplasmic stresses. Here, we show that the two-component system EsrSR regulates a cell envelope stress response in the Actinobacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum. The sensor kinase EsrS possesses an amino-terminal phage shock protein C (PspC) domain, a property that sets EsrSR apart from all other two-component systems characterized so far. An integral membrane protein, EsrI, whose gene is divergently transcribed to the esrSR gene locus and which interestingly also possesses a PspC domain, acts as an inhibitor of EsrSR under non-stress conditions. The EsrISR three-component system is activated among others by antibiotics inhibiting the lipid II cycle, such as bacitracin and vancomycin, and it orchestrates a broad regulon including the esrI-esrSR gene locus itself, genes encoding heat shock proteins, ABC transporters, and several putative membrane-associated or secreted proteins of unknown function. Among those, the ABC transporter encoded by cg3322-3320 was shown to be directly involved in bacitracin resistance of C. glutamicum. Since similar esrI-esrSR loci are present in a large number of actinobacterial genomes, EsrISR represents a novel type of stress-responsive systems whose components are highly conserved in the phylum Actinobacteria.

DESIGN
For global transcriptome analyses, cells of the C. glutamicum delta esrI (cg0706) deletion mutant, of the esrSR deletion mutant expressing EsrR from plasmid, and cells of the wild type in the presence of bacitracin were compared with the corresponding control.
