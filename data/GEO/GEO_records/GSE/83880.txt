TITLE
Gene expression of developed cancer stem cells [OCC-hiPS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression of human induced cancer stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells were analyzed.

DESIGN
We compared mRNA expression of human induced pluripotent stem cells and cancer stem cells which are induced from human iPS cells with a cancer cell culture medium. OCC: Okayama Cancer stem cell Collection
