TITLE
Sub-chronic transcriptional response in adult male MutaTMMouse following oral exposure to benzo(k)fluoranthene in lung, liver, and forestomach tissues [BkF]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of hundreds of structurally similar chemicals ubiquitously present in our environment. They are created during the incomplete combustion of organic materials, such as oil, wood, tobacco, and charbroiled meat. As such, human exposure to mixtures of PAHs can occur through consumption of PAH-containing foods and water, inhalation of polluted air, or dermal contact. Several PAHs have been classified as carcinogenic to humans or probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Benzo(k)fluoranthen is one such compound. In the present study, we sought to determine the dose-dependent changes in gene expression upon oral exposure to benz(a)anthracene in the lung, liver, and forestomach tissues. Adult male MutaTMMouse were exposed to three doses of benzo(k)fluoranthene or vehicle control (olive oil) for 28 days and sacrificed three days after the final exposure.

DESIGN
This experiment examined the pulmonary, hepatic, and forestomach transcriptional response of male mice exposed to benzo(k)fluoranthene  for 28 days at three different doses, including D1 (25 mg/kg-bw/day), D2 (50 mg/kg-bw/day), and D3 (100 mg/kg-bw/day) and vehicle control (D0).  Each dose group was examined 72 hours following the final exposure.  Each dose group had 2-4 biological replicates. There were a total 15, 13, and 14 samples (arrays) from the lung, liver, and forestomach, respectively, included in the final analysis using a two-colour reference design.
