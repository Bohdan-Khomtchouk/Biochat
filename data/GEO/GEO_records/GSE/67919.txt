TITLE
Epigenome analysis of tumor adjacent normal tissue from breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of tumor adjacent normal tissue from patients with invasive breast cancer, as well as tissue from women undergoing reduction mammoplasty or prophylactic surgery.  The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,577 CpGs in snap frozen breast tissue. Samples included 70 tumor-adjacent normal breast tissue with invasive disease, 8 tissues from breast prophylactic patients, and 18 tissues from breast reduction patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 96 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
