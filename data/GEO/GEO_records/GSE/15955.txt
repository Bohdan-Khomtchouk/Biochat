TITLE
Expression data from colon epithelium of STAT3IEC-KO in acute DSS colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STAT3 is a pleiotropic transcription factor with important functions in cytokine signalling in a variety of tissues. However, the role of STAT3 in the intestinal epithelium is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that development of colonic inflammation is associated  with the induction of STAT3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Studies in genetically engineered mice showed that epithelial STAT3 activation in DSS colitis is dependent on IL-22 rather than IL-6. IL-22 was secreted by colonic CD11c+ cells in response to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Conditional knockout mice with an IEC specific deletion of STAT3 activity were highly susceptible to experimental colitis, indicating that epithelial STAT3 regulates gut homeostasis. STAT3IEC-KO mice, upon induction of colitis, showed a striking defect of epithelial restitution. Gene chip analysis indicated that STAT3 regulates the cellular stress response, apoptosis and pathways associated with wound healing in IEC. Consistently, both IL-22 and epithelial STAT3 were found to be important in wound-healing experiments in vivo. In summary, our data suggest that intestinal epithelial STAT3 activation regulates immune homeostasis in the gut by promoting IL-22-dependent mucosal wound healing.

DESIGN
4 samples of colon epithelium were analyzed from 4 mice (2 per group Stat3flfl VillinCre- and Stat3flfl VillinCre+, respectively) after they had been treated with DSS (2.5%) for 5 days
