TITLE
Expression data from E. faecalis Fsr mutants during GBAP induction

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
To rigorously characterize the Fsr regulon, we compared gene expression in V583 isogenic mutants in Fsr genes and each of the Fsr-regulated protease genes using microarrays and purified GBAP, the quorum-sensing molecule. We used microarrays to identified the genes that are regulated directly by Fsr Quorum sensing system.

DESIGN
E. faecalis V583 cells were collected at 0 minutes and 10 minutes after GBAP addition, for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The cells were collected when the number of the cells are ideal for Quorum sensing activation. This procedure was also made without GBAP addition. For each condition were made replicates.
