TITLE
Comparative transcriptional profiling of organs of the barley spike

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The lemma, the palea and the awn of a barley spike are photosynthetic organs and supply the developing seed with carbohydrates. In addition, the lemma and the palea cover the seed and protect it from pathogens and insects. In this study, we compared gene expression among the lemma, the palea, the awn and the developing seed of barley at the grain-filling stage (Zadok scale 83) using the Barley1 Genome Array in order to identify genes that determine the primary function of these organs.

DESIGN
Lemma, palea, awn and seed were collected at grain-filling stage (Zadok scale 83) to compare differences in gene expression. For each organ three biological replications were collected on three different dates. On each of the three dates, one replication of each organ was collected from plants grown in separate pots using a randomized complete block design (RCBD). In ths design, organ type was the treatment effect and date of sample collection (replication) was the block. To get enough tissue for RNA extraction, each replication for each organ was collected from four plants in the same pot. RNA from each replicate sample was hybridized to individual Barley1 GeneChips. Thus, for four organs with three replications (blocks), a total of 12 Barley1 GeneChips were used.
