TITLE
Primary nasal epithelium exposed to house dust mite extract shows activated expression in allergics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response to allergen was studied in epithelial cells derived from allergic pantients and from healthy controls. Cells were cultured after isolation from a nasal biopsy. Cells were exposed to Housed dust mite or vessel (saline) Microarray data was analysed using bioinformatics and biostaistics. We conclude  that a marked difference in basal expression and in response to hous dust mite exists Keywords: cellular response to allergen
