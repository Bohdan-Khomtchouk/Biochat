TITLE
Gene expression changes in aortas of mice on high fat versus regular chow diet.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine effects of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance on arterial wall biology, gene expression profiles were generated using aortas from mice on high fat (35% fat) diet and their respective non diabetic regular chow fed controls. Keywords: Chip

DESIGN
Experiment was done in triplicate with three independent pools from test mice on high fat diet and control mice on regular chow diet. For RNA isolation aortas were striped of adventitia and periaortic fat. RNA from three aortas was pooled for the synthesis of probe for affymetrix array analysis.
