TITLE
IL6 Related Cytokines Augment Angiogenesis in Nascent and Mature Human Endothelium Via JAK2 Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While therapeutic angiogenesis holds promise for vascular diseases, progress has been limited due to discrepancies in defining adult endothelial progenitors. We have identified and characterized a population of pluripotent derived NRP1+CD34+ nascent endothelial cells, immediately diverged from NRP1+CD34- mesodermal cells. We contrasted the transcriptional profile of NRP1+ CD34+ nascent endothelial cells against undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to gain insights into the pathways that are uniquely activated in formation of new endothelium. We found significant upregulation of IL-6 related growth factor receptors, including ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), and their downstream JAK/STAT signaling components in NRP1+CD34+ endothelial cells. When exposed to CNTF, angiogenic sprouting of NRP1+CD34+ was induced in Matrigel, which was abolished with JAK2 inhibition. Furthermore, we found evidence of JAK2 dependent cytokine signaling in more mature endothelium, highlighting the significance of the IL6R/JAK2 pathway, well known in hematopoiesis, in vascular biology. The findings identify a novel group of growth factor receptors and downstream signaling components that may be targeted to modulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.
