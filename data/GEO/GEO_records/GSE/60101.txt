TITLE
Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We develop a new ChIpseq method (iChIP) to profile chromatin states of low cell number samples. We use IChIP to profile the chromatin dynamics during hematopoiesis across 16 different cell types which include the principal hematopoietic progenitors

DESIGN
3' RNA-seq for digital gene expression quantitation across multiple cell types.
