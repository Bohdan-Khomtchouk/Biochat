TITLE
Expression data from miR-132 overexpressing immortalized human mammary fibroblasts and from mammary epithelial columnar cell hyperplasia cells co-cultured with miR-132 overexpressing fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Columnar cell hyperplasia (CCH) is the first histologically identifiable lesion in the breast with premalignant potential. Altered miRNA expression in the stroma surrounding CCH compared to normal tissue was discovered. The effect of upregulation of one specific miRNA was investigated  by gene expression array in human mammary fibroblasts as well as in epithelial CCH cells coculterd with miR-132 oversexpressing human mammary fibroblasts. We used microarrays to detail the effects of miR-132 in human mammary fibroblasts and identified multiple altered genes and gene pathways both in the fibroblasts and in cocultured human mammary epithelial CCH cells.

DESIGN
Immortalized human mammary fibroblasts were transfected in duplicates with miRNA mimics for miR-132 or negative control and RNA was extracted 24 h after transfection. Human mammary epithelial columnar cell hyperplasia cells were cocultured with immortalized human mammary fibroblasts transfected with either miR-132 mimic or negative control 24 hours prior to RNA extraction. The RNA from all six samples was hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
