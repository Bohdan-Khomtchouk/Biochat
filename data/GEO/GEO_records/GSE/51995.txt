TITLE
Gene expression profiling of paired pterygium and conjunctiva tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify dysregulated molecules between pterygium tissues and uninvolved conjunctiva tissues from the same eye,  we performed whole genome microarray expression profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA from four pairs of pterygium and uninvolved conjunctiva tissues from the same eye was extracted and used for microarray experiments.
