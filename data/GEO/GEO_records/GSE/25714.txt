TITLE
Novel roles of C. elegans heterochromatin protein HP1 and linker histone HIS-24 in the regulation of innate immune gene expression and stress Response

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Linker histone H1 and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are essential components ofheterochromatin which contribute to the transcriptional repression of genes. It has been shown that the methylation mark on the histone H1 serves as a specific recognition code for the chromodomain of HP1, however, the functional role of the HP1/H1 complex remains elusive. Using C. elegans, we elucidate the function of the linker histone variant HIS-24 and heterochromatin proteins HPL/HP1 in the cooperative transcriptional regulation of immunerelevant and stress resistance genes. We also show that HIS-24 and HPL act redundantly in vulval cell fate specification and gonad development. Finally, we provide the first evidence that HPL-1 interacts with HIS-24 at mono-methylated lysine 14 and associates in vivo with promoters of infection-inducible genes: the caenacin (cnc)- and the thaumatin (thn)- gene clusters. Our results highlight a functional link between epigenetic regulation by HP1/H1 the innate immune system and stress response.

DESIGN
The experiment was performed using biological independent replicates of pooled worms. For the KO mutants we used duplicates and for WT condition quadruplicates.
