TITLE
Human U937 cell transcriptome response to Zaire Ebola virus wild-type in the ΔVP30 background and Δmucin virus [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in human U937 cells infected with Zaire Ebola virus wild-type in the ΔVP30 background and Δmucin virus.

DESIGN
Human U937 cells (monocyte-like) expressing the Ebola VP30 protein were infected with Zaire Ebola virus wild-type (wild) in the ΔVP30 background and Δmucin virus (encodes a GP lacking the mucin domain) (mucin). Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 8, 18, and 30 h post-infection.
