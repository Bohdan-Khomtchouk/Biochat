TITLE
EHEC and K-12 E. coli QseD mutant analysis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We used arrays to examine the overall transcriptional differences between WT K-12 E. coli, and EHEC 86-24 and their corresponding QseD (yjiE) mutants.

DESIGN
Strains were grown to OD600 ~1.0, RNA was harvested, cDNA synthesized, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to the chips.  Expression of the QseD mutants was compared to the corresponding WT.
