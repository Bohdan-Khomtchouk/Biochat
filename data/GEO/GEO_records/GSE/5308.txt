TITLE
Evaluation of the performance of the Arabidopsis Pathoarray 464_001: an example of detailed analysis of mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis Pathoarray 464_001 (GPL3638) was used to compare response of wild-type, rps2-101C (Bent et al., 1994; Mindorinos et al., 1994) and ndr1-1 (Century et al., 1995) to Pseudomonas syringae strain expressing avrRpt2.  The two mutants are compromised in RPS2-mediated resistance but distinct difference between them has not been described.  The results suggested that ndr1-1 affects a defense signaling pathway(s) in addition to the RPS2-dependent pathway, and indicate that the microarray is a powerful tool for systems analysis of the Arabidopsis disease signaling network.
