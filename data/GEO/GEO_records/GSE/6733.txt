TITLE
Gene expression changes in aortas of db/db versus control db/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine effects of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance on arterial wall biology, aortic gene expression profiles were generated using aortas from Lepr^db/db and their respective nondiabetic Lepr^db/+ controls. Keywords: Chip

DESIGN
Experiment was done in triplicate with three independent pool of test Lepr^db/db and control Lepr^db/+ pooled samples. For RNA isolation aortas were striped of adventitia and periaortic fat. RNA from six aortas was pooled for the synthesis of probe for affymetrix array analysis.
