TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Chlorhexidine diacetate on Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Chlorhexidine diacetate, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Chlorhexidine diacetate. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three chlorhexidine diacetate-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 10 and 60 min exposures.
