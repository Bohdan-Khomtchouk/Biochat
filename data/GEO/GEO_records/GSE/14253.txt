TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Chlorhexidine diacetate on Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Chlorhexidine diacetate, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study
