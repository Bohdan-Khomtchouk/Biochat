TITLE
Gene expression in HEK293 cells with hSNRK-GFP or GFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes with human SNRK-GFP overexpression.  The purpose of the study was to determine the expression of the genes that are altered by SNRK in order to obtain evidence about what cellular functions SNRK regulates.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HEK293 cells 48 hours after transfection with human SNRK-pEGFPN3 or pEGFPN3

PLATFORM
GPL6102 Illumina human-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
