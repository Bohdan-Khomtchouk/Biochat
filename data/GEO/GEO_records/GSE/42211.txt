TITLE
Genome wide occupancy of SUMO machinery in proliferative and Ras-induced senescent human primary fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factors represent one of the largest groups of proteins regulated by SUMO, and their modification has generally been correlated with transcriptional repression. However, as most of the studies focus on specific sumoylated transcriptional regulators, the distribution and global role of SUMO on chromatin in relation to transcription regulation remain largely unknown. To investigate this role, we determined the occupancy of SUMO machinery proteins on chromatin by ChIP coupled to sequencing in human primary cells.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 histone modifications, Polymerase II, SUMO1, SUMO2, Ubc9 and PIASy in proliferative and Ras-induced senescent fibroblasts.
