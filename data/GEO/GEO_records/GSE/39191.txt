TITLE
P0-cre marked neural crest cells in murine embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular features of craniofacial versus trunk neural crest cells (NCCs), we utilized P0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP mice that specifically label NCCs (Yamauchi et al., 1999 (PMID 10419695)). Craniofacial and trunk regions were isolated from P0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP mouse embryos at embryonic day E12.5, and dissociated cells were analyzed by flow cytometory in regard to the intensity of EGFP.

DESIGN
In this study, we performed at least duplicate experiments for each of the four groups (Craniofacial EGFP+, Trunk EGFP+, Craniofacial EGFP-, Trunk EGFP-). Total of 9 samples.
