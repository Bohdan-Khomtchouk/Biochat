TITLE
Comparative study of a mTOR inhibitor, a pan-PI3K inhibitor and a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in MCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation contributes to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) pathogenesis and drug resistance. However, the use of mTOR inhibitors as single agents have shown limited clinical efficacy in relation with drug activation of feedback loops. Selective PI3K inhibition or dual PI3K/mTOR catalytic inhibition are different therapeutic approaches developed to achieve effective pathway blockage. Here, we evaluated the antitumor activity of a mTOR inhibitor, a pan-PI3K inhibitor and a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in primary MCL cells. We found that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor modulated angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness and cytokine signaling compared to a mTOR inhibitor and a pan-PI3K inhibitor in MCL. We used microarrays to compare the effect of these three compounds in MCL and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes modulated by each compound.

DESIGN
Global RNA expression in primary cells from two MCL patients treated with a mTOR inhibitor, a pan-PI3K inhibitor and a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor for 8 hours
