Mesenchymal stem cells from myelodysplastic syndromes are functionally and genomically abnormal

SUMMARY
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are the progenitors of the Bone Marrow (BM) stroma and have been involved in the physiopathology of MDS. The presence of cytogenetic aberrations on MSC from MDS patients is controversial. The aim of the study is to characterize BM derived MSC from patients with MDS using: kinetic studies, immunophenotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis and genetic changes by array based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). 32 cases of untreated MDS were included in the study. MSC from MDS achieved confluence at a slower rate than donor-MSC, and the antigenic expression of CD105 and CD104 was also lower. Array-CGH studies showed DNA genomic changes that were proved not to be somatic, and gains were more frequent than looses. The results of array-CGH were confirmed by FISH. When an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed two clusters were identified: one of them included the 5q- syndrome patients, while the other incorporated the rest of the MDS patients. Our results shows, for the first time, that MSC from MDS display genomic aberrations, assessed by array-CGH and FISH, some of them specially linked to particular MDS subtypes.
