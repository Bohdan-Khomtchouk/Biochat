TITLE
The bone marrow microenvironment in patients with neuroblastoma: presence of IFN signature and significant down-regulation of CXCL12 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra cranial solid tumor in infants. Although several risk factors including patient age, disease stage and genetic abnormalities, such as MYCN amplification and 11q deletion, have been shown to predict outcome, the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous clinical behavior of this tumor, ranging from spontaneous regression to rapid progression of disease and patientâ€™s death, remain largely unknown. Patients with disseminated disease mainly show metastasis at bone marrow (BM) and bone. The presence of metastasis is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for NB patients over 18 months of age at diagnosis, whose event-free and overall survivals are grim despite intensive multimodal therapies. We decided to investigate the transcriptome of both NB metastatic cells and resident hematopoietic BM cells to get insight on potential targets for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes. Hereby, we report on the results obtained by comparing BM resident hematopoietic cells in the presence and absence of infiltrating NB hematopoietic cells with BM cells from young healthy donors.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression profiles of 40 bone marrow samples: 8 from healthy young donor; 23 from NB patients with stage 1, 2, 3; 9 from NB patients with stage 4.
