TITLE
Identifying RBBP4-regulated transcriptome in T98G glioblastoma cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (RBBP4) is a chromatin modifying protein regulating multiple cellular functions. We have identified RBBP4 as a critical modulator of therapy response in glioblastoma (GBM). The purpose of this study was to identify genes through which RBBP4 regulates this important role with expectation of identifying candidates for therapy sensitizing strategy in GBM, and perhaps in other human malignancies.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from T98G cells expressing either a control shRNA (shNT) or RBBP4 shRNA (shRBBP4), and RNA-seq was used to evaluate the patterns of gene expression comparing T98G-shNT with the T98G-shRNA.
