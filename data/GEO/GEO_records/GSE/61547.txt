TITLE
Expression data from HTR-8/Svneo side population (SP) and non-side population (NSP) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immature cell populations, including stem cells and progenitor cells, can be found in “side-population (SP)” cells. Although SP cells isolated from some adult tissues have been reported elsewhere, isolation and characterization of human trophoblast SP cells remained to be reported. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cell differentiation and identified up-regulated genes of SP

DESIGN
HTR-8/SVneo SP cells or NSP cells were isolated using a FACS Vantage fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Bioscience, San Jose, California) using dual wavelength analysis (blue, 424 - 444nm; red 675 nm) after excitation with 350 nm UV light. PI-positive dead cells were excluded from the analysis. Sorted SP and NSP cells'  RNA had been analyzed by microarray analysis.
