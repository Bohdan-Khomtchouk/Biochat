TITLE
Genome-wide methylation analyses in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our main objective was to study genome-wide differential methylation in de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, grade IV glioma). We evaluated CpG sites in gene promoters of 26,000+ genes using an array-based chip. We retrieved 54 GBM from biorepositories of two institutions(40 from Columbia University and 14 from Case Western Reserve University) and 24 control brain tissues from the New York Brain Bank, which collected control brain tissues from consented subjects without history of neurological diseases at autopsy.

DESIGN
Bisulfite modified DNA was extracted from 54 GBM and 24 control brain tissue. The HumanMethylation27 Analysis Bead-Chips (Illumina) were used to interrogate 26,486 informative CpG sites in the autosomes.
