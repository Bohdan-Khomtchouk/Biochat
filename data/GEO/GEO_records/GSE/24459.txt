TITLE
Comparison of lymphoblastoid cell gene expression with immunofluorescent chromosome banding

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metaphase chromosome staining was used to provide a high level overview of the pattern of histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) at a single cell level in human lymphoblastois cells. These epigenomic banding patterns were related to various genomic features including gene and CpG island density as well as gene expression.
