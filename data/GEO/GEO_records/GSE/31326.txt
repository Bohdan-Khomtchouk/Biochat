TITLE
Expression data from the partially synthetic yeasts SynIXR-1D, -6B,  -22D, and controls.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have replaced the right arm of chromosome IX in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a synthetic version to generate synIXR haploids.  The synthetic chromosome features multiple sequeunce modifications. We analyzed gene expression by microarray analysis in three synIXR haploids (1D, 6B, and 22D) to detect any changes in synIXR transcripts or global compensatory changes.
