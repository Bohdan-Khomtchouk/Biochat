TITLE
Expression of placental genes in STOX1 overexpressing mice at 16.5 days of gestation versus WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two pools of three placentas from transgenic mice of the TG13 strain and WT mice were hybridized on Nimblegen Arrays. TG13 mice overexpress the gene STOX1 and have the symptoms of severe preeclamsia.

DESIGN
Total RNA was used
