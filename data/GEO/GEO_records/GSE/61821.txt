TITLE
Patient-based transcriptome-wide analysis identify interferon and ubiquination pathways as potential predictors of Influenza A disease severity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile in influenza infected patients with different clinical outcomes were investigated.

DESIGN
Using gene expression profiling, we investigated the expression level of ~47,000 genes in the whole blood of patients with mild (83 patients), moderate (40 patients) and severe (11 patients) symptoms caused by influenza virus. The gene expression level in these patients was compared with febrile patients caused by unknown pathogens (73 patients)
