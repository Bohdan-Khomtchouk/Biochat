TITLE
Gene expression in feather dermal papilla (DP)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The feather follicle is a “professional” regenerative organ that undergoes natural cycling and, regeneration after wound plucking. Similar to mammalian hair follicle, dermal papilla (DP) controls feather regeneration, shape, size, and axis. Here we report gene expression profiling for feather DP at different growth stages. For growth phase, we compared gene expression of DP, the ramogenic zone of feather branching epithelium (Erz) and the mesenchymal pulp (Pp). We also compared gene expression of DP at resting phase. To characterize the feather regeneration process, we further profiled gene expression at Day-2 and Day-4 post wound. Our results provide a resource for investigating feather growth and regeneration.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in dermal papilla (DP) at growth phase and resting phase feather follicle, and during feather regeneration.
