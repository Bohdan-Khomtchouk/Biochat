TITLE
Cardioprotection and lifespan extension by the natural polyamine spermidine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Here we show that oral supplementation of the natural polyamine spermidine extends lifespan, while it exerts cardioprotective effects through reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and preservation of diastolic function in old mice. Spermidine feeding enhanced cardiac autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial respiration and mechano-elastical properties of cardiomyocytes in vivo, coinciding with increased titin phosphorylation and suppressed subclinical inflammation. Spermidine failed to promote cardioprotection in mice lacking the autophagy-related gene Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed high-salt diet, a model for hypertension-induced congestive heart failure, spermidine reduced systemic blood pressure, increased titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in diastolic function, thus delaying the progression to heart failure. Finally, high dietary spermidine intake correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in humans. Our results suggest a novel and generic strategy against cardiovascular disease.

DESIGN
Expression data of heart tissue from three groups: young mice, aged mice and aged mice treated with spermidine
