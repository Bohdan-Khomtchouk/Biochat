TITLE
The Genetic Regulation of the Terminating Phase of Liver Regeneration

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The liver regeneration process terminates when the normal liver-mass/body-weight ratio of 2.5 % has been re-established. We aimed to generate and analyse global expression profiles to study the genetic interactions in relation to liver regeneration, to illuminate the genetic interactions between genes regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, and to clarify the role of TGF-ß signalling in the terminating phase of liver regeneration. Twelve pigs were randomised to either 60% liver resection (n=4), sham operation (n=4) or control animals (n=4). Liver biopsies were taken at time of resection, after three weeks and upon termination the sixth week. Global gene expression profiles in the biopsies were obtained using porcine oligonucleotide microarrays, representing approximately 20000 porcine genes. Microarray analysis revealed a clear dominance of genes regulating apoptosis towards the end of regeneration, compared to the sham and control groups. Caspase Recruitment Domain-Containing Protein 11 (CARD11) was upregulated six weeks after liver resection, suggesting the involvement of the caspase system at this time. Zinc Finger Protein (ZNF490) gene, with a potential negative effect on cell cycle progression and promotion of apoptosis, was only up regulated at three and six weeks after liver resection indicating a central role at this time. TGF-ß was not found to be significantly affected. CARD11 and ZNF490 appear to play a central role in the termination of liver regeneration in the present study. The lack of TGF-ß could indicate that signaling by TGF-ß is not required for termination of liver regeneration.
