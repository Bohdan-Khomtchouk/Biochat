TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Sporadic Canine Hemangiosarcoma are Uniquely Associated with Breed

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Abnormal function of genes is at the root of most cancers, but heritable cancer syndromes account for a very small minority of all tumors in humans and domestic animals. The majority of cancers are “sporadic,” that is, they are not heritable in the strictest sense. Instead, sporadic cancers occur due to interactions of unknown intrinsic (heritable) and environmental factors that lead to malignant transformation and uncontrolled growth. Identification of heritable risk factors in sporadic human cancers is difficult because individual genetic backgrounds are very heterogeneous. To this end, individual genetic backgrounds of purebred dogs are more homogeneous, and dog breeds show different predilection to develop specific cancers. Here, we used genomic screens based on gene expression profiling to identify sets of genes that may contribute to the development of canine hemangiosarcoma, a relatively common endothelial sarcoma. Specific genes in a single breed (Golden Retrievers) are modulated by (or with) heritable risk traits, showing functional features that appear to modulate tumor behavior. Our results suggest these methods are suitable to identify genes that will enhance our understanding of how these cancers happen, as well as possible treatment targets that will improve outcomes of both human and canine cancer patients. Keywords: Hemangiosarcoma, microarray, heritability, GSEA, canine

DESIGN
10 samples were analysed.  6 Golden Retrievers with hemangiosarcoma, 3 non-Golden Retrievers with hemangiosarcoma, and 1 mixed breed Golden Retriever with hemangiosarcoma. The experiment was designed to find genes associated with breed and hemangiosarcoma to asses genetic make-up on disease susceptibility and/or progression
