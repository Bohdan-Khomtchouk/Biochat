TITLE
Tissue-specific signatures in the transcriptional response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection of   Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes ricinus tick cell lines

ORGANISM
Ixodes ricinus

SUMMARY
We report differential gene expression with tissue-specific signatures in tick cell lines infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum - transcriptional response to infection of I. scapularis ISE6 cells resembled that of tick hemocytes while the response in I. ricinus IRE/CTVM20 cells resembles that of tick midguts.

DESIGN
Comparison of differential gene expression in infected tick cell lines (Ixodes scapularis [ISE6] and Ixodes ricinus [IRE/CTVM20]) at 7 days post-infection. Differential gene expression determined through comparison with mock-treated (uninfected) cells.  This series contains only Ixodes ricinus data.
