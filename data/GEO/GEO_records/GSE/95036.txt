TITLE
Unique DNA methylation signature in HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) represent a heterogeneous group of cancers, for which human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an emerging risk factor. Previous studies showed promoter hypermethylation in HPV(+) oropharyngeal cancers, but only few consistent target genes have been so far described and the evidence of a functional impact on gene expression is still limited. Methods. We performed global and stratified pooled analyses of epigenome-wide data in HNSCCs based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 bead-array data in order to identify tissue-specific components and common viral epigenetic targets in HPV-associated tumours . Results. We identified novel differentially methylated CpGs and regions associated with viral infection that are independent of the anatomic site. In particular, most hypomethylated regions were characterized by a marked loss of CpG island boundaries, which showed significant correlations with expression of neighbouring genes. Moreover, a subset of only 5 CpGs in few hypomethylated regions predicted HPV status with a high level of specificity in different cohorts. Finally, this signature was a better predictor of survival compared with HPV status determined by viral gene expression by RNA-Sequencing in the TCGA cohort. Conclusions. We identified a novel epigenetic signature of HPV infection in HNSCCs which is independent of the anatomic site, is functionally correlated with gene expression and may be leveraged for improved stratification of prognosis in HNSCCs.

DESIGN
In total 12 samples from French head and neck cancer patients were processed. Data for 11 samples are provided as one sample did not pass the quality checks.
