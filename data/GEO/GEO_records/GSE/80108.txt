TITLE
A. lyrata ssp. lyrata root and flower-bud transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata

SUMMARY
Using A. lyrata microarray platform the root and flower bud specific gene expression was characterized.

DESIGN
Roots and flower-buds from 6 weeks old A. lyrata plants grown hydroponically on a raft were harvested and used as biological tissues for total RNA extraction. Tissues harvested from 8-10 plants were pooled together and were defined as a biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL21706 Agilent-030951 A. lyrata 8X60 {Probe Name version]
