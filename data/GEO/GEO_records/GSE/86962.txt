TITLE
Profiling of CD34+ hair follicle stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) CD49f+/CD34+/GFP- hair follicle stem cells after hair follicle keratinocyte isolation from the skin of age matched saline or diphtheria toxin (DT) treated Lgr5-DTReGFP mice. The " SAMPLE_ID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech. The ID of this project in Genentech's ExpressionPlot database is PRJ0009986

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of CD49f+/CD34+/GFP- hair follicle stem cells from saline or DT treated Lgr5-DTReGFP mice

PLATFORM
