TITLE
Hepatic gene expression profile in hydrogen water administrated SD rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The effects of the administration of molecular hydrogen-saturated drinking water (hydrogen water) on hepatic gene expression were investigated in rats. Using DNA microarrays, 548 upregulated and 695 downregulated genes were detected in the liver after a 4-week administration of hydrogen water. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that genes for oxidoreduction-related proteins, including hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes.

DESIGN
4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were acclimatized for 4 days in a room maintained at 24 ± 3°C with a relative humidity of 55 ± 15% with a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00, off at 19:00) and were fed ad libitum on a commercial diet (MF, Oriental Yeast Co., Yokohama, Japan). After acclimatization, the rats were divided into two groups (n = 8 per group) with similar mean body weights. During a period of 4 weeks, one group (control group) was supplied with sterilized distilled water and the other (HW group) with hydrogen water produced by MiZ Co. Ltd. (Fujisawa, Japan), which contains 0.7 mM dissolved hydrogen (pH 7.4). All the animals drank water ad libitum.  After 4 weeks, each rat was anesthetized with diethyl ether and blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta.  The liver was then excised and analyzed the effect of hydrogen water extract administration on hepatic gene expression.
