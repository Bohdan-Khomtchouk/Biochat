TITLE
Lymph node stromal cells: Control siRNA treated vs. Eif4g3 siRNA treated - Total RNA and Heavy polysome fraction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the total RNA and heavy polysome fractions of Eif4g3 siRNA treated lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) compared to control-sIRNA treated samples The objective of this study was to identify genes whose translation are reduced after silencing Eif4g3 (the gene which encodes the translation initiation factor eIF4GII).  Genes with reduced translation are expected to have lower expression in RNA samples isolated from heavy polysomes but not in RNA samples isolated from whole cell lysates.

DESIGN
LNSCs were grown in 10 cm plates, allowed to reach ≥ 80% confluency and then transfected with 400 pmol of control or Eif4g3 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000.  7 plates were transfected with control or Eif4g3 siRNA.  Total RNA was extracted from cells 48h after transfection.  To isolate RNA from the heavy polysome fractions, cells were pooled, lysed and fractionated on a 10% to 60% continuous sucrose gradient. Fractions containing the heavy polysome fractions were pooled. RNA was extracted from these samples and used for microarrays on the Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarray Kit, 4×44K 2-color arrays.
