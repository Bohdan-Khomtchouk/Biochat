TITLE
Gene-regulatory networks activated by pattern-specific generation of action potentials in dorsal root ganglia neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Development and plasticity in the nervous system are regulated by specific patterns of neural impulse activity.  Patterned activity orchestrates spatial and temporal changes in the expression of networks of genes.  These gene regulatory networks underlie the long-term changes in cell specification, growth of synaptic connections, and frequency adaptation that occur throughout neonatal and postnatal life. We show that the temporal nature of action potentials and downstream signaling differentially regulate the expression of hundreds of diverse neuronal genes through distinct gene regulatory networks.  Analysis of upstream regulatory regions showed enrichment in transcription factor binding sites for NF-Kappa that was action potential firing pattern specific.  Our new findings demonstrate spike-frequency decoding by action potentials at the transcriptional level by pattern-specific activation of transcription factors and associated gene-regulatory networks that operate to adjust the modalities of sensory neurons.

DESIGN
We analyzed the transcriptomic changes in primary cultures of embronic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons subjected to four electric stimulation patterns with respect to their non-stimulated counterparts. We have adopted the multiple yellow strategy in which differently fluorescent labeled biological replicas are co-hybridized with each array and then similarly labeled samples from cells subjected to different conditions are compared and results averaged over the two labels.
