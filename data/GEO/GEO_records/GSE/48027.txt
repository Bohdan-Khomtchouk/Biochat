TITLE
Host directed activity of Pyrazinamide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pyrazinamide (PZA) is one of the first line antibiotics used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  we have used human monocyte and a mouse model of pulmonary TB to investigate whether treatment with PZA, in addition to its known anti-mycobacterial properties, modulate the host immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection.

DESIGN
Mice were infected with Mtb and treatment with PZA was started at 28 days post-infection.  At 42 days and 63 days post-infection, group of animals were euthanized and lung tissue was collected to isolate total RNA and used in microarray experiments.  Mtb-infected, untreated animals served as controls.
