TITLE
Skin healing and scale regeneration in fed and unfed sea bream, Sparus auratus

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Fish scales are an important reservoir of calcium and phosphorus and together with the skin function as an integrated barrier against environmental changes and external aggressors. Histological studies have revealed that the skin and scales regenerate rapidly in fish when they are lost or damaged. In the present manuscript the histological and molecular changes underlying skin and scale regeneration in fed and fasted sea bream (Sparus auratus) were studied using a microarray 3 and 7 days after scale removal to provide a comprehensive molecular understanding of the early stages of these processes. Histological analysis of skin/scales revealed 3 days after scale removal re-epithelisation had occurred and the scale pocket had formed. In animals with scales removed, there was significant up-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and adhesion, immune response and antioxidant activities. The expression profiles of the fasted animals centred on maintaining energy homeostasis. The utilisation of fasting as a treatment emphasised the competing whole animal physiological requirements with regard to barrier repair, infection control and energy homeostasis.

DESIGN
Gene expression of sea bream (Sparus auratus) skin and scales was analysed in normal and treated animals. Three different treatments were applied: 1. scales removal at day 0 of the experiment; 2. unfed fish 7 days prior the start of the experiment; and 3. scales removal at day 0 of the experiment of unfed fish 7 days prior the start of the experiment. Fish were sampled at two different  days: day 3 and day 7 after scale removal. Five individuals from control and experimental groups were analysed for both sampling days (3 and 7), resulting in a total of 40 samples analysed by microarray.
