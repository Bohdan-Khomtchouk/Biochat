TITLE
VEGF induction of HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries by sprouting from preexisting vessels, is mainly induced by VEGF-A. To identify genes which are induced by VEGF-A in endothelial cells, HUVEC were starved and induced by VEGF-A165 for 30, 60 and 150min. RNA of induced and uninduced cells was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in complete EGM-2 medium in dense culture for four days without change of medium and before the stimulation in EGM-2 medium without growth factors over night. The cells were stimulated with 100ng/ml VEGF-A165 for 30, 60 and 150 min. RNA was isolated with Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions.
