TITLE
VEGF induction of HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries by sprouting from preexisting vessels, is mainly induced by VEGF-A. To identify genes which are induced by VEGF-A in endothelial cells, HUVEC were starved and induced by VEGF-A165 for 30, 60 and 150min. RNA of induced and uninduced cells was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarray.
