TITLE
Differential gene expression in APOE3 and APOE4 gene targeted replacement mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to investigate hepatic gene expression profiles differentially regulated by the APOE genotype in gene targeted replacement mice. The APOE4 genotype is associated with increased mortality in the elderly and is an independent risk factor for age-dependent chronic diseases. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and molecular targets involved in the APOE4-risk association. As APOE is centrally involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and in large part is produced in the liver, we analyzed hepatic RNA profiles of APOE4- and APOE3-expressing mice.

DESIGN
2 groups of 5 animals with 1 liver extract per animal. Mice were homozygous for a human APOE3 or APOE4 gene targeted replacement of the endogenous mouse Apoe gene (B6.129P2-Apoetm2(APOE*3)Mae N8 or B6.129P2-Apoetm3(APOE*4)Mae N8, Taconic Transgenic Modelsâ„¢, ), purchased at the age of 6-8 weeks, strain C57BL/6, 3 months old at the performance of the microarray, 6 weeks on a high-fat diet containing 41% energy from milk fat and 2 g/kg cholesterol.
