TITLE
Differential regulation of HSFA1s and HSFA2 after heat shock in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
HSFA1s are a gene family of HSFA1 with four members, HSFA1a, HSFA1b, HSFA1d, and HSFA1e. HSFA1s are the master regulators of heat shock response. As a part of the heat shock response, HSFA2 can prolong the heat shock response and amplify the heat shock response in response to repeat heat shock. To identify the heat-shock-responsive genes differentially regulated by HSFA1s and HSFA2, we compared the transcriptomic differences of plants containing only constitutively expressed HSFA1s or HSFA2 after heat stress.

DESIGN
hsfa2 (the KO mutant of HSFA2, Col-0 background) and A2QK-10 (CaMV 35S:HSFA2 in QK mutant; QK is HSFA1a/b/d/e quadruple KO mutant) were used to compare the difference of heat shock response when plants lack HSFA1s or HSFA2. The aim is to find the HSFA1s- and HSFA2-preferred regulating genes after heat stress. As the control samples, wild type is the plant with normal heat shock response, and QK (HSFA1s KO mutant, Col-0 and Ws mixed background) is the plant that lost the heat shock response controlled by HSFA1s.
