TITLE
Escherichia coli K-12 grown in the presence of glycerol exhibits upregulation in genes for acid stress chaperones and concomitant downregulation in genes involved in generation of acidic metabolites

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This study explores the effects of glycerol, on whole genome expression of Escherichia coli. DNA microarray analysis imply that E. coli in the presence of glycerol generates acidic metabolites to which it adapts by upregulation of genes involved in acid stress and by simultaneously downregulating genes involved in high pH stress.

DESIGN
E.coli was grown in the presence and absence of glycerol. RNA was extracted from these samples, cDNA was prepared, fragmented cDNA was labled with labeling reagent and hybridized with Affymetrix E.coli2.0 genome array chips.Data was analysed to get the effect of glycerol on E.coli gene expression
