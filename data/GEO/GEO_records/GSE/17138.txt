TITLE
Gene expression profiles of renin producing cells in newborn and adult kidney isolated from Renin-YFP transgenic mice using FACS. (GUDMAP Series ID: 29)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone

DESIGN
Renin-YFP transgenic mice were utilized to isolate renin producing cells from the kidneys of either P0 neonatal pups or Adult mice. Renin producing cells were isolated from the kidney by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA was isolated from FACS sorted cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
