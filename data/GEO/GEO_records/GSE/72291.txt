TITLE
Validation of a genomic classifier for prediction of metastasis following postoperative radiation therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that a genomic classifier (GC) would predict biochemical failure (BF) and distant metastasis (DM) in men receiving radiation therapy (RT) after radical prostatectomy (RP).

DESIGN
139 primary prostate cancer tumor (radicalâ€…prostatectomy, FFPE) specimins from patients at TJU who recieved post-RP radiation therapy.
