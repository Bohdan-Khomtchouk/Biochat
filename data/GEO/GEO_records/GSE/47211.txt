TITLE
Curcumin intake affects miRNA signature in murine melanoma with mmu-miR-205-5p most significantly altered.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer with estimated 48,000 deaths worldwide. The polyphenol curcumin derived from the plant Curcuma longa is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerogenic properties. Accordingly, dietary intake of this compound may be suitable for melanoma prevention. However, how this compound affects basic cellular mechanisms in developing melanoma still remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the impact of oral curcumin administration on the miRNA signature of engrafting melanoma. For this purpose, the effects of a 4% curcumin diet on murine B78H1 melanoma were tested in a flank model. Curcumin diet or standard chow (control) was administered two weeks prior to tumor initiation until termination of the experiment. Highly significant chip-based miRNA array analysis was deployed to detect alterations in the miRNA signature of the tumors. Curcumin treatment significantly reduced the growth of the flank tumors. Furthermore the miRNA expression signature in tumors was substantially altered by curcumin intake with mmu-miR-205-5p over 100 times higher expressed when compared to controls. Putative targets of curcumin-induced up-regulated miRNAs were enriched in o-glycan biosynthesis, endoplasmatic reticulum protein processing and different cancer-related pathways. These findings demonstrate a profound alteration of the miRNA expression signature in engrafting curcumin-treated melanoma with mmu-miR-205-5p being up-regulated most significantly.

DESIGN
Treatment of male C57BL/6 mice with induced flank tumors (injection of B78H1 cells) either with standard mouse chow (control n=6) or chow enriched with 4% of curcumin (treatment group n=7 )
