TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - ABA treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharum hybrid cultivar SP80-3280

SUMMARY
Plants (genotype SP80-3280, CTC, Brazil) cultivated in axenic cultures were transferred to a growth chamber at 26°C on a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle with a photon flux density of 70 µE.m-2.s-1 and cultivated for 4 weeks. After this period, the phytohormone ABA (Sigma Chem. Co) was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of a 100 µmol.L-1. Control plants were treated with distilled water. Leaves were collected 0 h, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after exposure to ABA and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of hormone treatment

DESIGN
RNA from experimental sample and from the control sample (0 h) was used for hybridization to dual channel arrays. Two biological replicates were used for each experimental point. The quantification of each hybridization was submitted in two files, one for each slide side (technical replicates).
