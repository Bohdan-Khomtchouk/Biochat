TITLE
ArcA Chip-chip from Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12, WT and ∆arcA strains

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Mapping the occupancy of ArcA throughout the genome of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12 using an affinity purified antibody under anaerobic and aerobic growth conditions. As a control, we also performed ChIP-chip onArcA in a ∆arcA mutant strain of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12. Described in the manuscript The response regulator ArcA uses a diverse binding site architechture to globally regulate carbon oxidation in E. coli

DESIGN
Mapping of occupancy of ArcA in the genome of Escherchia coli MG1655 K-12 during anaerobic fermentation and aerobic respiration.  Immunoprecipitated DNA compared to INPUT for each sample.
