TITLE
Gene expression profiles of FGF-treated prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a member of endocrine FGF subfamily, which includes FGF19, FGF21 and FGF23. We explored the question of whether different FGF ligands are activating the same transcriptional program in prostate cancer (PCa) cells or whether there are unique or partially overlapping activities as well.

DESIGN
We stimulated biological duplicates of LNCaP cells with FGF2 (classical FGF), FGF19 or FGF23 and collected mRNAs after 24 hrs. We then carried out expression array analysis using Agilent expression arrays. Multiple group comparisons
