TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in gingival crevicular fluid of periodontitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNAs in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by a PCR-based method that yielded quantitative measures of more than 600 miRNAs. We found that miRNA profiles in GCF of periodontitis patients are distinct from those of healthy controls.

DESIGN
Comprehensive miRNA profiling of GCF derived from ten subjects (5 healthy and 5 periodontitis).
