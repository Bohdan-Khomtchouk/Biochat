TITLE
Spatial segregation of BMP/Smad signaling affects osteoblast differentiation in C2C12 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of BMP-2 induced gene expression of C2C12 cells treated with the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore to identify gene expression profiles which are sensitive to endocytosis inhibition. Our data highlight the importance of endocytosis for transmission of an extracellular BMP-2 signal into the nucleus to activate a transcriptional gene network

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from C2C12 cells stimulated with BMP-2 together with the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore or DMSO as control compared to unstimulated cells treated with dynasore or DMSO alone.
