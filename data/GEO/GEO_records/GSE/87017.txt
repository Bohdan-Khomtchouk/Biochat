TITLE
Roadmap to implantation- RNA seq of ovine LE, GE and conceptus during early pregnancy

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
RNA seq analysis of laser capture microdissected luminal and glandular epithelium from ewes on day of pregnancy 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20. As well as RNA seq of whole conceptuses, and trophectoderm tissue from day 12, 14, 16 and 20 of pregnancy. Determination of gene expression changes in the uterine epithelium and conceptus during early pregnancy helps to improve our understanding of early pregnancy events and provides a basis of new strategies to improve fertility and reproductive efficiency in ruminants.

DESIGN
RNA seq analysis of 4 samples of each tissue type (luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE) and conceptus) for 4 animals. Pre-sequencing amplification of LE, GE and day 12 conceptus samples.
