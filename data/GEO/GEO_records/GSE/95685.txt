TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mouse liver transcriptome following exposure to TCPOBOP or PCN

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression were assayed in mouse liver nuclear RNA following a single injection of the CAR agonist TCPOBOP (1,4-Bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) or the PXR agonist PCN (pregnenolone 16Î±-carbonitrile) in 7-week old mice. This study is part of a larger study entitled Sex-Differential Responses of Tumor Promotion-Associated Genes and Dysregulation of Novel Long Noncoding RNAs in Constitutive Androstane Receptor-Activated Mouse Liver (PMID: 28903501).

DESIGN
Nuclear RNA was isolated from male and female CD1 mouse liver following either 3 hour exposure or 27 hour exposure to TCPOBOP; or from male liver following a 3 hour exposure to PCN. N=2-3 biological pools were sequenced per control or treatment group, with each pool comprised of nuclear RNA pooled from n=3-4 individual mouse livers.
