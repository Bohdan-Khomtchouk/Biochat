TITLE
Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) (in vivo)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Relative protein levels for each sample were determined by interpolation of each dilution curves from the standard curve antibody slide. All the data points were normalized for protein loading and transformed to a linear value. Linear values were transformed to Log2 value and then median‚Äêcentered for hierarchical cluster analysis.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, To determine the biological effects of Radiation  on signaling pathways in GBM cells in vivo orthotropic intra cranial(IC)implants (U251 & U87), we profiled the modulation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins using RPPA under different doses of radiation treatment (RT).
