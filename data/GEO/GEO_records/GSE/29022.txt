TITLE
Technical and biological variance structure in mRNA-Seq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression data from next generation sequencing platforms is obtained in the form of counts per gene or exon. Counts are generally assumed to follow a Poisson distribution in which the variance is equal to the mean. However, it is common in observed count data with biological variation for over-dispersion to be present, i.e., for the variance to be greater than the mean.

DESIGN
examination of technical and biological variance in mRNA-seq count data
