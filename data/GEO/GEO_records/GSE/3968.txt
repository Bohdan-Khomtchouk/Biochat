TITLE
Puf proteins, RNA co-immunopurification

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA-coimmunopurifications with TAP-tagged Puf proteins from Saccharomyces cereviseae. Untagged strain  (BY4741) served as a control. Cells were grown to midlog phase and harvested by centrifugation. TAP-tagged Puf proteins were affinity purified from cell-free extracts with IgG sepharose and eluted with TEV protease. RNA was isolated from extract (=input)and from purified protein samples by phenol-chloroform extraction. RNA samples were reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo-dT and random nonamer oligos in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP/ dNTP mixture. cDNAs were fluorescently labeled and hybridized on yeast DNA microarrays over night at 65 degrees.

Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
