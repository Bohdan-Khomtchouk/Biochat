TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in mouse spleen stroma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison between gene expression profiles of splenic stroma from wild type and lymphotoxin beta receptor knockout mice. The goal was to identify a set of genes which expression in splenic stroma is under lymphotoxin control and which can potentially be important for proper stroma development and function in secondary lymphoid organs.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from mechanically separated stroma and splenocytes of wild type and LTbR-KO mice, as well as cultured spleen stroma cells from wild type mice. technical replicate - extract: A,B technical replicate - extract: C,D technical replicate - extract: E,F technical replicate - extract: G,H
