TITLE
ZFP57 recognizes multiple and closely spaced sequence motif variants to maintain repressive epigenetic marks in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mouse embryonic stem cells SNPs disrupting closely-spaced hexanucleotide motifs are associated with lack of ZFP57 binding and H3K9me3 enrichment.

DESIGN
Examination of ZFP57-KAP1 allele-specific binding in two lines of mouse embryonic stem cells JB1 and BJ1 generated from F1 hybrids derived from JF1 x B6 and B6 x JF1 crosses respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
