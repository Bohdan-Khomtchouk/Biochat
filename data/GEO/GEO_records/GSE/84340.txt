TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion and DAmP collections chemogenomic screen with Selenomethionine

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Growth assay in the presence of Selenomethionine that uses the barcoded collections of yeast gene modification (deletion or DamP) to identify strains that are hypersensitive to the presence of the aminoacid.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment â€“ growth of a pool of strains in the presence or absence of Selenomethionine. Two or three independent biological replicates for each condition
