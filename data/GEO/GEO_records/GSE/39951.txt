TITLE
Biofumigation effects of wild Brassica oleracea on beneficial soil invertebrates

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to identify the transcriptional changes between wild Brassica oleraceae lines (Winspit) and 2 cultivated lines (purple sprouting broccoli and savoy cabbage) that show different biofumigation phenotypes. Fully expanded leaves were compared from 8 week old plants.

DESIGN
Comparison of leaf samples taken from 4 different Winspit lines and 4 replicates of 2 different cultivated cultivars of Brassica oleracea

PLATFORM
GPL10733 Affymetrix Brassica Exon 1.0 ST
