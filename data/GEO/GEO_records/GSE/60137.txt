TITLE
Foxo3 Regulated Genes in G1E-ER-GATA-1 Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ensemble of Foxo3-regulated genes in the erythroid G1E-ER-GATA-1 cell line was determined by knocking down Foxo3 using siRNA, and measuring genome wide transcription by microarray analysis

DESIGN
G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were treated with  control or Foxo3-specific siRNA by nucleofection at t = 0 h and t = 24 h. At t = 24 h, cells were treated with ÃŸ-estradiol to activate ER-GATA-1. RNA was harvested at t = 48 h and processed for microarray analysis.
