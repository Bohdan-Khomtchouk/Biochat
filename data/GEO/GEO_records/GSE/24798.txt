TITLE
Aspergillus niger WT: Control vs. steam-exploded sugarcane induction

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. niger comparing WT strain vs. ΔXlnR strain treated with steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse (SESB) for 6, 12 and 24 h. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to cellulases and hemicellulases, comparing the differences between WT strain and the strain with the disrupted xylanolytic transcriptional activator gene, XlnR, after treatment with steam-exploded sugarcane. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR, mass spectrometry of secreted proteins and enzymatic assays.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment : WT-SESB or ΔXlnR-SESB for 6, 12 and 24 h at 30 oC in batch culture. Firstly, WT and ΔXlnR strains were grown in minimal medium with fructose as carbon source (control), and then transferred to SESB as carbon source.
