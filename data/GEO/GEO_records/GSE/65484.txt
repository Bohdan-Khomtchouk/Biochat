TITLE
aCGH profiling for Frozen tumour samples of 50 Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients and 14 Adjacent normal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To gain molecular insights of HBV integration that may contribute to HCC tumorigenesis, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing and whole genome copy number profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from 50 Chinese patients. Conclusions: This is the first report on the molecular basis of the MLL4 integration driving MLL4 over-expression. HBV-MLL4 integration occurred frequently in Chinese HCC patients, representing a unique molecular segment for HCC with HBV infection.

DESIGN
We profiled 50 Chinese Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients and 14 adjacent tissues  using Agilent 244K array CGH technology.  50 Tumor samples also did RNASeq profiling.
