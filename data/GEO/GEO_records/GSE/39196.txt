TITLE
Effect of Gadd45a overexpression on mouse skeletal muscle mRNA levels.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gadd45a is a stress-induced protein that causes skeletal muscle atrophy. The goal of these studies was to determine the effects of Gadd45a overexpression on mRNA levels in mouse skeletal muscle. For additional details see Ebert et al, Stress-Induced Skeletal Muscle Gadd45a Expression Reprograms Myonuclei and Causes Muscle Atrophy. JBC epub. June 12, 2012.

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from muscle-specfic ATF4 knockout mice (ATF4 mKO) were transfected with either 20 mg empty plasmid (pcDNA3) (left TA) or 20 mg pCMV-FLAG-Gadd45a (right TA) and harvested 7 days later.  mRNA levels in Gadd45a-transfected muscles were normalized to levels in control transfected muscles.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
