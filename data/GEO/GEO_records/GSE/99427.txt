TITLE
Identification of AtGRP7 targets by iCLIP

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A key function for RNA-binding proteins in orchestrating plant development and environmental responses is well established. However, the lack of a genome-wide view on their in vivo binding targets and binding landscapes represents a gap in understanding the mode of action of plant RNA-binding proteins. Here, we adapt individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) for genome-wide determining the binding repertoire of the circadian clock-regulated Arabidopsis thaliana glycine-rich RNA-binding protein AtGRP7. We have established iCLIP for plants to identify target transcripts of the RNA-binding protein AtGRP7. This paves the way to investigate the dynamics of posttranscriptional networks in response to exogenous and endogenous cues.
