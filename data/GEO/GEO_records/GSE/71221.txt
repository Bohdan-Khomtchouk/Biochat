TITLE
Aedes aegypti (Aag2) Cells: Control (CTR) vs. Heme-incubated / Control vs. Paraquat-incubated

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
In order to study heme-induced global transcriptional changes, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of heme influence on the A. aegypti cell line Aag2. As heme-mediated effects on gene expression are thought to be related to oxidative stress, we compared the transcriptional profiles of Aag2 cells challenged with either 50 µM heme or 100 µM of the ROS inducer paraquat, using whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, CTR vs. Heme- or Paraquat incubated cells. Biological replicates: 4 control and 4 experimental replicates.
