TITLE
Time course and dose response analysis of gene expression in BCR or CD40-stimulated DT40 B cell

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Gene Expression dynamics is important information. To know IKK- or ERK-dependent B cell receptor- or CD40-induced gene expression dynamics, we performed the time course and dose response analysis in wild type or MEK inhibitor treated or IKKbeta inactive DT40 B cells.

DESIGN
Two replicated samples were analysed. Unstimulated cells (T0) were control. WT cells or MEK Inh. (MEK inhibitor;U0126 5mM, 30min pretreated) or IKKbetaSA (S176/181A knock-in) Cells were stimulated with 0.1, 1, 10 µg/ml of anti-IgM (M4) or 1, 3, 6  µg/ml of CD40ligand (CD40L) for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 or 90min.
