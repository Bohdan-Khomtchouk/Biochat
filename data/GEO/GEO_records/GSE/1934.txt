TITLE
Ifh1 activates RP genes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Experiment Design: •Type of experiment: time course after GAL (galactose) induction •Experimental factor: time, genotype •Number of hybridizations performed in the experiment: 24 (eight conditions with three biological replicates each) Samples used, extract preparation and labeling: •The origin of the biological sample: Species: S. cerevisiae Cell type: wild-type (YSS37, IFH1-13myc-TRP1, MATa) UASIFH1::HIS3-UASGAL1 (YSS89, UASGAL1-IFH1-13myc-TRP1, MATa) •Growth conditions: log phase (2x107/mL) at 30°C in YPLG medium, then addition of Galactose to 2% •Treatments: all cells were harvested by rapid centrifugation at 4°C then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Keywords = IFH1 Keywords = Transcriptional control of RP genes Keywords: time-course
