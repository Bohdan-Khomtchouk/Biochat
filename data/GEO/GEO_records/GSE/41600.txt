TITLE
Attenuation of Global Transcript Changes Induced by Elastase with Symplostatin 5 Cotreatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays was performed to comprehensively determine global changes in transcript levels in bronchial epithelial cells following elastase treatment. Elastase caused a significant change in expression (P < 0.05, fold change 1.5) of 364 transcripts corresponding to 348 genes. Elastase affected the expression of signaling molecules including chemokines, cytokines, and receptors, as well as components of the spliceosome, transcription machinery, cell cycle and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Importantly, the transcriptional response to elastase was attenuated by co-administration of 10 µM symplostatin 5. Comparison of the global heatmap of significantly modulated transcripts indicated that symplostatin 5 potently prevented the global effects of elastase. Symplostatin 5 caused a 20–68 % reduction in transcript levels of elastase-inducible genes including those involved in NOD- and MAPK- signaling pathways which are relevant to inflammation.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed in biological duplicates. Transcriptome profile of elastase, elastase+symplostatin 5 were compared to control.
