TITLE
Identification of microRNAs dysregulated in cellular senescence driven by endogenous genotoxic stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared microRNA (miRNA) expression in Ercc1-/- primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and wild-type (WT) MEFs in 20% O2 and 3% O2 growth conditions to identify miRNAs that drive cellular senescence.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression in WT and Erccc1-/- MEFs was measured at passage 3 and passage 7 after growth in 20% and 3% O2. Two independent experiments were performed for each growth condition.
