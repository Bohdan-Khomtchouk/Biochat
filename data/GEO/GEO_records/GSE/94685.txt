TITLE
RNA-sequencing of lung ECs isolated at P5 from mice with EC-specific deletion of LATS1/2 and LATS1/2;YAP/TAZ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Hippo-YAP signaling in angiogenesis, we performed RNA-sequencing by using lung ECs isolated from mice with EC-specific deletion of indicated components of Hippo pathway.

DESIGN
Lung ECs were isolated from mice with indicated genotype at P5 and mRNA profiles was generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplicate, using Illumina NextSeq 500.
