TITLE
A novel lncRNA, LUADT1 promotes lung adenocarcinoma proliferation by epigenetic suppression of p27

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate the development and progression of various cancers, however, few lncRNAs have been well characterized in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Understanding the expression profile of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes is critical to develop new diagnosis and treatment strategies for LUAD and improving the prognosis of diagnosed patients.

DESIGN
Five female LUAD patients with no smoking history were selected to profile lncRNA and protein-coding gene expression with microarrays. Paired tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues were collected and confirmed by pathologists.
