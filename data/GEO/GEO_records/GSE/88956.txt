TITLE
CD74 role in transcription regulation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD74 activation was previously shown to affect gene transcription. The goal of this study was to reasarch its role as a transcriptor regulator. CD74 was activated in primary CLL cells obtained from patients for 2 and 8 h. mRNA was then extracted, and mRNA-seq was conducted.

DESIGN
mRNA seq was done for CD74 ot IgG activated cells 2 and 8 h following activation in triplicated
