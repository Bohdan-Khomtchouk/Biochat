TITLE
Transcriptional landscape of the human cell cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Steady-state  gene  expression  across  the  cell  cycle  has  been  studied  extensively.  However, 2 transcriptional gene regulation and histone modification dynamics at different cell cycle stages is3 largely  unknown.  By  applying  a  combination  of  GRO-seq,  RNA-seq and  histone  modification 4 ChIP-seq, we depicted a comprehensive transcriptional landscape at G0/G1, G1/S and M phases 5 of  breast  cancer  MCF-7  cells.  Importantly,  GRO-seq  and  RNA-seq  analysis  identified  different 6 cell  cycle  regulated  genes,  suggesting  a  lag  between  transcription  and  steady-state  expression 7 during the cell cycle. Interestingly, we identified genes actively transcribed at early M phase that 8 are longer in length and have low expression, which is accompanied by global increase of active 9 histone  modifications  of  H3K4me2  and  H3K27ac.  In  addition,  we identified  2,440  cell  cycle 10regulated   enhancer   RNAs   (eRNAs)   that   are   strongly   associated   with   differential   active 11transcription  but  not  stable  expression  levels  across  the  cell  cycle. Motif  analysis  on  dynamic 12eRNAs  predicted  KLF4  as  a  key  regulator  of  G1/S  transition, which  was  experimentally 13validated.  Altogether,  our   combined  analysis   characterized  the  transcriptional   and histone 14modification  profile of  the  human  cell  cycle  and  identified  novel  dynamic  transcriptional 15signatures across the cell cycle.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells are synchronized to three different cell cycle stages: G0/G1, S and M phase. Global nuclear run-on followed by RNA sequencing (GRO-seq), ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K4me2 modification were carried out in the synchronized cells. Dnase-seq were performed in asynchronized MCF7 cells.
