TITLE
Profiling of direct mRNA targets of miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 are jointly downregulated in prostate cancer and act as repressors of AR-signaling.  MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNA targets mainly by translational repression, mRNA deadenylation or cleavage. Reconstitution of these lost miRNAs in the LNCaP PCa cell line cause morphology changes, growth arrest, and apoptosis, increasing when the miRNAs were co-expressed. This series identifies direct targets of miR-130a, miR-203, and miR-205 by AGO2-RNA co-immunoprecipitation as described by (Beitzinger et al. 2007) upon miRNA reconstitution in LNCaP cells and analyzing AGO2-bound mRNAs using Affymetrix Genechips. Relative levels of AGO2 bound versus total RNA expression were compared between miRNA reconstituted and miR-scr transfected samples.

DESIGN
Three arrays each for AGO2-bound RNA upon reconstitution of miR-130a, miR-203, miR-205, a scramble miRNA, and three arrays each for total RNA upon reconstitution of miR-130a, miR-203, miR-205, a scramble miRNA.
