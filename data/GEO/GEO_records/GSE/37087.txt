TITLE
Examination of the role of peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) in gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the potential role of peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) in gene expression, we created stable shRNA scrambled control and PAD2 knockdown MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.  After validating the specific knockdown of PAD2 at the mRNA and protein level, we utilized an Agilent microarray platform to compare the gene expression profile of the two cell lines to generate a candidate list of genes regulated by PAD2.

DESIGN
Control and PAD2 knockdown cells were created by stably transfecting shRNA constructs into MCF-7 cells.  Stable cells were selected using puromycin and knockdown validate at the mRNA and protein level.  Microarray data represents 4 independent biological replicates contain control and PAD2 knockdown samples.
