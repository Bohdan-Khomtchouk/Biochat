TITLE
The maize pericarp transcriptome

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
P1 encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor responsible for the accumulation of insecticidal flavones in maize silks and red phlobaphene pigments in pericarps and other floral tissues, which contributed to making P1 an important visual marker since the dawn of modern genetics. We conducted RNA-Seq using pericarps at two different stages, 14 and 25 days after pollination (DAP). High-throughput sequencing using the Illumina platform resulted in the generation of ~20 million high quality reads, from which ~90% aligned to the recently completed maize genome sequence corresponding to ~5 million reads for each one of the four samples.

DESIGN
Examination of two different RNA samples from two different stages of maize pericarp tissues.
