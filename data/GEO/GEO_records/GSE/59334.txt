TITLE
microRNA expression profiling and its integration with mRNA in metastatic melanoma reveal associations with BRAF mutation status and patient prognosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objectives/experimental design

DESIGN
Samples eligible for this study (n=84) were obtained from lymph node specimens (Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) Biospecimen Bank) in which macroscopic tumor was observed, obtained from patients believed to be without distant metastases at the time of tumor banking based on clinical examination and computerised axial tomographic scanning of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Specimens were macro-dissected at time of banking and subsequently reviewed to meet minimum criteria for tumor cell content ( > 80%) and amount of necrosis ( < 30%). Linked clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the MIA research database. mRNA expression profiling information in the same samples is available: GSE54467.
