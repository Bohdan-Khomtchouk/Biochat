TITLE
Expression data to identify putative transcriptional targets of ZNF165 in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that the cancer testis antigen, ZNF165, is required for viability and can modulate TGFβ-induced gene expression in mesenchymal, Claudin-Low, TNBC. We employed the Affymetrix microarray platform to uncover transcriptionally modulated genes following ZNF165 depletion and TGFβ stimulation using the Claudin-low TNBC tumor-derived cell lines, SUM159 as a model. Our results provide insight into how ZNF165 globally modulates TGFβ signaling. We used microarray analysis to uncover the transcriptional network controlled by ZNF165 and clarify the role of ZNF165 in global TGFβ signaling

DESIGN
SUM159 and WHIM12 cells were reverse transfected with either non-targeting or ZNF165 siRNA. For SUM159 cells, sixty hours post-transfection, cells were exposed to TGFβ for 3 hours. For WHIM12, forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were exposed to TGFβ for 3 hours. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized on to Affymetrix microarrays. Each experiment was repeated three times.
