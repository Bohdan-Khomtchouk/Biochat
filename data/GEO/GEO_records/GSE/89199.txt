TITLE
Genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of Trichoderma reesei QM9978 reveals vib1 to be essential for cellulase induction

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
The ascomycete Trichoderma reesei is an industrial producer of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes and also serves as a model for investigations on these enzymes and their genes. The strain QM9978 has a cellulase negative phenotype and therefore presents a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying cellulase regulation. A transcriptomic analyses of the cellulase negative strain QM9978 and the original strain QM6a have been performed to identify the genetic differences between QM6a and QM9978 leading to the cellulase-negative phenotype

DESIGN
Two strains were used: T. reesei QM6a (ATCC13631) and QM9978 (Torigoi, E. et al. Mutants of Trichoderma reesei are defective in cellulose induction, but not basal expression of cellulase-encoding genes. Gene 173, 199-203 (1996)) with two time points for each strain T0h (glucose starvation), T24h and T48h (after lactose pulse). All samples are in duplicate.
