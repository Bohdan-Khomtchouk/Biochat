TITLE
The functional study of zebrafish rig1 gene in NNV infection

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of ZF-4 cells comparing controle morpholino-infection cells with rig1 morpholino-infection cells. This assay is used for determination of gene expression profiling at 6 hpi under NNV infection in rig1 knockdown cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, controle morpholino-NNV infection cells vs. rig1 morpholino-NNV infection cells (5 MOI).

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
