TITLE
Expression data from young HSCs with or without Pot1a overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Appropriate regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal is critical for the maintenance of life long hematopoiesis. However, long-term repeated cell divisions induce the accumulation of DNA damage, especially at telomere, significantly compromises HSC function. Therefore, shelterin elements Pot1a is required to prevent DNA damage response at telomeres in order to maintain their function. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying Pot1a function in Pot1a transduced HSCs during culture and identified distinct molecular signature in this process.

DESIGN
10wks-old mice LT-HSCs were sorted and cultured for 1 day. Mock control (control) and full length WT-Pot1a (Pot1a) genes were transduced into cells by using retro viral vectors. After 3 days culture, GFP+ LT-HSCs were sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
