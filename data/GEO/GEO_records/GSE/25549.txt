Polycomb Protein Ezh1 Promotes RNA Polymerase II Elongation

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins initiate the formation of repressed chromatin domains and regulate developmental gene expression.  A mammalian PcG protein, Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), triggers transcriptional repression by catalyzing the addition of methyl groups onto lysine-27 of histone H3 (H3K27me2/3)1.  This action facilitates the binding of other PcG proteins to histone H3 and compaction of chromatin.  Interestingly, there exists a paralog of Ezh2, termed Ezh1, whose primary function remains unclear.  Here, we provide evidence for genome-wide association of Ezh1 with active epigenetic marks, RNA polymerase II (PolII) and mRNA production.  Ezh1 depletion reduced global PolII occupancy within gene bodies and resulted in delayed transcriptional activation during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells.  Conversely, ectopic expression of wild-type Ezh1 led to premature gene activation and rescued PolII-elongation defects in Ezh1-depleted cells.  Collectively, these findings reveal an unanticipated role of a PcG protein in promoting mRNA transcription.
