TITLE
Pathogenicity of genomic duplications is determined by formation of novel chromatin domains (neo-TADs) (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-scale methods have identified subchromosomal structures so-called topologically associated domains (TADs) that subdivide the genome into discrete regulatory units, establish with their target genes. By re-engineering human duplications at the SOX9 locus in mice combined with 4C-seq and Capture Hi-C experiments, we show that genomic duplications can result in the formation of novel chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of embryonic limb buds for WT and mutant animals carrying structural variations at the Sox9/Kcnj locus.

PLATFORM
