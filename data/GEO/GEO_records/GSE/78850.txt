TITLE
Gene expression in human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines upon HIC1 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the role of HIC1 silencing in regulating PCa EMT development, Human Gene Expression Microarrays were searched for altered genes upon silencing HIC1 expression in C4-2B and DU145 cells. According to fold-change screening betweenHIC1-silenced and its respective control cells, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were shown.

DESIGN
Human PCa cell lines C4-2B and DU145 were transfected with lenti-virus (shRNA targeting HIC1 and respective control). HIC1-silenced cells were respectively noted as C4-2B-shHIC1 and DU145-shHIC1. Their respective control cells were respectively noted as C4-2B-shctrl and DU145-shctrl.
