TITLE
Differential gene expression in diffusely infiltrating astrocytic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims at investigating differential gene expression in human diffusely infiltrating astrocytic tumours, grades II, III and IV. A total of 63 tumours were assessed using the Affymetrix U133A GeneChip. Samples comprised in this GEO submission are identical to those in submission GSE1993 with the exception of two pilocytic astrocytoma tumours (grade I) that have not been included. The study aims not only at discovering the main expression differences between astrocytic tumours of distinct histological grades but also wishes to correlate these findings with the known histopathological and biological hallmarks of astrocytoma progression. Further, the study aims at correlating gene expression with previously obtained genomic information for several loci known to be involved in astrocytoma tumour progression. Keywords: other
