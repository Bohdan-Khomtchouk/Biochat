TITLE
Pregnancy-associated alterations in DNA methylation patterns of mammary epithelial stem cells [mRRBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary gland development and luminal differentiation occur largely postnatally during puberty and pregnancy. We found that pregnancy had the most significant effects on stem cells, inducing a distinct epigenetic state that remained stable through life.

DESIGN
Mammary glands were collected from mice at non-pregnant and pregnant stages for DNA extraction and DNA methylation analysis via mRRBS (multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing).
