TITLE
Muscle expression of SOD1G93A modulates microRNA and mRNA expression pattern associated with the myelination process in the spinal cord of transgenic mice [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of lumbar spinal cord from MLC/SOD1G93A mice and age matched controls at 120 days of age. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene expression 2.0 st Array to determine differential gene expression.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from mice MLC/SOD1G93A and controls FVB age matched at 4 month-old. Samples were collected representing each genotype and age group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Microarrays.
