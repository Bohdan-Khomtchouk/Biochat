TITLE
Expression data from liver samples overxpressing either the GFP or ChREBP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The GFP or ChREBP were overexpressed in the liver of C57Bl6/J mice through adenoviral gene delivery. Mice were studied in the fed state 3 weeks later. We used microarray analysis to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying ChREBP overexpression and identified distinct classes of up and down regulated genes.

DESIGN
RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
