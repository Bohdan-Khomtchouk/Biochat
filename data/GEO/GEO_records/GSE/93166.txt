TITLE
The function of cullin 3 in macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understanding the function of cullin 3 during inflammation in macrophages, we have employed mouse bone marrow derived macrophages microarray expression profiling to identify the gens that involve in regulationg inflammatory respones upon LPS challenge.  Mouse BMM were stimulated with LPS for 6 hours and RNA was extracted for microarray. Ogt was indentified by comparison between wildtype and Cullin 3 knockout BMM.

DESIGN
Mouse BMM were stimulated with LPS for 6 hours and RNA was extracted for microarray.  Samples were in duplicate and the microarray was done once.
