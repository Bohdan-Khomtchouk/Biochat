TITLE
Complexity of expression from transiently transfected plasmids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient plasmid transfection is common approach for studies in cultured mammalian cells. To examine behavior of transfected plasmids, we analyzed their transcriptional landscape by deep sequencing. We found that plasmids generate different levels of transcripts virtually everywhere. Spurious transcription may have undesirable effects as some co-transfected plasmids inhibited expression of luciferase reporters in a dose-dependent manner. In one case, we attributed this effect to kan/neo resistance cassette, which generated a unique population of edited sense and antisense small RNAs. The unexpected complexity of expression of transiently transfected plasmids highlights the importance of appropriate experimental controls.
