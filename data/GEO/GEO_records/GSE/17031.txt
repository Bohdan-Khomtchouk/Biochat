TITLE
Tasquinimod, a Quinoline-3-Carboxamide Anti-Angiogenic Agent, treated Prostate Cancer Cell Line in-vivo and in-vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The quinoline-3-carboxamide ABR-215050 (Tasquinimod (INN)), exhibits anti-tumor activity via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in human and rodent tumors. To further explore the mode of action of ABR-215050, in vivo experiments with gene microarray analysis were performed using samples of LNCaP prostate tumors excised from nude mice exposed to ABR-215050 for 24h at 10 mg/kg(ad.lib.). The array data were validated by real-time PCR (sqRT-PCR), as well as by protein expression experiments. Among several significant differentially expressed gene after exposure to ABR-215050, were cytokine receptor CXCR4, cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and Lysyloxidase  preprotein (LOX). To further explore the mode of action of ABR-215050, in vitro experiments with gene microarray analysis were performed using LNCaP prostate tumor cells. The array data were validated by real-time PCR (sqRT-PCR), as well as by protein expression experiments. One of the most significant differentially expressed genes after exposure to ABR-215050, was thrombospondin-1 (THBS1).

DESIGN
2-color treatment vs. control microarray experiment comprising four biological replicates. Each biological replicate was hybridized with dye-swap; resulting in eight hybridizations for each dataset (in vitro and in vivo), for a total of 16 hybridizations.
