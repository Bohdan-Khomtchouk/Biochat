TITLE
DNA methylation alternations in the offspring adipose from chromium restriction diet dams

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maternal chromium restriction may disturb susceptibility in offspring. Adipose from maternal chromium diet has 1214 CpG  sites that exhibit differential DNA methylationregulated compared to control.

DESIGN
We performed DNA methylation array analyses of offspring adipose from chromium restriction dams and control diet dams at 32 week (n=3 per group).
