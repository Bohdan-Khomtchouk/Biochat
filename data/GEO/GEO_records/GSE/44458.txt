TITLE
Bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells promote tongue cancer invasion by inducing collagen production

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor microenvironment (TME) is an active player in malignant growth and spread. Changes in the composition and structure of TME and extracellular matrix can result in either suppression or facilitation of malignant tumor growth. Carcinoma‚Äêassociated fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs), tumor associated macrophages and other inflammatory cells all affect the composition of TME, proliferation and survival of cancer cells, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the interaction between bone marrow-derived BMMSCs and human oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) cells in the processes of invasion and gene expression. Co-cultures of OTSCC cancer cells and BMMSCs in 3D organotypic invasion assay were used in addition to cell culture, immunological, microarray, and RNA interference techniques.

DESIGN
Total number of 4 samples were analyzed. 2 replicates of cultured human oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) cells, and 2 replicates of OTSCC cells co-cultured with bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells
