TITLE
Transcriptome profile for leaves of rice plants subjected to severe reproductive stage drought stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To understand how the qDTY12.1 interacts with other genes within the genome to give better physiological adaptations and better yield; the leaves transcriptome of DTY12.1 parents (Vandana , Way Rarem) and DTY12.1 NIL (481-B) were compared under control and drought conditions.

DESIGN
Drought induced gene expression was studied in the leaves of the rice plants subjected to severe reproductive stage drought. Seeds of Vandana, Way Rarem, and 481-B were sown into rotovated soil at a rate of 2.0 g m-1  into plots of 3 rows X 3 m. The three genotypes were sown in three replications in a randomized complete block design.

PLATFORM
GPL21470 Agilent-045741 Rice custom expression array (Probe name version)
