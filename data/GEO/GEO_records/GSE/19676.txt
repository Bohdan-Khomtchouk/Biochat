TITLE
Striatum of Huntington's disease model mice [Illumina data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of transcriptional changes in the striatum may be an effective approach to understanding the natural history of changes in expression contributing to the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (HD). We have performed genome-wide expression profiling of the YAC128 transgenic mouse model of HD at 12 and 24 months of age using two platforms in parallel; Affymetrix and Illumina. We performed gene expression profiling on the same striatal mRNA across both platforms. Keywords: time course,disease state analysis

DESIGN
Transgenic mice expressing human HD huntingtin with 120 CAG repeats (YAC128) and wildtype littermates were used for the described experiments. The mice were group housed in polystyrene cages under a normal light-dark cycle (6 am to 8 pm) in a clean facility and with free access to water and standard rodent chow. All experiments were performed in accordance with the University of British Columbia animal care committee. Striatal tissue was collected from 12 and 24 month old YAC128 mice and wildtype littermates.
