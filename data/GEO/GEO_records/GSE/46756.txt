TITLE
mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably overexpressing pcDNA3.1-PinX1 and Empty Vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular mechanism and signaling pathways that PinX1 is involved in, a Human LncRNA Array V2.0 (Arraystar, USA)-based genome wide screen of the alterations in lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles was performed in MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing PinX1.

DESIGN
MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-PinX1 and pcDNA3.1 empty vector and the microarray analysis were performed after the  clonal selection of cells  with a high expression level.
