TITLE
The kinetics of ethylene-regulated changes in the root transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Ethylene-dependent gene expression was assayed by treating with 1 uM ACC, an ethylene precursor, or a control treatment to Arabidopsis seedlings by transferring 6 day old Arabidopsis grown on a a nylon mesh to fresh ACC-containing or control media Seedling roots were harvested 0, .5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after treatment and the resultant RNA was used for microarray analysis to determine the kinetic profiles of auxin-responsive gene expression

DESIGN
8 timepoints after control or ACC treatment done in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
