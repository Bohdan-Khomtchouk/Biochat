TITLE
yeast hsf1-R206S/F256S mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Effect of hsf1-R206S/F256S mutation on heat-induced transcription of genes is analyzed. Total RNA was isolated from HSF1 wild type and hsf1-R206S/F256S cells grown at 39oC for 15 min. Probe cDNA was primed by oligo(dT) and was synthesized in the presence of 33P-dCTP. Hybridization was carried out using the same GF100 GeneFilter. Value higher than 30 in HSF1 wild type cells is confident. Values from duplicate experiments were averaged, and the average fold changes were calculated.
