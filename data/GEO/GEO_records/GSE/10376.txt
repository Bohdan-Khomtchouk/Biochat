TITLE
Expression profiling of mammalian Schwann cells in response to NF1 RNAi treatment and the MEK inhibitor U0126

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the changes in the gene expression profile of cells in which NF1 has been knocked down by RNAi in the presence/absence of the MEK inhibitor UO126 Keywords: RNAi knock-down of NF1 gene

DESIGN
Primary Rat Schwann cells were transiently transfected with either scrambled (control) or NF1 RNAi oligonucleotides in the presence/absence of the MEK inhibitor UO126. Total RNA was then harvested 48 hours post-transfection. Three independent biological replicates were analysed.
