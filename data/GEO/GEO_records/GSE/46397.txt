TITLE
Human embryonic stem cells derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we derived human embryonic stem cell via SCNT. Transcriptional analysis was performed to compare characteristics of SCNT-derived ESCs to their IVF counterpart.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of human embryonic stem cells (hESO-NT1) derived from human skin fibroblasts (HDF-f) via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was compared with IVF-derived counterpart (hESO-7) derived using oocytes from identical donor and parental skin fibroblast (HDF-f). . Three biological replicates of each cell line (A, B, C) were analyzed.
