TITLE
Expression data from hair follicles treated with an osteopontin-derived peptide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human hair follicle is not only regulated, but is a source of transcription factors, hormones, neurohormones etc. which are crucial in regulating its growth. We used microarrays to determine the early response of microdissected human hair follicles to an osteopontin-derived peptide.

DESIGN
Human hair follicles were microdissected from scalp skin from two different patients and were treated for 6 and 24hrs with vehicle (control) and two concentrations of an osteopontin-derived peptide (FOL-005). 12 samples were analysed altogether (6 from each patient, 12 HFs per patient)
