TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of CHD8 binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of CHD8 binding sites as well as sites associated with the activating histone marks 2mk4H3 and 3mK4H3. These analyses have been performed by ChIP-chip using a custom microarray containing promoter regions and CpG islands. ChIP experiments were performed with the C33A human cervix carcinoma cell line.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip analysis of CHD8, 2mK4H3 and 3mK4H3 in C33A cells
