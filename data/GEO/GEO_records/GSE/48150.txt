TITLE
Expression data in the Cap Stage of the Human Embryonic Tooth Germ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Numerous genes that play important regulative roles during tooth development in mice have been identified. However, very little is known about gene expression and function in human odontogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying tooth development and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during in the tooth germs.

DESIGN
Tooth germs of molar, incisor, and canine at the cap stage were dissected, respectively, from 12-week-old human embryonic oral cavity for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to screen for the genes that are strongly expressed in the dental tissues and analysis if these genes related to mammalian tooth development and tooth abnormalities.
