TITLE
Expression data from kidney transplantions in a fisher-lewis rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Most kidney allograft losses are caused by chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) that is characterized by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and a smoldering inflammatory process. The aim of the study was to correlate changes in gene expression over time, as evidenced by effects on regulatory pathways linked to the development of fibrosis and inflammation during the development of chronic damage. Renal allografts were harvested for time points 0d, 7d, 14d and 56d (n=3-5) and examined for steady state mRNA expression using Affymetrix microarray RG-U34A. A select group of genes previously associated with chronic fibrosis was then examined in the context of progressive dysfunction. In order to verify the microarray analysis, qPCR has been performed. Microarray data was used to obtain transcriptomic changes reflecting signaltransduction pathway dysregulation Timecourse results (log2 placebo/control) linked below as supplementary files. Keywords: timecourse analysis

DESIGN
Progression of rejection of transplanted kidneys was observed in untreated animals at timepoints 7d,14d and 56d after transplantation
