TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa unexposed and exposed to direct current

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Application of 200 µA of direct current to bacterial biofilms leads to cellular death. We hypothesize that bacterial death is caused, in part, by the generation of reactive oxygen species. We used microarray analysis to determine the effects at a cellular level following 60 minutes of exposure of bacterial biofilms to 200 µA direct current.

DESIGN
Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were exposed to either 0 µA or 200 µA of direct current for 60 minutes, RNA was extracted and analyzed using Affymetrix microarray specific for P. aeruginosa

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
