TITLE
Epigenetic activation of neuronal gene expression by JMJD3 is required for postnatal and adult brain neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The epigenetic mechanisms that enable lifelong neurogenesis from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain are poorly understood.  Here we show that JMJD3, a histone H3-lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, acts as a critical activator of neurogenesis.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of JMJD3 null (P9 UBC-Cre/ERT2;Jmjd3F/F) and 3 biological replicates of littermate controls were used to analyze the effect of JMJD3 deletion on gene expression.
