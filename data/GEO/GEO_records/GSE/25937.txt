TITLE
Gene expression in mouse liver depleted of HDAC3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver-specific depletion of HDAC3 leads to liver steatosis (fatty liver), suggesting disregulation of lipid metabolism. This is correlated with changes in lipid metabolic gene expression. Livers depleted of HDAC3 were removed from 12 week old male HDAC3 fl/fl mice (loxP sites flanking exon 4 to 7 of the HDAC3 gene encoding the catalytic domain of HDAC3) one week after the injection of AAV2/8-Tbg-Cre virus. Livers from the HDAC3 fl/fl mice injected with AAV2/8-Tbg-GFP were used as normal controls.

DESIGN
mRNA was extracted from 100mg mouse liver samples and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. For each group (HDAC3 depleted liver and normal liver), we have 5 samples from different mice.
