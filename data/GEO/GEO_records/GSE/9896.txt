TITLE
Expression data from wildtype and gas-1 mitochondrial mutant C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Utilizing C. elegans as a model of mitochondrial dysfunction provides insight into cellular adaptations which occur as a consequence of genetic alterations causative of human disease.  We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of hypomorhpic C. elegans mutants in nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes I, II and III. Our goal was to detect concordant changes among clusters of genes that comprise defined metabolic pathways utilizing gene set enrichment analysis. Keywords: Wildtype vs mutant comparison as a method for studying contributors to disease processes
