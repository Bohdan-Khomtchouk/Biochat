TITLE
The chicken immature erythrocyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation is impacted by multiple layers of genome organization. Here, we  identified and mapped out all the transcriptionally active chromosomal domains in the chicken  immature erythrocyte genome, including the known β- and α-globin domains, by combining a  powerful chromatin fractionation method with next generation DNA and RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of total RNA were sequenced to characterize genes in chicken erythrocyte cells

PLATFORM
GPL21224 AB 5500xl Genetic Analyzer (Gallus gallus)
