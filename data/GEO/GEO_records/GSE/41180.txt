TITLE
mRNA profiles of WTAP siRNA-treated HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the role of WTAP in splicing regulation, we performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on RNA isolated from control, WTAP or Virilizer siRNA-treated HUVECs, yielding 12 million uniquely mapped 75nt pair-end tags from each sample. MapSplice software was used for differential expression and differences in transcript splice junctions .

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of control, WTAP or Virilizer siRNA-treated HUVECs were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAII.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
