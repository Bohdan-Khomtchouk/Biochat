TITLE
The alterations of gene expression in aortic valve from calcific aortic valve disease patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness resulting in development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD); however, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification are poorly understood. Here, we investigated gene expressions in relation to valvular calcification and promotion of CAVD progression.

DESIGN
3 samples of aortic valve from patients with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) were compared with 3 samples of aortic valve from age-matched normal subjects
