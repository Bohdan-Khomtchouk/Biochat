TITLE
Opposite Imp/Syp temporal gradients govern birth time-dependent neuronal fates

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Generating diverse neurons involves spatially distinct neural stem cells that show age dependent developmental fates. Drosophila neuroblasts produce long, diverse yet stereotyped series of distinct neurons, called lineages. We searched for novel temporal factors that could pattern such extended lineages by RNA-sequencing of specific neuroblasts at various developmental times. We found that two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, display opposing high-to-low and low-to-high temporal gradients with distinct dynamics in specific lineages. Manipulating Imp/Syp levels in mushroom body neuroblasts revealed opposing roles in the specification of early and late temporal fates, primarily via regulation of Chinmo translation. This study implicates the opposing Imp/Syp gradients as temporal morphogens that encode stem cell age and govern birth time-dependent offspring cell fate through post-transcriptional regulation of temporal dentity genes.
