TITLE
RNA-seq of HDAC2-disrupted 293FT cells by CRISPR-Cas9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional functions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 are largely viewed as repressive through their association in corepressor complexes, however, the unique functions and targets of HDAC2 are less well understood. We have utilized HDAC2-null cells to distinguish the role of HDAC2 in human cells and identify uniqye HDAC2 targets.

DESIGN
HDAC2-null 293FT cells were created via CRISPR-Cas9 targeting and analyzed by RNA-seq for differential expression.

PLATFORM
