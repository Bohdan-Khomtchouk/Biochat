TITLE
Serpinb3a contributes to early skin inflammation following allergen exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Serpinb3a knockout mice show attenuated Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and S100A8 expression (an early inflammatory marker) following treatment with Aspergillus fumigatus extract. The aim of the RNAseq experiments was to provided mechanistic insight for the role of Serpinb3a by identifying early differences in gene expression following allergen exposure.

DESIGN
Wild type Balb/c and Serpinb3a null mouse backs were shaved and 24 hours later a patch containing 200ug of Aspergillus fumigatus extract was applied to the skin. After 3 days the patch was removed and the skin was harvested after an additional 24 hours.

PLATFORM
