TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in Omental Adipose Tissue of Morbidly Obese Diabetic African Americans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose tissues play an important role in the pathophysiology of obesity-related disease including type 2 diabetes. To describe gene expression patterns and functional pathways in obesity-related type 2 diabetes, we performed global transcript profiling of omental adipose tissue in morbidly obese individuals with or without diabetes.

DESIGN
Fourteen (14) morbidly obese diabetics (cases) and 6 morbidly obese non-diabetics (reference) were included in this study.
