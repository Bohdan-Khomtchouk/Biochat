TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing in wild and domesticated tomato species

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum ; Solanum pimpinellifolium ; Solanum pennellii ; Solanum habrochaites

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of seedlings of four tomato species Solanum habrochaites, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum pimpinelliolium, and Solanum pennellii. An additional panel of samples include many tissues from Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum pennellii in two light conditions
