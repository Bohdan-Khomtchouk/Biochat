TITLE
Gene expression profiling of retrovirus PDGFB-induced glioma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profilings of platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB)-induced mouse glioma to compare the differential transcriptome profiles between Ctrl-T tumor cells and Olig2cKO tumor cells.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO brain tumor (glioma) cells, normal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), normal astrocytes, and normal brain cortex by high-throughput sequencing.

PLATFORM
