TITLE
Expression data of porcine mammary glands from late pregnancy to peak lactation.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Sow milk yield and quality is crucial for the survival and growth of piglets. Mammary epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, milk component production and galactopoietic hormone and cytokine synthesis result from the quantities of differentially expressed genes. This study used the Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip to acquire a comprehensive picture of transcriptional adaptations in the mammary glands of lactating sows.

DESIGN
Mammary tissue samples were collected from six sows at -17, 1 and 17 d relative to parturition. Mammary tissues from two sows were used to extract RNA and were subsequently pooled in equal volumes. Nine pooled samples were hybridized to porcine Affymetrix GeneChips.
