TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans: Control (0 h starvation) vs. induction of starvation (12 h and 24 h) for WT, delta xprG and delta atmA

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing starvation for 0 (reference), 12 and 24 h. The main objective was to identify genes specifically regulated during starvation by atmA and xprG. The results of the experiment were further validated by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Experimental procedure: Three A. nidulans strains were used in this study: WT, delta atmA and delta xprG. Strains were grown on minimal medium for 24 h (0 h starvation reference), then exposed to 12 and 24 h starvation. atmA: ATM, Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated; Malavazi, I., Savoldi, M., Da Silva Ferreira, M.
