TITLE
The transcriptome of anthers of  rice gamyb mutant expressing various GAMYB homologs was measured at the microspore stage.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To confirm the function of the GAMYB homologs for Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens in rice cells, we examined the expression profile in the anthers of transgenic plants, which OsGAMYB, SmGAMYB, or PpGAMYB2 is expressed under the control of the rice GAMYB promoter in rice gamy mutant.

DESIGN
Expression profiling was conducted using rice 4x44K microarray RAP-DB (G2519F#15241). The microarray was used to profile gene expression in OsGAMYB:OsGAMYB, OsGAMYB:SmGAMYB, OsGAMYB:PpGAMYB2 and vector transgenic plants. To assess the reproducibility of the microarray analysis, each microarray experiment was performed twice using RNA samples that had been isolated independently (i.e., two biological replicates), and included a dye-swapping test as a technical replicate for each biological replicate.
