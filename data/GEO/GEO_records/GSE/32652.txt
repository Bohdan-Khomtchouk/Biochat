TITLE
The transcriptome of anthers of  rice gamyb mutant expressing various GAMYB homologs was measured at the microspore stage.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To confirm the function of the GAMYB homologs for Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens in rice cells, we examined the expression profile in the anthers of transgenic plants, which OsGAMYB, SmGAMYB, or PpGAMYB2 is expressed under the control of the rice GAMYB promoter in rice gamy mutant.
