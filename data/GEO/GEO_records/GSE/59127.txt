TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of single cells extracted from E12.5 embryonic kidneys.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used micro-dissection and trypsinization techniques to isolate single cells from the Embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) total kidney. A subset of these single cell populations is analysed individually via Fluidigm single cell analysis. This analysis will determine the transcriptional profile of each cell type, identify compartment specific transcripts, compartment specific transcript isoforms and cell-type specific long-noncoding RNAs. In addition the unbiased nature of RNA-SEQ will potentially identify novel transcripts that have not been annotated in the database.

DESIGN
E12.5 kidneys are dissected; the kidneys are made into a single cell suspension via trypsinization.  A subset of these cells is analysed individually via Fluidigm C1 single cell analysis.  The long term goal is to generate a single cell resolution transcriptional atlas of the developing kidney.
