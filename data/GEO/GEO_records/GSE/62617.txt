TITLE
MOF regulates cell cycle progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We utilized primary MEFs to further delineate the role of MOF in proliferating cells and demonstrate that MOF directly activates genes required for cell cycle progression.

DESIGN
MEFs of both genders are conditionally depleted of MOF using the Cre-Lox system. Consequences at the transcriptional level are assessed using the Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array by Affymetrix
