TITLE
The MLL3/MLL4 branch of the COMPASS family regulates H3K4 monomethylation at enhancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) can be mono-, di-, and trimethylated by members of the COMPASS (COMplex of Proteins ASsociated with Set1) family from yeast to human and these modifications can be found at distinct regions of the genome. Monomethylation of histone H3K4 (H3K4me1) is relatively more enriched at metazoan enhancer regions compared to trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3), which are found at transcription start sites in all eukaryotes. Our recent studies in Drosophila demonstrated that the Trithorax-related (Trr) branch of the COMPASS family regulates enhancer activity and is responsible for the implementation of H3K4me1 at these regions. There are six COMPASS family members in mammals, two of which, MLL3 and MLL4, are most closely related to Drosophila Trr. Here, we use ChIP-seq of this class of COMPASS family members in both human HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells and find that MLL4 is preferentially found at enhancer regions. MLL3 and MLL4 are frequently mutated in cancer, and indeed, the widely used HCT116 cancer cell line contains inactivating mutations in the MLL3 gene. Using HCT116 cells in which MLL4 has also been knocked out, we demonstrate that MLL4 is a major regulator of H3K4me1 in these cells, with the greatest loss of monomethylation at enhancer regions. Moreover, we found a redundant role between Mll3 and Mll4 in enhancer H3K4 monomethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblast  (MEF) cells. These findings suggest that mammalian MLL3/MLL4 function in the regulation of enhancer activity and enhancer-promoter communication during gene expression and that mutations of MLL3 and MLL4 found in cancer could exert their properties through enhancer malfunction.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells for MLL4. ChIP-seq of MLL4 and p300 in human parental HCT116 cells. ChIP-seq of H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in parental HCT116 cells  and HCT116 cells with Mll4âˆ†set.
