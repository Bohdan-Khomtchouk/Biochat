TITLE
JAK/STAT coordinates cell proliferation during disc regeneration with Dilp8-mediated developmental delay in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Regeneration of fragmented Drosophila imaginal discs occurs in an epimorphic manner, involving local cell proliferation at the wound site. Following disc fragmentation, cells at the wound site activate a restoration program through wound healing, regenerative cell proliferation and repatterning of the tissue. However, the interplay of signaling cascades, driving these early reprogramming steps, is not well understood. Here we profiled the transcriptome of regenerating cells in the early phase within twenty-four hours after wounding. We found that JAK/STAT signaling becomes activated at the wound site and promotes regenerative cell proliferation in cooperation with Wingless (Wg) signaling. In addition, we demonstrated that the expression of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 8 (dilp8), which encodes a paracrine peptide to delay the onset of pupariation, is controlled by JAK/STAT signaling in early regenerating discs. Our findings suggest that JAK/STAT signaling plays a pivotal role in coordinating regenerative disc growth with organismal developmental timing.

DESIGN
In order to analyze transcriptome change in early regenerating imaginal disc, Drosophila prothorasic leg discs were fragmented (to anterior one-quarter or posterior three-quarters) and cultured ex vivo in adult fly abdomen. Regenerating cells in early regeneration phase (at 12 or 24 hours after wounding) were subjected to transcriptome profiling with Affymetrix microarrays. For control samples, the corresponding regions of uncut-cultured discs and uncut-uncultured discs were used.
