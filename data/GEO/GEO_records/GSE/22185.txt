TITLE
Array CGH analysis of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most important mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.  The vast majority of GISTs exhibit activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA, but epigenetic alteration of GISTs is largely unknown.  In this study, we aimed to clarify the involvement of DNA methylation in GIST malignancy. A total of 25 GIST specimens were studied using Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 105A (G4412A, Agilent).  Levels of LINE-1 methylation were analyzed using bisulfite-pyrosequencing.  LINE-1 hypomethylation was correlated with risk grade, and high-risk GISTs exhibited lower levels of LINE-1 methylation than low- or intermediate-risk GISTs.  Array CGH analysis revealed a significant correlation between LINE-1 hypomethylation and chromosomal aberrations.  Our data suggest that LINE-1 hypomethylation correlates with the aggressiveness of GISTs.  Hypomethylation may increase the malignant potential of GISTs by inducing accumulation of chromosomal aberrations.

DESIGN
A total of 25 surgically obtained human gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) was analyzed using Agilent CGH microarray. Copy number aberration was compared with clinicopathological features and DNA methylation status.
