TITLE
Mouse intestinal crypt epithelial cells: Apc+/Δ716 mice vs. Apc+/Δ716 Id2-/- compound mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse intestinal crypt epithelial cells comparing Apc+/Δ716 mice with Apc+/Δ716 Id2-/- mice.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, Apc+/Δ716 mice vs. Apc+/Δ716 Id2-/- mice, Biological replicates: 1 pooled intestinal crypt epithelium from 3 Apc+/Δ716 mice, 1 pooled intestinal crypt epithelium from 3 Apc+/Δ716 Id2-/- mice. One replicate per array.
