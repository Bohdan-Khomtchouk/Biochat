TITLE
Transcript profiling of drought responsiveness in two contrasting rice genotypes during vegetative stage stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice (Oryza sativa), the major staple food crop is being cultivated under varying ecosystems ranging from irrigated lowland to rainfed upland environments.  Improvement in the rice production under drought prone unfavourable environment depends on the development of drought tolerant genotypes which needs thorough understanding of physiological and molecular events behind the tolerance mechanism. There is considerable genetic variation for drought tolerance mechanism within the cultivated gene pool. To understand the diversity of drought response, two indica rice genotypes namely, i) Apo,  an up-land drought tolerant indica veriety from Philippines and ii) IR64, a popular high yielding drought susceptible genotype were selected for this study. We used the 22K rice Oligoarray from Agilent technologies to study the transcript profile in the leaves of the two contrasting rice genotypes under control and drought stressed conditions during vegetative phase.
