TITLE
Expression data from short-time cultured primary cells derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time course comparison to tissue origin and with control cell line HT29 derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Status of expression pattern is different in adenocarcinoma of each patient. Human tumor cells extensively changes their gene- and protein expression patterns during their cultivation, clonal selection and expansion, thereby loosing many of the characteristics of their primary origin. In this study we analyzed if these expression changes could be circumvented by using short-term primary cell culture models derived from colorectal cancer patients. We compared several primary cells from tumor tissues using a standardized protocol which yielded similar cell populations. For monitoring the gene expression changes induced by cell preparation and cultivation we collected the tissues immediately after resection and isolated cells before seeding, and after 24 and 72 hours of cultivation from each patient. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Reference tissue, viable primary cells, and cells of cell line HT29 were selected at indicated times, total RNA's were preparated and amplified to biotinylated cRNA for microarray analysis using high-density HG-U133plus 2.0 GeneChipsÂ® from Affymetrix.
