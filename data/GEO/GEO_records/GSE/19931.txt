TITLE
Overexpression of miR-483-3p in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HaCaT human keratinocytes were transfected with pre-miR-483-3p or pre-miR-NC. RNA samples were harvested 48h post-transfection and mRNA profiles were determined with pan genomic arrays. Two biological replicates were performed for each comparison. Data were normalized using a dye-swap method.

DESIGN
HaCaT transfection of pre-miR-483-3p (3p) or pre-miR-NC (NC) at 48h in a dye-swap experiment.
