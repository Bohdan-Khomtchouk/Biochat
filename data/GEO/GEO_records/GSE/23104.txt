TITLE
DNA microarrays (time course) in the iPS process treated with microRNA clusters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Treatment with MicroRNA cluster B and C increase the iPS efficiency We used microarrays to identify changes induced by MicroRNA clusters in the iPS process

DESIGN
One group were MEFs infected with SKO factors, plus MicroRNA cluster B, C or control blank virus. The other group were MEFs infected with MicroRNA cluster B, C or control blank virus only.TRIZOL cell lysates were prepared at D4 and D8.
