TITLE
DNA damage regulation and its role in drug-related phenotypes in the malaria parasites. [genomic DNA]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The goal of our study is to characterize the global transcriptional resposne of P.falciparum to DNA damageing agents. Alongside, we stidied the epigenetic regulation  of DNA damage resposne in parasite. Further, we studied the mecanism which underlined the ARMD (mutator) phenotype of P. falciparum.

DESIGN
In order to elucidate the transcriptiona resposne to DNA damage,  P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were treated with 4 perturbating agents for 6 hours. We mapped the global nucleosome occupancy for 3 most responsive histone modifications to DNA damage by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarray (ChIP-on-chip). In order to identify the transcriptional similarities between artemesinin and MMS, we carried out 6 hours of artemesinin treatment in triplicates and compared with triplicate dataset of MMS.
