TITLE
Grape berry: control vs late harvest techniques (late harvest, DMR-A, DMR-B)

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing control berries (sampled at Traditional harvest, TH) with berries sampled after the application of different post-harvest techniques (late-harvest LH; double reasoned maturation-A, DMR-A; double reasoned maturation-B, DMR-B)

DESIGN
Comparison of Grape berries subjected to three different post-harvest techniques (LH, DMR-A, DMR-B) versus Grape berries sampled at traditional harvest (TH). Comparisons were as follows: LH berries versus TH berries (2 biological replicates), DMR-A berries versus TH berries (2 biological replicates, only one dye-swapped), DMR-B berries versus TH berries (2 biological replicates, only one dye-swapped).
