TITLE
miRNA expression in AML and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy with a dismal outcome in the majority of cases. A detailed understanding of the genetic alterations and gene expression changes that contribute to its pathogenesis is important to improve prognostication, disease monitoring, and therapy. The expression of 636 human miRNAs was compared between samples from 52 patients with AML and 13 healthy individuals by locked nucleic acid (LNA) based microarray technology. 143 miRNAs were expressed at detectable levels, and  64 of these were significantly differentially expressed between AML and healthy peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or CD34+ cells.

DESIGN
52 AML, 5 peripheral blood (PB), 5 bone marrow (BM), and 3 CD34+ cell samples from healthy donors were subjected to miRNA microarray analysis.
