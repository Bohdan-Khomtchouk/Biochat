TITLE
Gene expression data from CD14++ CD16- classical monocytes from healthy volunteers and patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of peripheral immune cells can provide a wealth of information. Classical CD14++ CD16- monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and profiled for differential gene expression using Affymetrix human Genechips 2.1 U133.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed genes were identified comparing gene expression profiles between healthy and PDAC.
