TITLE
miRNAs in flowers of Viburnum macrocephalum f. keteleeri

ORGANISM
Viburnum macrocephalum f. keteleeri

SUMMARY
High-throughput small RNA sequencing were performed to identify a large number of miRNAs and their targets in fertile and sterile flowers of V. macrocephalum f. keteleeri for the first time. We ascertained that the regulatory networks of the miRNAs are involved in many different primary biological processes based on potential target designations. Our study is the first to provide useful information for uncovering the regulatory networks of miRNAs in  V. macrocephalum f. keteleeri flowers.
