TITLE
Bovine Day 15 Extra-embryonic membrane (EEM): Male and Female Control vs. Male and Female CSF2 Methylation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We aimed to study the effects of CSF2 treatment on the methylome of the Day 15 female and male embryo.

DESIGN
Methylomic profiling of bovine extra-embryonic membrane at Day 15 post-insemination produced by IVF. Oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro using a single Holstein bull. After 5 days in vitro culture, the embryos were either treated with 10 ng/ml bovine recombinant CSF2 or the Control (DPBS/BSA) until Day 7. At Day 7, the embryos were transferred into recipients. At day 15 following insemination, embryos were flushed and collected for total RNA and gDNA extraction. The gender of the embryos were determined by PCR prior to microarray analysis. CSF2 males were compared to Control males while CSF2 females were compared to Control females
