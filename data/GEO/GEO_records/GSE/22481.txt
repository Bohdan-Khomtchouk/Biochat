TITLE
CGH profiles of primary breast carcinomas from HBOC (Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer) families

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
89 tumors from women that were eligible for, and subjected to, routine diagnostic testing according to the HBOC criteria but were negative for pathogenic BRCA1/2-mutations or carried an UV in either BRCA1/2

DESIGN
A BRCA2-classifier was built using array-CGH profiles of 28 BRCA2-mutated and 28 sporadic breast tumors. The classifier was validated on an independent group of 19 BRCA2-mutated and 19 sporadic breast tumors. Subsequently, we tested 89 breast tumors from suspected hereditary breast (and ovarian) cancer (HBOC) families, in which either no BRCA1/2 mutation or an UV had been found by routine diagnostics.
