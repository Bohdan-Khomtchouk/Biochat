TITLE
Ectopic expression of Foxp3 and UBD in Th cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression analysis revealed that UBD is a down-stream element of Foxp3 in human activated regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg). Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Comparison of expression profiles measured in naturally occuring regulatory T-cells (Treg), Foxp3 and UBD transformed Th cells versus their controls with respect to the observed regulatory phenotype.
