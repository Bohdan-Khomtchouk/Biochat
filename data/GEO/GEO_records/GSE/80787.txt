TITLE
Developmental nicotine mediated gene expression and epigenetic change effects on neuronal structure and behavior [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developmental nicotine exposure causes persistent changes in cortical neuron morphology and in behavior. We used microarray screening to identify master transcriptional or epigenetic regulators mediating these effects of nicotine

DESIGN
mRNA prepared from dissected cortical tissue from mice that were administered saccharin or nicotine from conception through weaning at postnatal day 21 (pre- & postnatal period), and that were then allowed to remain nicotine-free until 3 months of age
