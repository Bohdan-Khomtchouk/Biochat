TITLE
C57BL/6 Benchmark Set for Early Cardiac Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timed matings were performed using C57BL/6 mice and pregnant females sacrificed starting at embryonic day (E) 10.5, and then in daily intervals until E14.5.  Gene expression was be further analyzed at E16.5 and E18.5, to monitor changes in gene expression related to maturation of the heart.  At stage 10.5, the rostral and caudal parts of the embryo were removed and the middle part, which includes the heart, was subjected to expression analysis.  From embryonic day 11.5 on, we isolated embryonic hearts and separated the ventricular from the atrial chambers. Keywords = heart Keywords = development Keywords = cardiac Keywords: time-course
