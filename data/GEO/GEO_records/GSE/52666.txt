TITLE
Distinct gene expression profiles between overt GIST and miniGIST

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In contrast to the paucity of clinic GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumor; 0.0014 % happening rate), there is a more than twenty thousand times higher rate for miniGISTs, about ~30% of human population could be identified to have miniGISTs. Exploring the molecular differences between miniGISTs and overt GISTs will help us to understand the transformation mechanisms along with GIST progression, but C-kit and PDGFRA mutations analysis failed to identify the differences between these two groups.   Conclusion: miniGISTs have significant distinct gene expression profile with overt GISTs by both unsupervised and supervised analysis. Our finding indicated that c-kit and DOG1 expression are the very early events in the genesis of miniGIST and overt GIST, and miniGIST is a molecular distinct group with overt GIST.

DESIGN
Within our study, we collected six miniGISTs with diameter less than 1cm from autopsies and seven overt GISTs from clinic, performed the first system-wide gene expression profiling of miniGISTs and overt GISTs by 3â€™end RNA Sequencing, and further compared the expression profiles between these two groups.
