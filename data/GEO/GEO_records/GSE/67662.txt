TITLE
FOXO1/3 and PTEN Depletion in Granulosa Cells Promotes Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Forkhead Box, FOXO1 and FOXO3, transcription factors regulate multiple functions in mammalian cells. Selective inactivation of the Foxo1 and Foxo3 genes in murine ovarian granulosa cells severely impairs follicular development and apoptosis causing infertility, and as shown herein, granulosa cell tumor (GCT) formation. Coordinate depletion of the tumor suppressor Pten gene in the Foxo1/3 strain enhanced the penetrance and onset of GCT formation

DESIGN
A direct comparison of ovarian granulosa cells from wild type d25 and FOXO/PTEN knockout granulosa cell tumors.
