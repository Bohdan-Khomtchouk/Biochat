TITLE
Expression data from rice seedlings of wild type and the CHR729 mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to study the function of CHR729 in rice, the T-DNA insertion mutant of CHR729 was obtained and analysed.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 11-day-old seedlings of both wild type (Hwayoung) and CHR729 mutant plants. Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice Genome Array hybridization was performed with three biological replicates. Data was analyzed with SAM Excel add-in and in-house perl scripts. Results showed that 254 genes are up-regulated, and 345 genes are down-regulated (with q – value at 5%).
