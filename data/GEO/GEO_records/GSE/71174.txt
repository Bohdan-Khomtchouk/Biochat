TITLE
Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 arrays of RNA extracted from gastrocnemius muscle of 4 global Ppp3cb KO mice and 4 corresponding WT littermates, and  4 skeletal muscle-specific Ppp3r1Mlc1fCre KO and 4 corresponding WT littermates.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global deficiency of catalytic subunit Ppp3cb, and tissue-specific ablation of regulatory subunit Ppp3r1 from skeletal muscle but not adipose tissue or liver led to protection from high-fat diet induced obesity and comorbid sequel√¶. Ser637 hyperphosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in skeletal muscle of calcineurin-deficient mice was associated with mitochondrial elongation into power-cable shaped filaments, increased mitochondrial respiration, but attenuated exercise performance.

DESIGN
Mice used for microarray analyses were all male, and chronically exposed to HFD for at least 8 weeks.
