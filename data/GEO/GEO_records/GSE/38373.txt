TITLE
Identifying conserved and novel miRNAs in germinating seeds of Glycine max using deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of plant development. In soybean (Glycine max), an important edible oil crop, valuable lipids are synthesized and stored in the cotyledons during embryogenesis .This storage lipids are used as energy source of the emerging seeds, during the germination procces. Until now, there are no microRNAs related to lipid metabolism in soybean or any other plant. This work aims to describe the miRNAome of germinating seeds of B. napus by identifying plant-conserved and novel miRNAs and comparing miRNA abundance in mature versus germinating seeds. A total of 183 familes were detected through a computational analysis of a large number of reads obtained from deep sequencing from  two small RNA libraries of (i) pooled germintaing seeds stages and (ii) mature soybean seeds. We have found 39 new mirna precursors which produce 41 new mature forms. The present work also have identified isomiRNAs and mirnas offset (moRNAs). This work presents a comprehensive study of the miRNA transcriptome of soybean germinating seeds and will provide a basis for future research on more targeted studies of individual miRNAs and their functions in lipid consumption in development soybean seeds.

DESIGN
MicroRNA profiles in 2 different seed libraries (mature seeds and a pool of germinating seed stages) of Glycine max by deep sequencing (Illumina GAII).

PLATFORM
GPL11192 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Glycine max)
