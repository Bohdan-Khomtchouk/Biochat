TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 3T3-L1 cells treated with Interleukin-15 (IL-15)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were either treated 0ng/ml or 500ng/ml rmIL-15 for 24 hours (n=3/group)

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profilling performed in vitro using recombinant murine (rm)IL-15 treated (500ng/ml) and untreated (control) 3T3-L1 cells. Equal amounts of total RNA per subject were used in the assay.
