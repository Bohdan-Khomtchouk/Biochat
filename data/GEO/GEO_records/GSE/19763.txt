TITLE
Genome-wide FLP/MYB88 binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
FLP and MYB88 are two paralogous MYB proteins, regulating the symmetric division of guard mother cell during Arabidopsis stomatal development. To understand their molecular functions, we performed genome-wide identification of FLP/MYB88 binding targets using ChIP-chip with FLP/MYB88 antibody. By comparing ChIP-chip between wild-type and flp-1 myb88 lines, a total genes were identified as putative direct targets for FLP/MYB88.

DESIGN
Ten-day old wild-type and flp-1 myb88 Arabidopsis green tissues were used for ChIP. Rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing FLP and MYB88 proteins was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation
