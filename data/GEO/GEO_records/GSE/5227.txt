TITLE
Stress-specific role of the fission yeast Gcn5 acetylatransferase in programming a subset of stress-response genes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have found Gcn5 is specifically requried for KCl and CaCl2 mediated stress in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe. We have charaterised the genome wide gene expression responses to KCl stress and show the Gcn5 in involved in the regulation of sebset of stress response genes. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Four subsets is included: 1 gcn5 mutant compared to wt under rich medium without treatement, 2 gcn5 mutant compared to wild type both under KCl treatment, 3 wild type 15min treatment with KCl compared to non-treated, 4 Wild type 60min KCl treatement compared to non-treated. Gene expression profiling experiment in which gene expression in logarithmically growing cultures of test group was compared to that control in rich medium at 25C.RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA expression profiling analysis using the established protocols (Xue et al, 2004). Independent RNA preparations were used to hybridise to microarray slides with dye swap. Data normalized with 'Lowess' per chip per spot normalization.
