TITLE
Medaka larvae were exposed to HBCD

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
Recently, omics techniques have been widely applied to the discovery of potential bio-markers and explore triggering mechanism. To get a more comprehensive diagnosis of HBCD impacts on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), the larvae (within 24 hours post-hatch) were exposed to gradient doses of HBCD. After exposure for 7 days, the profiles of genes expression were examined using a custom-commercial 26, 430-oligonucleotide arrays (4Ã—44K) of Japanese medaka which is shared much genomic information with marine medaka.At the end of the treatment period, 30 larvae/sample were pooled for RNA extraction and labeled by One-Color. A total of twelve independent arrays: three control (DMSO), three low-concentration HBCD (0.2 nM) exposures, three medium-concentration HBCD (2 nM) exposures, and three high-concentration HBCD (20 nM) exposures.
