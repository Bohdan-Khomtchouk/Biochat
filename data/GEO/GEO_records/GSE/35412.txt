TITLE
Identification and pathway analysis of microRNAs with no previous involvement in breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA expression signatures can differentiate normal and breast cancer tissues and can define specific clinico-pathological phenotypes in breast tumors. In order to further evaluate the microRNA expression profile in breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of 667 microRNAs in 29 tumors and 21 adjacent normal tissues using TaqMan Low-density arrays. 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (adjusted P value=0.05, Fold Change=2) in breast tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue. Importantly, the role of 43 of these microRNAs has not been previously reported in breast cancer, including several evolutionary conserved microRNA*, showing similar expression rates to that of their corresponding leading strand.

DESIGN
The procedure begins with the retro-transcription of 70ng of total RNA with stem-loop primers to obtain a cDNA template. A pre-amplification step was included in order to increase the concentration of the original material and to detect microRNAs that are expressed at low levels. The pre-amplified product was loaded into the TaqManÂ® Low Density Arrays and amplification signal detection was carried out using the 7900 FAST real time thermal cycler (ABI). A total of 29 tumor and 21 normal samples (two pools: one containing five samples, other containing 12 samples, plus 4 independent normal samples) were analyzed. 23 tumors and the two normal pools were processed by triplicate, representing 82% of the total samples.
