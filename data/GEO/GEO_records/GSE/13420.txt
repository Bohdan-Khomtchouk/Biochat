TITLE
Significant and Systematic Expression Differentiation in Long-Lived Yeast Strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The three yeast mutants sch9Δ, ras2Δ, tor1Δ show extended chronological life span up to three folds. This study aims to dissect the mechanisms that lead to the yeast life span extension. Keywords: Expression comparison between wild type and long-lived yeast mutant strain
