TITLE
Lethality of MalE-LacZ hybrid protein shares mechanistic attributes with oxidative component of antibiotic lethality

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MC4100

SUMMARY
This study examines stress responses following lethal induction of a MalE-LacZ hybrid protein

DESIGN
E coli MC4100 cells bearing a MalE-LacZ hybrid protein under a maltose promoter (MM18) were grown in M63 medium and induced with 0.2% maltose. Cells were incubated for at 37C with shaking and sampled hourly over 5 hr for RNA extraction.
