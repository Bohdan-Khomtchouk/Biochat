TITLE
A secreted effector protein of Ustilago maydis guides maize leaf cells to form tumors

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Zea mays transcriptome profiling of infected seedlings by the Ustilago maydis wildtype and the seedling specific effector mutant demonstrated the variation of gene expression in the mutant and the classes of genes that are absent in the mutant as compared to the wildtype U. maydis SG200 strain. Two dye competitive hybridizations were performed on Agilent Oligo arrays.

DESIGN
Comparison were done 1) with mock and infected samples at 6dpi. 2) between the two 6dpi infected samples with wildtype and the secreted effector mutant
