TITLE
Expression diversity between prostate cancer cell line PC3 and circulating tumor cell derived from PC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a group of cells detached from primary cancer and poured into blood. Compared with local cancer cells, CTCs display more invasive ability to colonize distant organs. During the process of releasing CTCs, not only morphogical changes in cancer cells, up/down regulation of some critical molecules may contribute to its potential to spread to other locations.

DESIGN
Total RNA of CTCs and its parental cell PC3 was extracted using Trizol reagent, then molecular hybridization was performed on Affymetrix microarrays. 3 times repetition were carried on for each group to improve credibility of expression profiles. Moreover, expression of PC3 was treated as control group.

PLATFORM
