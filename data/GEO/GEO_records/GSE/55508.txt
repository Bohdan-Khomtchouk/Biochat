TITLE
Chronological Aging of Yeast in SD medium

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast grown in synthetic complete medium (SD) until glucose depletion is aged chronologically. Cells are stressed by lacking of nutrients and accumulating toxic substances, and thus undergo gene expression changes in response to those. We performed microarray experiments to capture gene expression profiles of yeast cultured at 4 different time points.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae CENPK 113-7D strain was grown in SD medium (2% glucose). Yeast cells were harvested at Log phase, 2 days, 6 days and 10 days of cultivation for microarray analysis.  Each time point was perfromed in triplicate and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.
