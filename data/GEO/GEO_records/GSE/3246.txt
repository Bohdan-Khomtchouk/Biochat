TITLE
A serpin, SAS1, controls hormonal cross talk in the plant defense pathway

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A possible regulatory role for SAS1 was evaluated by examining gene expression patterns of SAS1-HA plants. Keywords: serpin overexpression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 weeks old wt and the over expression SAS1:HA line.  Data in this platform contains 6 repetitions including 2 independent biological experiments.

PLATFORM
GPL242 Arabidopsis The Keck Resource Lab 12K Array
