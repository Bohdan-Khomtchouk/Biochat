TITLE
cDNA aCGH study of whole genome amlification effect on analysis of FFPE microdissected human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
6 samples of FFPE breast cancer tissue, whole genome amplification methods tested for fidelity: 3 samples amplified by two techniques (SCOMP and DOP) and compaed to non amplified control, 3 samples amplified additionally by the better performing technique (SCOMP) Keywords: Pre-clinical method validation, whole genome amplification for use with aCGH

DESIGN
Histological sections microdissected, DNA extracted, subjected to whole genome amplification protocol and aCGH.

PLATFORM
GPL6478 University Health Network Microarray Centre 19k human cDNA microarray
