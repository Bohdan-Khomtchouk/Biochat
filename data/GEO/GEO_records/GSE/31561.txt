TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of organ-specific toxicity induced by a panPPAR agonist in mice: Identification of organ-specific toxicity biomarkers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we aim to identify candidate biomarkers which may be useful as surrogate indicators of toxicity for pre-clinical development of panPPAR-agonist drug candidates. Gene expression microarray, histopathology and clinical chemistry data were generated from liver, heart, kidney and skeletal muscles of three groups of mice administered with three different dosages of an experimental pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist, PPM-201, for 14 days. The histopathology and clinical chemistry data were compared with the gene expression analysis and candidate biomarker genes were identified.
