TITLE
Biological sex influences gene expressions in cardiac myocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Purpose:Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women, but not much is known about baseline differences in the heart between males and females Method: Adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) were isolated from male and female rats and then RNA was isolated and RNA sequencing was performed. Results: We identified ~ 600 transcripts that were differentially expressed in cardiac myocytes from either sex. We also observed that enriched pathways from this data set were sexually dimorphic

DESIGN
ARVMs were isolated, plated for 45 minutes and then frozen with liquid nitrogen. We had at least 5 biological replicates for each sex; n=6 males and n=5 females

PLATFORM
GPL18694 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Rattus norvegicus)
