TITLE
Expression data from yeast with modulated expression of base excision repair players

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of yeast to modulation of the expression of base excision repair players, these generate different dna lesions of abasic sites of strand breaks We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the DNA damage response in yeast Keywords: dose

DESIGN
Yeaststrains with different expression levels of players in base excision repair (in biological triplicate)  were grown to mid log phase. The expression responses were compared to each other and we have deciphered a gene expression profile that is specific for DNA damage in yeast.
