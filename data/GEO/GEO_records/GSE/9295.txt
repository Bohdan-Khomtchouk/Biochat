TITLE
Expression data from yeast with modulated expression of base excision repair players

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of yeast to modulation of the expression of base excision repair players, these generate different dna lesions of abasic sites of strand breaks We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the DNA damage response in yeast Keywords: dose
