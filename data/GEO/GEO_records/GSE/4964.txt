TITLE
Gene expression of RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS, ISO, PGE2, LPS PLUS ISO, and LPS PLUS PGE2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LPS plus ISO and LPS plus PGE2 had non-additive effects on gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells Keywords: time course

DESIGN
total RNA from RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Isoproterenol (ISO), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), LPS PLUS Iso, and LPS PLUS PGE2 vs total RNA from time_matched_control RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) cultured in media, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h time course with triplicates, with dyeSwap measurements on custom Ailgent Oligo arrays

PLATFORM
