TITLE
Expression profile from doxorubicine treated B16 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major huddle in chemotherapy. To identify cancer genes that contribute to chemoresistance, B16 mouse melanoma cells were used as a model. We used microarrays to decipher the specific gene regulation in doxorubicine treated B16 mouse melanoma cells. Keywords: Time course
