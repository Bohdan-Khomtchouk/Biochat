TITLE
Small RNA profiling of strains and lifecycle  of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
High throughput sequencing was used to investigate the production of small RNAs from  in Chlamydomonas in different strains and different stages of the life cycle.  The association between these and methylation was assessed using  genomic sequencing, comparing a sequenced genome with one enriched for methylated DNA sequence by immuno-precipitation.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA production in several strains and of the methylation of regions producing these small RNAs.

PLATFORM
GPL9152 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii)
