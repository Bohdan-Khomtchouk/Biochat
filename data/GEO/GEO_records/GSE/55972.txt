TITLE
Effect of Titanium dioxide nanoparticles on Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 genes expression

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional expression patterns of the model strain E. coli exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (NP-TiO2), under dark conditions by using a microarray. Expression profiles were compared to unexposed E.coli and ratio of expression were analysed.

DESIGN
Cell exposure to NP-TiO2 was conducted in 10 mM NaCl, E. coli bacterial suspension and NP-TiO2 stock suspension (or mQ water for the control) were added to the NaCl solution to obtain final concentrations of 10E7 cells/ml and 100 mg/l of TiO2 nanoparticles. The flasks were then incubated at 20Â°C on a dark rotary shaker for 5 h. Exposed NP-TiO2: 4 biological replicats. Control: 4 biological replicats.
