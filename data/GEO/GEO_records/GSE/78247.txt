TITLE
Analysis of gene-expression in normal, unmanipulated na誰ve (CD44lo/CD49dlo; CD5lo/CD5hi) and Virtual memory (CD44hi/CD49dlo) T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splenocytes from lymphoreplete, unmanipulated mice were analyzed for basal mRNA levels. We hypothesized, based on previous data from our lab and others, that many cytokine/inflammatory response genes would show an increase from na誰ve CD5lo < CD5hi < Virtual memory.

DESIGN
mRNA was analyzed from mouse splenocytes separated into na誰ve CD5lo, na誰ve CD5hi, and virtual memory cells. Mice were lymphoreplete and unmanipulated.
