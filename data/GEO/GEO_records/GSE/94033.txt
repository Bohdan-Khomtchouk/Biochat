TITLE
SMYD5 regulates H4K20me3-marked heterochromatin to safeguard ES cell self-renewal and prevent spurious differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

SUMMARY
Epigenetic regulation of chromatin states is thought to control the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the roles of repressive histone modifications such as trimethylated histone lysine 20 (H4K20me3) in pluripotency and development are largely unknown. Here, we show that the histone lysine methyltransferase SMYD5 mediates H4K20me3 at heterochromatin regions. Depletion of SMYD5 leads to compromised self-renewal, including dysregulated expression of OCT4 targets, and perturbed differentiation. SMYD5 bound regions are enriched with repetitive DNA elements. Knockdown of SMYD5 results in a global decrease of H4K20me3 levels, a redistribution of heterochromatin constituents including H3K9me3/2, G9a, and HP1Î±, and de-repression of endogenous retroelements. A loss of SMYD5-dependent silencing of heterochromatin nearby genic regions leads to upregulated expression of lineage-specific genes, thus contributing to the decreased self-renewal and accelerated differentiation of SMYD5-depeleted ES cells. Altogether, these findings implicate a role for SMYD5 in regulating ES cell self-renewal and H4K20me3-marked heterochromatin.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for H4K20me3, H3K9me3/2, HP1 in murine shLuc and shSmyd5 ES cells, and SMYD5 in ES cells.
