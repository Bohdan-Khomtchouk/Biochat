TITLE
Gene expression profiles in control and FOXC1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXC1 is a critical marker for basal-like breast cancer. To explore the role of FOXC1 in regulation of basal-like breast cancer cell function, we performed microarray assays and discovered that some known cancer-related genes were regulated by FOXC1.

DESIGN
We transfected a FOXC1 expression vector or the control vector into MDA-MB-231 cells, followed by microarray assays.
