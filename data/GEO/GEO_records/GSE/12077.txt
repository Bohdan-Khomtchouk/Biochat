TITLE
Androgen dependent gene expression profiling of the urogenital sinus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established during lineage commitment in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a readily manipulable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression changes in the murine prostate rudiment (Urogenital Sinus, UGS) at three time points during the first 48 hours of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding mesenchyme. Keywords: time course, prostate gland development

DESIGN
Differential gene expression was assessed by direct comparisons  of labeled moieties, using dye-swaps as technical replicates. Hybridizations were performed  on the Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) Whole Mouse Genome DNA microarray (mgug4122a). Three  different time points were analyzed using RNA pooled from different embryos: • UGS of female embryos upon 6 hours of androgen treatment compared to UGS of vehicletreated  mice (H6 comparison, 8 different slides); • UGS of female embryos upon 12 hours of androgen treatment compared to UGS of vehicletreated  mice (H12 comparison, 6 different slides); • UGS of male embryos compared to UGS of female embryos (MvsF comparison, 10 different  slides). Pools from male tissues were hybridized against pools from female litter-mates;
