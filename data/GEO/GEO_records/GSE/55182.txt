TITLE
Pneumococcus rolls epigenetic dice with a six phase random switch that controls virulence

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA form 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae which expressed only a single HsdS variant of the phase variable type I restriction modification system. Samples were from mid log exponential growth phase in standard glucose containing growth medium.

DESIGN
Examination of the mRNA profiles for evaluation of epigenetic regulation by a phase variable restriction modification system

PLATFORM
GPL18303 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Streptococcus pneumoniae)
