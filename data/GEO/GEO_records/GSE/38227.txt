TITLE
Activation of TGF-beta pathway by areca nut constituents: A possible cause of Oral submucous fibrosis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of areca nut constituents in manifestation of Oral submucous fibrosis, we studied gene expression profile in epithelial cells following areca nut water extract treatment. A comaprison with TGF-beta induced gene expression changes were performed as epithelial cells were predicted to be source of TGF-beta.

DESIGN
Control Vs Areca nut 5 ug/ml water extract (5H) (2), Contro Vs TGF-beta (2), Control Vs ALK5 (TbetaRI inhibitor) (2), Control Vs 5H + ALK5 inhibitor (2). (2)- Biological duplicates.
