TITLE
Gene expression profiling of laser capture microdissected prostate specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of laser capture microdissected normal non-neoplastic prostate (cystoprostatectomies) epithelial tissue and compared it to non-transformed and neoplastic low and high grade prostate epithelial tissue from radical prostatectomies, each with its immediately surrounding stroma.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling of laser capture microdissected tissue specimens from 12 low grade (Gleason 3+3) and 13 high grade (Gleason 8 and higher) radical prostatectomy (RP) and 5 cystoprostatectomy cases. For each RP case we took 6 regions of interest: tumor (T), PIN (P) and benign (B) epithelium each with its adjacent stroma (sT, sP, sB). For cystoprostatectomy we studied benign epithelium and adjacent stroma (H.B and H.sB).
