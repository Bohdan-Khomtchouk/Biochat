TITLE
The effects of UVB and the organic osmolyte betaine on rat epidermal keratinocytes in an organotypic culture system

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Betaine (trimethylglycine) is a non-toxic, highly water-soluble organic osmolyte widely used in skin care due to its assumed moisturizing and protective properties, but only few studies have addressed its specific effects in skin. Here, the cellular and molecular targets of betaine were analyzed by genome-wide expression analysis in organotypic cultures of rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK). In this model, we also examined whether betaine modifies the impacts of acute UVB exposure. The expression of several genes relevant to epidermal biology, proliferation/differentiation or malignancy as well as solute transport were verified by independent methods (qRT-PCR, western blotting). The data concerning changes in calcium metabolism after UVB exposure has been published separately (Bart et al., Br. J. Dermatol. 171:376-387, 2014).

DESIGN
Organotypic cultures of rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK) were prepared by plating cells on a collagen-coated insert (submerged in medium), lifting the confluent cell layer to the air-liquid interface 3 days after plating. These 3D cultures were divided in four treatment groups with three replicates in each: control, betaine (10 mM), UVB (30 mJ/cm2) and betaine + UVB. Betaine was added to the cultures for 11 days, starting from day 4 until sample collection. UVB exposure was performed 24 h prior to sample collection for 2-week-old 3D cultures with a well-formed epidermal layer. For further details on the experimental set-up and characteristics of the UV source, please refer to Bart et al. (Br. J. Dermatol. 171:376-387, 2014) and Rauhala et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 288:17999-18012, 2013).
