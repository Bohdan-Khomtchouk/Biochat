ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from cytoplasmic fractions of a fibrosarcoma immortalized cell line HT1080 derived from the connective tissue from a 35 year old male. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
