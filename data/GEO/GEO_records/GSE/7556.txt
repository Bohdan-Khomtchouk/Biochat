TITLE
Genetic changes in the evolution of multidrug resistance for cultured human ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were assessed for vincristine-sensitive parental ovarian tumor cell line (SKOV3) and its highly vincristine-resistant derivative (SKVCR 2.0) Keywords: vincristine, drug resistance, ovarian, SKOV3, MDR

DESIGN
Duplicate gene expression microarray experiments were undertaken for each of SKOV3 and SKVCR 2.0.  Comparative analysis between these two groups defined genes activated in vincristine resistance
