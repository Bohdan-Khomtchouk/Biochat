TITLE
Expression data from human cancer cells treated with UPR modulators under ER stress conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular defense mechanism against glucose deprivation, a cell condition that occurs in solid tumors. A key feature of the UPR is the activation of the transcription program that allows the cell to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We used micoarrays to show that the UPR transcription program is disrupted by the antitumor macrocyclic compound versipelostatin (VST) and antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin and phenformin, depending on cellular glucose availability. Keywords: stress response, drug response
