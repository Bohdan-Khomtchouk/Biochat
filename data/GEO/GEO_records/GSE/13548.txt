TITLE
Expression data from human cancer cells treated with UPR modulators under ER stress conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular defense mechanism against glucose deprivation, a cell condition that occurs in solid tumors. A key feature of the UPR is the activation of the transcription program that allows the cell to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We used micoarrays to show that the UPR transcription program is disrupted by the antitumor macrocyclic compound versipelostatin (VST) and antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin and phenformin, depending on cellular glucose availability. Keywords: stress response, drug response

DESIGN
Total 42 samples were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To induce the UPR, we treated cells (HeLa, HT-29, HT1080, MKN74) for 15 or 18 hours under ER stress conditions by replacing the medium with glucose-free medium or by adding either 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) or Tunicamycin (TM) to glucose-containing medium. UPR modulators (VST, biguanides or pyrvinium pamoate) were added at various final concentrations immediately after cells were placed in glucose-free medium or just before the chemical stressors were added to glucose-containing culture medium.
