TITLE
A Gene Expression Signature Predicts Survival of Patients with Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied a meta-analysis of datasets from seven different microarray studies on lung cancer for differentially expressed genes related to survival time (under 2 y and over 5 y). Systematic bias adjustment in the datasets was performed by distance-weighted discrimination (DWD). We identified a gene expression signature consisting of 64 genes that is highly predictive of which stage I lung cancer patients may benefit from more aggressive therapy. Keywords: disease state analysis
