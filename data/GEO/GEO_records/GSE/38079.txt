TITLE
Composition and organization of active centromere sequences in complex genomes

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We report the sequences bound to CENP-A in the dog genome (Canis familiaris) for high-throughput characterization of centromeric sequences. We compare these ChIPSeq reads (72 bp, single read) against a reference centromeric satellite DNA domain database for the dog genome, resulting in the annotation of sequence variation and estimated abundance of seven satellite families together with adjacent, non-satellite sequences.  To study global patterns of sequence diversity and characterizing the subset of sequences correlated with centromere function, these sequences were evaluated relative to a comprehensive centromere sequence domain k-mer library.  From this analysis, we identify functional sequence features from two satellite families (CarSat1 and CarSat2) that are defined by distinct arrays subtypes.
