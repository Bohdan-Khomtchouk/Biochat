TITLE
Genome-wide epigenetic analyses and Transcriptional analysis  in NB4 cells expressing PML-RARalpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina High-Throughput ChIP Sequencing profiling was performed using the H3K9K14ac antibody in NB4 cells treated with the compounds ATRA, MS-275,MC2392 (a hybrid molecule of ATRA with a 2-aminoanilide tail of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275) or solvent, DMSO. We find that MC2392 induces changes in H3 acetylation at a small subset of PML-RARÎ± binding sites but also in regions not regulated by ATRA. Moreover, MC2392 alters expression of a number of stress-responsive and apoptotic genes.

DESIGN
Genome-wide ChIP-seq was performed in NB4 cells for histone3 acetylated in K9K14
