TITLE
RNA-seq of SCLC PDX models treated with EP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the correlation of transcript abundance with response to EP in 19 PDX models of SCLC

DESIGN
Single-end RNA-seq was performend on fresh-frozen samples of 19 patient-derived xenografts, and transcript abundance was then correlated with sensitivity to EP in vivo.
