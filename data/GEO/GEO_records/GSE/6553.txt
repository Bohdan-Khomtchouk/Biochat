TITLE
Natural variation in gene expression between normal human individuals studied using Hu800 cDNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hu800 array has gene probes for signal transduction (322 genes), inflammatory responses (50 genes), chemokines and their receptors (12 genes) and Th1 and Th2 cytokines (20 genes). Along with these set of genes 325 genes have been selected based on their variation in expression levels between unrelated individuals as studied using Affymetrix HG U95Av2 arrays (Sharma et al, 2005). Keywords: Natural variation in gene expression between humans
