TITLE
Natural variation in gene expression between normal human individuals studied using Hu800 cDNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hu800 array has gene probes for signal transduction (322 genes), inflammatory responses (50 genes), chemokines and their receptors (12 genes) and Th1 and Th2 cytokines (20 genes). Along with these set of genes 325 genes have been selected based on their variation in expression levels between unrelated individuals as studied using Affymetrix HG U95Av2 arrays (Sharma et al, 2005). Keywords: Natural variation in gene expression between humans

DESIGN
Seven normal human individuals with age group of 22-34 years were recruited. These seven individuals comprised of three female individuals (F51, F52, F53) and four male individuals (M55, M56, M57 and M58). Ten pair wise comparisons were carried out between these unrelated individuals following a partial loop design
