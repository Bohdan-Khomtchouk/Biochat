TITLE
Gene expression signatures in a human bladder cancer cell line SW780 transfected with miR-137 precursor molecule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effect of miRNAs, we carried out a gene expression microarray analysis of SW780 cells transfected with a miR-137 precursor or a negative control.  We found that 1,326 probe sets (1,016 unique genes) were downregulated ( > 2-fold) by ectopic miR-137 expression, including the previously reported miR-137 target genes CDK6, CDC42 and AURKA.  Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that genes related to the cell cycle were significantly enriched among the affected genes.

DESIGN
SW780 cells were transfected with a Pre-miR-137 miRNA Precursor Molecule (Ambion) or Pre-miR miRNA Molecules Negative Control #1 (Ambion). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA extraction was carried out, and gene expression signatures were analyzed.
