TITLE
miRNA profiling in adult rat cardiomyocytes and myocyte-derived progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
TLDA miRNA profiling on purified rat cardiomyocytes (Myo) (Ctl) and myocyte-derived progenitor cells (MDCs) demonstrated significant dedifferentiation of myocytes and identity of stemness, cell cycle progression and proliferation in MDCs after continuous culture in mitogen-rich medium for about 2 weeks.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 batches of myocytes or MDCs; 100ug each was subjected to TLDA microRNA profiling after preamplification using ABI's kit. Cardiomyocyte (Myo, Ctl) was used as calibrator sample.
