Primary CNS lymphoma B cell receptors recognize CNS proteins

SUMMARY
Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (PCNSL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma confined to the CNS. In order to elucidate its peculiar organ tropism, we generated recombinant antibodies (recAb) identical with the BCR of a series of 23 PCNSL from immunocompetent patients.  While none of the recAb showed self-reactivity upon testing with common autoantigens, they recognized 1547 proteins present on a large-scale protein microarray. Interestingly, proteins recognized by the recAb are physiologically expressed by CNS neurons (GRINL1A, centaurin-α, BAIAP2). Furthermore, 87% (20/23) of the recAb including all antibodies derived from IGHV4 34 using PCNSL recognized galectin-3, which was upregulated on microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, and cerebral endothelial cells upon CNS invasion by PCNSL. Thus, PCNSL Ig may recognize CNS proteins as self-antigens. Their interaction may contribute to BCR signaling with sustained NF-κB activation and, ultimately, may foster tumor cell proliferation and survival. These data may also explain, at least in part, the affinity of the tumor cells of PCNSL to the CNS.
