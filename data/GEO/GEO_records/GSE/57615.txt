TITLE
Expression data from early rice endosperm

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularization and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Rice endosperm at 2 days after pollination(DAP) was selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the endosperm expression profile at 2 DAP. To that end, we hand-selected endosperm according to morphological criteria at 2 DAP before cellularization.
