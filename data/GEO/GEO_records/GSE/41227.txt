TITLE
Differentially Expressed Genes Regulating the Progression of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ to Invasive Breast Cancer (Group 4 Epithelial)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used gene expression profiling of human DCIS and IBC to discover uniquely expressed genes that may also regulate progression.

DESIGN
RNA from human samples were extracted, purified, amplified, and evaluated for gene expression using Affymetrix U133-X3P gene expression arrays.
