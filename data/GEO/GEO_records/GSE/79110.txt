TITLE
Zinc finger protein 521 overexpression is a feature of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia and contributes to the maintenance of myeloid differentiation block

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZNF521 is a multiple zinc finger transcription factor previously identified because abundantly and selectively expressed in normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. From microarray datasets, aberrant expression of ZNF521 has been reported in both pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with MLL gene rearrangements. However, a proper validation of microarray data is lacking, likewise ZNF521 contribution in MLL-rearranged AML is still uncertain. In this study, we show that ZNF521 is significantly upregulated in MLL translocated AML patients from a large pediatric cohort, regardless of the type of MLL translocations such as MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF10 and MLL-AF6 fusion genes. Our in vitro functional studies demonstrate that ZNF521 play a critical role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of MLL-rearranged cells. Furthermore, analysis of the ZNF521 gene promoter region shows that ZNF521 is a direct downstream target of both MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL fusion proteins. Gene expression profiling of MLL-AF9-rearranged THP-1 cells after depletion of ZNF521 reveals correlation with several expression signatures including stem cell-like and MLL fusion dependent programs. These data suggest that MLL fusion proteins activate ZNF521 expression to maintain the undifferentiated state and contribute to leukemogenesis. ZNF521 is required to block differentiation in MLL-rearranged AML cells

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured on Affymetrix in 3 independent experiments of THP-1 cells transfected with Lentiviral shRNA vector against ZNF521 (shZNF521) or control scrambled shRNA (shScram)
