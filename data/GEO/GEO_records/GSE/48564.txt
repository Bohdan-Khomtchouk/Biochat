TITLE
Expression data from mammary tumors from a MOLF/Ei x PyMT mouse cross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse genetic crosses were established between the PyMT model of metastatic breast cancer and MOLF/Ei strain. Tumors were harvested from the animals for gene expression analysis to identify genes associated with progression to distant metastatic disease.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 134 samples from the MOLF cross were assayed on Affymetrix chips.
