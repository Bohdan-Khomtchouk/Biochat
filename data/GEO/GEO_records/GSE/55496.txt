TITLE
Study of 1,4 Butanediol response in Escherichia coli DH1

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli DH1

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli DH1 cultures with treated with 6% 1,4 Butanediol for 1 hour and compared with untreated cultures The data from this experiment was used to identify a candidate for  further study as described in Szmidt et al 2013 Utilizing a highly responsive gene, yhjX, in E. coli based production of 1,4-Butanediol submitted to Chemical Engineering Science

DESIGN
4x72k E.coli gene expression microarrays were used to study the genes that are differentialy expressed in the strain DH1 grown in defined medoin and exposed to 6% 1,4 Butanediol for one hour at mid-log growth stage.

PLATFORM
