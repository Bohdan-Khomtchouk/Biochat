TITLE
Breast cancer and liver tissue biopsies used to develop and validate an index for liver contamination in metastatic breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PURPOSE: To develop an index capable of detecting and quantifying the extent of liver RNA contamination in liver biopsies of metastatic breast cancer METHODS: We developed a microarray-based gene expression liver index by comparing the expression levels of genes in liver tissue biopsies and in primary breast cancer biopsies.  The predictive performance of the index was then evaluated in defined mixtures of liver and breast cancer RNA.  A calibration curve was established to allow estimation of the liver RNA content in unknown metastatic breast cancer samples.

DESIGN
A set of liver biopsies and primary breast cancer biopsies were used to identify genes that were expressed significantly higher in liver tissue.  These genes were used in a liver index, which was validated in a new set of liver and primary breast cancer biopsies.  A set of liver/breast cancer RNA mixtures was used to establish a calibration curve to allow quantification of liver contamination in metastatic breast cancer samples.  The prediction error of the calibration curve was assessed in a new set of liver/breast cancer RNA mixtures and applied to estimate the liver content in a set of unknown metastatic breast cancer biopsies.
