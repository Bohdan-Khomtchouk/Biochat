TITLE
Down-regulation of SFRP1 in a mammary epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data to accompany Gauger et al. (2009) Cancer Cell International paper

DESIGN
A treated X untreated design was used whereby immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines (TERT cells) were modified to stably express an siRNA that knocked down SFRP1 expression.  These " treated " cells were labeled with Cy5 and four replicate harvests were hybridized to Agilent 4by44k whole genome microarrays, along with a Cy3 labeled untreated control.  The untreated control consisted of 4 pooled harvests of the parent cell line in normal growth conditions at 60-80% confluence.
