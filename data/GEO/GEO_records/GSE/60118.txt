TITLE
Inhalation exposure of hexanal in rats (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further development of insight into the mechanism of toxicity, it is important to employ whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to ientify genes with the potential to distinguish hexanal exposure across an exposure range relevant for toxicologic mechanisms. However, few reports have described the effect of hexanal on gene expression profiles using animal model. In this respect, we studied the expression profiles of mRNAs in hexanal-exposed in rats by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To evaluate the gene expression in lung tissue of rats after exposure of hexanal, Fischer-344 rats were inhaled to three concentrations (600, 1000, 1500 mg/m3) for 5 weeks. mRNA expression analysis was conducted using Rat GE(v3) 4X44K microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA).
