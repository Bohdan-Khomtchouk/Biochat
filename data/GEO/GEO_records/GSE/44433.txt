TITLE
Expression data from laser microdissected murine intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray  analyses of laser microdissected murine intestinal epithelial cells under the control of maternal inflammation at 17.5 days post conception demonstrates that maternal inflammation differentially regulates 2174 (iWT) and 3345 (iARE) genes in fetal tissue, but these transcriptional profiles  were overwritten in the postnatal environment dominated by tissue inflammation at 8 weeks postnatal. We isolated 50 ng total RNA out of laser microdissected fetal and adult intestinal epithelial cells from the distal ileum and performed microarrays to address whether maternal inflammation programs the fetal intestine towards TNF-driven pathology

DESIGN
Conventionally raised heterozygous TnfΔARE/+ and Tnf+/+ wild type mice on C57BL/6 background were used for this study. Female Tnf+/+ wild type (WT) mice were bred with male TnfΔARE/+ (ARE) mice and vice versa, generating offspring from healthy WT dams (WT and ARE) and inflamed ARE dams (iWT and iARE). On day 17.5 post conception (dpc) and 8 weeks postnatal the fetuses and offspring were sacrificed.The gut was freshly frozen in  Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) embedding compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, USA) on dry ice and stored at -80°C until laser microdissection.
