TITLE
Physical and functional interactions between the histone H3K4 demethylase JARID1A and the NuRD complex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone H3K4 methylation has been linked to transcriptional activation. JARID1A (also known as RBP2 or KDM5A), a member of the JARID1 protein family, is an H3K4 demethylase, previously implicated in the regulation of transcription and differentiation. Here we show that JARID1A is physically and functionally associated with two histone deacetylase complexes. Immunoaffinity purification of JARID1A confirmed a previously described association with the SIN3B-containing HDAC complex, and revealed an association with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Sucrose density gradient and sequential immunoprecipitation analyses further confirmed the stable association of JARID1A with these two HDAC complexes.  JARID1A depletion led to changes in the expression of hundreds of genes, two-thirds of which were also controlled by CHD4, the NuRD catalytic subunit. Gene ontology analysis confirmed that the genes commonly regulated by both JARID1A and CHD4 were categorized as developmentally regulated genes. ChIP analyses suggested that CHD4 controls chromatin association with JARID1A and modulates H3K4 levels at the promoter and coding regions of target genes. We further demonstrated that the C. elegans homologues of JARID1 and CHD4 function in the same pathway during vulva development. Taken together, these results suggest that JARID1A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes.
