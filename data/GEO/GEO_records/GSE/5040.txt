TITLE
Polyamides alleviate transcription inhibition associated with long GAA•TTC repeats in Friedreich’s ataxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphoblast cells from a patient with Freidriech's Ataxia were incubated with pyrrole-imidazole polyamides targeted to the GAA triplet repeat in the intron 1.  The polyamides were shown in cell culture to increase levels of endogenous frataxin mRNA.  A normal sibling derived lymphoblast cell line was used as a control. Keywords: human lymphoblast cells

DESIGN
Normal (GM15851) and patient (GM15850) cell lines were incubated in the presence of match polyamide FA1 at 1uM, 2uM or mismatch polyamide FA2 at 2uM for 7days prior to RNA purification and microarray analysis.
