TITLE
RNA profiling of mouse mammary tumor cell redirection in vitro model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed an in vitro system of cancer cell redirection that employs the 1:50 ratio of cancer cells to normal cells.  Using our in vitro system of cancer cell redirection we investigated the genetic profiles of erbB2-overexpressing mammary tumor-derived cells as they undergo the redirection phenomenon.

DESIGN
6 cell groups with measured in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
