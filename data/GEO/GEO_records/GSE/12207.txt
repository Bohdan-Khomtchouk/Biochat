TITLE
Biofilms and type III secretion are not mutually exclusive in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Biofilm formation and type III secretion have been shown to be reciprocally regulated in P. aeruginosa, and it has been suggested that factors related to acute infection may be incompatible with biofilm formation. We investigated how growth conditions influence the production of virulence factors by studying the inter-relationships between colonies, biofilms and planktonic cells. We found that biofilms in our growth conditions express the type III secretion and these lifestyles are therefore not mutually exclusive in P. aeruginosa. Keywords: Comparison of different growth modes and growth phases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
