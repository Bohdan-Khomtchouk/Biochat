TITLE
Gene expression profile of Human tissues and cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray experiments to examine gene expression in human tissues. This data was used for comparison with our humanized mouse study (GEO ID GSE33846) and threshold determination of our tiling array data (GEO ID GSE18490, public in the near future). A total of 22 tissues (bone marrow, cerebellum, colon, cortex, fetal brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, thyroid, trachea and uterus) and 2 cell lines (HeLa and SH-SY5Y) were examined.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from Human tissues and cell cultures were labeled and hybridized to the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array according to the manufacturer's protocol.
