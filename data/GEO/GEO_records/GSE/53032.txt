TITLE
Expression data from OCI Ly3 SP vs. nonSP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile OCI Ly3 Side Population Cells vs non Side Population

DESIGN
OCI Ly3 cells were cultured and stained with Hoechst33342. FACS analysis identified a distinct Side Population. Side Population Cells were sorted separatly from nonSide Population cells. We used microarray analysis to identify differentialy expressed genes.
