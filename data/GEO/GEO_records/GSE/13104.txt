TITLE
p53+/- mouse osteosarcoma RNA array (with mc3T3 and one RS control)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA expression profiles from 12 (twelve) osteosarcomas arisen from p53+/- mouse were compared with a mc3T3 osteoblast control, and a rhabdomyosarcoma expression profile which was from a mouse with the same genetic background.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 12 osteosarcomas and 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, both arisen from p53+/- mice. Total RNA was also extracted from a cultured mc3T3 osteoblast cell line as control. RNA microarray was performed on the 14 samples, and expression profiles were compared.
