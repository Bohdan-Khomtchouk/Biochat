TITLE
Next Generation Metatranscriptome Sequencing of an Anaerobic Hexadecane-Degrading Microbial Consortia

ORGANISM
mixed culture KAZ_0815

SUMMARY
Purpose: Identification of transcriptionally active genes in the unculturable community constituent, Smithella, during hexadecane degradation; Differential gene expression analysis of hexadecane-relevant genes acoss three different conditions; Extension of metatranscriptomic datasets to other community constituents to identify interspecies relationships.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated for this community across three different conditions (hexadecane-, butyric acid-, caprylic acid-degrading conditions) using a modified version of Nextera and sequenced using Illumina's Miseq platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17563 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (mixed culture KAZ_0815) GPL17564 Illumina MiSeq (mixed culture KAZ_0815)
