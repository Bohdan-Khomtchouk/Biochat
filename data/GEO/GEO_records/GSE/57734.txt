TITLE
Differentiation of K562 with PMA treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
K562 cells were treated with 20nM PMA. Cells were harvested after 48 hours and RNA was extracted with miRvana RNA isolation kit. Expression profiling was done on Agilent platform.

DESIGN
K562 cells were treated 20nM PHORBOL 12-MYRISTATE 13-ACETATE (PMA) and harvested after 48 hours for RNA extraction. Control cells were treated equal amount of solvent (DMSO) in which PMA was dissolved.

PLATFORM
GPL13252 Agilent-027114 Genotypic Technology designed Custom Human Whole Genome 8x60k Microarray
