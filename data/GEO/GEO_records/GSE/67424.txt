TITLE
Determination of Transcriptional start sites in S. aureus USA300 (JE2) during exponential phase

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional start sites determination of USA300 (JE2)  by using dRNA-Seq

DESIGN
In order to globally identify transcriptional start sites in Staphylococcus aureus we depleted processed transcripts from RNA extractions with Terminator 5'-phosphate-dependent exonuclease.

PLATFORM
