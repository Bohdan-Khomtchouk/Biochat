TITLE
Genes differentially expressed in Haloferax mediterranei strains, DF50 and ΔdeoR2,  with or without induction by fructose

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloferax mediterranei DF50 and ΔdeoR2 with induction by fructose comparing with the strains without this induction. Goal was to explore the effect of induction by fructose on Haloferax mediterranei.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the Haloferax mediterranei DF50 and ΔdeoR2 with or without induction by fructose were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to  Haloferax mediterranei genome array genechips, representing about 3800 genes.
