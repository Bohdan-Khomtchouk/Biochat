TITLE
Impact of TLR7 on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BMDMs from congenic TLR7 KO mice and WT mice were infected with STM and analysed for gene expression at 24 h post infection.

DESIGN
Each sample is from one mouse. Samples 1-2 originate from a different infection experiment from samples 3-7. Each sample was analysed on Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
