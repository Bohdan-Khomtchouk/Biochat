TITLE
Molecular characterization of a series of 7 NF1-associated human MPNSTs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
7 MPNSTs from 7 neurofibromatosis-type 1 patients were screened with a high resolution array-CGH. Each MPNST DNA (somatic tumor DNA) was individually hybridized on Agilent whole human genome 244K microarrays (Platform GPL4091) using the pooled genomic constitutional DNA (lymphocytes DNA) from the normal control patients as reference, in order to detect tumor-specific aberrations.

DESIGN
NF1-associated MPNST DNA vs. pooled normal constitutional DNA
