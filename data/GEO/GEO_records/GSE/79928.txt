TITLE
Characterization and transplantation of enteric neural crest cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs and hESCs) were induced to differentiate to enteric neurons through neural crest specification. We sequenced mRNA samples from enteric neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells at 4 different stage to generate the gene expression profiles of these cells.

DESIGN
8 samples, including undifferentiated HDF-hiPSCs/H1, freshly isolated p75+/HNK1+ hiPSC-NCSCs and H1-NCSCs, enteric neural crest precursors (hiPSC-ENCPs 1 and hiPSC-ENCPs 2) from hiPSC-NCSCs, and enteric-like neurons (hiPSC-ENs 1 and hiPSC-ENs 2) from hiPSC-NCSCs, were analyzed.
