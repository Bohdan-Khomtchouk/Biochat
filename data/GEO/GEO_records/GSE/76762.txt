TITLE
miRNA expression data from primary human tissue (gastric mucosa)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment aims to identify mRNAs that are regulated in response to RYGB surgery The overall aim of the study was to identify mechanisms by which RYGB surgery promotes improvement of clinical paramters on a molecular level

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA profiles from primary tissue before, during and after RYGB surgery
