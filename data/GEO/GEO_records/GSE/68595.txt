TITLE
Changes in gene expression in the bark of MIR15

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles of bark from MIR15 compared to wildtype plants. Wild type (WT) and transgenic poplars (Populus tremula x P. alba, clone INRA 717-1B4) were grown aseptically on Woody Plant Medium. Total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Populus trichocarpa v3.0 reference transcripts ( http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!info?alias=Org_Ptrichocarpa; Ptrichocarpa_210_transcript_primaryTranscriptOnly) using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of bark from MIR15 compared to wildtype plants were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Two biological replicates were sequenced for MIR15 and WT samples.

PLATFORM
GPL18583 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Populus tremula x Populus alba)
