TITLE
Expression data from rodents following ischemic injury, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) Neuregulin-1 treatment.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used gene expression profiling to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of NRG1â€™s effects 3 hours after the induction of ischemia.

DESIGN
Cortical brain tissues were collected three hours following MCAO and NRG1 treatment, RNA extracted and hybrdized to an Affymetrix microarray chip.

PLATFORM
GPL17117 [RaGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
