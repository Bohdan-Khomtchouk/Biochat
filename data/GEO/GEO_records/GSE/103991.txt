TITLE
Knockdown of NUP62 of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line UMSCC1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p63, especially its dominant isoform ∆Np63⍺, plays essential roles in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); yet the mechanisms controlling its nuclear transport remain unknown. Nucleoporins (NUPs) are a family of proteins building nuclear pore complex (NPC) and mediating nuclear transport across the nuclear envelope. Recent evidence suggests a cell-type-specific function for certain NUPs; however, the significance of NUPs in SCC biology remains unknown. In this study, we report that nucleoporin 62 (NUP62) is highly expressed in stratified squamous epithelia, which is further elevated in SCCs. Depletion of NUP62 inhibited the proliferation ability and augmented differentiation characteristics of SCC cells. This loss of dedifferentiation status was associated with defects in ∆Np63⍺ nuclear transport. We further found that differentiation inducible Rho kinase reduced an interaction between NUP62 and ∆Np63a by phosphorylation of phenylalanine-glycine regions of NUP62, resulting in attenuated ∆Np63⍺ nuclear import. Our results characterize NUP62 as a key gatekeeper for ∆Np63⍺ and uncover its significant function to control ∆Np63⍺ nuclear transport in SCC.

DESIGN
Comparison between negative control cells and NUP62 knocked down cells. There are two biological replicates for each conditions.
