TITLE
Discovery of progenitor signatures by time series synexpression analysis during Drosophila cell immortalization [Microarray Expression]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To characterize the sequence of events associated with RasV12 immortalization of Drosophila embryonic cells, we generated transcriptional time series during cell line establishment, from primary cultures until passage (P) 19.

DESIGN
We generated two transcriptional time series from two cell lines (R3 and R7) by sampling the cultures at successive stages, early (P2-4), intermediate (P4-11), and late (P16-19), characterized by different passage times. Time points for the R3 time-series were: P2, P2 (replicate), P5, P6, P7, P8, P16, P17 and P19; for the R7 time-series: P2, P2 (replicate), P3, P4, P7, P8, P16, P17 and P19.
