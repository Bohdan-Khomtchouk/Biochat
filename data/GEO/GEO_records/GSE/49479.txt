TITLE
The transcription factor GATA6 allows self-renewal of colon adenoma stem cells by repressing BMP gene expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aberrant activation of WNT signaling and loss of BMP signals represent the two main alterations leading to the initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we screen for genes required for maintaining the tumor stem cell phenotype and identify the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA6 as key regulator of the WNT and BMP pathways in CRC. GATA6 directly drives the expression of LGR5 in adenoma stem cells while it restricts BMP signaling to differentiated tumor cells. Genetic deletion of Gata6 in mouse colon adenomas increases the levels of BMP factors, which signal to block self-renewal of tumor stem cells. In human tumors, GATA6 represses BMP4 gene expression through binding to a regulatory region that has been previously linked to increased susceptibility to develop CRC. Thus, GATA6 creates a permissive environment for tumor stem cell expansion by controlling the major signaling pathways that influence CRC initiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA from biological replicates of VillinCreERT2Gata6+/+Apcfl/fl and VillinCreERT2Gata6fl/flApcfl/fl  colon adenoma tumor organoids grown for one week in control media (see growth protocol).Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzolÂ® Plus RNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies).
