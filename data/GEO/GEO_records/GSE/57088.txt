TITLE
Expression data from fasted macroH2A1/2 double knockout adult mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MacroH2As core histone variants have a unique structure that includes C-terminal nonhistone domain. MacroH2As are highly conserved in vertebrates, and are thought to regulate gene expression. However the nature of genes regulated by macroH2As and the biological significance of macroH2As for the organism remain unclear. Here we examine macroH2A function in vivo by knocking out both macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 in the mouse. We used microarrays to examine how the absence of macroH2A.1 and macroH2A.2 histone variants affect gene expression fasted adult mouse liver.

DESIGN
Two month old male mice were fasted overnight (~16 hours). Mice were sacrificed between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, livers were collected and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extract with Trizol (life technologies) following standard protocol.
