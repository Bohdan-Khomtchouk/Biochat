TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiles in WT and APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
With the criterion of 2-fold cutoff, 7 miRNAs were upregulated and 7 miRNAs were downregulated in APP/PS1 hippocampal tissues compared with WT hippocampal tissues

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of miRNAs was performed on pooled hippocampal tissues from WT (n=16) and APP/PS1 mice (n=16) at E14
