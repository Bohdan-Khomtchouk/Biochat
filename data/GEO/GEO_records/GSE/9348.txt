TITLE
Expression data from healthy controls and early stage CRC patient's tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. Up to 25% of early stage sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients succumb to metastasis after curative surgery. We used microarrays to detail  gene expression and identified a metastasis-prone signature for early stage CRC. Keywords: RNA expression

DESIGN
Tumors from age- and ethnicity-matched 70 patients and biopsies from 12 healthy controls were used. We aimed to find a metastasis-prone signature for early stage CRC by genome-wide expression profiling of age- and ethnicity-matched patients and healthy controls using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 array.
