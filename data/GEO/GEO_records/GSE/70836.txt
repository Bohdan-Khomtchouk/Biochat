TITLE
Effects of selection on residual feed intake and diet on gene expression in pig subcutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 48 pigs aged (132 days of age) originated from two lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) : low-RFI pigs (RFIneg), high-RFI pigs (RFIpl). Both lines were offered isocaloric and isoproteic diets with contrasted energy source and nutrients:  low fat, low fiber (LF) diet or a high fat, high fiber (HF)diet during 10 weeks. Effects of RFI selection, diet and interaction between diet and line were investigated.

DESIGN
Four experimental groups: low-RFI pigs fed high fat, high fiber diet (HF_RFIneg), high-RFI pigs fed high fat, high fiber diet(HF_RFIpl),  low-RFI pigs fed low fat, low fiber diet (LF_RFIneg) and high-RFI pigs fed low fat, low fiber diet(LF_RFIpl). 12 pigs per condition. One replicate per array.
