TITLE
Minicircle-derived iPS cells - Agilent Data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Owing to the risk of insertional mutagenesis, viral transduction has been increasingly replaced by nonviral methods to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We report the use of ‘minicircle’ DNA, a vector type that is free of bacterial DNA and capable of high expression in cells. Here we use a single minicircle vector to generate transgene-free iPSCs from adult human adipose stem cells.  (Note: Our Nature Methods publication included analysis of array data from GSM374067 and GSM374068 in conjunction with this series).

DESIGN
Total RNA from H7 hESCs (n = 2) and minicircle-derived human iPS cells (n = 2 subclones from adipose tissue of two individual patients) was hybridized to four Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays. A pooled reference sample was used that contained total RNA from H9 hESCs, H9 embryoid bodies, cardiac and endothelial cells derived from H9 hESCs, cardiac fetal tissue, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
