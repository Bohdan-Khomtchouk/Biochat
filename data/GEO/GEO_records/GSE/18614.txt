TITLE
Differential Regulation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases by Acetaminophen in TAMH cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acetaminophen (APAP), a widely used analgesic and antipyretic that is considered to be relatively safe at recommended doses, is the leading cause of drug-induced liver failure in the United States.  3â€™-Hydroxyacetanilide (AMAP), a regioisomer of acetaminophen is useful as a comparative tool for studying APAP-induced toxicity since it is non-toxic relative to APAP.  TGF-alpha transgenic mouse hepatocytes were treated with both isomers to investigate mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in order to differentiate their toxicological outcomes.  Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade expression and activation were measured using microarray and Bioplex technologies, respectively.  APAP treatment led to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, whereas AMAP treatment led to the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).  The microarray data suggested APAP treatment may upregulate gene expression at multiple levels of the JNK cascade including a JNK-related scaffold protein.  Expression data was related to phosphoprotein levels using the Bioplex system.  APAP treatment led to a significant activation of JNK compared to its regioisomer.  In contrast, microarray analysis of AMAP showed a slight upregulation of ERK gene activity.  Furthermore, Bioplex data showed AMAP treatment led to significant ERK phosphorylation compared to APAP.  Cell viability assays confirmed that  APAP-induced activation of JNK was related to higher rates of cell death, whereas activation of ERK by AMAP may be cytoprotective.
