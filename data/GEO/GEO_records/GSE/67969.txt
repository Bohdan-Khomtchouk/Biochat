TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of bovine cumulus cells during first 6 hrs of in vitro maturation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Study the effect of in vitro maturation system on the transcriptomics of bovine cumulus cells during incubation of first 6 hrs.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of cumulus cells derived from cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) after 6 hrs of in vitro matutaion(Ct-6H) vs. cumulus cells before maturation (Ct-0H, REFERENCE) were contrasted. Each replicate was subjected to a dye-swap procedure.
