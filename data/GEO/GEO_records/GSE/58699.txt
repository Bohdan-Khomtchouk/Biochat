TITLE
Gene expression profile in PGC1b overexpressing skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PGC1b transgenic mice were generated to selectively over-express PGC1b in skeletal muscles using human skeletal alpha-actin gene promoter. The gene expression profiles were collected from Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of wild type (WT) and PGC1b transgenic (TG)  mice.

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior muscles from three month old WT and PGC1b transgenic male mice.
