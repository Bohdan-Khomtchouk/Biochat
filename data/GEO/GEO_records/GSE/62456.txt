TITLE
Effect of 2-aryl benzimidazole (5a) on Gene Expression Profile of the Human Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism of 2-aryl benzimidazole (5a) against breast cancer cells, we used microarray gene expression analyses to discover which target or signaling pathways were significant impact by 5a in MDA-MB-453 cells. We have investigated the mRNA expression patterns before and after 5a administration of breast cancer cells, we discovered that 5a had a significant impact on the cell cycle and MEK/Erk signaling pathways, and their p-Value were 5.62 × 10-21 and 2.04 × 10-17 respectively. We also searched for genes that exhibited the greatest differences in expression of the 5a-induced MDA-MB-453 cells relative to the control cells. Several of these genes, including FOS, JUN, TNFRSF10B (DR5), CDKN1A (p21), E2F1, E2F2 and CDC20, have been reported to relate to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 5a treated vs. untreated MDA-MB-453 cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL16765 Human 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray
