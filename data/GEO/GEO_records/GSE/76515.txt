TITLE
Expression data from A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and TUSC3 knocked out A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer metastasis is a multistep processes based on reciprocal interanctions between tumor cells and their surroundings. From this experiments, we aim to investigate the contribution of TUSC3 deficency in lung cancer metastasis. We performed gene expression transcriptome analysis to identify genes and/or noncoding RNAs regulated by TUSC3 gene

DESIGN
The A549 TUSC3 knockout cells were generated by a CRISPER knockout construct and then control cells or the knockout cells were stimulated by Tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer. After that, the cells were harvested and preapred for the analysis

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
