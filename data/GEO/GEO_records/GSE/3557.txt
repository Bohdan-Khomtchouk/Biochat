TITLE
Effect of the amount of input total RNA on T7 amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification Table 9 This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the amount of input total RNA on the fidelity, reproducibility, and yield of T7 based RNA linear amplification. BC2 total RNA was amplified using the Jeffrey lab protocol. Different amounts of T7 primer were used according to the quantity of input total RNA. Multiple amplifications were done for each quantity of input total RNA to minimize experimental variations. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
