TITLE
gene expression profiling of three type of grade II gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we performed gene expression profiling of 14 cases of grade II gliomas. The results of these analysis were used in unsupervised analyses to compare correlations between the histological subtype of grade II gliomas and gene expression profiles

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 14 tumor tissue of patients, which included 5 astrocytomas WHO grade II (T2), 5 oligodendro-gliomas WHO grade II (T2) and 4 ependymomas WHO grade II (T2) samples, in additional to 4 normal tissues. The genome-wide expression analysis was first performed by directly comparing the expression profile of highly enriched different kinds of grade II gliomas and normal tissues, we then applied various data-mining methods to process the 14 different types of grade II gliomas tissues sample.
