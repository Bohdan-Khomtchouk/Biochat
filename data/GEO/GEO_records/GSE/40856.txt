TITLE
Non-tumor/tumor intestinal tissue of control or intestine-specific HAI-1 deficient Apc(Min/+) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyse roles of HAI-1/Spint1 in intestinal tumorigenesis, we examined the effect of intestine-specific deletion of Spint1 gene on Apc(Min/+) mice. The loss of Hai-1/Spint1 significantly accelerated tumor formation in ApcMin/+ mice and shortened their survival periods. Mouse small intestine tumor tissue or background mucosa lacking macroscopically visible tumors were proceeded to RNA extraction and hybridization on microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array).

DESIGN
Non-tumor or tumor intestinal mucosa tissues of Apc (Min/+)/Spint1 (flox/flox) mice and non-tumor or tumor intestinal mucosa tissues of  Apc (Min/+)/Spint1 (flox/flox)/Vil-Cre mice were analysed. The experiment was repeated respectively.
