TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain with R1158 strain background: Fold change after doxycycline treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To understand the extent that Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) regulated its target proteins at the transcription level, transcriptomic change was profiled in yeast cells upon Hsp90 compromising. We genetically modified the R1158 strain (resulting genotype of mutant strain: TETp-HSC82 hsp82Δ arg4Δ lys5Δ car2Δ::URA3) and then reduced the Hsp90 amount with doxycycline treatment. Fold change of mRNA from untreated to treated cells indicated the transcriptomic change. Totally, we identified 1104 genes mis-regulated with a fold change of no less than 1.5 (P < 0.05) upon Hsp90 compromising.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, treated vs. untreated cells. Biological duplicates, independently grown and harvested. Technical triplicates for RNA isolation.

PLATFORM
GPL18498 IMB yeast 7K operon oligo array for gene expression
