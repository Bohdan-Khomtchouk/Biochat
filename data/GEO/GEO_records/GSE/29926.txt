TITLE
Gene microarray screening of RNA from bruce 4 ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The sample is wild type male bruce 4 ES cells which has been used in core f to generate knockout mice.

DESIGN
RNA samples from wild type male bruce 4 ES cells, which has been used in core f to generate knockout mice, were screened.  Scraped cells, pre-plated and non-pre-plated trypsinized cells were compared to determine the effects of trypsin and fibroblasts on gene expression of the ES cells. Mouse ES cell pellets were delivered to Core E for RNA Extraction. *Concurrent analysis of glycan profiles in these cells was performed in Core C*. RNA from scraped ES cells, trypsinized cells, and pre-plated trypsinized cells was isolated and prepared in triplicate.  RNA was labeled and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 array. Resulting Gene expression patterns were analyzed by Core F.
