TITLE
PBMC gene expression of early onset of the first demyelinating event of acute optic neuritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Optic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS); it appears as the presenting symptom in about 25% of MS patients and occurs in 30â€“70% of patients with MS during the course of their illness Purpose. To evaluate the molecular pathways that operate in the early phase of acute ON by studying gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) subpopulations including CD19+ B cells, CD14+ macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
High throughput gene expression analysis was performed on periferal mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) samples from 6 patients within 96 hours of the acute onset of the first demyelinating event of optic neuritis and 9 age matched healthy subjects using Affymetrix Inc. technology
