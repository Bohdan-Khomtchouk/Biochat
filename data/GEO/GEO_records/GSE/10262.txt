TITLE
Expression data from Helicobacter pylori-infected mouse gastric epithelial progenitor and non-progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates can establish themselves in gastric epithelial stem cells and this interaction may have implications for gastric tumorigenesis. Mouse gastric epithelial progenitor cells (mGEPs) and non-progenitor gastric epithelial cells (npGECs) were infected for 24hrs with Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates Kx1 and Kx2. Kx1 was isolated from a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG) and Kx2 from the same patient 4 years later, when he progressed to gastric adenocarcinoma. Keywords: RNA Expression Array
