TITLE
H4K16 acetylation marks active genes and enhancers of embryonic stem cells, but does not alter chromatin compaction (II) [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that acetylation of H4K16 is a new marker of active enhancers and that some enhancers are marked by H3K4me1, MOF and H4K16ac but not by acetylated H3K27 or p300, suggesting that they are novel p300-independent regulatory elements.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H4K16 acetylation in undifferentiated 46c(sox1-gfp) ES cells, and FACS sorted day 5 Neural Progenitor Cells (differentiated with NB27 and Neuro2 medium supplements) , along with MNase digested input for both samples
