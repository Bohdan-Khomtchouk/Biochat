TITLE
Effects of chronic desipramine treatment on hippocampal transcriptome in mice differing in response to antidepressants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of chronic treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant (desipramine) at gene expression level in hippocampus of mice bred for  high (HA) or low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia (SSIA).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated hippocampi of HA and LA mice subjected to 21 intraperitoneal injections of desipramine hydrochloride (7.5 mg/kg/day) compared to total RNA obtained from isolated hippocampi of HA and LA mice subjected to 21 intraperitoneal injections of saline.

PLATFORM
