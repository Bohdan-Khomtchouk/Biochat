TITLE
Cistrome of the Aldosterone-activated Mineralocorticoid Receptor in Human Renal Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone in Humans, has a major role in maintaining the hemo-electrolytique homeostasis, by acting in the distal part of nephron. This steroid hormone mainly acts through its binding to a ligand-induced transcription factor, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). MR binds to specific genomic sequences, where it recruits transcriptional coregulators, to activate or repress target gene transcription. The aim of this work was to access the whole aldosterone-dependand MR target genes, by comparing sequenced data from aldosterone or vehicle-treated samples.

DESIGN
Anti-MR ChIP-seq in Human Kidney GFP-hMR cells treated with vehicle or Aldosterone.
