TITLE
Wild-type versus Pumilio mutant flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL reagent from wild-type flies (yellow white, yw) and Pumilio mutant flies (pum13; Barker DD. et al. (1992) Genes Dev 6, 2312-26). 12 microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using a 1:1 mixture of oligo(dT) and random nonamer primers and in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP.
