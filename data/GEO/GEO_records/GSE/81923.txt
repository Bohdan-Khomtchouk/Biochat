TITLE
Gene expression changes between wildtype (WT) Nicotiana benthamiana plants with and without infection with Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd)

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
WT plants (at the five-leaf stage) were infected with PSTVd strain NB by agroinfiltration. Three weeks post infection (3 wpi) young leaves were collected from infected and uninfected (control) WT plants and used in a custom genome-wide gene expression microarray (4x 180K Sureprint G3 microarray, Agilent)

DESIGN
One comparison with three biological replicates : leaves of WT N. benthamiana plants infected with PSTVd compared to leaves of uninfected WT N. benthamiana plants
