TITLE
A unique regulatory phase of DNA methylation in the early mammalian embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is highly dynamic during mammalian embryogenesis. It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively depleted of global cytosine methylation at fertilization, followed by passive depletion that reaches a minimum at the blastocyst stage.  However, this model is based on limited data, and to date no base-resolution maps exist to support and refine it.  Here, we generated genome-scale DNA methylation maps in mouse gametes and through post-implantation embryogenesis.  We find that the oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation, most prominently at specific subfamilies of LINE-1 and LTR-containing retro-elements, which are disparate between gametes and resolve to lower methylation values in zygote. Surprisingly, the oocyte contributes a unique set of Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs), including many CpG Island promoter regions, that are maintained in the early embryo but are lost at the onset of embryonic specification and absent in somatic cells. In contrast, sperm contributed methylation includes retrotransposons that become completely methylated after the blastocyst stage. Our data provide a complete genome-scale, base-resolution timeline of DNA methylation in the pre-specified embryo, when this epigenetic modification is most dynamic and before returning to the canonical somatic pattern.
