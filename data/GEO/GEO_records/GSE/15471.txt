TITLE
Whole-Tissue Gene Expression Study of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of 36 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors and matching normal pancreatic tissue samples from pancreatic cancer patients of the Clinical Institute Fundeni (ICF) using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 whole-genome chips.

DESIGN
Pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples were obtained at the time of surgery from resected pancreas of 36 pancreatic cancer patients. Gene expression was analyzed on Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 whole genome microarrays. For three of the 36 normal-tumor sample pairs we carried out replicate microarray hybridizations in order to gauge the technical measurement errors. We thus performed 78 genechip hybridizations in total. A patient sample pair was excluded from further analysis since one of the samples did not meet the quality controls. The microarray data was subsequently normalized using the RMA algorithm.
