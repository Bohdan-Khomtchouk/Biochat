TITLE
Identification of genes modulate by MLS000408882-01 and MLS000573813-01 in lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MLS000408882-01 and MLS000573813-01 were identified through a cell based screen that measures the reactivation of an epigenetically silenced transgene. MLS000408882-01 and MLS000573813-01 shows selectivity for cancer vs. normal cells affecting both transcriptional patterns and cell viability in a cancer specific manner.

DESIGN
the patient matched HCC4017 (cancer) vs. HBEC30KT (immortalized normal) lung cell pair were treated with DMSO vehicle or MLS000408882-01 and MLS000573813-01 for 4 h or 24 h and RNA extracted.
