TITLE
Study of poplar shoot apex methylome response to variations in soil water avaialbility

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
In a context of climate changes, water availability is expected to become a limiting factor for plant growth and to have an impact on forest health. In order to identify genes involved in shoot phenotypic plasticity in response to variations in water availability in trees, DNA methylation patterns were investigated in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Populus deltoides Ã— P. nigra hybrid cuttings submitted to a moderate water deficit followed by a rewatering step. Transcriptomic response was also studied and is another GEO submission.
