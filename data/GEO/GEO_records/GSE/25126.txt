TITLE
[E-MTAB-189] Genomewide Analysis of Histone Modifications in Normal Human Islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment used ChIP-seq technology to create a genome-wide profile of histone marks in normal human pancreatic islets.  In the current work we analyzed two histone marks associated with gene expression (H3K4me3, H3K4me1) and marks associated with gene repression (H3K27me3). Each mark was anayzed using samples obtained from four donors (n=4). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) for histone marks were performed using specific anti-histone antibodies. Enrichment of each sample was calulated with respect to its  individual input using qPCR.  Samples were sequenced with Solexa and sequenced DNA from both Input (n=4) and ChIP (n = 4) samples were aligned to the NCBI Genome Build 36.1 Hg18 to determine regions that were enriched for binding by modified histones.
