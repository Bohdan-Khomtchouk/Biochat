TITLE
Expression data of satellite cells through muscle injury time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satellite cells are resident skeletal muscle stem cells responsible for muscle maintenance and repair.  In resting muscle, satellite cells are maintained in a quiescent state.  Satellite cell activation induces the myogenic commitment factor, MyoD, and cell cycle entry to facilitate transition to a population of proliferating myoblasts that eventually exit the cycle and regenerate muscle tissue.  The molecular mechanism involved in the transition of a quiescent satellite cell to a transit-amplifying myoblast is poorly understood. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression of in vivo satellite cell activation through muscle injury and identified RNA post-transcriptional regulation as a key component of satellite cell activation.

DESIGN
Wild type or Sdc4-/- satellite cells were FACS isolated from resting muscle or from muscle 12h and 48h following barium chloride-induced muscle injury.  5000 cell equivalents of RNA was labeled and hybridized to MOE430v2 GeneChips (Affymetrix) and scanned as per manufacturers protocol.  Probeset intensities were GCRMA normalized for further analysis including UPGMA hierarchical clustering, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and fold change.
