TITLE
Regulation of dendritic cells and macrophages by an anti-apoptotic cell natural Ab that inhibits inflammatory arthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; unidentified

SUMMARY
Although natural antibodies (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection, and whether they have housekeeping functions. We now show that the prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a previously unknown type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells, and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes. This T15-NAb-mediated process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide “eat me” signals for phagocytic clearance. Further investigation revealed that, the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro macrophage LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, as well as in vitro Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also inhibited in vivo TLR–induced pro-inflammatory responses, and could suppress autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a total of 15 custom-spotted protein slides were hybridized with a T15 IgM monoclonal antibody at three different concentrations, an isotype control IgM, 2 slides were hybridized with serum from naїve mice, 2 slides incubated with serum from mice immunized with apoptotic cells, 2 slides were incubated with serum from mice immunized with saline, 2 slides were incubated with serum from mice injected with T15 IgM monoclonal antibody, 2 slides were incubated with serum from a lupus-prone mouse disease model and a negative control slide with no antibody hybridized
