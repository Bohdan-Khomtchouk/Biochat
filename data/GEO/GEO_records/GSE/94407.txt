TITLE
miRNA profiling of C3H/HeJ mice with and without spontaneous alopecia areata

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to identify miRNA expression patterns that correlated with spontaneous onset of autoimmune alopecia in C3H/HeJ mice compare to normal haired controls. Skin from 3 mice with or without spontaneous AA were taken for the study.

DESIGN
5 Biological samples were taken from each mouse.
