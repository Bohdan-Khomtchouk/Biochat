TITLE
Effect of OsHRZ knockdown in rice roots under iron sufficiency and deficiency

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rice genes analyzing the effect of knockdown of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 in HRZ2i lines. NT and HRZ2i lines 1, 2 and 3 (2i-1, 2i-2 and 2i-3, respectively) were treated under iron sufficiency for 7 days (+Fe 7d) or under iron deficiency for 1 day (-Fe 1d) or 7 days (-Fe 7d) in hydroponic culture.

DESIGN
Comparison between NT and HRZ2i lines at +Fe 7d, -Fe 1d and -Fe 7d. Biological replicates: 2-3 NT replicates, 3 HRZ2i replicates (one each for 2i-1, 2i-2 and 2i-3) for each treatment.
