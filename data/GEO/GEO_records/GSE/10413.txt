TITLE
Gene expression profiling of caffeic acid phenethyl ester-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), derived from various plant sources, has been shown to ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo, and this has been attributed to its ability to reduce the oxidative stress. Here we investigated the cytoprotection of CAPE against menadione (MD)-induced oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to evaluate potential gene expression involvement. CAPE exhibited dose-dependent cytoprotection of HUVEC that required preincubation. A gene screen with microarrays was performed to identify the potential cytoprotective gene(s) induced by CAPE. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was highly upregulated by CAPE and this was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Keywords: Gene expression in HUVEC, CAPE cytoprotective dose response

DESIGN
Confluent HUVEC were incubated with cytoprotective dose of CAPE at 5 Âµg/ml or 0.1% DMSO as vehicle control for 6 hrs. Both treatments were done in triplicates. Total RNA was isolated at the end of the treatment and applied to microarray experiments in order to identify transcriptional response of HUVEC to CAPE. Microarray experiments were based on a two-color reference design using human universal reference RNA to compare results bwtween CAPE treatment and vehicle control groups.
