TITLE
The protein kinase KIS impacts gene expression in the neonate brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The protein kinase KIS (product of the gene UHMK1) is expressed during mouse brain development and is proposed to control gene expression through the phosphorylation of splicing factor SF1. We compared the expression of transcripts in wild type and KIS-ko newborn mouse brain (females) using affymetrix exon 1st arrays.

DESIGN
Six pairs of wildtype and KIS-ko brains from littermate female newborn mice were processed for Affymetrix exon 1st array hybridization. Analysis was performed at the exon level using PLIER normalisation and the Affymetrix Expression Console.
