TITLE
Changes in gene expression in implantation sites by absence of Cbs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The change in gene expression on the 8th day of gestation was investigated using DNA microarrays. Uterine gene expression of implantation sites  was analysed in female mice.

DESIGN
Female mice, C57BL/6jXOla129 genetic background were used for experiments. Mice, housed in sterile filter-top cages (3-4 per cage), were acclimatized in a room maintained at 20ÂºC with a 12-h light-dark fr four months.  Two groups were established: a) The control group and b) homozygous Cbs deficient mice and sacrificed at the eight day post-coitum.
