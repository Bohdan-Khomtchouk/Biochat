TITLE
Effect of iBET762+ on transcriptome of 20861 and 20863 W12 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the effect of iBET762+, a bromodomain BET inhibitor, on the transcription of 20861 and 20863 cells. These cells are subclones of W12 cells, derived from cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesion. 20861 contains integrated HPV16 DNA and 20863 contains extrachromosomal HPV16 DNA. iBET762+ decreases expression of the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes in both cell lines and this is expected to have dramatic effects on the cellular transcriptome

DESIGN
Isolate mRNA from 20861 and 20863 cells after 44 hours treatment with 1 micromolar iBET762- (the inactive enantiomer) or iBET762+. Three biological replicates from independent experiments.
