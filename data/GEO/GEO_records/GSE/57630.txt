TITLE
Gene expression profile for NGAL overexpression in esophageal squamous carcinoma cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as oncogene 24p3, uterocalin, siderocalin or lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), is a member of the lipocalin family. Elevated NGAL involves various functions in malignant cells, even sometimes the conclusions were controversial. NGAL inhibits apoptosis in thyroid cancer and decrease invasion and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer, but it increase proliferation and metastasis in breast and colon cancer. Nonetheless, the molecular functions and mechanisms of NGAL in ESCC are unknown.  To address these issues and to identify genes and biological pathways associated with NGAL functions and mechanism, NGAL was overexpressed by pcDNA3.0 plasmid in ESCC cell line EC109 with an empty plasmid as a control, these two cells were applied for mRNA expression profile analyses to find the differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Plasmids of pcDNA3.0-NGAL and pcDNA3.0 were transfected into ESCC cell line EC109, respectively. Stable transfected cell clones were selected by G418. The overexpression of NGAL protein was confirmed by western blot. Total RNAs from NGAL overexpressed cells and control cells were extracted for Agilent whole genome oligo microarray. A dye flip was performed for duplicate.
