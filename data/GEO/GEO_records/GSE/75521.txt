TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of a wildtype CHO cell line (CHO-K1), a mutant CHO cell line (pgsA745) that lacks xylosyltransferase (XylT) activity, and pgsA745 stably transfected with XylT1 (pgsA745-XylT1).

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
We report a a large deletion in the gene encoding for laminin subunit Î±2 (Lama2) in CHO pgsA745.

DESIGN
RNA of three different cell lines was extracted and analyzed.
