TITLE
Mural lymphatic endothelial cells regulate meningeal angiogenesis in the zebrafish (pericytes)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analyse gene expression in brain pericytes

DESIGN
Adult zebrafish brains were dissociated using Liberase and pdgfr beta  egfp postive cells FAC sorted into Trizol LS.  RNA was extracted and amplified before sequencing.  Samples were prepared in triplicate, with 6 brains used per samples.
