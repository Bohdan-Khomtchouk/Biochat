TITLE
Gene expression profiling of retrograde PAP-signaling and ABA-signaling mutants in response to ABA treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chloroplast-nuclear retrograde signaling is viewed as a mechanism for inter-organelle communication. Here we show the SAL1-PAP (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′- phosphate) retrograde pathway functions more broadly in guard cells, interacting with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling at least in part via exoribonucleases. Unexpectedly, PAP bypasses the canonical signaling components ABA Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and Open Stomata 1 (OST1) by priming an alternative pathway that restores ABA-responsive gene expression, ROS bursts, ion channel function and stomatal closure in ost1-2. This alternative pathway up-regulates lowly expressed Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) which have the capacity to activate the key slow anion channel SLAC1 in response to ABA-mediated and ost1-2 independent calcium release. The role of PAP in priming an alternative pathway to bypass components previously considered essential for stomatal closure demonstrates how a chloroplast signal can have broader roles as a secondary messenger to directly intersect with and tune hormone signaling.

DESIGN
Gene expression responses in whole Arabidopsis leaves were compared between mock and ABA treated genotypes; Col-0 Ler, alx8, ost1-2 and alx8 ost1-2; in triplicate.
