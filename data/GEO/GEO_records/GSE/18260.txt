TITLE
Expression data for kidney progenitor tissue from rat embryo  at E13

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we compared genes expressed in the unbudded portion of the Wolffian duct with the isolated ureteric bud to find genes novel to early kidney development.  We used the Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array to compare the unbudded tissues with the budded samples. We used microarrays to find novel genes regulating early kidney formation.

DESIGN
Isolated ureteric buds (UB) were separated from the embryonic kidney after a light trypsinization step.  Approximately 100 UBs were pooled together into each replicate.  Approximately 100 isolated Wolffian ducts were dissected from E13 rat embryoes and pooled into each sample.  Approximately 50 Wolffian ducts with attached mesodermal cells were pooled into each replicate.
