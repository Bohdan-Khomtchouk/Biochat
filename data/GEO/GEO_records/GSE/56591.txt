TITLE
Expression data from human monocyte derived macrophages infected with adenovirus expressing HIV-1 Vpr

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 Vpr protein is a multifunctional protein which perturbs human transcriptome and interacts with a number of cellular proteins. In this study, we have attempted to explore the efffects of Vpr on human transcriptome and have identified several genes which are involved in innate immune respone and cell signaling pathways. We used the microarray analysis to elucidate the differnetail expression pattern of differnet genes in human macrophages infected with HIV-1 Vpr. As result we found that HIV-1 Vpr protein leads to the induction of various interferon stimualted genes (ISGs) and chemokines in human macrophages.

DESIGN
Human monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy donors and were infected with recombinant adenoviruses either expressing HIV-1 Vpr or ZsGreen1 as a control. At 48 hours post-infection, RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis.
