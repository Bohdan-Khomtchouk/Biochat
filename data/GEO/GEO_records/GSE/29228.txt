TITLE
5q21 tiling array on prostate tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CGH profiles of prostate tumors on custom designed high resolution arrays tiling chromosome 5q21

DESIGN
A custom high-density Agilent 15k CGH array tiling 5q21 was designed to narrow down the region of deletion at 5q21 to a few genes that could be followed up with functional studies.  8 critical prostate tumors samples with the most focal regions of deletion were chosen to be profiled on the 5q21 tiling array.
