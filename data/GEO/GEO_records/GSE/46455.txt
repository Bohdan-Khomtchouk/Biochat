TITLE
Comparison between wild type E. coli and adhE (alcohol dehydrogenase) mutants, grown under anaerobic condition

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) ; Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
To characterize anaerobic stress-induced expression in adhE mutants, the microarray experiment was performed with two serotypes of wild type E. coli and their adhE mutants: (1) K-12 strain, wild type; (2) B strain, wild type; (3) BW25113, adhE mutants; (4) BL21(DE3), adhE mutants. Under anaerobic growth condition in glucose-containing complex medium, the wild type strains 1 and 2 grew well whereas the mutant strains 3 and 4 experienced anaerobic stress and grew after 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively.

DESIGN
For each of the four strains, RNA sampling was done after six hours of growth under anaerobic condition. Only one replicate was obtained for each strain.
