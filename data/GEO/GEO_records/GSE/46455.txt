TITLE
Comparison between wild type E. coli and adhE (alcohol dehydrogenase) mutants, grown under anaerobic condition

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
To characterize anaerobic stress-induced expression in adhE mutants, the microarray experiment was performed with two serotypes of wild type E. coli and their adhE mutants: (1) K-12 strain, wild type; (2) B strain, wild type; (3) BW25113, adhE mutants; (4) BL21(DE3), adhE mutants. Under anaerobic growth condition in glucose-containing complex medium, the wild type strains 1 and 2 grew well whereas the mutant strains 3 and 4 experienced anaerobic stress and grew after 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively.
