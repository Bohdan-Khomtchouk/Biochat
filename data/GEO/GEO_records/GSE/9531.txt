TITLE
Rhesus Macaque gene expression data obtained using Rhesus Macaque Array or Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The primary goal of this study was to compare the performances of Rhesus Macaque Genome Array and Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array with respect to the detection of differential expressions when rhesus macaque RNA extracts were labeled and hybridized. The secondary goal of this study was to investigate the effect of mismatch position on signal strength in Affymetrix GeneChips by examining naturally occurring mismatches between rhesus macaque transcripts and human probes from Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

Keywords: cross hybridization

DESIGN
Rhesus macaque RNA from five sources (immortalized fibroblasts, cerebral cortex, pancreas, testes and thymus) was divided into two sets of aliquots of equal amount.  Samples from each of the five sources were labeled and hybridized with either Rhesus Macaque Genome Array or two Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
