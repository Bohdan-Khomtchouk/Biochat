TITLE
Deep sequencing of the degradome cDNA library in soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We deep sequenced a degradome library constructed from different soybean tissues. As a result, 19,830,257 represented 5,337,590 distinct signatures were obtained. 70.98% of the signatures were assigned to one soybean cDNA sequence and 24.05% matched with two cDNA sequences. 428 potential targets of small RNAs and 25 novel miRNA families were identified in soybean. A total of 211 potential miRNA targets including 150 conserved miRNA targets and 69 soybean-specific miRNA targets were identified. The signatures distribution on soybean primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) showed that most of the pri-miRNAs had the characteristic pattern of Dicer processing. The TAS3 small RNAs (siRNAs) biogenesis was conserved in soybean and nine Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) were identified as the TAS3 siRNA targets. The global identification of miRNAs targets would contribute to the functional research of the miRNA in soybean.
