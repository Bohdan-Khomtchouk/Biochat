SUMMARY
Notch signaling defines a conserved, fundamental pathway, responsible for determination in metazoan development and is widely recognized as an essential component of lineage specific differentiation and stem cell self-renewal in many tissues including the hematopoietic system. Until recently, the majority of studies in the hematopoietic system focused on Notch signaling in lymphocyte differentiation and knowledge of individual Notch receptor roles in early hematopoiesis has been limited due to a paucity of genetic tools available  To fate-map Notch receptor expression and pathway activity in the hematopoietic system we used tamoxifen-inducible CreER knock-in mice for individual Notch receptors in combination to a novel Notch reporter strain (Hes1GFP) and a conditional gain of function allele of Notch2 receptor (Rosa-lsl-ICN2).

DESIGN
Bone marrow lineage negative, cKit+, Sca1- cells were sorted from Rosa-lsl-ICN2 Mx1-cre+ mice or Mx1-cre+ littermates for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
