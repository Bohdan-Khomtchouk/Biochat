TITLE
Subcellular localization of coagulation factor II receptor-like 1 in neurons governs angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chip-Seq on HEK293 cells using an antibody against PAR2 in order to determe binding to promoter and  enhancer sequences

DESIGN
PAR2-GFP expressing HEK293 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PAR2. Short-read sequencing of ChIP DNA fragments was processed using the Solexa/Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. Results were converted to BED files for processing and visualization for peak detection.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
