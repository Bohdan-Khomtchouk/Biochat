TITLE
Global microRNA profiling of the mouse ventricles during development of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The  study sought to determine the global miRNA profile of ventricles during early and end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a severe double mutant mouse model of the disease. MicroRNA expression profiles of ventricles of transgenic mice with a mutation in both the myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7 Arg403Gln) and cardiac troponin I gene (TNNI3 Ser203Gln) and of non-transgenic mice were determined using Rodent TaqMan Low Density miRNA Arrays A v2.0 (TLDA, Life Technologies). MicroRNA profiles were measured at 10 days of age and 16 days of age, in 3 biological replicates.

DESIGN
qRT-PCR analysis of microRNAs of ventricles of three transgenic mice and three non-transgenic mice age 10 days, and three transgenic mice and three non-transgenic mice age 16 days. 450 ng RNA was reverse transcribed, without pre-amplification, using TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and Megaplex RT Primers rodent pool A (Life Technologies). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified using a TaqMan rodent microRNA A Array v2.0 (Life Technologies) with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System.
