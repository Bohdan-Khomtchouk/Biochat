TITLE
The BET bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 improves lenalidomide activity in in vitro and in vivo models of multiple myeloma by synergistic blockade of Ikaros and c-Myc signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) cells were treated with the BET inhibitor CPI203 alone and in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in vitro and in vivo (mouse xenograft). We used microarrays to uncover the mechanisms underlying CPI-203 activity in MM, alone and in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (combo).

DESIGN
Global RNA expression was done in three MM cell lines treated in vitro with the BET inhibitor alone or with the combo for 6h.
