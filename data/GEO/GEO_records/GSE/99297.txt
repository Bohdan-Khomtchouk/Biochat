TITLE
Using data from RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional changes in a H2O2-evolved strain OE100 under 4˚С and 20 MPa

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal is to investigate how to enhance the adaptability of deep-sea bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 to low temperature and high pressure by experimental evolution with H2O2 stress

DESIGN
Comparision of gene expression in evolved H2O2-stressed strain OE100 to ancestor WT strain at maximum growth yield under 4˚С and 20 MPa

PLATFORM
GPL17267 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Shewanella piezotolerans WP3)
