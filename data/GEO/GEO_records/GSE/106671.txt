TITLE
Gene expression signatures of highly metastatic gallbladder cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver invasion and metastasis often occur in gallbladder cancer (GBC). We established a liver metastasis mouse model using NOZ cells for two round intrasplenic injection. We acquired a highly metastatic subclone of NOZ cells, we named it LiM2-NOZ(second-round liver metastasis NOZ) cells. Then we characterized the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs that differentially expressed in NOZ and LiM2-NOZ cells.

DESIGN
Three independent NOZ and three independent LiM2-NOZ cells were used

PLATFORM
