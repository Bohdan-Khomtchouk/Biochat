TITLE
Gene and microRNA expression profiling of a melanoma cell line resistant to BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 compared to the parental sensitive counterpart (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene and microRNA expression profiles were generated for a melanoma cell line resistant to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 and its parental cell line in order to identify altered gene-microRNA regulatory networks. Results showed that CCL2 acts as an autocrine factor and coordinately regulates, via HIF1, miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b, which are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Inhibition of CCL2 and of the specific miRNAs restores sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates for resistant and parental cells were generated by independent cultures and RNA extractions. After quality control one sample from the gene expression dataset was discarded for poor gene expression profile quality.
