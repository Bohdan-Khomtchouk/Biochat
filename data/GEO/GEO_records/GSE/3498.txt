TITLE
Effects of water restriction on gene expression in mouse renal medulla

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify novel gene targets of vasopressin regulation in the renal medulla, we performed a cDNA microarray study on the inner medullary tissue of mice following a 48 hour water restriction protocol. Keywords: Stress Response
