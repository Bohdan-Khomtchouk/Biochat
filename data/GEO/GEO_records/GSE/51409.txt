TITLE
PAO1 gene expression at 22°C and 37°C in Lysogeny broth

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 was grown at 22°C and 37°C in Lysogeny broth (LB) and RNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix P. aeruginosa chip.

DESIGN
PAO1 was grown in triplicate in Lysogeny broth at 22°C or 37°C.  Total RNA from each sample was pooled and amplified then assayed in triplicate resulting in 6 total samples.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
