TITLE
FUS KO mRNA sequencing and anti-FUS RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our study is to identify the role of FUS in shaping the transcriptome. RNA-seq of two FUS KO clones was performed and compared to wt; for each, four replicates were sequenced. RNA molecules associated with the FUS protein were determined by means of a RNA immuno-precipitation, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Total RNA was used as a control. SH-SY5Y cells were used for both experiments.

DESIGN
RNA-seq: 4 wt samples, 4 A4 KO samples, 4 A5 KO samples. RIP-seq: 1 input control sample, 3 anti-FUS IP replicates.
