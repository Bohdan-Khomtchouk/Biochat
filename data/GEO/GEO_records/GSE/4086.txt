SUMMARY
Activation of glycolytic genes by HIF-1 is considered critical for metabolic adaptation to hypoxia.  We found that HIF-1 also actively suppresses glucose metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) by directly trans-activating the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1).  PDK1 inactivates the TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.  Forced PDK1 expression in hypoxic HIF-1α-null cells increases ATP levels, attenuates hypoxic ROS generation and rescues these cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These studies reveal a novel hypoxia-induced metabolic switch that shunts glucose metabolites from the mitochondria to glycolysis to maintain ATP production and to prevent toxic ROS production.
