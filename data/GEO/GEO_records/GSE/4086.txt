TITLE
Hypoxia responsive genes in human Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, P493-6.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of glycolytic genes by HIF-1 is considered critical for metabolic adaptation to hypoxia.  We found that HIF-1 also actively suppresses glucose metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) by directly trans-activating the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1).  PDK1 inactivates the TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.  Forced PDK1 expression in hypoxic HIF-1α-null cells increases ATP levels, attenuates hypoxic ROS generation and rescues these cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These studies reveal a novel hypoxia-induced metabolic switch that shunts glucose metabolites from the mitochondria to glycolysis to maintain ATP production and to prevent toxic ROS production. Keywords: Hypoxia responsive, case control

DESIGN
We sought to determine by microarray analysis of gene expression the genes responsive to hypoxia using the human B lymphocyte cell line, P493-6. Hypoxia-responsive genes were globally assessed in cells incubated in 0.1% O2 for 29 hours at which the highest HIF-1 levels were obtained
