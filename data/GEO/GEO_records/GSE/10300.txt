head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patient selection and specimen collection. Thirty-six freshly frozen tumor samples were prospectively collected from patients undergoing surgery or biopsy for HNSCC at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill (21 patients) and Vanderbilt University (15 patients). All tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 minutes of surgical resection or biopsy, and kept at -80oC until further processing. All patients consented to participation in this study under protocols approved by IRB at the two institutions. This set includes the samples previously deposited into GEO including 8 additional samples and adjustment for protocol changes. The original 36 before protocol changes (and thus unadjusted) are here: Slebos RJ, Yi Y, Ely K, et al.
