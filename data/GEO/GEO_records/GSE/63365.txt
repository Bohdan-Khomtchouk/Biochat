TITLE
Comparison of gene expression patterns between Lgr5 positive cells and CD24 hi cells in murin colon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Lgr5_EGFP-ires-CreERT2 allows us to sort colonic stem cells and CD24 positive cell are subpopulation of Goblet cells in colon

DESIGN
In Lgr5_EGFP-ires-CreERT2 knockin mice, GFP is expressed under the control of Lgr5 promoter, we used PE-conjugated anti-CD24 antibody to sort subset of Goblet cells from colonic crypts
