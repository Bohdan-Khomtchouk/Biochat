TITLE
Effect of s100b on lan5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human neuroblastoma cell line Lan5 cells were cultured in complete DMEM till 80% confluence, then placed at 60000 cells per squared cm. Cells were then plated in 24-well plates for cell viability assay and in T75 flasks for RNA isolation. Medium was replaced with serum-free fresh medium for 12 hours prior to s100b treatment. Gene expression patterns were then analysed using the Human Focus Genechip array.

DESIGN
In this study we analyze gene expression patterns in Lan5 cells treated with s100b protein. We utilized control cells (untreated) and two different concentrations (0.5 nM and 5 uM) of s100b. We used three biological replicates, for the three concentration tested, according to MIAME guidelines (total 9 chips were used in this study).
