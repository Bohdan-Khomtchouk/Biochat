TITLE
Gene expression induced by DOT1L and Menin inhibition in cell line models of leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression upon DOT1L inhibition, or Menin inhibition, or a combination of DOT1L and Menin inhibiting agents, was assessed in several MLL-rearranged human cell lines and a mouse model of MLL-AF9 leukemia. The goal of the study was to explore the mechanisms by which the EPZ0004777 and MI-2-2 chemicals collaborate to induce differentiation and cell death in MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF9 leukemias.

DESIGN
2 compounds and combinaison thereof, 1 concentration & 1 timepoint per treatment, DMSO control, 3 biological replicates
