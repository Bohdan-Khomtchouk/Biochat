TITLE
Hematopoietic Transcriptional Comparison of HSC from B10.BR/JRep and B10.BR/J (drifted) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Divergence has occured between the B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJJrep and B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJ (drifted) mouse strains, resulting in altered antigenic recognition and differential bone marrow engraftment capability. The microarray data demonstrate that the transcriptional profile of genes associated with hematopoiesis differs between lineage negative (as a marker for hematopoietic stem cells) bone marrow cells isolated from the B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJJrep and B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJ (drifted) mouse strains.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from ten male mice of each strain, aged 10-12 weeks, were harvested.  One pooled sample was analyzed for each strain.
