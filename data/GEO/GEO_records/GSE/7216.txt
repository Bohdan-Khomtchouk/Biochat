TITLE
Cytokine treated normal human epidermal keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) from neonatal foreskin were cultured in serum-free EpiLife medium with human KC growth supplement (0.2% bovine pituitary extract (v/v), 5ug bovine insulin, 5ug/ml bovine transferrin, 0.5ng/ml human EGF, and 0.18 ug/ml hydrocortisone) from Cascade Biologics.  Cultures were treated with recombinant cytokines from R & D Systems.  J Immunol. 2007 Feb 15;178(4):2229-40. Keywords: cytokine response

DESIGN
NHEK were treated with IL-19, IL20, IL-22, and IL24, with controls untreated, along with IL1b, IFN gamma, and KGF.
