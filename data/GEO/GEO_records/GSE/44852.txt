TITLE
SMC5/6 facilitates joint molecule resolution and stepwise loss of cohesin to promote meiotic chromosome segregation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
During meiosis, Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) complexes underpin two fundamental features of meiosis: homologous recombination and chromosome segregation. While meiotic functions of the cohesin and condensin complexes have been delineated, the role of the third SMC complex, Smc5/6, remains enigmatic. Diminished Smc5/6 function causes severe defects in nuclear division, but the underlying causes of these defects remain unclear. Here we identify specific, essential meiotic functions for the Smc5/6 complex in homologous recombination and regulation of cohesin. We show that Smc5/6 is enriched at centromeres and cohesin-association sites where it regulates sister-chromatid cohesion and the timely removal of cohesin from chromosomal arms, respectively.  Smc5/6 also localizes to recombination hotspots, where it promotes normal formation and resolution of joint-molecule intermediates. Furthermore, we find that Smc5/6 specifically promotes resolution of joint molecules via the XPF-family endonuclease, Mus81-Mms4Eme1. We propose that Smc5/6 acts as a chaperone for ‘mitotic’-like recombination processes during meiosis.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip was used to compare Smc5 localization in wild-type and spo11 strains
