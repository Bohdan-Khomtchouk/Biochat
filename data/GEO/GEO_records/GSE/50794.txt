TITLE
GEMM CRC collection analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of colorectal cancer (CRC) were created, and primary tumors from these GEMMs were analyzed. Primary CRC tumors from these GEMMs were genotyped to confirm that they contain the core genetic lesions of interest, including APC, P53, KRAS, and BRAF. Primary tumors from GEMMs with combinations of lesions of interest were analyzed by whole genome expression, and their expression profiles were compared to determine how they segregate. Signatures were then generated from GEMM tumors of interest and compared to human clinical datasets with expression and outcome data.

DESIGN
Primary tumors from CRC GEMMs with different combinations of mutant alleles of interested were generated and analyzed. Alleles include mutant forms of APC (A), P53 (P), KRAS (K) and BRAF (B).
