TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human hepatocellular cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out in 4 matched human hepatocellular cancer samples/normal liver smapls, and 4 human hepatocellular cancer samples to characterize the molecular mechanisms relevant to the etiology of human hepatocellular cancer development.

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of the 4 matched human hepatocellular cancer samples/normal liver samples, and 4  human hepatocellular cancer samples.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
