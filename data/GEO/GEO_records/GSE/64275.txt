TITLE
High-throughput sequencing identifies miRNAs and their targets involved in porcine muscle development

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs involved in muscle development, three independent small RNA libraries from porcine skeletal muscle at the age of 63d、98d and 161d were constructed. A total of 4105184， 4606375 and 5113984 mappable small RNA sequences were generated in the three small RNA libraries, respectively, and 887 known and 472 new candidate miRNAs were obtained.

DESIGN
sample 1: Examination of small RNA in porcine skeletal muscle at the age of 63d; sample 2: Examination of small RNA in porcine skeletal muscle at the age of 98d; sample 3: Examination of small RNA in porcine skeletal muscle at the age of 161d
