TITLE
Expression data on human MO-to-DC and MO-to-MAC differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the RNA expression profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MACs) obtained by exposure with GM-CSF/IL-4 and GM-CSF, respectively, and with mature DCs and MACs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure The expression profiles of RNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived immature dendritic cells (iDCs) and macrophages (iMACs) following GM-CSF/IL-4  and GM-CSF incubation, and then activation/maturation with lypopolysaccharyde (LPS) using the Affymetrix PrimeView Human Gene Expression array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). This platform allows the interrogation of > 36,000 transcrits and variants per sample. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to three sets of samples of monocytes (MOs), derived immature DCs and MACs (iDCS and iMACS) and activated/mature DCs and MACs following incubation with LPS (mDCS and mMACs)
