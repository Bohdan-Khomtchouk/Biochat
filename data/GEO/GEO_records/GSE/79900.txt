TITLE
Transcriptome response after addition of individual agonists of TLR4 (MPLA) and NOD2 (MDP) receptors to THP-1 cells or its combination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using microarray analysis, we explored the differences in gene expression profiles between individual and combined stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NOD2) in THP-1 cells.  Analysis was performed 3 hours post addition of TLR4 agonist MPLA and the NOD2 agonist MDP to THP-1 cells. The results provide the detailed molecular profile of the the genetic response to individual and combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 receptors

DESIGN
THP-1 cells (Invivogen) were seeded in 3-cm culture dishes at 1x10^6 cells per dish in RPMI medium. Next day, cells were treated with MDP (20μg/ml) and MPLA (1μg/ml) individually or in combination or left untreated.
