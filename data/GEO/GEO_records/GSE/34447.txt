TITLE
Gene expression analysis of wild type and KAP1 KO mouse T cell progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The modulation of chromatin status at specific genomic loci controls lymphoid differentiation. Here, we investigated the role played in this process by KAP1, the universal cofactor of KRAB-containing Zinc Finger Proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), a tetrapod-restricted family of transcriptional repressors. T cell-specific Kap1 knockout mice displayed a significant expansion of immature thymocytes and imbalances in the ratios of mature T cells in the thymus and the spleen, with impaired responses to TCR stimulation. Transcriptome and chromatin studies revealed that KAP1 directly controls the expression of a number of genes involved in TCR and cytokine signalling, among which Traf1 and FoxO1, and is strongly associated with cis-acting regulatory elements marked by the H3K9me3 repressive mark on the genome of thymic T cells. Likely responsible for tethering KAP1 to at least part of its genomic targets, a small number of KRAB/ZFPs are selectively expressed in T lymphoid cells. These results reveal the so far unsuspected yet important role of KRAB/KAP1-mediated epigenetic regulation in T lymphocyte differentiation and activation.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested form the thymus of 3 CD4-Cre/Kap1flox (KAP1 KO in the T lineage) mice and 3 wt/Kap1flox littermate controls
