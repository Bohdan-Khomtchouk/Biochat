TITLE
Frequent derepression of the mesenchymal transcription factor gene in acute myeloid leukemia (mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine CD45.1+ CD117+ BM cells were co-transduced pairwise with retroviral vectors expressing Hoxa9, Meis1, Foxc1 or a control empty vector. Ninety-six hours later 10^6 drug resistant cells were transplanted into CD45.2+ irradiated congenic recipients. To investigate the consequences of FOXC1 expression on the transcriptome in murine AML, we performed exon array analysis using flow sorted CD117+Gr1+ leukemia cells recovered from sick mice (Hoxa9/control; Moxa9/Meis1; or Hoxa9/FOXC1 leukemias; 3 mice per cohort).

DESIGN
Nine exon arrays total; 3 arrays for each cohort (Hoxa9/control; Moxa9/Meis1; or Hoxa9/FOXC1), each from a separate mouse.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
