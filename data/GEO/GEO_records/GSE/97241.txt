TITLE
Effect of Paral1 deficiency on gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Paral1 is a novel adipocyte-specific lincRNA upregulated during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of Paral1 by siRNA transfection in 3T3-L1 cells followed by transcriptomic analyses was performed.

DESIGN
3T3-L1 adipogenesis was induced as in Dubois-Chevalier et al. NAR 2014. siRNA were transfected at the same time or after 7 days of differentiation. Transcriptome analyses of total RNA extracted from 3T3-L1 cells after two days of transfection with siRNA control (Ctrl-siRNA) or targeting Paral1 (Paral1-siRNA) were performed (D2 relates to cells transfected with siRNA upon indution of differentiation; D9 relates to cells transfected with siRNA after 7 days of differentiation). Three independent replicates were performed.
