TITLE
ChIP-Sequencing of AL5 over-expressing Arabidopsis and its knock out mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins affect growth and development by regulating transcription and reading epigenetic modifications of histones, but their functions in abiotic stress responses remain largely unclear. Here we characterize seven Arabidopsis thaliana Alfin1-like PHD finger proteins (ALs) in the response to abiotic stresses. ALs localize to the nucleus and repress transcription. Except AL6, all the ALs bind to G-box element. Changes of the amino acids at positions 34 and 35 in AL6 cause the loss of G-box binding ability. Expression of the ALs responded differently to osmotic stress, salt, cold and abscisic acid treatments. AL5 was induced by multiple stresses, and AL5-overexpressing plants showed higher tolerance to salt, drought and freezing stress than Col-0. Also, al5 mutants showed reduced stress tolerance. ChIP-Seq assay helps find the direct targets of AL5.

DESIGN
Polyclonal antibody of AL5 protein was used to perform ChIP experiment. Two samples were analyzed, AL5 OE sample and its knock out mutant. Data was analyzed as OE sample Vs mutant sample and help find targets of AL5 protein.
