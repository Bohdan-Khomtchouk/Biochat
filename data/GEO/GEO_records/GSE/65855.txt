TITLE
Therapeutic intervention of monocytes to LPS challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the possible therapeutic effects of ibuprofen and Pep19-2.5 alone or in combination on the LPS-response of human monocytes.

DESIGN
Human monocytes were challenged with 0.1ng/ml LPS and/or 10ng/ml Pep19-2.5 LPS. Medium controls served as unstimulated samples. LPS and Pep19-2.5 was used either alone or together to LPS-challenged samples. RNA was extracted after 4 hrs of stimulation. Three biological replicates were conducted
