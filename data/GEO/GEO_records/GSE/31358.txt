TITLE
Deletion of HDAC1 induces caspase-independent autophagic cell death and mitotic defect in Hep3B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HDAC1 aberrantly over expressed in HCC and it was considered as an oncogene gene in HCC development. So we want to analyze in greater detail of the genes regulated by HDAC1 using microarray assay.

DESIGN
Hep3B RNA was extracted after transfected by HDAC1 shRNA or scrambled shRNA (Mock) for 72hr. For microarray analysis of gene expression unpon depletion of HDAC1, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used to make biotin-labeled cRNA using the Ambion Illumina cRNA amplification and labeling kit according to manufacturers’ instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX)
