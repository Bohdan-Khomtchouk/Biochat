TITLE
Genome-wide profilings of IFN-stimulated murine splenic B cells by ATAC-Seq.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the IFN-induced dynamics in murine splenic B cells. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 10,000U IFNa and spleens were removed at 90min. B cells were negatively isolated using magnetic beads and profiled for the chromatin configuration by ATAC-seq.

DESIGN
Profilings of chromatin configuration by ATAC-seq (0 and 90min, biological duplicate for each).
