TITLE
Islet mRNA changes in rat pancreatic islets during aging

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
comparison of mRNA expression in the islets of 3- and 12-month old male Wistar rats Aging is a risk factor for a majority of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. During aging pancreatic beta-cell function decreases leading to impaired insulin secretion and proliferation and to an increase in apoptosis. Impairment of pancreatic beta cell functions and survival has been linked to gene expression changes. The aim of our study was to obtain a global expression profile of microRNAs and mRNAs of pancreatic islets of 3 and 12 month old male Wistar rats in order to identify the changes occurring during aging.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from pancreatic islets of three 3-month old and three 12-month old rats and was further analyzed by microarray

PLATFORM
GPL15690 Arraystar Rat LncRNA microarray (026403)
