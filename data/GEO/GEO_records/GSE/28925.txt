TITLE
Gene expression analysis of an endometrial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This group is studying the role of glycoproteins in embryo implantation and development of the maternal-fetal interface. The Aplin lab is developing an embryo implantation model in which blastocysts attach to human endometrial cells. The project aims to investigate the molecular interactions mediating attachment and subsequent events including trophoblast invasion and displacement of maternal cells. In the present phase of the project, the lab is using the Ishikawa (human endometrial) cell line with mouse embryos.

DESIGN
RNA from three replicate samples from the Ishikawa cell line were prepared and sent to Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL11095 [GLYCOv3_Hs] Custom Affymetrix Glyco v3 GeneChip
