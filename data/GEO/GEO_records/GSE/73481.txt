TITLE
Aberrantly activated Gli2-KIF20A axis is crucial for the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and predicts poor prognosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels in response to inhibition of Hh signaling in hepatocellular cancer cells using a cDNA microarray technique. Microarray analyses revealed that 136 genes were up-regulated and 335 gene were down-regulated after treatment with both cyclopamine (an antagonist of SMO) and GANT61 (a specific, small-molecular molecule inhibitor of Glis).

DESIGN
HCC-LM3 cells were treated with GANT61 (20 μM for 48 hr), Cyclopamine (20μM for 48 hr) and control vehicle DMSO, respectively.
