TITLE
Genome-wide Maps of Alkylation Damage, Repair, and Mutagenesis in Yeast Reveal Mechanisms of Mutational Heterogeneity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA base damage is an important contributor to genome instability, but how the formation and repair of these lesions is affected by the genomic landscape is unknown. Here we describe genome-wide maps of DNA base damage, repair, and mutagenesis at single nucleotide resolution in yeast treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Analysis of these maps revealed that base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage is significantly modulated by chromatin, with faster repair in nucleosome free regions, and slower repair and higher mutation density within strongly positioned nucleosomes. Both the translational and rotational settings of lesions within nucleosomes significantly influence BER efficiency; moreover, this effect is asymmetric relative to the nucleosome dyad and is regulated by histone modifications. Our data also indicate that MMS-induced A mutations are significantly enriched on the non-transcribed strand (NTS) of yeast genes, particularly in BER-deficient strains, due to higher damage formation on the NTS and transcription-coupled repair of the transcribed strand (TS). These findings reveal the influence of chromatin on repair and mutagenesis of base lesions on a genome-wide scale, and suggest a novel mechanism for transcription-associated mutation asymmetry, which is frequently observed in human cancers.

DESIGN
MMS lesion mapping data was analyzed for WT or mag1âˆ† yeast cells treated with 0.2% MMS or 0.4% MMS and allowed to repair for 0hr, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hours.
