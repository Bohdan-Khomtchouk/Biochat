TITLE
Gene expression profile of SmarT-cells compared to control T cells modified to express ΔCAR, ΔTGFbRII and ΔIL4R

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this experiment was to compare the transcriptional profile of T cells modified to express CAR, TBBR and 4/7 ICR (i.e. SmarT-cells) against control T cells expressing the delta constructs (i.e. ΔCAR, ΔTGFbRII and ΔIL4R). RNA samples were isolated from trangenic T cells generated from three independent donors.

DESIGN
T cells were sorted 5 days post transduction using a SH800S cell sorter (SONY Biotechnology) to normalize for the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between transgenic T cells. RNA was isolated at 24 hours after stimulating the transgenic T cells with OKT3, TGFb and IL4, using the RNeasy mini plus kit (QIAGEN) and hybridized to the nCounter PanCancer immune profiling panel (human codeset).
