TITLE
Temporal development of necrotizing enterocolitis in the preterm pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal disease that afflicts 5-10% of preterm infants, often progresses rapidly from mild food intolerance into extensive haemorrhage, inflammation and necrosis. Events leading to NEC have remained poorly defined. Similar disease characteristics are observed in preterm pigs 24-48 h after feeding formula. Using this model, we aimed to characterize the temporal development of NEC, and describe the functional and immunological response of the preterm intestine preceding NEC. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Pigs from treatment groups TPN (n=5), and 8 h (n=5) and 24 h (n=5-6) FORM and COLOS were randomly selected for microarray analysis. Equal amounts of total distal small intestinal RNA from all pigs was pooled to make the reference sample. Samples and reference pool were labelled with Oyster 550 and 650, respectively. The in-house spotted porcine oligonucleotide microarray version 4 (POM4) is a low density microarray consisting of 384 different oligonucleotide probes representing more than 200 different immune related genes and eight different array control oligonucleotides (ArrayControl; Ambion, NÃ¦rum, Denmark). The immunologically relevant 60-70mer oligonucleotide probes represent interferons and interleukins (and receptors), chemokines (and receptors), acute phase proteins, apoptosis-related factors and sequences with relevance to Toll-like receptors and their intracellular signalling pathways.
