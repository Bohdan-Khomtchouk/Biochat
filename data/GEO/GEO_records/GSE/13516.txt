TITLE
Temporal development of necrotizing enterocolitis in the preterm pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal disease that afflicts 5-10% of preterm infants, often progresses rapidly from mild food intolerance into extensive haemorrhage, inflammation and necrosis. Events leading to NEC have remained poorly defined. Similar disease characteristics are observed in preterm pigs 24-48 h after feeding formula. Using this model, we aimed to characterize the temporal development of NEC, and describe the functional and immunological response of the preterm intestine preceding NEC. Keywords: time course
