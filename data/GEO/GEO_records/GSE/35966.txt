TITLE
Identification of differently expressed genes in Rainbow trout muscle under restricted feeding

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
We identified that the adiponectin gene expression in rainbow trout muscle decreased by restrected feeding. In order to identify the genes differently expressed by the same treatment, micrarray analysis was conducted

DESIGN
Fish were fed ad libitum once a week (RF, restricted feed group) or fed ad libitum twice per day (control).  After 1 month, the muscle was desected from 4 individuals from each group.

PLATFORM
GPL15258 Agilent-016320 rainbow trout 37K oligo array [Probe name version]
