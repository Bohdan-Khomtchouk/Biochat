TITLE
Gene profiling of Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) siRNA in mutants at generation G1 and G11

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp06-03_microtrac - gene profiling of turnip crinkle virus (tcv) sirna in mutants at generation g1 and g11 - What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA in diferent mutants?  - Col-0, dcl2/4, dcl3/4 and dcl2/3/4 were grown until rosette state and inoculated with TCV. Ten days post-inoculation the leaves were harvested. The same was made at generation 1 (G1) and 11 (G11).

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison
