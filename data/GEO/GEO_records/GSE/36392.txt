TITLE
Expression data from pulmonary Type 2 Myeloid (T2M) cells, Eosinophils, Neutrophils, and Macrophages, from IL-25 treated 4get mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many symptoms associated with allergic asthma result from the sequelae of type 2 inflammation.  Interleukin (IL)-25 promotes type 2 inflammatory responses, and T2M cells represent an IL-4 and IL-13 producing granulocytic IL-25 responsive population. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression profile of T2M cells, and compared T2M cells to other inflammatory subsets (eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages) in the lungs of mice with IL-25-induced pulmonary inflammation.

DESIGN
Inflammatory subsets were isolated from the lungs of IL-25 treated 4get mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled cells from 4 donor mice for each replicate, and used FACS to isolate pure populations of each inflammatory subset in parallel. We analyzed 3 T2M replicates and 2 replicates each of the other inflammatory subsets.
