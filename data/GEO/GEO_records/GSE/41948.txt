TITLE
Fine Time-Course Expression Analysis of Mammalian Sex Determination in 129S1/SvImJ and C57BL/6J XX and XY mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the differentiation of the bipotential gonad into a testis or an ovary in 2 strains of mice - 129S1/SvImJ (129S1) and C57BL/6J (B6). Our results provide a high resolution view of the initiation and canalization of the differentiation of the gonad. It also reveals global differences in the transcriptome between 129S1 and B6 mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from XX and XY embryonic mouse gonads at 6 equally spaced time points between embryonic day (E) 11.0 and E12.0 from 129S1 and B6 mice. Mice were staged using tail somite numbers
