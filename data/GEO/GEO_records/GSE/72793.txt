TITLE
Lung miRNA profiling in mouse model of allergic airways disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the differential expression of miRNAs in the lungs of mice subjected to a model of allergic airways disease and non-allergic and steroid-treated control animals.

DESIGN
Total lung RNA was collected from mice sensitised and challenged with PBS or OVA with or without DEX treatment at day 16 and miRNA microarrays performed.

PLATFORM
GPL13493 Agilent-021828 Unrestricted Mouse miRNA Microarray (V2) (miRNA_ID version)
