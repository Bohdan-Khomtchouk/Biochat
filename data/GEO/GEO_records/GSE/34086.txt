TITLE
Genome structure of radicicol-induced aneuploids in yeast by array CGH

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Aneuploidy, a state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes, is a form of large-effect mutation able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions.  Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stresses could in turn induce aneuploidy in budding yeast. Radicicol was shown to induce high level missegregation of an artificial chromosome (CF). This experiment examines possible aneuploidy of other (“natural”) chromosomes induced by radicicol.

DESIGN
Red colonies (lost CF) were first screened by FACS. Possible aneuploids were then subjected to hybridization, with WT as the control.
