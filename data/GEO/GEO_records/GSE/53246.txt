TITLE
Plasmodium berghei Gametocytogenesis

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of gametocyte non-producer lines in Plasmodium berghei Transcriptome of gametocyte non producer lines (natural and genetic KO) and parental (820) lines.  The aim of the study was to identify key genes involved in the decision to commit to gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium berghei. These microarrays compare naturally selected lines that do not produce gametocytes, and the parental line and additionally a genetic knock out of AP2-G PBANKA_143750.  Data published Sinha, Hughes, et, al Nature tbc.

DESIGN
2- colour microarray comparing to common background pool (containing all life cycle stages). Replicates of different life cycle stages of gametocyte non-producer lines and wild tye (WT) parental control lines
