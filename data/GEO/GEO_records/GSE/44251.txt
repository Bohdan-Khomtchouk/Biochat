TITLE
Expression data from undifferentiated and differentiated mouse female ES cells PGK12.1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse arrays were used for expression analyses in undifferentiated and differentiated PGK12.1 ES cells. We found that the X:autosome expression ratios calculated from the mean expression values of X-linked and autosomal genes from microarrays was ~1.4 in undifferentiated female ES cells and then decreased to 1.2 in PGK12.1 cells after 15-day embryoid body differentiation. Thus, a substantial level of X upregulation is already evident in these ES cells prior to differentiation. Our findings based on Affymetrix expression arrays are consistent with microarray analysis from other labs and our RNA-seq analysis of mouse female PGK12.1 ES cells.

DESIGN
Mouse female ES cells PGK12.1 were differentiated by the EB (embryoid body) differentiation protocol. The presence of two active X chromosomes in undifferentiated female ES cells and one active X in 15-day differentiated cells was verified by Xist RNA FISH. Total RNA was prepared from undifferentiated and 15-day differentiated PGK12.1 and was used for expression array analyses to examine exprssion of the X chromosome during differentiation.
