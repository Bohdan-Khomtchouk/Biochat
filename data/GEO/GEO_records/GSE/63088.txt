TITLE
An RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of floral buds of an interspecific Brassica hybrid between B. carinata and B. napus

ORGANISM
Brassica napus ; Brassica carinata ; Brassica carinata x Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, 39,598; 32,403and 42,208 genes were identified in flower buds of B. carinata cv.W29, B. napus cv. Zhongshuang 11 and their hybrids, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in pollen wall assembly, pollen exine formation, pollen development, pollen tube growth, pollination, gene transcription, macromolecule methylation and translation, which might be associated with impaired fertility in the F1 hybrid. These results will shed light on the mechanisms underlying the low fertility of the interspecific hybrids and expand our knowledge of interspecific hybridization.
