TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of primary HCC tumors and their non-tumor tissue counterparts. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in 20 paired tumor and non-tumor tissues which were obtained from HCC patients who underwent surgery.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 20 paired samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
