TITLE
Expression data from AsPC1 cells treated with ICG-001

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The CREB binding protein inhibitor ICG-001 suppresses pancreatic cancer growth We used microarrays to detail global gene expression changes in the pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC1 following treatment with ICG-001 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin)

DESIGN
AsPC1 cells were treated with 10uM ICG-001 or vehicle control (DMSO) for either 6 hours or 24 hours.  AsPC-1 cells were also separately transfected with 20nM control siRNA or CTNNB1 siRNA for 48 hours.  RNA was extracted at these time points for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays
