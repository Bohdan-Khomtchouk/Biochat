TITLE
Acetaminophen (APAP) Rat Blood Test Gene Expression Data Set

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression test data set from rat blood samples exposed to either 150, 1500 or 2000 mg/kg of APAP for 3, 6 or 24 hours. The Supplementary file (appended below) contains the mapping for the decoding of blinded samples. Keywords: Dose response, Time course, Microarray, Gene expression

DESIGN
Male F344/N rats, 10-12 weeks old, were exposed to 0 (vehicle only), 150, 1500 or 2000 mg/kg APAP in 0.5% ethyl cellulose by oral gavage in two doses to increase absorption. The animals were sacrificed after 3, 6, or 24 hours. Equal amounts of RNA from the blood from each of six vehicle-only treated control animals were pooled at each time point and compared to individual control and treated animals at each dose and time period.  The samples were hybridized in duplicate for each individual rat for a total of 12 (test set) microarray chips per dose and time period. Experiments were performed according to the guidelines established in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and an approved Animal Study Protocol was on file prior to initiation of the study.
