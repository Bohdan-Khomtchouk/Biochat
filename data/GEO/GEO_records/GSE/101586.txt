TITLE
Profiling circular RNA expression in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a kind of novel non-coding RNAs. Recent evidence has known that circRNAs play important roles in various diseases; however, few circRNAs have been well characterized in lung cancer. Understanding the expression profile of circRNAs and protein-coding genes is critical to discover the pathogenesis of lung cancer.

DESIGN
Five female lung adenocarcinoma patients with no smoking history were selected to profile circular RNA expression with microarrays. Paired tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected and confirmed by pathologists.
