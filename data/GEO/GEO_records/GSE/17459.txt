TITLE
Down's syndrome with acute lymphoblastic pediatric leukemia (DS-ALL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DS-ALL is a highly heterogeneous disease with predominance of an aberrant exp. of CRLF2 cooperating with mutated JAK2 Acute lymphoblastic pediatric leukemia specimens of Down's syndrome are examined for gene expression profiles and specific genetic aberrations. Gene expression profiling and specific genetic variation analysis identify novel pathways involved in DS-ALL pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile analysis and specific genetic data are integrated to find characteristics of DS-ALL's
