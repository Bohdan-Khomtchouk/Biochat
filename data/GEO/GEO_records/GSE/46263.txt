TITLE
Studies on mature endothelial cells; exploring  mechanisms for improvement of cardiovascular diseases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC were treated in vitro with CoCl2 to induce hypoxia, high glucose and high glucose plus hypoxia in different intervals (1, 3, 12 hours). Subsequently, the effect of metformin (anti-diabetic drug) on all conditions was studied to take advantage of transcriptomics to prospectively explore the mechanism of this drug to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in type II diabetic patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from 66 HUVEC samples; 22 different conditions each has 3 biological repeats; labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
