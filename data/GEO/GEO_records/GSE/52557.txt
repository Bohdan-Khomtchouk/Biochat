TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of intestinal antigen presenting cells from control, HFD-induced prediabetic and diabetic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether diet-induced changes in gut microbiota modified intestinal immune cell gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome of antigen presenting cells isolated from the lamina propria of the small intestine of mice fed with different diet.

DESIGN
Mice were fed a high-fat diet to change microbiota. At 10 and 30 days after the diet start, microarrays were performed on lamina propria antigen presenting cells.
