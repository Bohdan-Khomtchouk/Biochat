TITLE
Early response of the fungus Pycnoporus coccineus to softwood and hardwood feedstocks

ORGANISM
Trametes coccinea

SUMMARY
White-rot basidiomycete fungi are potent degraders of plant biomass with the ability to mineralize all lignocellulose components. Recent comparative genomics studies showed that these fungi use a wide diversity of enzymes for wood degradation. Deeper functional analyses are however necessary to understand the enzymatic mechanisms leading to lignocellulose breakdown. The Polyporale fungus Pycnoporus coccineus CIRM-BRFM310 grows well on both coniferous and deciduous wood. In the present study we analyzed the early response of the fungus to softwood (pine) and hardwood (aspen) feedstocks.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in fungal mycelium after 3 days growth in liquid cultures on pine or aspen.
