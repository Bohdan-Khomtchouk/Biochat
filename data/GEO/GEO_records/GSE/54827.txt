TITLE
Transcriptional expression profiling of the two aneuploidies in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
There are various levels of aneuploidies in nature and many of them are highly associated with human tumer cells and genetic diseases. To understanding the transcriptional profiling of different levels of anuploidies, the wild type Col, trisomy 2, and tertiary trisomy 2 identified in Arabidopsis were studied by using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips.

DESIGN
Three samples (the wild type Col-0, trisomy 2, and tertiary trisomy 2) were analyzed.
