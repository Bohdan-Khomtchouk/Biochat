TITLE
miR expression after treatment with anti-miR-191 or control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to study the effectivity of miR down regulation by using an anti-miR molecule. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal disease with currently very limited beneficial therapies. MicroRNAs (miRs), which are considered to be master regulators of gene expression, have significant influence on cellular pathways and phenotype, and are de-regulated in HCC, and hence are thought to be of great therapeutic potential as novel targets. We identified hsa-miR-191 as a potential target for HCC therapy. Inhibition of this miR causes decreased cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vitro as well as a significant reduction of tumor mass in vivo in an orthotopic liver xenograft model. This miR was also found to be up-regulated by a dioxin, a known liver carcinogen, and was found to be a key regulator of cancer related pathways.

DESIGN
HCC cell line treated with anti-miR-191, and treated with negative control anti-miR. Although this experiment was done with dual channel, chanels are not compared, irrelevant samples were on the reciprocal channel.  Sample data tables represent relevant, single channel data.
