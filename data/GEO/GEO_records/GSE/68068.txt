TITLE
Investigating the effect of CodY mutation on the gene expression in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 SC19 strain.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of CodY mutation on the gene expression in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 SC19 strain, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes regulated by CodY mutation. DNA microarray analysis was performed using an Agilent custom-designed oligonucleotide microarray. Based upon the whole genome sequence of SC19 , specific 60-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed using eArray ( https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/ ), to cover all annotated genes. Probes were printed seven times on microarray slides. Three biological replicates of total RNA from two wild type strains and from two codY mutant strains were amplified and labeled with Cy3-CTP using Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color(Agilent technologies, US), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled cRNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). After fragmentation, microarray slides were hybridized with 600 ng Cy3-labeled cRNA. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 17 h with rotation at 10 rpm. Microarray slides were washed and scanned by an Agilent Microarray Scanner (G2565BA). Those genes with greater than two-fold change ratios were regarded as differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
codY mutation induced gene expression in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 SC19 was detected in two wild type and two codY mutated strain of  Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
