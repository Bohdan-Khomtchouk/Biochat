TITLE
Dataset #1 for genome-wide analysis of heritable dog osteosarcoma in 3 breeds

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma in dogs is a spontaneously occurring disease with a global tumor gene expression signature indistinguishable from human pediatric tumors and clinical progression is remarkably similar. Unlike human OS, canine OS is a highly heritable disease with some large and giant dog breeds at > 10x increased risk. We did a genome wide association study of osteosarcoma using the Illumina CanineHD genotyping array in three breeds: greyhound (mortality from OS = 26%), rottweiler (17%) and Irish wolfhound (IWH, 21%) and identified 33 inherited risk loci explaining 55 to 85% of phenotype variance in each breed.

DESIGN
Data created for a genome-wide association studio of heritable osteosarcoma risk factors in dogs, including 267 racing greyhounds (153 affected (A) + 114 unaffected (U)), 135 rottweilers (80 A + 55 U), 141 IWH (76 A + 65 U) and 19 AKC greyhounds using the Illumina CanineHD array (~170,000 SNPs genomewide)
