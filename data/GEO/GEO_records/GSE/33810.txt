TITLE
Expression data of tumor and non-tumor samples from patients with esophageal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used cDNA microarray to study the  gene expression profile between the tumor and non-tumor tissue samples from patients with esophageal cancer

DESIGN
Pooled RNA from 10 pairs of primary ESCCs without family history and 5 pairs with family history, relative to their corresponding non-tumor tissues were compared by Affymetrix microarrays.
