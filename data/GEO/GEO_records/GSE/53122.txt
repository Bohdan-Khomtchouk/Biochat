TITLE
Gene expression profiling of resistance genes to low temperature in leaves of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)

ORGANISM
Arachis hypogaea

SUMMARY
Investigation of  resistance genes from 36,158 peanut ESTs after cold stress treatment, compared with untreated peanut. Yield some useful insights into cold-mediated signal transduction pathways in peanut.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate untreated peanut leaves and three separate cold-treated peanut leaves.  Each chip measures the expression level of 36,158 ESTs.

PLATFORM
GPL18040 NimbleGen Peanut oligonucleotide microarray (36,741)
