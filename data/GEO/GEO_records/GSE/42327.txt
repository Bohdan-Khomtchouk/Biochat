TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis in Thoc5- and CFIm68-depleted HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that CFIm68, a mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factor implicated for alternative polyadenylation site choice, was co-purified with Thoc5, a component of human THO/TREX. Microarray analysis using human HeLa cells reveals knockdown of Thoc5 affects the expression of a subset of non-heat shock genes. Notably, depletion of Thoc5 attenuated the expression of the mRNAs polyadenylated at distal, but not proximal, polyadenylation sites, which phenocopied the depletion of CFIm68.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments using different siRNAs against Thoc5 (siThoc5-1and siThoc5-2) and CFIm68 (siCFIm68-1and siCFIm68-2) were performed. In both experiments, siDsRed was used as negative control.
