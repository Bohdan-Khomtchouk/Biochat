TITLE
Effects of MaxiK silencing in corporal smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MaxiK potassium channel is a key modulator of smooth muscle tone. Due to its calcium and voltage sensitivity, MaxiK is activated following depolarization and Ca2+ mobilization, therefore relaxing the muscle. We investigate the effects of silencing MaxiK for 48h in corpus cavernosuml smooth muscle (CCSM) cells to identify possible mechanisms of compensation through molecular crosstalk between pathways regulating smooth muscle tone.

DESIGN
Human CCSM cells were obtained from explant cell cultures. MaxiK channels were silenced for 48h then total RNA was extracted for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Global gene expression of 48h siRNA treated cells was compared to that of untreated controls.
