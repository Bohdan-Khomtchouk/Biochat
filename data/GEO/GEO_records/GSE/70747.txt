TITLE
Comparison of C3 or C3156-181-peptide treated Isolated primary rat neonatal Schwann Cells after 12 h

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differently expressed genes between C3 or C3156-181-peptide treated Isolated primary rat neonatal Schwann Cells. To elucidate the unresolved mechanism behind the promoting effect of C3156-181 on PNR we cultured primary rat neonatal SCs and treated them for up to 72 h with C3 or C3156-181. We then performed gene expression microarray analysis Results from two loops of two different treatment times are summarized in this study. The samples were taken from two C3 or C3156-181-peptide treated Isolated primary rat neonatal Schwann Cell cultures. Microarrays were hybridized in a loop approach.

DESIGN
Results from two loops that map to two different sampling times (loop1: after 12 hours, loop2: after 72) are compared in this study. The data in this file represents loop1. The samples were taken from untreated, C3 or C3156-181-peptide treated Isolated primary rat neonatal Schwann Cells.
