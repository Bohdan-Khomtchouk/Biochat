TITLE
Comparison of gene expression after induction of DNA endonuclease

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Investigating the induction of the SOS response after the introduction of a single dsDNA break per genome by expressing an endonuclease. The endonuclease is under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter.

DESIGN
Grow cells in minimal arabinose and at T0 split the culture. One set gets xylose to induce the endonuclease and the other does not. Each set is done in triplicate.

PLATFORM
