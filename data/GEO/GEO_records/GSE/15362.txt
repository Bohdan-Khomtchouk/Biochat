TITLE
Radiation-induced genes expressed in six murine tumors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling  was used to identify genes that display radiation-induced transcriptional change over tumor histopathology. Keywords: mouse squamous cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and mammary carcinoma, gamma-irradiation,  resected sample, transplanted tissues

DESIGN
C3H/HeMs male mice were irradiated by gamma-rays as local irradiation in single doses to hind legs where each tumor was transplanted. The animals were sacrificed up to 42 days after irradiation and recurrent point. Non-irradiated mice served as the controls. Each tumor sample was dissected and used for expression analysis.
