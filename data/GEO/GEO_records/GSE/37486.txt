TITLE
Expression profiling in young spikes of pistillody wheat line compared with normal wheat line

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes conferring induction of pistillody, homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures. As a result, we identified five genes which show higher expression levels in pistillody line compared with normal line. Quantitative expression analysis using real-time PCR indicated that among five genes a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein gene, WCBP1 (wheat calmodulin-binding protein 1), is obviously up-regulated in the young spikes of the pistillody line. The full-length cDNA sequence for WCBP1 showed it is a member of the ACBP60 family CaM-binding protein.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between the pistillody line and normal line. Total RNA samples were isolated from young spikes (3-10mm in length) at floret differentiation stage. Two independent experiments were conducted in each experiments.
