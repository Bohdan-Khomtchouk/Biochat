TITLE
Differential induction of apoptosis, IFN signaling and phagocytosis in macrophages infected with a panel of attenuated and non-attenuated poxviruses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Similarities as well as differences were found in macrophages infected with different virus strains, particularly at the expression level of immunomodulatory genes, but infection with MVA was particularly efficient in triggering changes in gene expression associated with increased activation of innate immunity.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, uninfected vs. infected cells. Biological replicates: 6 control replicates, 3 infected replicates.
