TITLE
EHUA Vibrio alginolyticus EPGS Nimblegen

ORGANISM
Vibrio alginolyticus

SUMMARY
Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative marine bacterium. A limited population of the organisms causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. In this study, Vibrio alginolyticus wild type strain EPGS is compared with the mutants of Ser-Thr kinase PpkA and phosphatase PppA, after cultured for 7h, in Luria-Bertani containing medium 3 % NaCl at 30 C. Our goal is to determine the ppkA and pppA regulon.

DESIGN
Three wild type and five mutant Vibrio alginolyticus samples were compared.
