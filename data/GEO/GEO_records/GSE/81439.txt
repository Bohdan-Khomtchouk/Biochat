TITLE
Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation (Human_RWPE1_RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome of human RWPE1 cells over-expressing wild type NKX3.1 and mutant NKX3.1 (T164A).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from RWPE1 cells engineered with empty vector (altered pTRIPZ), NKX3.1 wild type over-expression, and NKX3.1 (T164A) mutant over-expression. Engineered RWPE1 cells were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
