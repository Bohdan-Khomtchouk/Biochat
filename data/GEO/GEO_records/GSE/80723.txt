TITLE
Enhancer chromatin marks in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD lymphoid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped H3K4me1 and H3K27ac chromatin marks in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD lymphoid leukemias

DESIGN
Maps of enhancer chromatin marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias and FLT3-ITD leukemias were obtained by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500
