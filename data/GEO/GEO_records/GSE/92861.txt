TITLE
Expression data from individual MEF2A isoform knockdown in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Regulation of homeostasis and development of cardiac muscle tissues is controlled by a core set of transcription factors. The MEF2 family plays a critical role in these processes. We knocked down expression of MEF2 isoforms in a primary cell culture model of cardiomyocytes and assessed global expression pattern changes between MEF2 knockdowns, and with a negative control.

DESIGN
NRVMs were transduced with shRNA viral vectors to knockdown expression of individual MEF2 proteins. Cells were harvested 2 days post-transduction for Affymetrix global gene expression analysis. Each array represents a single biological replicate, and treatments were done in triplicate (3 arrays per treatment, each a single biological sample).
