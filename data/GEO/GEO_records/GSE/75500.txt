TITLE
Genomic profiling of stage II and III colon cancers reveals APC mutations to be associated with survival in stage III colon cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to stratify stage II and III colon cancer patients for risk of disease recurrence based on DNA aberrations, including DNA copy number aberrations (CNA) and CNA-associated chromosomal breakpoints. To this end, high quality array-CGH data of clinically well-annotated colon cancer specimens was generated using FFPE material from a selected series of primary tumor and patient-matched normal tissue.

DESIGN
arrayCGH data of 114 stage II and III colon cancers.
