TITLE
Interactions between Yeast Proteins and Rsp5 Ubiquitin Ligase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify substrates of the ubiquitinating E3 enzyme Rsp5 we applied purified Rsp5 to duplicate protein arrays. The Rsp proteins were expressed as fusion proteins to GST. We used as a control Ubr1, a RING domain containing E3 ligase

DESIGN
We analyzed Rsp5 from S.cerevisiae on duplicate arrays, with four control chips, two without Rsp5 and two with Ubr1.
