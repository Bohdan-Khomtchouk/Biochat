TITLE
Expression data from preimplantation mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Landmark events occur in a coordinated manner during preimplantation development of the mammalian embryo, yet the regulatory network that orchestrates these events remains largely unknown. We delineated the regulons of Oct4, Sall4, and Nanog using morpholino (MO)-mediated gene knockdowns followed by microarray analysis of pooled embryos.

DESIGN
1-cell fertilized mouse embryos were injected with a morpholino and were collected at either 20 hours or at 44 hours after microinjection.
