TITLE
Expression profile in response to salt-treatment in wheat using 11k wheat array

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Global expression analysis of transcripts in response to salt treatment was carried out for common wheat using oligo-DNA microarrays. Microarrays have been designed from unique wheat genes classified from a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two-week-old seedlings of common wheat were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 1, 6 and 24 hours and their roots and shoots were separately subjected to microarray analyses. Consequently, 5996 genes showed changes in expression of more than two-fold, and were classified into 12 groups according to correlations in gene expression patterns. These salt-responsive genes were assigned functions using Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Genes assigned to transcription factor, transcription-regulator activity and DNA binding functions were preferentially classified into early response groups. On the other hand, those assigned transferase and transporter activity were classified into late response groups. These data on gene expression suggest that multiple signal transduction pathways in response to salt treatment exist in wheat. Salt-responsive transcription factors (TFs), namely AP2/EREBP, MYB, NAC and WRKY, were selected and their expression patterns compared with those of rice. Most showed different expression patterns in wheat and rice in response to salt treatment. Furthermore, comparing the microarray data for wheat and rice, only a small number of genes were up- or down-regulated in common in response to salt treatment. These findings suggest that salt-responsive mechanisms distinct from rice might be present in wheat, and wheat genes can contribute to providing novel gene resources for breeding of salt-tolerant crops.
