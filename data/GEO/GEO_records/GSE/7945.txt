TITLE
No-Transcriptional impact of Cd-induced nitric oxide synthesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-08_no - no - Cadmium treatment induces slow but long lasting nitric oxide production in plant tissues. This NO production can be suppressed using the commonly used Nitric Oxide Synthase inhibitor L-NAME. This inhibitor tends to partially alleviate Cd toxicity. This effect is correlated with a strong diminution of Cd content in roots of plants treated both with Cd and L-NAME compared to roots from plants treated with Cd only. The main goal of this study is the identification of transcriptionnal changes caused by Cd-induced nitric oxide, and that could potentially result in enhanced Cd root accumulation.  - Germination of surface sterilized seeds was performed on solid MS/2 medium. After 2 weeks, the young plantlets were placed on sand for an additional 3 week period in a controlled environment (8 h photoperiod of 300 umol m-2 s-1, 22degreeC, 70% relative humidity) . Plants of similar rosette diameters were then transfered to an hydroponic culture using the nutritive solution described in [Gravot et al. 2004 FEBS Letters 561:22-28] for an acclimation of 3 days. L-NAME and cadmium treatments were respectively started 1 and 2 hours after the start of illumination and root tissues were collected 24 h later and immediatly frozen in liquid nitrogen before RNA extraction. Treatments were : 1 : control 2 : L-NAME 5 mM 3 : Cd 30 uM 4 : L-NAME 5mM + Cd 30 uM 5 : Cd 15 uM For each condition, 3 independent biological repetitions were conducted. RNA were extracted separatly and checked for quality before pooling together. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
