TITLE
Hairpin RNA induces secondary small interfering RNA synthesis and silencing in trans in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We provide evidence of the generation of Rdp1-mediated secondary siRNAs in vivo in fission yeast. Secondly, we show that the presence of Ago1-associated siRNAs does not guarantee robust silencing.

DESIGN
We obtained sequences from gel purified small RNAs of wt and rdp1delta fission yeast cells and FLAG-ago1 associated small RNAs.
