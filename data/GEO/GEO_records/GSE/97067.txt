TITLE
Transcriptome analysis on wild type and ddx39a mutant zebrafish embryos by Next Generation Sequencing

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
DEAD box RNA helicase DDX39A has been shown to regulate RNA metabolism; however its role in vertebrate development has not previously been examined. To determine the impact of loss of ddx39a on transcriptome during vertebrate early development, we pursued transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) on wild type and ddx39a mutant zebrafish embryos at 24 hour-post-fertilization. And by using RIP-seq to identify targeted RNA which were DDX39A binded.

DESIGN
Using RNA-seq to identify the changes in the transcriptomic landscape in ddx39a mutants. Using RIP-seq to identify DDX39A binding RNAs.
