TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs between Alzheimer's disease and control mice's hippocampus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs influence restorative physiological or degenerative pathological processes in several neurological disorders, yet their role in Alzheimer’s disease remains unclear. Here we compared microRNAs expression in the period of AD pathogenesis when mice first begin to have detectable extracellular Aβ deposition. Tg2576 mice aged 9-10 months and their wild type littermates, as well as a double transgenic model of AD, APP/ PS1M146V/+  and wild type C57BL/6J mice both at 3-4 age months (n=3) were used. Hippocampus tissue miRNAs were detected by hybridization to microarrays having 924 mammalian miRNA probes.The result indicated that some of the deregulated miRNAs in AD mice have been implicated in amyloid beta production.
