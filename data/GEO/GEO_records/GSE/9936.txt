TITLE
Expression data from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) coexpressing ERalpha and Erbeta, treated with phytoestrogens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global transcriptional response mediated by ERalpha or ERbeta to the phytoestrogen genistein in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell model. Keywords: ligand response over time course

DESIGN
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells expressing endogenouse Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERalpha) were infected with adenovirus carrying either estrogen receptor beta (AdERb) or no insert (Ad) at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 20.  Cells were then treated with either vehicle control (veh), 6nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 6nM genistein (LG), 300nM genistein (HG), 300nM S-Equol (EQ), HG+3uM ICI182,780 (IG), EQ+3uM ICI 182,780(IE) for additional periods of 4h or 24hr before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to determine if genistein and S-Equol, phytoestrogens selective for the ERbeta can elicit transcriptional response distinctive from those mediated by the ERalpha.
