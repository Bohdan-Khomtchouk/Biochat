TITLE
Expression data from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) coexpressing ERalpha and Erbeta, treated with phytoestrogens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global transcriptional response mediated by ERalpha or ERbeta to the phytoestrogen genistein in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell model. Keywords: ligand response over time course
