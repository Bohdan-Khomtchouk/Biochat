TITLE
Deciphering a functional gene network underlying robustness to protein overproduction

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We systematically investigated the impact of genetic variation and the environment on protein overproduction costs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae To identify genes mediating protein overproduction costs, genetic perturbations were applied. The yEVenus overexpression plasmid was crossed into gene deletion backgound. The generation of double mutant strains enabled us to investigate the transcriptional response of the cells under two different internal stress: deletion of a given gene, plus the overexpression of a gratuitous protein

DESIGN
To explore the cellular response under gratuitous protein overproduction, a sensitized background was used (sse1 deletion). Our aim was to identify differentially expressed genes upon protein overproduction. 3-3 biological replicates were used for the control (single deletion strain with an empty plasmid) and for the overexpression strains (single deletion strain with yEVenus multi-copy plasmid) as well. The cellular response to overexpression was normalized to the control sse1 deletion strain, without overexpression.
