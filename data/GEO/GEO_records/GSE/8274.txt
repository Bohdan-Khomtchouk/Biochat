TITLE
Molecular Markers for Predicting Potato Tuber Bruise Susceptibility

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Blackspot bruising is the tuber discoloration resulting from mechanical damage in susceptible crops and is a major quality and environmental problem for the potato industry. The present study is aimed at identifying differences in gene expression which are correlated with the development of bruise susceptibility or resistance in tubers.  This may produce markers or diagnostic tests for use in predicting enhanced bruise susceptibility in field grown potato crops.  Different potato cultivars were grown in field plots at ADAS Gleadthorpe, Nottinghamshire, UK during three growing seasons – 2003, 2004 and 2005.  Random samples of tubers (8) were harvested by hand and cores excised from the subdermal tissues of the stolon end of the tubers and immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolations.  The remainder of the crops were stored at 4oC for bruise susceptibility testing - samples of tubers (30) from each crop were impacted and incubated for 48h at 30oC.  Bruise susceptibility was scored, according to the intensity of pigmentation and the volume of tuber tissue affected, on a scale of 0 (very resistant) – 10 (very susceptible). Crops representing 'very susceptible', 'susceptible', 'moderate' and 'resistant' to bruising, were selected for RNA isolation.  Total RNA’s were isolated from frozen cores by the TIGR hot phenol extraction method, precipitated by LiCl and treated with DNase.  RNA concentrations were adjusted to ~2ug/ul and analysed on 1% TBE gels after formamide treatment. Any RNA’s which were not pure enough or showed degradation were discarded. Total RNA’s were pooled and 25ul samples aliquotted according to the required hybridisations indicated in the Excel spreadsheet and the on-line information form. Keywords: Direct comparison
