TITLE
Analyzing the role of transcription elongation factors Spt4-5 in splicing

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A set of 22 expts. aimed at identifying splicing events dependent upon on the Spt4-5 transcription elongation factors in yeast.  Four spt mutants and an mRNA capping mutant were analyzed four times each, including biological and technical (dye-swap) replicates.  Two wt vs wt expts. were also performed.
