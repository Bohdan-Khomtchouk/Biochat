TITLE
Gene expression analysis of GD9.25 vehicle- or cyclopamine-exposed mouse frontonasal prominence and ventral prosencephalon tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify Hedgehog-regulated genes in the frontonasal process (FNP) and ventral prosencephalon at GD9.25 in mice, during the initial pathogenesis of cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

DESIGN
Frontonasal process and underlying ventral prosencephalon tissues were microdissected from GD9.25 (20-24 somite pairs) mouse embryos exposed to vehicle or cyclopamine from GD8.25-9.25.  Tissues were pooled by litter to minimize intralitter variability.  N=6 vehicle and N=6 cyclopamine pooled litters were included in the analysis.
