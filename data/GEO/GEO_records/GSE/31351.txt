TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the effect of CT16 (PAGE5) silencing by RNAi in A2058 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular gene expression profiles were investigated after CT16 (PAGE5) silencing in CT16 positive A2058 melanoma cells. Control siRNA treated A2058 cells was used as a negative control.

DESIGN
Total RNA from three individual cultures of A2058 cells treated with CT16 siRNA and from three individual cultures of A2058 cells treated with control siRNA.
