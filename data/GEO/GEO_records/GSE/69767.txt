TITLE
Gene expression profiles of normal human tonsillar cell subpopulations FACS sorted based on expression of cell surface markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the progenitor-enriched CD44+NGFR+ cells present in the crypt and surface regions of the tonsil, we used an Illumina array system to analyze the transcriptome of these cells isolated from the tonsillar crypt and surface regions of three different individuals as well as the total epithelial (CD45-CD31-) populations obtained from two of these.

DESIGN
To enrich for epithelial progeniors in human palatine tonsil tissue, hematopoietic and endothelial cells were depleted from freshly isolated cell suspensions derived from palatine tonsils using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The resultant CD45-CD31- population was further fractionated into four subpopulations using antibodies against CD44 and NGFR. Based on the immunohistochemical phenotype and in vitro functional assays, CD44+NGFR+ subpopulations were identified as epithelial progenitor-enriched subsets.  Microarray profiling was used to derive gene expression signatures of CD45-CD31- subsets (total epithelial-enriched) and CD45-CD31-CD44+NGFR+ subpopulations (progenitor-enriched).
