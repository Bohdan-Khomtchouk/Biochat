TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human Th17 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aims at identifying transcriptional changes induced by in vitro polarization of human cord blood CD4+ cells towards Th17 subtype with combination of IL6, IL1b and TGFb by using timeseries data. In this study, we identified gene expression changes characterizing early stages of human Th17 cell differentiation program through genome-wide gene expression profiling. Primary T helper cells isolated from umbilical cord blood were used to construct detailed kinetic patterns of gene expression after initiation of Th17 differentiation with IL1b, IL6 and TGFb. The dataset described provides the starting point for defining the gene regulatory networks and identifying new candidates regulating the Th17 differentiation in human.

DESIGN
Altogether 57 samples were analyzed representing 3 biological replicates of timeseries data (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours) of Th17 polarized cells and control Th0 cells
