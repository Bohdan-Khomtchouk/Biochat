TITLE
A TGFB Responsive Gene Expression Signature is Associated With More Severe Skin and Lung Disease in Diffuse Scleroderma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary dermal fibroblasts from patients with dSSc and healthy controls were treated with TGF beta for up to 24h and the genome-wide patterns of gene expression measured on DNA microarrays. 894 genes were identified as TGF beta-responsive in 4 independent cultures of dermal fibroblasts (2 healthy control and 2 dSSc patients).  The 894 genes in the TGF beta-responsive signature are associated with induction of growth factor signaling, collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix deposition.
