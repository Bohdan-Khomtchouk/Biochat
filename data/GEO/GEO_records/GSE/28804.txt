TITLE
Synergism of Iraqi Sand/Cigarette Smoke Co-Exposure in Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Synergism of Iraqi Sand/Cigarette Smoke Co-Exposure in Rats. 24 samples are used.

DESIGN
A total of 102 rats will be separated into six exposure groups: each group consisting of 17 male CD Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 to 15 weeks old.  The six exposure groups were each exposed via two routes: 1. nose-only inhalation exposures --- air or cigarette smoke; 2. whole-body inhalation exposures -- air or manufactured silica sand or Iraqi sand.  The nose only exposures were conducted 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 6 weeks.  During the last two weeks of the nose - only exposures, whole-body exposure were also conducted 18-19 hours per day, 7 days per week.
