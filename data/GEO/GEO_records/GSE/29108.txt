TITLE
The role of a novel CAR-induced gene TUBA8 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Tuba8 gene was identified as a CAR-regulated gene that was induced during phenobarbital (PB) promotion of liver tumor. TUBA8 was then over-expressed in heaptocarcinoma cells to determine the function of TUBA8.

DESIGN
First, identify genes that are regulated by CAR and are induced during liver tumor development. Second, overexpressiong of an identified gene in transformed cells to detemine the biolgical function of the gene product. In this manuscript, the TUBA8 gene was examined.
