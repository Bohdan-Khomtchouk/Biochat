TITLE
In vivo actin cross-linking induced by type VI secretion system is associated with intestinal inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether the Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) is functional during animal infection, derivatives of V52 were used to infect infant mice.  In this infection model, a diarrheal response occurred and effector translocation could be detected.  These host responses were dependent on a functional T6SS and on the actin cross-linking effector domain of VgrG-1. Gene expression and histological studies showed innate immune activation and immune cell infiltration in the intestinal lumen.

DESIGN
3 infection groups (mock, V52, ACD), 3 biological replicates per group.
