TITLE
Expression data from control or CCR4b/CNOT6L-depleted cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The stability of mRNA influences the abundance of cellular transcripts and proteins. Deadenylases play critical roles in mRNA turnover and thus are important for the regulation of arious biological events. Here, we report the identification and characterization of CCR4b/CNOT6L, which is homologous to yeast CCR4 mRNA deadenylase. We compared the expression profiles of the cellular genes between control and CCR4b/CNOT6L-depleted cells by microarray analysis

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from control or CCR4b-depleted cells. Following the isolation of RNA, all subsequent technical procedures, including quality control of RNA, labeling, hybridization, and scanning of the arrays, were performed in BIO MATRIX Research, Inc., cDNA, and biotinlabeled cRNA was synthesized according to protocols for Affymetrix array analysis. Biotin-labeled cRNAs (15  g) were hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). To determine the average differences for each probe set, changes were calculated by a global normalization method using Affymetrix GCOS (GeneChipOperating Software) software.
