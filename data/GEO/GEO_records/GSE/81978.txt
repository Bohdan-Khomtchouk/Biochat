TITLE
Effect of SF3B1 suppression in cancer cells with different SF3B1 copy-number levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer cell lines containing stable dox inducible shRNAs targeting SF3B1 were profiled by RNA sequencing. We determined the effect of gene expression and splicing changes before and after knocking down SF3B1 in cell lines with normal copy number (SF3B1neutral) or partial copy loss (SF3B1loss) cell lines

DESIGN
RNA profiles for SF3B1 suppression were generated from 8 breast cancer cell line pairs (-/+ dox) with no techincal replicates.
