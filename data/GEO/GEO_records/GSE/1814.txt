TITLE
Transcriptional effects of the TOR2-controlled signaling function

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptional effects of the TOR2-controlled signaling function using a genome-wide microarray approach in yeast. In S. cerevisiae, TOR2 has two essential signaling functions. One, shared with TOR1, is required for translation initiation, transcription, and cell growth in response to the presence of nutrients. The second is unique to TOR2, and functions in cell-cycle-dependent actin polarization and possibly in transcription. A previous genetic screen for mutants defective in the TOR-shared and the TOR2-unique functions identified several TOR2 temperature-sensitive alleles. In this study, we compared total transcription profiles for strain SH121, which is specifically defective in the TOR2-unique function, and its isogenic wild type counterpart SH100.
