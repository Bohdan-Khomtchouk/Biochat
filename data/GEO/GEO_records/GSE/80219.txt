TITLE
Condensin II complex mediates interactions of histone gene loci

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Condensin complexes are known for their importance in chromosome condensation during mitosis. However, condensin II binds to the geome during interphase as well. The role of condensin II in genome organization in mammalian interphase nuclei is not characterized. Since condensin II binds to the promoters of the transcriptionally active promoters in interphase genome, the aim of this study is to uncover its role in mediating chromatin interactions between active gene promoters such as histone gene loci.

DESIGN
Examination of interactions between histone gene loci in control and condensin II knockdown cells by 4C-seq
