TITLE
CTCF and cohesin regulate chromatin loop stability with distinct dynamics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study investigates the nuclear organization and the binding dynamics of CTCF and cohesin by super-resolution microscopy and ChIP-seq. We determined the genome-wide binding profile of CTCF and Rad21 cohesin subunit in wild type mouse ES cells and compared them to a double FLAG-Halo-mCTCF/mRad21-SNAPf-V5 knock-in mES line, generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to perform imaging experiments.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of CTCF and Rad21 cohesin subunit in wild type mouse ES cells (WT) and in mouse ES cells homozygous for FLAG-Halo-CTCF and Rad21-SNAPf-V5 (C59 clone). ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared independently from two ChIP biological replicates, using normal serum IgGs as a control, and including total inputs as reference datasets.
