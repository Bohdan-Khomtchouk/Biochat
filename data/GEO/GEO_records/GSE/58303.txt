TITLE
Mouse brain tissue after methanol and normal saline treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently showed that methanol emitted by wounded plants might function as a signaling molecule for plant-to-plant  and plant-to-animal communications. In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol  dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and  exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic  waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol  concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and  regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested  that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol.  Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of  mRNAs from genes involved in cell signalling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol  acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis

DESIGN
4 mouse were treated with methanol for 2 h and 4 with normal saline for 2 h, than we collected brain tissue samples and extracted total RNA by Trizol according to manufacturer's protocol
