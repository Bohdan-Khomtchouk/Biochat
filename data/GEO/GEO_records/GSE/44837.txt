TITLE
Gene methylation profile of breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the gene methylation profile of 26 breast cancer cell lines to identify variations associated with different phenotypes and molecular subtype. The panel includes 13 estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and 13 ER+ cell lines. Four of the ER- cell lines and 5 of the ER+ cell lines are HER2 positive.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 26 samples was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip.
