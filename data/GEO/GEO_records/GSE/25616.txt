TITLE
Liver expression data from lactating QSi5 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The liver plays a crucial role in energy partitioning and is particularly important for the increased demand from the mammary gland during lactation. The present study identifies genes associated with negative energy balance in lactating mice. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying negative energy balance and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The pregnant mice was fed a high GI diet during and throughout pregnancy until peak lactation (HGI group; n = 5). The second group was fed a low GI diet over the same period (LGI group; n = 5). The HGI diet included 51.4% (W/W basis) of glucose and a gross energy of 15.6MJ/Kg and the LGI diet contained 51.4% (W/W basis) of high amylase starch (Hi-Maze) and a gross energy of 16.3MJ/Kg. At the end of this period, mice were euthanazed and livers were removed and microarray was performed.
