TITLE
Basal in vitro transcriptomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
This study uses microarray analyses to examine baseline gene expression profiles for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates relative to reference strain CDC1551 during log phase growth in vitro in 7H9 broth. For this in vitro analyses, log-phase mycobacteria in starter cultures grown to mid-log from frozen stocks were inoculated into 7H9-OADC medium in 25-cm2 vented flasks at an OD of ~0.05 and grown without shaking for ~1 week to an OD of ~0.5-0.6.
