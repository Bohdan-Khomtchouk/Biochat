TITLE
Sba1 ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Sba1 (yeast p23 homolog) was performed as described (PMID: 10376605) using an antibody specific for Sba1 (PMID: 10691735) or normal rabbit serum (Control) and logarithmically growing yeast. We report 572 genomic locations associated with sba1.

DESIGN
Genome wide sba1 occupancy on yeast genome were profiled using ChIP-seq
