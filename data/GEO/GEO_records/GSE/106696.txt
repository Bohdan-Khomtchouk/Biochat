TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in scramble and GPR126 knockdown colon cancer cells (HT-29)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Identify genes regulated by GPR126 in colon cancer cells by RNA-seq analysis Methods: Use shRNAs to knock down GPR126 in HT-29 cells, total RNAs from scramble group (NC) and GPR126 knockdown group (Sh1) were subjected to RNA-sequencing. Results: Around 700 transcriptomes were up-regulated in GPR126 knockdown HT-29 cells, and 14000 transcriptomes were down-regulated in GPR126 knockdown HT-29 cells.GPR126 mainly regualtes genes from DNA synthesis and cell cycle-related pathways. Conclusions: Our study firstly showed the function of GPR126 regulating colon cancer cell proliferation by targeting genes invovled in DNA synthesis and cell cycle-related pathways.

DESIGN
RNA interference in colon cancer cell line HT-29, knock down GPR126 expression, and conduct gene expression profiling by RNA-seq. Two groups, one sample from each group.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
