TITLE
Microarray analysis to unravel the function of C-terminus domain of EBF1 by gain-of function approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of C-terminus domain of EBF1, a gain-of function microarray analysis was performed by transducing Empty, Ebf1wt and Ebf1DC expressing vectors into Ebf1-/- progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Freshly prepared Ebf1−/− c-Kit+ fetal liver cells were transduced with  pmys-Empty-IRES-GFP, pmys-EBF1wt-IRES-GFP and pmys-EBF1DC-IRES-GFP. EBF1wt- or EBF1ΔC-transduced cells were sorted as early pro-B cells (GFP+CD19+BP1−Thy1−Mac1−NK1.1−CD3−). vector-transduced cells were sorted as only GFP+.
