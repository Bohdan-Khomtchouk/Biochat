TITLE
Gene expression profile of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs), induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs), and heart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profile of total 24460 probes in the iCMs. The gene expression shifts from a fibroblast state toward a cardiac-like phenotype by Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5/Mesp1/Myocd (GMTMM) or GMTMM/miR-133 transduction at 7 days after transduction. MiR-133 silenced fibroblast signatures in parallel with cardiac gene activation, and Snai1 overexpression inhibited the effects of miR-133-mediated cardiac reprogramming.

DESIGN
HCFs were used for negative control, human heart tissue for positive control. Gene expression profiles were compared among HCFs, iCMs and heart. 24460 probes were analyzed in each experiment.
