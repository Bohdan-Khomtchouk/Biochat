TITLE
Hsa-miR-500a-5p target discovery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hsa-miR-500a-5p (miR500a) activity has been associated with breast cancer survival. We used gene expression arrays (Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0) to discover relevant targets of miR500a.

DESIGN
MiR500a was overexpressed (mimics) or suppressed (inhibitor) in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D). Triplicates or quadruplicates of each condition were used for RNA extraction after 2 days of transfection and gene expression analyses.
