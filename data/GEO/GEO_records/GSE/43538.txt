TITLE
Spirodiclofen resistance in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
The goal of our microarray experiments was to compare the gene expression profile of two spirodiclofen resistant spider mite strains (SR-VP and SR-TK) with that of a susceptible spider mite strain (LS-VL)

DESIGN
5 samples were analyzed: 3 biological replicates for SR-VP, 2 biological replicates for SR-TK

PLATFORM
GPL15756 Agilent-028213 Tetranychus urticae Expression Array
