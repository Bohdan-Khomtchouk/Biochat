TITLE
Gene expression signatures in ex vivo Cytarabine (Ara-C) and Daunorubicin (Dnr) sensitive AML samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wide inter-individual variation in terms of outcome and toxic side effects of treatment exist among patients with AML receiving chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (Dnr). Drug resistance and relapse are considered major causes of treatment failure. Gene expression profiling was undertaken to address possible mechanisms of Ara-C/Dnr resistance. Based on ex vivo Ara-C cytotoxicity at diagnosis, Ara-C sensitive (IC50 < 3uM AraC) and Dnr sensitive samples (IC50 < 0.5 uM) (5 samples each) were included for microarray analysis. These were compared with the samples which were drug resistant ex vivo at diagnosis. Our microarray experiment resulted in indentifying differentially expressed genes under ex vivo Ara-C sensitive as well as Dnr sensitive samples compared to ex vivo Drug resistant samples.
