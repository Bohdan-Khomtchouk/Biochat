TITLE
Gene expression profile of cell lines 2106T, H1975 and MeWo after knockdown of PAEP.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile was analyzed after knockdown of PAEP in lung cancer cell lines 2106T and H1975 as well as in skin cancer cell line MeWo. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of PAEP and its protein product glycodelin in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with a control siRNA or a siRNA pool of 4 siRNAs targeting PAEP. RNA of three biological replicates each was extracted and used for Affymetrix analyses.
