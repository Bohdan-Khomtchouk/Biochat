TITLE
Effect of Isoflurane and LTM on basolateral amygdala

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fear conditioning in rats leads to long term memory (LTM) formation. A central neural substrate for LTM is the basolateral amygdala. We sought the expression changes specific to LTM at 6h following anesthesia with isoflurane (a general anesthetic and an effective amnestic agent), following pain (a component of conditioning), and following conditioning in presence and absence of isoflurane. Keywords = anesthesia, amygdala, LTM, Rampil, Isoflurane, fear, memory Keywords: other

DESIGN
For baseline control 9 samples were used. 5 samples each were used for all other experimental conditions: isoflurane, pain, conditioning and conditioning in presence of isoflurane.
