TITLE
RNA-Seq of SHEP TET21N cells upon Doxorubicin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MYCN-high and MYCN-low neuroblastoma cells differ in their responses to Doxorubicin treatment. To explain this difference we compared the global trancriptomes of MYCN-high and MYCN-low cells before, during and after treatment.

DESIGN
MYCN-high cells without doxycyline and MYCN-low cells with doxycycline were treated with 0.1Âµg/ml Doxorubicin.  Transcriptome was measured for the following time points: in untreated cells,  in cells which were treated with Doxorubicin for 72 hours, and in cells collected three, eight and fourteen days after Doxorubin washout.  Experiment was performed in biological duplicate.
