TITLE
Expression analysis in anaerobic Hanford 100H aquifer flow-through columns receiving lactate and chromate

ORGANISM
mixed sample

SUMMARY
Columns containing Hanford 100H aquifer sediment continuously infused with 5 mM lactate, 5 uM Cr(VI), and either 7.5 mM sulfate or 12 mM nitrate as an electron acceptor.

DESIGN
A two-chip study using total RNA extracted from unfiltered effluent from columns (nitrate or sulfate infused).

PLATFORM
GPL18536 Functional gene array for anaerobic Hanford 100H aquifer community
