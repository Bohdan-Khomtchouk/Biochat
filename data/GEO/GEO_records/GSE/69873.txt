TITLE
ERG promotes the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells by restricting their differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of the transcription factor ERG in hematopoiesis we generated Erg heterozygous knockout and conditional Erg knockout mice. We found that several hematopoietic cell types were decreased in these mice. To define Erg downstream target genes in hematopoietic stem cells, we sorted Lineage-, Sca-1+, c-kit+, CD150+, CD48- cells from Erg +/- mice for gene expression analysis. To define Erg downstream target genes in hematopoietic progenitors, we sorted multipotent progenitors (Lineage-, Sca-1+, c-kit+, CD150-) from Erg -/- mice for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
We generated Erg heterozygous knockout mice and provide 3 replicates for wild type (Erg +/+) populations of stem cells (HSC) and 3 replicates for Erg +/- mices. We also generated a conditional Erg knockout mice. We provide 3 replicates for Erg fl/fl and 3 replicates for Erg (-/-) mice.
