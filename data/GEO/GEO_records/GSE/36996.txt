TITLE
The overall effect of parasitization by Nasonia vitripennis on its host Sarcophaga crassipalpis

ORGANISM
Sarcophaga crassipalpis

SUMMARY
Nasonia vitripennis injects venom into its host organism Sarcophaga crassipalpis together with the eggs in order to make it suitable for the offspring to survive. The venom is known to suppress the hosts immune system, elevate the lipid levels, slow down development, et cetera.This microarray can uncover new transcriptomal effects on the host organism after natural envenomation that have not been discovered by bioassays. Since transcriptomal effects will vary during time, two different time points have been selected, 3 and 25 hours after parasitization.

DESIGN
16 individuals per sample, 4 replicates per group, loopdesign, 4 control individuals per time point, dye swap

PLATFORM
GPL15391 Agilent-035742 Custom Sarcophaga crassipalpis Array (Ag-S.Crassipalpis)
