TITLE
Division-induced DNA double strand breaks in the chromosome terminus region of Escherichia coli lacking RecBCD DNA repair enzyme

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
RecBCD protein complex is an important player of DSB repair in bacteria and bacteria that cannot repair DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) have a low viability. Whole genome sequencing analyses showed a deficit in specific sequences of the chromosome terminus region in recB mutant cells, suggesting terminus DNA degradation during growth. We studied here the phenomenon of terminus DNA loss by 42 whole genome sequencing and microscopy analyses of exponentially growing bacteria. We tested all processes known to take place in the chromosome terminus region for a putative role in DNA loss: replication fork termination, dimer resolution, resolution of catenated chromosomes, and translocation of the chromosome arms in daughter cells during septum formation. None of the mutations that affect these processes prevents the phenomenon. However, we observed that terminus DNA loss is abolished in cells that cannot divide. We propose that in cells defective for RecBCD-mediated DSB repair the terminus region of the chromosome remains in the way of the growing septum during cell division, then septum closure triggers chromosome breakage and, in turn, DNA degradation.
