TITLE
Genome-wide binding of the homeodomain transcription factor Sine oculis (So) in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide binding of the highly conserved TF Sine oculis (So), which is necessary for Drosophila eye development and has few previously known direct transcriptional targets. Our data identify novel putative targets of So-mediated regulation, including genes involved in multiple aspects of development.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of ChIP-seq with anti-So antibody on chromatin from D. melanogaster third instar eye-antennal imaginal discs; negative control - same sample and ChIP-seq protocol without anti-So antibody

PLATFORM
GPL11203 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Drosophila melanogaster)
