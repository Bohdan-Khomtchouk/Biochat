TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Clostridium Perfringens infection in broilers on medicated and non-medicated diets.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of clostridium perfringens infection in broilers on medicated and non-medicated diets using chicken 44k agilent microarray. To elucidate molecular and ceelular mechanisms of bacitracin effect on CP infection in chickens by microarray technology.

DESIGN
A total number of 600 Ross broilers were reared in 12 pens with each hosting 50 birds.  Each 6 pens of birds were fed bacitracin-medicated (55 ppm) or non-medicated starter diets immediately after the chicks were placed. At day 18, birds were challenged with CP. Spleens were collected from 12 birds of each group at day 18 (before infection), 19, 20, and 22. Total RNA was labeled by Cy3 or Cy5 with dye swap. Gene signal intensity was globally normalized by LOWESS and expressed on natural log scale. A mixed model including treatment, time, array (random effect), dye, and all interactions among treatment, time was used to identify differentially expressed genes between treatments, at the 1% significance level.
