TITLE
Next generation RNA sequencing to identify overexpressed transporter genes in Zymoseptoria tritici field strains

ORGANISM
Zymoseptoria tritici

SUMMARY
Septoria leaf blotch is a worldwide threat for wheat and mainly controlled by the application of synthetic fungicides. The fungal pathogen responsible for this disease, Zymoseptoria tritici, was shown as highly adaptable to its host plant, but also to fungicide challenge. Over the past decades it developed resistance to most fungicides due to target site modifications. Recently isolated strains showed cross-resistance to diverse fungicides and to unrelated drugs, suggesting a resistance mechanism that seems rarer in phytopathogenic fungi, known as multidrug resistance (MDR) in other organisms. In this study we show for two Z. tritici MDR strains, MDR6 and MDR7, enhanced prochloraz efflux sensitive to the modulators amitryptiline and chlorpromazine. Efflux was also inhibited by verapamil in the MDR7strain. Transcriptomics revealed several overexpressed transporter genes in both MDR strains, out of which the expression of the MgMFS1 transporter gene was the strongest and constitutively high in tested MDR field strains. Its inactivation in the MDR6 strain abolished resistance to fungicides with different modes of action revealing its involvement in the MDR phenomenon in Z. tritici.

DESIGN
A total of four strains were compared, two sensitive (IPO323, S6) and two MDR strains (09-ASA-3apz; 09-CB01) with three replicates each. All strains were grown in liquid YPD medium to exponential growth.
