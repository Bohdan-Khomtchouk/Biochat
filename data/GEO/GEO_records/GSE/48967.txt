TITLE
Effects of FGF2 and cell culture surface on the transcriptome of adult human dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study set to determine the effects of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 and cell culture surface (tissue culture plastic and glass) on the transcriptome of adult human dermal fibroblasts. Transcriptional profiles of adult human dermal fibroblasts grown in four experimental conditions (glass, glass and addition of FGF2, plastic, plastic and addition of FGF2) were compared. Comparison of the transcriptomes will allow to identify significantly differentially expressed genes due to FGF2 and surface treatment, which in turn will allow for identification of the pathways affected by these factors in the human adult fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of adult human dermal fibroblasts grown on tissue culture plastic and glass, with and without 4ng/ml FGF2, was performed in two biological replicates and three technical replicates for each treatment condition.
