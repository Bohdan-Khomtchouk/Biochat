TITLE
Estrogen signaling through Estrogen Receptor ⍺ alters lipid metabolism and promotes glomerulonephritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from glomeruli with and without functional ER⍺ duringnNephrotoxic serum-induced nephritis. There is sex bias in SLE and lupus nephritis with a 9:1 women to men ratio. Timecourse microarray analysis of glomeruli isolated from kidneys during nephrotoxic serum-induced nephritis (NTN) reveled altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in WT females compared to ER⍺KO females.

DESIGN
We analyzed glomerular extracts from the kidney cortices of 16 female mice (8 C57Bl/6 (B6), 8 B6.ER⍺KO) from 4 time-points after NTS injection: untreated, 18 hours, 6 days, 2 weeks.(2 mice per time point per strain)
