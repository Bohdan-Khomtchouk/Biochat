TITLE
HES2 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in standard conditions and FACs sorted for GCTM-2 and CD9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HES2 ESCs were grown in standard ES culture conditions.  After 1 week, these cells were FACs sorted for the presence of GCTM-2 and CD9. Keywords: Sorted cell comparison

DESIGN
Three consecutive passages of HES2 cells were grown and subjected to FACs sorting. For each, 4 sorted populations of cells (p4, p5, p6, p7) were collected and these were subjected to microarray. A total of 12 samples: 3 replicates each of p4, p5, p6, and p7.
