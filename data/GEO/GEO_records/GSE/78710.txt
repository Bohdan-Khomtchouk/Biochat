TITLE
SNP microarray of T-REx-293-based clones overexpressing the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A conditional and isogenic system for APOBEC3B (A3B) induction in T-REx-293 cells. Cells were engineered to express doxycycline-inducible A3B-eGFP or eGFP constructs and subjected to 10 rounds of A3B-eGFP exposure causing 80-90% cell death. Control pools (eGFP) were subjected to parallel rounds of non-toxic eGFP exposure, and dilutions were done each round to mimic A3B-eGFP induced population fluctuations. DNA was extracted and subjected to SNP analyses using the Human OmniExpress-24v1-0 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Genotyping was performed using the humanomniexpress_24v1-0_a cluster file.

DESIGN
SNP data is avaiable for a total of 16 samples, all derived from single cells mother lines A and C. For each series, each consisting of 8 samples, A3B-eGFP and eGFP daugther clones were processed on the SNP microarray, as well as 3 A3B-eGFP and 3 eGFP grand-daugther clones.

PLATFORM
GPL21168 HumanOmniExpress-24 v1.0 BeadChip [SNP_ID version]
