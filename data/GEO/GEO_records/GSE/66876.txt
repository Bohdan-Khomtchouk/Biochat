TITLE
Pancreatic cancer exosomes induce pre-metastatic niche formation in the liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancers (PCs) are highly metastatic with poor prognosis, mainly due to delayed detection. We hypothesized that intercellular communication is critical for metastatic progression. Here, we show that PC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naïve mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden. Uptake of PC-derived exosomes by Kupffer cells caused transforming growth factor β secretion and upregulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells. This fibrotic microenvironment enhanced recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed in PC-derived exosomes, and its blockade prevented liver pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Compared to patients whose pancreatic tumors did not progress, MIF was markedly higher in exosomes from stage I PC patients who later developed liver metastasis. These findings suggest that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PC liver metastasis.
