TITLE
Genome-wide identification of transcripts associated with lncRNA-ATB by RIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in TGF-β signaling is still unknown. In this study, we observed that the lncRNA-Activated by TGF-β (lncRNA-ATB) was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases and associated with poor prognosis. lncRNA-ATB upregulated ZEB1 and ZEB2 by competitively binding the miR-200 family and then induced EMT and invasion. In addition, lncRNA-ATB promoted organ colonization of disseminated tumor cells by binding IL11 mRNA, inducing autocrine of IL11 and triggering STAT3 signaling. Globally, lncRNA-ATB promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade. Thus, these findings suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies.

DESIGN
To identify mRNA species bound by lncRNA-ATB, we performed an RIP to pull down endogenous mRNAs associated with the lncRNA-ATB and sequenced the retrieved RNA.
