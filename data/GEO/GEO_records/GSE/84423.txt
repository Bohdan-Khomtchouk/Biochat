TITLE
4-phenylbutyrate treatment prevents amyloid formation and restores β-cell function in mice overexpressing human islet amyloid polypeptide.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) is a chemical chaperone that has been shown to ameliorate β-cell dysfunction associated with hIAPP overexpression. The aim of the study was to investigate the in vivo effects of PBA in transgenic mice overexpressing hIAPP. We used microarrays to determine gene expression changes in pancreatic islets from mice overexepressing hIAPP and treated with PBA during 12 weeks.

DESIGN
8 weeks old wild type and hIAPP transgenic mice were treated with PBA (1g/kg/day) dissolved in water for 12 weeks. Pancreatic islets were isolated at sacrifice. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
