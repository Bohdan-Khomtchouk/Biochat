TITLE
A comparative analysis of genistein and daidzein in affecting lipid metabolism in rat liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Effects of soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, on the hepatic gene expression profile and indices for lipid metabolism were compared in rats. The GeneChip data was normalized and summarized by using SuperNORM data service (Skylight Biotech Inc.). Significance of expressional change among groups was tested by 2-way ANOVA on the normalized CEL data, which was deposited in a tab-separated ASCII text format. Principal components were identified on the summarized gene data.

DESIGN
Three groups of rats were fed with an experimental diet containing 2 g/kg of either genistein or daidzein, or a control diet free of isoflavone for 14 days.  The basal composition of the experimental diet was (in g/kg): casein, 200; palm oil, 100; corn starch, 150; cellulose, 20; mineral mixture (AIN-93G), 35; vitamin mixture (AIN-93), 10; L-cystine, 3.0; choline bitartrate, 2.0 and sucrose to 1 kg.
