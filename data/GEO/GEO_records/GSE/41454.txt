TITLE
Enhanced immune response of BMDCs pulsed with H9N2 AIV and CpG

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen presenting cells, have demonstrated effective in controllingthe initial of innate immune, while CpG could improve the performance of immune system. To explorethe mechanism of CpG enhancing the immune response, we compared different stimulated mouse DCswith systemic approach microarrays. Analysis revealed 1840 differentially expressed genes in H9N2stimulated group, more than 1728 altered genes in inactive H9N2 group. Investigation also proved thatCpG/inactive H9N2 co-stimulation changed 2140 genes, more than that in H9N2 group, strongly demon-strated that CpG improved the performance of inactive H9N2 vaccination. Pathways analysis founded thatDCs response rapid to shift in their maturation state, which involved Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathwaysignificantly. Microarrays results were also verified by qRT-PCR with 14 elected representative genes. Fur-ther analysis proved that co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II), regulatory protein(IRF-7 and TRAF-6) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12) were all changed and involvedin DCs maturation. At last we demonstrated TLR signalling pathway in chicken bone marrow-deriveddendritic cells (chBM-DCs) stimulated with CpG. The distinct transcriptional profiles of DCs pulsed withvarious stimuli expanded our understanding of how DCs respond and recognize influenza.

DESIGN
The cultured mouse BMDCs were randomly divided into 6 groups (1: control DCs group, 2:CpG stimulated group, 3: H9N2 stimulated group, 4: CpG/H9N2 co-stimulated group, 5: inactivated H9N2 stimulated group, 6: CpG/inactivated H9N2 co-stimulated group). we used microarray to reveal striking transcriptome differences of different stimulated DCs.
