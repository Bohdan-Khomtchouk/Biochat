TITLE
Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy: post-expedition vs. pre-expedition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the skeletal muscle adaptations induced by exercise performed at high altitude hypoxia, we investigated if the gene expression profile of Vastus lateralis muscle was affected by 5000 m-above-sl-expedition.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy post-expedition vs Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy pre-expedition. Five volunteers/climbers. Biological replicates: 1 pre-expedition sample, 1 post-expedition sample.
