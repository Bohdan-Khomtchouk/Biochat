TITLE
The Brucella abortus virulence regulator, LovhK, is a sensor kinase in the general stress response signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis

SUMMARY
We sequenced the transcriptomes of B. abortus 2308 wild type, rpoE1, and lovhK deletion strains to assess gene expression in response to oxidative stress. The data represent 2 independent biological replicates of each strain.

DESIGN
Illumina RNA-seq of total mRNA isolated from wild type, rpoE1, and lovhK deletion strains that were each exposed to 5 mM hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.

PLATFORM
