TITLE
small RNA deep-sequencing of mature sperm, testis and uterus in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to discover novel small RNAs expressed in mature sperm, we isolated mature sperm from mouse cauda epididymis, comparing with data from adult tesis and uterus. The small RNA fraction (18-40nt) was cloned and sequenced from total RNA of mature sperm, testis and uterus of mice.

DESIGN
RNAs extracted from mature sperm, adult testis and uterus were used for high throughput sequencing analysis
