TITLE
Comparison of the DNA methylation of in vitro cultured bovine SAM-treated blastocysts and non-treated blastocysts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Epigenetics (DNA methylation) profiling of bovine in vitro cultured expanded blastocysts (EB) comparing control non-treated expanded blastocysts with SAM-treated expanded blastocysts. S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) is the global methyl donor providing methyl

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, bovine non-treated expanded blastocysts (pools of 10) vs bovine SAM-treated expanded blastocysts. Four biological replicates of each tissue were hybridized to four two-color arrays in a dye-balanced design.

PLATFORM
GPL18700 EmbryoGENE DNA Methylation Array Bovine 2x400K v2.0 (Feature Number)
