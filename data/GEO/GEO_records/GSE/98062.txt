TITLE
Gene expression in non-adherent MDA-MB-468 subpopulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasticity between adhesive and less-adhesive states is important for mammalian cell behaviour. To investigate adhesion plasticity, we have selected a stable isogenic subpopulation of MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells which grows in suspension. These suspension cells are unable to re-adhere to various matrices or to contract three-dimensional collagen lattices. By transcriptome analysis, we aimed to identified the determinants of adhesion plasticity, and found downregulation of the focal adhesion protein tensin3 (Tns3).

DESIGN
6 samples: 3 independent RNA preparations of parental MDA-MB-468 cells (ctrl 1, ctrl2, ctrl3), and RNA preparations of 3 independently isolated MDA-MB-468 subpopulations (suspA, suspB, suspC)

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
