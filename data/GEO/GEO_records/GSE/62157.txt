TITLE
A role of regulatory T cells in brown adipose tissue physiology

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The presence of different types of immune cells in adipose tissue has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Whereas cells of the immune system in white adipose tissue contribute to the low-grade chronic inflammation under obese conditions, their function in brown adipose tissue (BAT) remains largely elusive. Here we report a role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in BAT physiology.Ablation of Treg cells resulted in massive invasion of macrophages into BAT concordant with rearrangement of BAT morphology. Treg ablated animals displayed reduced energy expenditure. Our results for the first time demonstrate a functional role of Treg cells in the regulation of energy homeostasis.

DESIGN
Two experimental conditions: PBS injected mice as a control vs. diphtheria toxin (DT) injected. 3 biological replicates were used.
