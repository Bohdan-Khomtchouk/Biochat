TITLE
Glomerulonephritis in BXSB/MpJ-Yaa mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of glomeruli isolated from kidneys of 4 month male BXSB/MpJ-Yaa. The  BXSB/MpJ-Yaa mouse strain is a lupus-prone model. Results provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms linked to glomerulonephritis in BXSB/MpJ-Yaa mice.

DESIGN
The glomeruli were isolated from 6 BXSB/MpJ-Yaa (glomerulonephritis model) and BXSB/MpJ-Yaa+ (control). 6 glomerular populations of each strain were devided into 3 groups (1 group / 2 populations). 3 glomerulonephritis models versus 3 controls analysis was performed. BXSB/MpJ-Yaa is a recombinant inbred strain developed originally from a C57BL/6 female mouse and a SB/Le male mouse. Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune accelerator locus) localizing on the Y chromosome of BXSB/MpJ-Yaa male mice is the result of a duplication of an about 4 Mbp telomeric segment near the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome onto the Y chromosome. BXSB/MpJ-Yaa+ (control)  male mice carry the wild-type Y chromosome in place of the mutant Yaa-containing Y chromosome of BXSB/MpJ-Yaa male mice.
