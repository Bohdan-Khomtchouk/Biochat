TITLE
RNA-Seq Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Sex Expression in Melon (Cucumis melo L.)

ORGANISM
Cucumis melo

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was conducted among sergeant bulks of four sex types of melon flowers, namely monoecious (AAGG), gynoecious (AAgg), hermaphrodite (aaGG), and andromonoecious (aagg), a total of about 105 million reads were generated from the melon transcriptome using Solexa sequencing.Totally 79,698 unigenes were generated and 75,537 unigenes were mapped to 11,805 annotated  proteins in assembled melon genome (Garcia-Mas et al., 2012). Transcripts related to photomorphogenesis and flower development in plants were found, Most of the genes encoding plant hormone metabolism related protein, others related to flora development including Tasselseeds and male sterility genes which in phytohormones pathway were also detected. Comparison each two bulks (AAGG:AAgg, AAGG:aaGG, aagg:AAgg and aaGG:aagg ) exhibited different profiles of putative genes (include 745, 1342, 858 and 571 different expression genes, respectively).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of four sex types of melon flowers, namely monoecious (AAGG), gynoecious (AAgg), hermaphrodite (aaGG), and andromonoecious (aagg) were  were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000.

PLATFORM
