TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs between the fenpropathrin resistant and susceptible strains in Tetranychus cinnabarinus

ORGANISM
Tetranychus cinnabarinus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The present study provides the firstly large-scale characterization of miRNAs in Tetranychus cinnabarinus and the comparison between fenpropathrin resistant and susceptible strains gives a clue on study how miRNA involving in fenpropathrin resistance Methods: Using Illumina sequencing to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs between the fenpropathrin resistant and susceptible strains of Tetranychus cinnabarinus Results: 12 miRNAs that were expressed significantly differently were identified between thethe fenpropathrin resistant and susceptible strains of Tetranychus cinnabarinus

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 500  female adults aged 3-5 days post emergence from fenpropathrin resistant and susceptible strains of Tetranychus cinnabarinus,two biological repeats for each strain Raw sequencing read data were submitted to SRA: SRP067789

PLATFORM
GPL21302 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Tetranychus cinnabarinus)
