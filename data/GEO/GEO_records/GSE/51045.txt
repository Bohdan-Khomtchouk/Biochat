TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) occupancy in mouse liver at different Zeitgeber times (ZTs).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped SMRT binding on the genome in mouse livers and found no obvious circadian rhythm.

DESIGN
12-weeks old C57BL/6 male mice were fed ad libum. Livers were harvested at 5 pm (ZT 10) and 5 am (ZT 22) with 4 mice in each group. Anti-SMRT ChIP was performed independently in each mouse and pooled together for deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
