TITLE
NESG1-mediated differential expression genes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential expression genes in NESG1-overexpressed and negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma. NESG1 is a candidate tumor suppressor in NPC. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of NESG1 in NPC.

DESIGN
NESG1 cDNA was transfected into NESG1-negative NPC 5-8F cells and affymetrix microarrays HG-U133_Plus_2 were used to analyze the differential genes in NESG1-overexpressed NPC cells and their control NESG1-negative NPC cells.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
