TITLE
Impact of Elevated Plasma 5-HT on Global Gene Expression of Murine Megakaryocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to understand the functional consequences of plasma biogenic amine serotonin (5-HT) elevation in megakaryocytes by measuring gene expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the megakaryocytes of mice treated with either 5-HT or saline and global gene expression was measured.
