TITLE
Expression data from M(LPS+IFNγ) and M(IL4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human monocyte THP-1 cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS and supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (Gibco BRL). THP-1 was differentiated into macrophages by 24-h incubation with 160 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) followed by 24-h incubation in RPMI medium. Macrophages were further polarized to M1 macrophages by incubation with 10 pg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) and 20 ng/ml of interferon (IFN)-γ (R & D Systems, MN) and are referred to as M(LPS+IFN-γ) cells. M2 macrophages were obtained by incubation with 20 ng/ml of interleukin (IL)-4 (R & D Systems) and are referred to as M(IL4) cells. To test the represented polarization marker of PMA differentiated-THP-1 macrophages stimulated with 20 ng ml(-1) IFNγ + 10 pg ml(-1) LPS and 20 ng ml(-1) IL-4, which are known to influence macrophage polarization in vetro into the M1 and M2 state, respectively. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression pools to identify distinct M1 and M2 state during this process.

DESIGN
To test the polarization of macrophage. PMA differentiated-THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with IFNγ+LPS and IL-4. THP-1 derived macrophages, including M(LPS+INFγ) and M(IL4) cells, were processed in Trizol and then analyzed using the Affymetrix U133 Array platform.
