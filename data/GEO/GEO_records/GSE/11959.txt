TITLE
Anti-IGF-IR antibody h10H5 induces a unique transcriptional profile in SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma xenograft tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system consists of two ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II), which both signal through type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) to stimulate proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, with activity contributing to malignant growth of many types of human cancers. We have developed a humanized, affinity-matured anti-human IGF-IR monoclonal antibody (h10H5), which binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain. h10H5 inhibits IGF-IR-mediated signaling by blocking IGF-I and IGF-IIbinding and by inducing cell surface receptor down-regulation via internalization and degradation. In vitro, h10H5 exhibits anti-proliferative effects on cancer cell lines. In vivo, h10H5 demonstrates single-agent anti-tumor efficacy in human SK-N-AS neuroblastoma and SW527 breast cancer xenograft models, and even greater efficacy in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent Docetaxel or an anti-VEGF antibody. Anti-tumor activity of h10H5 is associated with decreased AKT activation and glucose uptake, and a 316-gene transcription profile with significant changes involving DNA metabolic and cell cycle machineries. These data support the clinical testing of h10H5 as a biotherapeutic for IGF-IR-dependent human tumors. Keywords: Gene expression changes as markers for drug activity

DESIGN
Two treatment groups with four tumor samples per group are collected and analyzed,
