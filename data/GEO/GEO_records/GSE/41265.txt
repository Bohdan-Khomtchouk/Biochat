TITLE
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals widespread heterogeneity in gene regulation and RNA processing in stimulated immune cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq to discover extensive cell-to-cell variability – in transcript expression levels, cell state, circuit usage, and alternative splicing – between stimulated immune cells

DESIGN
RNA seq libraries from 18 single cells, 3 populations of 10,000 cells, and 2 zero cells (negative controls) with SMARTer. Three additional single cell libraries with molecular barcodes (MB) using a modified SMARTer protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
