TITLE
Route specific dermal responses to vaccinia virus infection

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of rabbit skin infected via the intradermal or scarification route of infeciton assessing the early time post infection. Transcriptional profiles were assessed at 4hrs, 24hrs, and 48hrs post infection for each route of infection. Transcript variation is as compared to normal, uninfected rabbit skin.

DESIGN
Two condition, three time points per condition. 3 biological replicates per time point per condition. Normal rabbit skin was used as the control.
