TITLE
Gene expression data from  human metastatic melanoma tumors that may predict response to RAF265

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine how mutation of BRAF affected the response to RAF265, we utilized a tumor orthotopic implant model of early passage melanoma tumors in nude mice from a series of 17 patients with advanced metastatic Tumor growth was compared between RAF265 treatment (40 mg/kg, QD) and diluent control groups. The melanoma associated gene mutation profile and global gene expression profile were determined on these human melanoma samples by SNaPshot and Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 Array, respectively. Tumors were evaluated for growth response to RAF265 in an orthotopic implant model using nude mice. Comparisons were made between gene expression profiles of responders and non-responders, BRAF mutant and BRAF wild type tumors. Analysis of the microarray data revealed responders exhibited enriched expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, cell-cell adhesion and initiation of epithelial/mesenchymal transition. It is concluded that RAF265 significantly inhibits the growth of a sub-population of V600E mutant and wild type BRAF human melanoma tumors in vivo and the gene expression profile of this subset of tumors that may predict response to RAF265.

DESIGN
RNA from 17 human metastatic melanoma tumors was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
