TITLE
Transcriptional and translational effect of the lack of translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4E

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
One of the most regulated steps of translation initiation is the recruitment of an mRNA by the translation machinery. In eukaryotes, this step is mediated by the 5Â´end cap-binding factor eIF4E bound to the bridge protein eIF4G and forming the eIF4F complex. In plants, different isoforms of eIF4E and eIF4G form the antigenically distinct eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F complexes proposed to mediate selective translation. Using a microarray analysis of polyribosome- and non-polyribosome-purified mRNAs from 15 day-old Arabidopsis thaliana wild type [WT] and eIF(iso)4E knockout mutant [AteIF(iso)4E-1] seedlings we found 79 transcripts shifted from polyribosomes toward non-polyribosomes, and 47 mRNAs with the opposite behavior in the mutant. The translationally decreased mRNAs were overrepresented in root-preferentially expressed genes and proteins from the endomembrane system, including several transporters such as the phosphate transporter PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1), Sucrose transporter 3 (SUC3), the ABC transporter-like with ATPase activity (MRP11) and five electron transporters, as well as signal transduction-, protein modification- and transcription-related proteins.

DESIGN
For transcriptional analysis used total RNA of AteIF(iso)4E-1 seedlings of 15 days old to known the changes on transcripts leves by the eIF(iso)4E absence, using as control Wt seedlings. The experiments were performed in duplicate, and swap analysis were done. For translational analysis, used non-polysomal and polysomal RNA of AteIF(iso)4E-1 seedlings of 15 days old in order to known the transcripts that are modified in their translational levels by the eIF(iso)4E absence, using as control non polysomal and polysomal RNA of Wt seddlings.
