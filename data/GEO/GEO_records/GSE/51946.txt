TITLE
miRNA profile of lung adenocarcinoma cells treatment with monoclonal antibody NJ001 [miRNA_12h_24h_48h]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previously, we developed a newly monoclonal antibody named NJ001 which selectively reacted to non-small cell lung cancer and exhibited anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and so on. MiRNA ubiquitously regulates cell processes such as cell cycle regulation, invasion, differentiation and proliferation. We used microarrays to detail the miRNA changes in the lung adenocarcinoma cell SPC-A1 after treatment with NJ001. These miRNA may have contribution to the effect of NJ001 on cancer cells.

DESIGN
SPC-A1 cells treated with or without NJ001 were used as study group or control group respectively and everygroup has three biological repeats. Since we observed larges amounts of miRNA changes after NJ001treatment for 72h in SPC-A1. Another three time-points (12h, 24h, 48h) was added to find more earlier dynamic changes  expression levels of miRNA, which may be more important to the anti-tumor activity of NJ001.
