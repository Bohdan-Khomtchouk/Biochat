TITLE
De novo transcriptome sequencing in Anopheles funestus using Illumina RNA-seq technology

ORGANISM
Anopheles funestus

SUMMARY
We report the use of RNA-seq data to assemble transcriptional units of adult Anopheles funestus female mosquitoes. We also analyzed expression levels and protein divergence and discovered SNPs.

DESIGN
Examination of full body mRNA from a single sample of 30 adult females. Center Name: Cornell-BPL. Fragments include median insert size of 103 bp,  average insert size of 250 bp with a standard deviation of 22.

PLATFORM
GPL10459 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Anopheles funestus)
