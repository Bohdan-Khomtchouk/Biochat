TITLE
LSD1 knock down in SY5Y Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the functional relevance of LSD1 in neuroblastic tumors, SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against LSD1 or with a scrambled control siRNA. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression that were consistent with these observations 72 hours after LSD1 knock-down. At this time, 28 genes were significantly induced at least 1.5-fold and 29 genes were significantly repressed at least 1.5-fold. Among the 28 induced genes, 4 are markers of cytoskeletal remodelling (TNS1, TPM1, DNM2, DNAL4), indicating differentiation, and 3 (TPM1, DNM2 and SHANK2) are functionally linked to neurite dynamics and synaptic trafficking. TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression changes detected via microarray analysis for LSD1, DNAL4, DNM2, TNS1 and TPM1

DESIGN
SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNA directed against LSD1 or control siRNA. 2 independent transfection experiments were performed each. Reverse transcription, labelling of total RNA and subsequent hybridization to Affymetrix U133v2 chips were performed according to the manufacturerÂ´s protocols
