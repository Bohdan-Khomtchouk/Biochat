TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of primary AML specimens exposed to AhR modulating agents

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify genes that are directly or indirectly coregulated by the AhR pathway in primary human AML cells. Patient AML cells were treated for 16 hours with the two indirubin derivatives 6-bromoindirubin-3'oxime (BIO), 1-Methyl-6-bromoindirubin-3'oxime (MeBIO), the AHR-antagonist SR1 (StemReginin1), combinations of BIO+SR1 and MeBIO+SR1 or DMSO alone at indicated concentrations prior to RNA extraction for sequencing.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq performed on 5 primary AML samples fresh (t0) and after exposure to AhR-agonists (2), -antagonist (1), and DMSO Contributor: Leucegene Project, IRIC

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
