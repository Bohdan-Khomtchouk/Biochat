TITLE
Isolated cardiomyocyte and cardiac fibroblast expression analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Some cell type-specific gene expression is maintained in the maturation of cardiomyocytes, where DNA hypomethylation of gene body regions of a set of specific genes. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression program underlying the maintenance of cardiomyocyte function and maturation and compared it with DNA methylation status.

DESIGN
Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were carefully isolated from neonatal and adult hearts and used fresh for the analysis.
