TITLE
Epigenetic dynamics of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine during mouse spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Studies on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during germ cell development are still at the beginning stage. In the present study, we used our highly specific 5hmC-labeling and enrichment technique coupled with DNA deep-sequencing to profile the global 5hmC distribution in 8 serial stages of male germ cells during spermatogenesis, as well as in the the Sertoli cells (SE) which are the only somatic cell type inside seminiferous tubules. We analyzed the genomic distribution and dynamic changes of 5hmC during spermatogenesis. Moreover, to dissect the functional significance of 5hmC modifications for transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we also performed RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis in all of the 8 corresponding stages of male germ cells and found that 5hmC is positively correlated with gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA-seq: Examination of the transcriptomes during mouse spermatogenesis. 5hmC-seq: Identification of 5hmC enriched genmoic regions in mouse germ cell.
