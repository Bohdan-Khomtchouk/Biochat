TITLE
Regional commonalities and specificities of age-related changes in hippocampal transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The project examined age-related change in hippocampal gene expression in Fisher 344 x Brown Norway F1 rats from the NIA aging colony (Adult = 12M, Aged = 24M).  CA1, CA3, and DG specific dissections were examined from one cohort of animals and from a second cohort whole hippocampus was used.

DESIGN
Hippocampal gene expression with aging in a rat model was examined between Adult (12M) and Aged animals (24M)
