TITLE
Egg quality after natural and controlled ovulation

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The present study aimed at studying the rainbow trout egg transcriptome using 9152-cDNA microarrays after natural or controlled ovulation. The analysis of egg transcriptome after natural or controlled ovulation led to the identification of 26 genes. We observed that both hormonal induction and photoperiod control of ovulation induced significant changes in the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes. We demonstrate that hormonal induction of ovulation has an impact on the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes even though the resulting effects on the developmental potential of the egg is so far unknown. In addition, we also identified 1 gene exhibiting a differential mRNA abundance in eggs of varying developmental potential. Keywords: Egg quality-dependent
