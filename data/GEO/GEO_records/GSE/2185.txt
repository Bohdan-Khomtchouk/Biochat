SUMMARY
Expression of the sense-antisense transcripts (SATs). Methods: The sequences of 60mer DNA specific to the sense and antisense genes were chosen by K.K. DNAFORM (Japan), and Agilent Technologies manufactured custom oligo DNA microarray chips by using this information. RNA was labeled and hybridized using Fluorescent Direct Label Kits (oligo dT-primed labeling) (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocols. For labeling with random nanomers, we used the CyScribe First-Strand cDNA Labeling Kit (Amersham). The RNA samples used for microarray experiments were from mouse ES cells, SL10 cells (fibroblast cell line), brain, heart, and testis. The total RNA of brain, heart, and testis for array experiments was purchased from Ambion. The total RNA of ES and fibroblast cells was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The same total RNA samples were reciprocally labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, hybridized to the oligo DNA on the chip, and dye-normalized, and processed signals were obtained using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies). Keywords: parallel sample
