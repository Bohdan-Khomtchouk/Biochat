TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of IDH-mutant astrocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the diversity of expression states within IDH-mutant astrocytoma tumors, we profiled 6341 cells from 10 tumors by single cell RNA-seq

DESIGN
Tumors were disaggregated, sorted into single cells, and profiled by Smart-seq2. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Submitter declares reads will be made available through controlled access SRA and/or dbGaP.**
