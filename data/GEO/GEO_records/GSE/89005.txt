TITLE
Changes of lncRNA expression in primary human skin fibroblasts after irradiation with UVA or UVB

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), cells alter gene expression, switching on a variety of damage response pathways. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is thought to play critical roles in regulating expression of protein-coding genes. We hypothesized that lncRNAs also regulate gene expression following UV exposure and screened for changes in lncRNA expression in human primary fibroblasts after irradiation with longwave UV (UVA) or shortwave UV (UVB).

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles in primary human skin fibroblasts were determined 6 and 24 hours after single exposures to 200 kJ/m2 UVA or 500 J/m2 UVB. In addition, gene expression profiles were also determined 24 hours after three daily exposure to 100 kJ/m2 UVA or 200 J/m2 UVB. Triplicate samples of sham-irradiated cells and duplicate samples of irradiated cells were examined. Labeled cRNA were hybridized onto the Human LncRNA Array v3.0 (Arraystar). This array has been designed specifically for the detection of lncRNAs. It contains 30,586 probes for lncRNAs and 26,109 probes for mRNAs.
