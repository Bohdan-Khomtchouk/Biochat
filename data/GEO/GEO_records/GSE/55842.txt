TITLE
Gene expression analysis of eight-cell stage rat embryos sired by paternally exposed males to saline or BEP

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
8-cell stage rat embryos were sired by males treated with saline or a chemotherapeutic cocktail, BEP, consisting of Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin for 9 weeks. Animals were given an additional 9 weeks of recovery, without any treatment, prior to mating.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling for 84 stem cell transcription factors. Total RNA extracted from 25-35 embryos at the eight-cell stage sired by control or BEP-treated males after a 9-wk recovery period (2 females mated per male, n= 4 males/treatment).
