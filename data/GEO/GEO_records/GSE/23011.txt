TITLE
Transcription profile of colon biopsies from normal (NOR) donors, patients, underwent resection for CRC (M-CRC) and patients carriers of mutations predisposed to HNPCC (HNPC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The challenge of preventing colorectal cancer (CRC) is the early identification of individuals whose apparently normal colorectal mucosa will develop cancer, because of inherited trait or environmental exposure. We sought to use genome-wide expression profiling of endoscopic biopsies to detect a signature of propensity for cancer. We performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis of normal appearing mucosa of the following cases: healthy individuals, disease-free carriers predisposed to HNPCC (hereditary non-polyposis CRC), disease-free patients who underwent curative large bowel resection for CRC 1 to 15 years earlier and patients with CRC.

DESIGN
This profiling is based on the analysis of 4 donors who underwent curative large bowel resection for CRC from 1 to 19 years before (M-CRC samples), 4 disease-free carriers of mutations in the mismatch repair system genes, who are predisposed to develop HNPCC (HNPCC samples) and 4 endoscopy-negative, asymptomatic individuals (NOR samples)
