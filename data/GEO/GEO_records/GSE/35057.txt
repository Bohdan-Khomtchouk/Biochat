TITLE
Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 and 5 regulate different set of genes in high and low red/far-red light

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
As sessile organisms plants developed a veriety of adaptive responses to the ever changing environment. One of these responses is the shade avoidance syndrome which is composed of different responses like elongation growth, hyponastic leafs or early flowering to shade (low R/FR). Phytochrcome Interacting Factor 4 and 5 are bHLH transcription factors reported to activate gene expression upon perception of low R/FR. Using this miroarray experiment we identified new genes regulated by PIF4 and PIF5 in response to shade and investigated their genome wide role.

DESIGN
Here pif4pif5 double mutant, pif5 single mutant and PIF5 overexpressing line were compared to Col-0 wild type A. thaliana plants when grown under 12:12 DL circles for 14 days in high R/FR and either kept in high R/FR or transferred to low R/FR for additional 2 hours
