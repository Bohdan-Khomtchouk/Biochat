TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing and Analysis of Three Sheep Intestinal Regions

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
To identify intestinal metabolic related genes and reveal these molecular regulation mechanisms, we sequenced and compared the transcriptomes of mucosal epithelial tissues between cecum, proximal colon and duodenum. A total of 5420 genes constructed by 8055 transcripts were identified as differential expressed genes.

DESIGN
Transcriptome comparison of three sheep intestinal regions.
