Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling between oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles [MeDIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The physiological, biochemical and functional difference of oxidative and glycolytic muscles play important roles in human metabolic health as well as in meat quality of animal. To explore this aspect, we firstly provided a genome-wide landscape of DNA methylomes and their relationship with mRNA and miRNA transcriptome for PMM (psoas major muscle; oxidative) and LDM (longissimus dorsi muscle; glycotic) in this study. We observed hypomethylation of subtelomeric regions and high mitochondria content contributed to fast replicative senescence in PMM. The DMRs in promoter (478) and gene bodies (5718) were main enriched in GTPase regulator activity and signaling cascade mediated pathway. Integration analysis revealed methylation status within gene promoter (or gene body) and miRNA promoter have significant negative correlation with mRNA and miRNA expression, respectively. Which included numerous genes were closely related to distinct phenotypic traits between LDM and PMM. For instance, the hypermethylation and down-expression of HK-2 and PFKFB4 decreased the glycolytic potential in PMM. In addition, we validated the promoter hypomethylation and up-expression of miR-378 results in silencing the target gene expression and inducing promoted capillaries biosynthesis in PMM. Together, these results provide a thorough understanding of muscle metabolism and development from an genomic and epigenetic perspective.

DESIGN
The aim of our study is to identify different methylated genes that are linked to the phenotype of physiological, biochemical and functional variation in oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles
