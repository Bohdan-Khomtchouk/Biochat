TITLE
hepatocellular carcinoma vs. corresponding noncancerous liver or normal liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major health problem worldwide, and HCC patients have a poor prognostic outcome. In this study, we systematically disclose mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, and also effectively identify and validate novel anticancer targets in HCCs. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
total 58 cDNA microarrays, all experiment samples are hepatocellular carcinoma. RNAs from  33 corresponding noncancerous livers and 5 normal livers were used as the reference, respectively. The tumor samples were labeled with Cy5-dUTP.The nontumor samples were labeled with Cy3-dUTP.
