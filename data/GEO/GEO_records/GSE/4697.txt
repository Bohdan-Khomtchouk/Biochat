TITLE
Effect of a high fat diet on the hypothalami of mice susceptible to diet-induced obesity KOZAK2_ABI_HYP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experimental goals of this study were to determine the differences in hypothalamus gene expression in genetically identical mice that have variability in their susceptibility towards diet-induced obesity following 6 weeks feeding a high fat diet, 2 weeks low fat diet and 6 weeks high fat diet. Keywords: Comparative gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Gene expression analyses was performed from pooled hypothalamus RNA from male C57BL/6J mice exhibiting high or low weight gain after 6 weeks feeding a high fat diet, 2 weeks low fat diet and 6 weeks high fat diet.  Four technical replicates were performed for each pool of RNA from high (H1, H2, H3, and H4) and low (L1, L2, L3, and L4) weight gaining mice.
