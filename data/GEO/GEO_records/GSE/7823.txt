TITLE
Murine Pulmonary Response to Chronic Hypoxia is Strain Specific

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
6-8 week old BL6, FVB/N and SV129 mouse strains were kept in normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia for 4 weeks and then phenotyped by echocardiogram and right ventricular heart catheterization, followed by tissue collection. In addition, Affymetrix expression analysis was conducted in a paired fashion. Keywords: Differential response to hypoxia by strain

DESIGN
This series actually includes another 12 arrays. However, the others had technical difficulties and so aren't really appropriate for general distribution.
