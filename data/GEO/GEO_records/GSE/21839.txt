TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild type E. coli (K-12 MG1655) comparing to mutant E. coli strain (ECOM4) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Cytochrome oxydases and quinol monooxygenase were removed from the E. coli genome resulting in oxygen-independent physiology We used microarray profiling to identify perturbed metabolic or regulatory functionality resulting in the inability to undergo aerobic-anaerobic shift.
