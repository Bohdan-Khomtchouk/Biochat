TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild type E. coli (K-12 MG1655) comparing to mutant E. coli strain (ECOM4) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Cytochrome oxydases and quinol monooxygenase were removed from the E. coli genome resulting in oxygen-independent physiology We used microarray profiling to identify perturbed metabolic or regulatory functionality resulting in the inability to undergo aerobic-anaerobic shift.

DESIGN
Affimetrics E. coli Arrays 2.0, Experiment (ECOM4) under both conditions (+O2/-O2) were analyzed in triplicates and compared to control (MG1655) under same conditions in triplicates
