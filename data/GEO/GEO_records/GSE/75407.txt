TITLE
Expression data from mouse differentiated Bhlhe40-GFPneg and Bhlhe40-GFPpos TH17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray data on TH17 cells from Bhlhe40-GFP reporter mice We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in polarized Bhlhe40-GFPneg and Bhlhe40-GFPpos TH17 cells

DESIGN
Purified na√Øve CD4 T cells from spleen were polarized under TH17 condition in vitro.  On day 4, cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, and sorted by their Bhlhe40-GFP expression prior to microarray analysis
