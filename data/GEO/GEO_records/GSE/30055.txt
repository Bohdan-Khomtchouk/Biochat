TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult male zebrafish liver treated with chloroaniline

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 30 Âµg/L of chloroaniline for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in chloroaniline-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 12 arrays of chloroaniline-treated adult male zebrafish liver and 12 arrays of control fish.
