TITLE
A transcription factor pulse can prime chromatin for heritable transcriptional memory [ChIPseq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the epigenetic control of long-term transcriptionnal memory (LTTM) we used a trans-differentiation system where Bcell are reprogramed into macrophages upon induction of the transcription factor Cebpa. We performed ChIPseq in untreated Bcells, after 12h of Cebpa induction and after 6days of “wash” of Cebpa, to see if any proteins/histone marks are retained.

DESIGN
Genome binding/occupancy of transcription factor Pu1 and histones (H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27me3) by ChIPseq in uninduced Bcell (Control), after induction Cebpa for 6h (Pulse) and after 6 days of wash (Chase).
