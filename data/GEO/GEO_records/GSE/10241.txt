TITLE
A Global Genomic View of MIF Knockdown Cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MIF expression in HEK293 cells resulted in  inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle progress.   The microarray study of MIF KD cells reveald knockdown of MIF would lead to extensive changes in gene expression profiles which may elucidate the molecular mechanism of MIF siRNA-mediated inhibition of cell cycle and cell proliferation. Keywords: The whole-genome expression analysis in MIF knockdown cells and the control cells

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected  MIF siRNA (50pmol/ml & 100pmol/ml) or control RNA using LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent and re-incubated for 24 hours.At the designed time point, totol RNA was isolated from the different treated cells.The normal cells were used as control.
