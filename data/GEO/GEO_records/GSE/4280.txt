TITLE
HU treated cells vs wildtype untreated cells (asynchronized cells)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
DNA replication checkpiont kinase rad3 (human ATM/ATR-like kinase) and cds1 (human CHK2-like kinase) are known to restore stalled replication forks and prevent subsequent cell cycle progression during a replication block imposed by HU-treatment in fission yeast. In order to identify cell cycle-specific exression which are modulated by replication checkpoint kinase rad3 and cds1, microarray approach was used to profile asynchronous and synchronous cells of wildtype and mutants treated and untreated with HU Keywords: HU treated cells vs wildtype untreated cells

DESIGN
We analyzed 60 arrays for asynchronized cells of wildtype and rad3,cds1,chk1 mutants treated with 8 mM HU for 0,10,30,60 and 120 min,three biological repeats for each time point, 10 arrays for asynchronized cells of rad3sep1 double mutant treated with 8 mM HU for 0,10,30,60 and 120 mins,two biological repeat for each time point.
