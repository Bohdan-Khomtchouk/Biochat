TITLE
Dynamic gene expression of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We mapped quantitative trait loci for genome-wide gene expression (eQTL) in juvenile, reproductive and senescent C. elegans recombinant inbred lines, to determine heritable transcript dynamics

DESIGN
in total 54 dual color microarrays were done on three age groups.

PLATFORM
GPL4038 C. elegans 22k 60 mer array
