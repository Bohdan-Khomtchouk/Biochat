TITLE
Comparisons of the global gene profile between C-CPE treated- and untreated- SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis was performed to compare the global gene expression profile between C-CPE treated- and untreated- SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
SKOV-3 cells were treated with or without C-CPE for 72 hours, and total RNA was extracted and microarray was perfomed to compare the gene profiling changes between C-CPE treated- and untreated- cells. The experiment was  performed in triplicate.
