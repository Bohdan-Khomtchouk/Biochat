TITLE
Cellulose synthase mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome of homozygous mutants for AtCesA4 and AtCesA6 (cellulose synthase genes) to their heterozygous counterparts that have a wild type phenotype. All plants were 4-weeks-old and grown under short day conditions.

DESIGN
10 samples were used in this experiment: 3 each homozygous and heterozygous AtCesA4 plants, and 2 each homozygous and heterozygous AtCesA6 plants.
