TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to doxycyline-induced expression of proinsulin (C96Y)-GFP in an INS-1 insulinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A doxycyline-inducible INS-1 insulinoma cell line expressing proinsulin (C96Y)-GFP was engineered. Addition of doxycyline causes the production of the proinsulin (C96Y)-GFP, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This study analyzes the gene expression changes that occur after doxycyline-induced expression of proinsulin (C96Y)-GFP for 24h, 48h and 5 days. Expression changes were compared between control un-induced cells and cells treated with doxycyline. Three replicates (experiments) were performed for each time point.

DESIGN
Stable mutant insulin-expressing insulinoma cells were treated or not with doxycyline for 24h, 48h or 5 days and RNA was extracted for expression analysis.
