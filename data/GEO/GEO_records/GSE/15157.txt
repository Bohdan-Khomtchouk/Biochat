TITLE
Time course of localization of histone modifications, insulators, RNA polymerase II on TNF alpha responsive genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The many modifications involved in transcription are extensively coupled, and levels of histone modifications, insulators, and RNA polymerase II could be measured using genomic tiling microarrays. After 0, 30, 60 min of stimulation of HUVEC with TNF alpha, we crosslinked cells and fixed, then immunoprecipitated to prepare DNA using antibodies for modified histone, insulators and RNA polymerase. We apply samples collected every 7.5 min to arrays and monitor the growth of several long transcripts. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Using tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) to switch on transcription of selected human genes rapidly and synchronously, we apply samples collected every 30 min to arrays
