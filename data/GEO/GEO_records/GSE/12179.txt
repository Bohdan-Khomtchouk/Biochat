TITLE
Expression profiling of skeletal muscle in beef cattle treated with steroidal growth promoters

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In the present study, a oligonucleotide microarray platform is used to compare expression profiles of beef cattle muscle in animals treated with either Dexamethazone (Dex) or Dexamethazone plus 17β-estradiol (Estr) administered at sub-therapeutic dosage, against untreated controls. Seventeen male beef cattle 15-18 months old, around 450 kg mean body weight were randomly allocated in three groups: 6 were untreated (group Ctrl), 5 were administered with dexamethazone via feed 0.75mg/head for 43 days (group D); the last 6 animals were administered via feed for 43 days with Dex (0.75mg/head) and intramuscularly (i.m.) for three times with 17β-oestradiol, 20mg/head, (group DE). Three additional control animals, matching in sex and age, collected in a previous experiment were included in the Ctrl group to increase sample size and to control for biological variation. For each sample, total RNA was extracted from a specific anterior limb muscle (biceps branchii). Data analysis demonstrates that the expression profiles were strongly affected by Dex treatment with hundreds of genes up-regulated with relevant fold-change, whereas the myostatin gene was significantly down-regulated. On the contrary, the administration of Dex-Estr reveals a weaker effect on gene expression.
