TITLE
Genome wide screen to identify HDAC5 association in the cultured striatal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: using next generation sequencing, we identify the HDAC5 assocaited genomic region in the mouse cultured striatal neurons.

DESIGN
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-HDAC5 antibody or normal rabbit IgG as control with the mouse cultured striatal neurons stimulated with elevation of cAMP. The ChIP samples were subjected to the next generation sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL14602 AB SOLiD 4 System (Mus musculus)
