TITLE
High Resolution N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) Map Using Photo-crosslinking-Assisted m6A Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present here a photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A sequencing strategy to more accurately define sites with m6A modifications. Using this strategy, we obtained a high-resolution map of m6A in a human transcriptome. The map resembles the general distribution pattern observed previously, and reveals new m6A sites at base resolution. Our results provide insights into the relationship between the methylation regions and the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins.

DESIGN
Anti-m6A antibody capture and enrichment based photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A sequencing strategy
