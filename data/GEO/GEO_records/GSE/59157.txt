TITLE
Methylome analysis of normal kidney, nephrogenic rest and Wilms tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal kidney (n=36), nephrogenic rest (n=22) and Wilms tumour (n=37) was performed using the Illumina 450k array. Two papers were composed after analysis of this data (1) describes comparative analysis of 22 matched normal kidney-Wilms tumour pairs which identified biomarker differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that could be detected in patient blood; (2) describes comparative analysis of 20 matched trios which identified changes in methylation associated with progression from the precursor lesion towards tumourigenesis.

DESIGN
Bisulfte converted DNA from 95 samples of normal kidney, nephrogenic rest and Wilms tumour was hybridised to Illumina HumanMethylation450 bead chips.

PLATFORM
