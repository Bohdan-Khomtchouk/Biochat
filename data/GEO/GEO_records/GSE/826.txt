TITLE
Aging in heads from adult Drosophila males, w118 strain

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The w1118 strain is an inbred lab stock widely used in genetic and transgenic studies.  w1118 males have a median life span of 35 days. Adult males were collected within 24 hr after eclosion.  Approximately 200 flies were maintained in constant darkness in each food bottle at 25Â°C and 70% humidity and were transferred to fresh bottles every 3-4 days.   Transcripts were harvested at d3 and d47. To separate the head from the rest of the body, flies were frozen and briefly vortexed in liquid nitrogen. Fly heads were collected using a sieve which retained fly bodies.  Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (GIBCO/BRL).  Poly(A) RNA was isolated using Oligotex resin (Qiagen).  Samples were profiled with Affymetrix DrosGenome1 GeneChips, using standard Affymetrix protocol. Keywords: time-course
