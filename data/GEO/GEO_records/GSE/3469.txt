TITLE
Maf1 chromatin immunodepletion upon rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Evidence of Maf1 recruitment to Pol III promoters during transcriptional repression induced by rapamycin Keywords: Chromatin Immunodepletion on Chip time course

DESIGN
Incubation of crosslinked chromatin with antibodies directed against the myc-tagged Maf1 resulted in a near complete depletion of Maf1 from the supernatant as observed by Western blot. We compared the DNA fragments associated with the crosslinked chromatin after and before Maf1 immunopurification by hybridization to intergenic DNA microarrays (depletion analysis)
