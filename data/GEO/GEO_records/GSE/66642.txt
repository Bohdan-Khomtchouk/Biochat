TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the liver of 3-month old mice with a mutant Wrn protein treated with vitamin C compared to  3-month old WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. The gene responsible for WS is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair. We generated a mouse model with a deletion in the helicase domain of the murine WRN homologue that recapitulates most of the WS phenotypes including an abnormal hyaluronic acid excretion, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increased genomic instability and cancer incidence resulting in a 10-15% decreased life span expectancy. In addition, WS patients and Wrn mutant mice show hallmarks of a metabolic syndrome including premature visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin-resistant diabetes type 2 and associated cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we compared the expression profile of liver tissues from 3 months old Wrn mutant mice treated with 0.4% vitamin C to wild type animals.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed on the liver tissues of 3 months old mice. Four independent biological replicates of this experiment (wild type vs vitamin C treated Wrn mutant mice) were carried out on four replicates of each genotype.
