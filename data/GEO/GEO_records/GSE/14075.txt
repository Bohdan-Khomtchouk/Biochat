TITLE
Response of Rhodopirellula baltica to salt shift

ORGANISM
Rhodopirellula baltica

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the stress response of the marine Planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica after a salinity up-shift. R. baltica cultures were grown at 28Â°C in mineral media with 17.5% salinity and up-shifted to 59.9%. Samples were taken after 10, 20, 40, 60 and 300min and compared with cultures before the up-shift.

DESIGN
Reference design, time series experiment Whole genome array 5 time points, 3 replicates per time point. In total, 18 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL7654 Max Planck Institute, Whole Genome Array for Rhodopirellula baltica SH1T 7.4K version 1
