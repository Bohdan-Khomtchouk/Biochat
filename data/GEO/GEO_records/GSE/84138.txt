TITLE
miR-34a and miR-34b/c suppress intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes are frequently epigenetically silenced in primary CRCs. However, the in vivo relevance of miR-34a/b/c for suppression of intestinal tumor formation has not been analyzed by genetic approaches. ApcMin/+ mice with deletion of the miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes were generated and analyzed. The mRNA expression profiles of intestinal adenomas with and without functional miR-34a/b/c genes were compared.

DESIGN
miR-34a/b/c deficient ApcMin/+ mice and wild-type ApcMin/+ mice were sacrificed at 18 weeks of age. 3 tumor RNA samples were obtained for each genotype; each tumor RNA sample represented a pool of 3 tumors isolated from the same mouse.
