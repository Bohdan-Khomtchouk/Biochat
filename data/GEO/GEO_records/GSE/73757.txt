TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression from inoculated wheat leaves by XT4699, XT-Rocky and XT 4699hrcC-

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
TAL effectors are special family of type III effectors which can activate host gene expression at transcriptional level. The different induced genes in inoculated wheat leaves of wild type strain vs type III mutant are potential targets of TAL effectors. We observed around 250 differently induced genes ( > 10 fold) in the microarray analysis of gene expression of inoculated samples by XT4699 vs XT4699hrcC-

DESIGN
Microarray analyses of wheat leaf samples that were inoculated with strains XT4699 (wild type), XT-Rocky (wild type), and XT4699hrcC- (type III mutant of XT4699) were performed to identify changes in host gene expression.  First fully expanded leaves of 10-day-old ‘Chinese Spring’ wheat plants were inoculated with three different bacterial suspensions (XT4699, XT-Rocky, XT4699hrcC-) with optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm using a needleless syringe. RNA samples were isolated 24 h after inoculation using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Three biological replicates (pooled from three independently inoculated leaves) were used for each treatment.
