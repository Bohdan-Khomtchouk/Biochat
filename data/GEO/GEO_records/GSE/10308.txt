TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of aluminum toxicity and tolerance responses in maize roots

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major factor limiting crop yields on acid soils. In maize, Al tolerance is a complex phenomenon involving multiple genes and physiological mechanisms yet uncharacterized. To begin elucidating the molecular basis of maize Al toxicity and tolerance, we performed a detailed temporal analysis of root gene expression under Al stress using microarrays with an Al-tolerant and an Al-sensitive maize genotype. Seedlings of both genotypes were grown in hydroponics in a full nutrient solution containing 39uM of free Al3+ activity. Root samples were collected at 'time zero', and after 2, 6 and 24 hours of treatment. Keywords: stress treatment, time course
