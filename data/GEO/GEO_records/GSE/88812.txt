TITLE
Gene expression data of trial drug Dehydroabietylamine derivative-2 (DAAD-2) for Sensitive (HEP3B) and resistant (SNU449) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease world-wide. The survival of HCC patients is usually very poor due to the lack of efficient anti-cancer drugs acting against HCC cells. Structural modification is one of the important routes in chemical field for finding novel drugs with more potential bioactivities and broad bioactive spectra. Hence, a dehydroabietylamine derivative (DAAD-2) is prepared and subjected for cytotoxic activities on HCC cell lines.

DESIGN
Qualitative, analytical study for gene expression profiling by array
