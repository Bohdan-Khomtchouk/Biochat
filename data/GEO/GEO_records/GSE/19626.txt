TITLE
Profiling gene expression in Vax2 knockout compared with wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples from Vax2 knockout mouse eyes (at least two  biological replicates) were profiled by gene expression. As control we used total RNA from  wild type  eyes. The analysis was carried out at five different developmental stages: E10.5, E12.5, E16.5, P8, and P60. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
Vax2 knockout mouse animal model analyzed at various developmental stages.
