TITLE
Comparative genome hybridization profiles of six strains of Lactococcus lactis

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
The intra sub-species diversity of six strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was investigated at the genomic level and in terms of phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles in UF-cheese model. Six strains were isolated from various sources, but all are exhibiting a dairy phenotype. Our results showed that, the six strains exhibited small phenotypic differences since similar behaviour in terms of growth was obtained during cheese ripening while only different acidification capability was detected. Even if all strains displayed high genomic similarities, sharing a high core genome of almost two thousands genes, the expression of this core genome directly in the cheese matrix revealed major strain-specific differences. This strains with the same dairy origin.

DESIGN
Strains were cultured on M17. At least three independent cultures of the six strains were performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from cells grown overnight on M17 and radiolabelled cDNA were prepared and hybridized on nylon arrays. 1948 amplicons specific of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 genes were spotted twice on the array. 3 independent repetitions were performed.
