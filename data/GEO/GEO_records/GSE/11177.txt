TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of transgenics overexpressing SIBA(At3g56710) and SA treated plants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We found SIBA gene which rapidly increased with a peak at 2 h after SA treatments. Analysis of the transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis palnts which were treated salicilic acid (SA) and SIBA overexpressed plant. Keywords: Dose response and analysis of SIBA gene

DESIGN
The experiment is done using Agilent Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray. We analyzed gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide arrays at 2, 5, 10 and 24 hours after treated with 5mM SA and we identified genes which were induced by overexpressing SIBA plant.

PLATFORM
GPL2880 Agilent-013324 Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray (V2) G4136B (Feature Number version)
