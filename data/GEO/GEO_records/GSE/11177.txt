TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of transgenics overexpressing SIBA(At3g56710) and SA treated plants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We found SIBA gene which rapidly increased with a peak at 2 h after SA treatments. Analysis of the transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis palnts which were treated salicilic acid (SA) and SIBA overexpressed plant. Keywords: Dose response and analysis of SIBA gene
