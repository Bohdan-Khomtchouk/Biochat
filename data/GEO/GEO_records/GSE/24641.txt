TITLE
Image defocus and altered retinal gene expression in chicks

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Because refractive development is governed largely by the retina, we analyzed the retinal transcriptome in chicks wearing a spectacle lens, a well-established means to induce refractive errors, to identify gene expression alterations and to develop novel mechanistic hypotheses about refractive development.

DESIGN
One-week-old white Leghorn chicks wore a unilateral spectacle lens of + or â€“15 diopters for 6 hours or 3 days (n=6 for each condition). With total RNA from the retina/retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Affymetrix Chicken GeneChips were used to compare gene expression levels between lens-wearing and contralateral control eyes. Normalized microarray signal intensities were evaluated by an analysis of variance approach. Selected differentially expressed genes were validated by qPCR in biologically independent samples.
