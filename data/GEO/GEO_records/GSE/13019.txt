TITLE
dgpp-DGPP regulated genes. Identification of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate regulated genes in ABA signaling.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-06_dgpp - dgpp - The specific plant phosphorylated form of phosphatidic acid (PA), diacyglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) was recently shown to be a second messenger in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. The aim of the project is to identify among the set of ABA-regulated genes the ones also regulated by DGPP and/or PA. - Five ml of 3 days-old suspension cells was incubated with ABA or lipids for 3 h under the conditions of culture. Lipids were emulsified by sonication for 1 mi, four times, at 4Â°C, in one ml of culture medium then added to 4 ml suspension cells. Cells were filtrated under vacuum, frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted. Dioleoyl PA and dioctanoyl PA are from Sigma, dioleoyl DGPP and dioctanoyl DGPP are from Avanti Polar Lipids. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
