TITLE
Expression data from retinoic acid injections into the third ventricle of F344 rats compared to vehicle injected rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Short day (8hrs of light/day) housed juvenile, male F344 rats were injected with 10^-5 M all-trans RA or vehicle (saline) into the third ventricle of the hypothalamus. 24 hours after RA injections rats were killed by decapitation after isoflurane inhalation at ZT3 and brains were dissected and frozen on dry ice. Hypothalamic arcuate nucleus tissue blocks were cut for RNA exaction. 4 rats per group were used giving 8 rats in total.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression of genes were made between rats from RA injected vs vehicle injected groups.
