TITLE
Mouse embryo heart, e10.5 AVC: Control vs. Tbx3 hypomorphic mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the atrioventricular canal from e10.5 mouse hearts comparing wild-type control with Tbx3 GH/N hypomorphic mutant microdissected tissue. The goal was to identify direct and indirect targets of the transcription factor Tbx3, because Tbx3 is expressed in the AVC and hypomorphs develop embryonic AV conduction block at e12.5.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type control and Tbx3 mutant AVC tissue.  Tissue from 5 hearts was pooled to make each sample.  Biological replicates: 4.
