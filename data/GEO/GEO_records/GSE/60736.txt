TITLE
Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of sebacinoid fungi

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Serendipita indica ; Serendipita vermifera

SUMMARY
The recent release of a large number of genomes from ectomycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi have provided deep insight into fungal lifestyle-associated genomic adaptation. Comparative analyses of symbiotic fungal taxa showed that similar outcomes of interactions in distant related root symbioses are examples of convergent evolution. The order Sebacinales represents a sister group to the Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota) that is comprised of ectomycorrhizal, ericoid-, orchid- mycorrhizal, root endophytic fungi and saprotrophs (Oberwinkler et al., 2013). Sebacinoid taxa are widely distributed from arctic to temperate to tropical ecosystems and are among the most common and species-rich groups of ECM, OM and endophytic fungi (Tedersoo et al., 2012, Tedersoo et al., 2010, Oberwinkler et al., 2013).  The root endophyte Piriformospora indica and the orchid mycorrhizal fungus S. vermifera (MAFF 305830) are non-obligate root symbionts which were shown to be able to interact with many different experimental hosts, including the non-mycorrhizal plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These two fungi display similar colonization strategies in barley and in Arabidopsis and the ability to establish beneficial interactions with different hosts (Deshmukh et al., 2006). Colonization of the roots by P. indica and S. vermifera results in enhanced seed germination and biomass production as well as increased resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses in its experimental hosts, including various members of the Brassicaceae family, barley, Nicotiana attenuata and switchgrass (Ghimire, 2011, Ghimire et al., 2009, Ghimire et al., 2011, Waller et al., 2008, Barazani et al., 2007, Deshmukh et al., 2006). Microarray experiments were performed to identify and characterize conserved sebacinoid genes as key determinants in the Sebacinales symbioses.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis roots were inoculated with either Sebacina vermifera or Piriformospora indica and grown for up to 14 days. Additionally S. vermifera and A. thaliana were grown on 1/10 PNM medium alone. Samples were taken 3, 7 and 14 dpi (Arabidopsis), 3dpi (1/10 PNM, S. vermifera) and 7dpi (1/10 PNM, A. thaliana). Each experiment was performed in three independent biological repetitions. The experiments are follow-ups of previous experiments deposited under GSE47775.
