TITLE
RNA-sequencing technology identifies specific genes expressed in the ICM of mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq data from whole mouse embryos at E3.75 (stage where the three cell types: TE, PrE and EPI are well resolved) and from dissected ICMs in order to identify genes expressed specifically in the ICM

DESIGN
We used E3.75 whole mouse embryos at the blastocyst stage and immunosurgically dissected ICMs for RNA extraction and sequencing

PLATFORM
