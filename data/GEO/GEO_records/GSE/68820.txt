TITLE
Mouse lung tissue transcriptome response to a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV in wild type C57BL6/NJ mice and TLR3-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to determine the role of TLR3-/- on the regulation of the host immune response during lethal SARS-CoV infection

DESIGN
Groups of 10 week old C57BL6/NJ  or TLR3-/- mice were  infected with MA15 virus at a dose of 10^5 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 2, 4 and 7 days post infection. There were 4 or 5 animals/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, lung pathology, and transcriptional analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
