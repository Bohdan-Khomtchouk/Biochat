TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of GW4064 regulated genes in mouse primary hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse primary hepatocytes (MPH) prepared from C57Bl6 male adult mice were challenged with the FXR agonist GW4064 and used to prepare RNA which was then processed for analysis using MoGene-2_0-st Affymetrix microarrays according to standard procedures.

DESIGN
3 independent preparation of mouse primary hepatocytes (MPH) were performed and used to prepare RNA which was then processed for analysis using MoGene-2_0-st Affymetrix microarrays according to standard procedures.
