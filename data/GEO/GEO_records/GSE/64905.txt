TITLE
Gene Expression Data in Pediatric Burkit lymphoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of Peditric Burkitt lymphoma (PBL) patients samples were performed to analyze the comparative genomic signature and to investigate targetable signaling pathways in PBL

DESIGN
11 primary tumor specimens were obtained from Pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (PBS) patients and samples were hybridized to HGU133A2. Genechip (Affymetrix)
