TITLE
RUNX2 promotes the development of Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand how RUNX2 promoted the development of BPDCN, we transduced RUNX2-directed shRNA vectors in a BPDCN cell line, CAL-1 and performed microarray analysis of RUNX2-knocked down CAL-1 cells

DESIGN
CAL-1 cells were transduced with two distinct RUNX2-directed shRNA vectors containing IRES-GFP. As RUNX2-directed shRNA-transduced cells significantly reduced levels of RUNX2 expression, compared to the control Luciferase-directed shRNA-transduced cells, we perfomed gene expression analysis of RUNX2-knocked down CAL-1 cells.
