TITLE
Early fruit abscission is associated with the IAA14/SLR-ARF7 signaling cascade in pedicels of self-abscising apple

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
The self-abscising characteristic of fruit is a prominent trait for labor-saving cultivation in apple (Malus Ã— domestica). Up to 30 days after full bloom, early abscission leaves only central fruit in a cluster, while four lateral fruits are abscised. Since fruit abscission is possibly induced during earlier phases of fruit development, samples were collected at full bloom and 10 days after full bloom. Comparative analysis between central and lateral pedicels in self-abscising apple can be used to identify the genes that trigger the abscission mechanism, as the destinies of the pedicels in a cluster are obvious. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA-Seq to compare expression profiles between the surviving central pedicel to be survived and abscised lateral pedicel to be abscised from self-abscising apple. A total of 797,647 ESTs were assembled into 65,876 contigs which were annotated and analyzed with using Blast2GO. A total of 1,585 differentially expressed genes in central and lateral pedicels were identified using the NOISeq software. , and these genes were were characterized using the MapMan ontology software. Transcription factors involved in vascular bundle differentiation functioned in the central pedicel, while the signaling cascade of IAA14/SLR-ARF7, which progressed during lateral root emergence from primary roots, operated in lateral pedicels. Future studies should explore associations between the mechanisms of lateral root emergence and pedicel abscission during early phases of fruit development, as well as the interconnection among hormones.
