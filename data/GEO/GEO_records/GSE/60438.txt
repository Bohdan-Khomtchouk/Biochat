TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of deciduas from pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of decidual transcriptome in pre-eclampsia compared with normotensive controls to find differentially expressed genes/pathways. Preeclampsia (PE) is a common and serious pregnancy hypertensive disorder with a strong genetic component. The study aims were to use genome-wide analysis of decidual transcriptome in pre-eclampsia compared with normotensive controls to identify differentially expressed biological pathways, and to determine common pathways between the transcriptome and previously identified maternal susceptibility genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA from decidua basalis obtained from pre-eclamptic and normotensive control patients at Caesarean section
