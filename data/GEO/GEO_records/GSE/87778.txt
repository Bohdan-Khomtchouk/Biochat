TITLE
The global transcriptome analysis of HCT116 cells transfected with scrambled or CBX4 shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular mechanism of CBX4 in CRC, the global transcriptomes were analyzed in HCT116 cells in which CBX4 was knocked down with shRNA, and these transcriptomes were compared to those of HCT116 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA.

DESIGN
Two pairs of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used to dramatically reduce endogenous CBX4 expression in HCT116 cell line. The global transcriptomes were analyzed in HCT116 cells in which CBX4 was knocked down with shRNA, and these transcriptomes were compared to those of HCT116 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA.
