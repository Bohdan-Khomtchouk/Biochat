TITLE
The Nlrp12 inflammasome negatively regulates NOD2-mediated adjuvanticity, endotoxic shock and host defence afforded by an immunomodulatory muropeptide.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of intestinal response to Citrobacter rodentium in wild-type and Nlrp12-deficient mice

DESIGN
Four-conditions experiment, Nlrp12-deficient mouse infected by Citrobacter rodentium at day 7 versus non-infected Nlrp12-deficient mice with two biologicals replicates , Wild-type mouse infected by Citrobacter rodentium at day 7 versus non-infected Wild-type mice with two biologicals replicates and Nlrp12-deficient mouse infected by Citrobacter rodentium versus Control mouse infected by Citrobacter rodentium at 2 differents times ( day 0 and post infection at day 7 )  with three biologicals replicates

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
