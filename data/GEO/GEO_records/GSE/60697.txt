TITLE
Expression data from 20 human colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained snap-frozen tissue samples from 20 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with stage III disease who had undergone curative resection. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 arrays. We used microarrays to identify potential gene deregulation correlated with the outcomes of colon cancer patients.

DESIGN
mRNA from 20 primary colorectal tumour samples were extracted and hybridized to HG-U133Plus 2.0 expression arrays. The NexusExp3 procedure was used to make calls of expression. Of the 20 patients, 7 had disease relapse within 3 years after surgery.
