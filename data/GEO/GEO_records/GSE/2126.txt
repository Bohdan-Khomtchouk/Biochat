TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster mutation accumulation lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Experiment to estimate mutatational variance of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster at two times in development using 12 mutation accumulation lines. Keywords = evolution Keywords = quantitative genetics Keywords = Drosophila Keywords = mutation Keywords: other

DESIGN
Each of 12 lines measured 8 times in each of two stages.  For each stage, the design has two hexagons with 6 interior connections (=hybridizations) (all except opposite nodes).  Each line in one hexagon is connected to one line in the other hexagon and that line's opposite.  Each line is also connected to itself twice in the other stage.  Dyes are balanced.
