TITLE
An Ets2-specific transcriptional program in tumor-associated macrophages promotes metastasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages have been implicated in breast cancer progression and metastasis, but relatively little is known about the genes and pathways that are involved.  Using a conditional allele of Ets2 in the mouse, we have identified Ets2 as a critical gene in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) that specifically promotes mammary tumor metastasis.  Loss of Ets2 in TAMs decreased the frequency and size of lung metastases without impacting primary tumor burden.  Expression profiling of isolated tumor macrophages established that Ets2 deficiency resulted in the de-repression of a defined set of anti-angiogenic genes. Activation of this transcriptional program correlated with decreased angiogenesis in metastatic tumors and decreased metastatic growth.  Comparison of this Ets2-specific TAM expression profile with human breast cancer profiles revealed a macrophage gene expression signature that could predict overall survival of estrogen receptor negative patients.  In summary, we have identified a critical factor, Ets2, in TAMs that represses a transcriptional program to promote the growth of mammary tumor metastases in the lung.
