TITLE
Oncogenic role of TOX in CTCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TOX is a nuclear factor essential for the development of CD4+ T cells in the thymus. TOX is found to be aberrantly up-regulated in the skin biopsies and in the blood CD4+ T cells of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The goal of this study is to identify potential transcriptional targets of TOX in CTCL by comparison between TOX shRNA transfected CTCL cells (Hut78 and HH) and control CTCL cells.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. Lentivirus transduced control vector vs. TOX shRNA vectors on Hut78 and HH cell lines. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 shRNA tansduced replicates for each cell line.
