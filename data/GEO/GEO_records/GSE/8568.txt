TITLE
EXPRESSION PROFILING IN shlOXL2 AND shSNAIL IN HACA CELLS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the implication of LOXL2  AND SNAIL in re-adquisition of epithelial phenotype we performed a gene expression profile comparing the highly malignant control cell line HaCa4shEGFP (interfered with an irrelevant sequence) with the LOXL2 and SNAIL interfered cell lines HaCa4shLOXL2 and HaCa4shSNAIL Keywords: expression profiling

DESIGN
Two different RNA samples obtained from shLoxl2 and shSnail cells were labelled with Cy5-dUTP and from control cells (shGFP) with Cy3-dUTP (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden). Two additional hybridizations using the reciprocal fluorochrome labeling were performed, making a total of three hybridizations by condition.
