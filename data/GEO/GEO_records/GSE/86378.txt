TITLE
Streptomyces exploration is triggered by fungal interactions and volatile signals

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712

SUMMARY
We discovered the bacteria Streptomyces venezuelae can display a new form of growth termed exploration, and we used NGS to compare transcriptome profiles of cells demonstrating exploration versus static cells (not demonstrating exploration)

DESIGN
RNA profiles of 14-day old S. venezuelae explorer cells and 1-day old S. venezuelae static cells were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate using Illumina HiSeq

PLATFORM
GPL22391 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712)
