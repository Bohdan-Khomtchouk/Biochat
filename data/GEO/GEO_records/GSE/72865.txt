TITLE
Anti-cancer agent ONC201 activates early ATF4/DR5 upregulation, and cell death associated with XIAP inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two experiments were performed with ONC201/TIC10 in human colon cancer cell lines. The first experiment is TIC10-induced transcriptional changes at 48hrs in HCT116 p53-null cells (10uM). The second experiment is RKO cells, with and without acquired resistance to ONC201, treated with with ONC201 (10uM) for 48 hrs.

DESIGN
For the first experiment, six samples of HCT116 p53-null cells with TIC10 (10uM) or DMSO treatment. Three replicates each. For the second experiment, six samples of wild-type RKO cells with ONC201 (10uM) or DMSO treatment and the same treatments for RKO cells with acquired resistance to ONC201.
