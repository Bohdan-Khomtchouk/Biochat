TITLE
Gene expression analysis of A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) exposed to obese visceral exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 gene expression (mRNA) after 24 hour exposure to ten different doses of obese visceral adipocyte exosomes. The hypothesis is that obese visceral adipocyte exosomes genetically regulate genes in the TGFβ and Wnt-βcatenin pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from A549 cells after 24 hour exposure to obese visceral adipocyte exosomes (0.02-10 μg)

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
