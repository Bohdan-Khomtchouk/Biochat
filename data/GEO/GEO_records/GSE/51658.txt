TITLE
miRNA expression data from post-partum dairy cattle (Holstein Friesian) liver

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
High yielding dairy cattle undergo a state of NEB (negative energy balance) during the post-partum period when energy demand for lactation and maintenance exceeds energy intake. During this period in order to counteract NEB the liver under goes extensive metabolic and physiological change resulting in alteration in hepatic genes and miRNAs expression. We used Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2_0 Array with miRBase version 15 coverage to assess the liver miRNA expression in SNEB (severe NEB)  and MNEB (mild NEB) Holstein Friesian cattle during the post-partum period.

DESIGN
A NEB model of Holstein Friesian was established such that 12 post-partum cattle were randomly assigned to MNEB and SNEB groups depending on different feeding and milking regimes
