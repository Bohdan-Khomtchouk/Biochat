TITLE
Integrin αvβ3 acting as membrane receptor for thyroid hormones mediates angiogenesis in malignant T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found that thyroid hormones (THs), acting as soluble integrin αvβ3 ligands, activate growth-related signaling pathways in T-cell lymphomas (TCL). Specifically, TH-activated αvβ3 integrin signaling promotes TCL proliferation and angiogenesis, in part, via the up-regulation of VEGF.

DESIGN
CUTLL1 cells were treated with T3- and T4-bound agarose or agarose alone for 24hrs. Total RNA was harvested from cells and used for expression profiling via RNA-seq.
