TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in human plasma across time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The stability of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in human plasma was identified through expression profiling of genes across different time points (0, 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the plasma of three young males and identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs and mRNAs across six time points after extraction of the plasma.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
