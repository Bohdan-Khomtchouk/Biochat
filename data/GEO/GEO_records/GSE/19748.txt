TITLE
Gene expression screening during early granulation tissue formation (I)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Hydroxyapatite-coated cellulose induces a quicker and stronger inflammatory response compared to uncoated cellulose. Furthermore, the coated cellulose increases the homing at circulating bone-marrow derived progenitor cells. For this reason, Illumina microarray was used to study the early gene expression of  the forming granulation tissue in the hydroxyapatite-coated sponges.

DESIGN
A total of six samples from six different rats was analyzed.  Three samples were collected after 24 hours of implantation and three after 72 hours of implantation.
