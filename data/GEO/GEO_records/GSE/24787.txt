TITLE
Promoter methylation in HNSCC tumor cell lines is significantly different from primary tumors and xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study focused on global methylation changes between tumors, normal mucosa, primary tumor xenografts, and cell lines in order to determine epigenetic changes in cell cultures and xenografts derived from primary tumors.

DESIGN
1 fully methylated control cell line, 1 fully demethylated control cell line, 5 HNSCC cell lines, 2 normal cell lines, 7 normal mucosa, 3 primary HNSCC tumors, 3 xenografts of primary tumors
