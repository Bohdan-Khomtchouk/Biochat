TITLE
miRNA regulated by Notch signaling in macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This two-color miRNA chip was perfored to identify the downstream miRNAs regulated by Notch signaling in macrophage polarization.

DESIGN
To identify the downstream miRNAs mediated by Notch signaling during macrophage polarization regulating, RNA was isolated from bone marrow drived macrophages (BMDMs) of Notch signaling deletion and wild type mice as experiment samples. Three control (+/-) and three experiment (-/-) samples were detected.
