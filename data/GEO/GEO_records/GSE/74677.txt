TITLE
Examination of loss of Selenophosphate Synthetase 1 (SPS1) in mouse tissues and cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the role of SPS1 in mammals, we generated a Sps1 knockout mouse and found that systemic SPS1 deficiency was embryonic lethal. Embryos were clearly underdeveloped by E8.5 and virtually reabsorbed by E14.5. Removal of Sps1 specifically in hepatocytes using Albumin-cre preserved viability, but significantly affected expression of a large number of mRNAs involved in cancer, embryonic development and the glutathione system. Particularly notable was the extreme deficiency of glutaredoxin 1 (GLRX1) and glutathione-S-transferase omega 1. To assess these phenotypes at the cellular level, we targeted the removal of SPS1 in F9 cells, a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line, which recapitulated changes in the glutathione system proteins. We further found that several malignant characteristics of SPS1-deficient F9 cells were reversed, suggesting that SPS1 has a role in supporting and/or sustaining cancer. In addition, the increased ROS levels observed in F9 SPS1/GLRX1 deficient cells were reversed and became more like those in F9 SPS1 sufficient cells by overexpressing mouse or human GLRX1. The results suggest that SPS1 is an essential mammalian enzyme with roles in regulating redox homeostasis and controlling cell growth.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from 3 control and 3 hepatocyte-specific (Alb-Cre) SPS1 knockout mice taken at 3 months of age. Gene expression analysis of Control and SPS1 knockdown (shSPS1) mouse F9 cells. 3 replicates each.
