TITLE
Blood Transcriptional Profiles of Active and Latent TB (UK Test Set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset aims to validate and confirm the signature identified in the training set.  The aim of the experiment was to define transcriptional signatures in whole blood of TB patients (before drug treatment) and healthy controls to distinguish the signature of Latent and Active TB patients from each other and from healthy controls. This will help in diagnosis of active tuberculosis which normally relies on culture of the bacilli, which can take up to 6 wks, and sometimes the bacilli cannot be obtained from sputum thus requiring invasive techniques obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In some cases the bacill cannot be grown from sputum or BAL.   Secondly the aim was to determine whether Latent patients have a homogeneous or heterogeneous signature, one may expect the latter since it is not possible to determine by the present tests (Tuberculin skin test - TST - or MTb antigen responsiveness of blood cells to produce IFN-gamma - IGRA assay) whether the mycobacteria has been cleared, is still present but is controlled, or if patients are recently infected or reactivated and will develop active TB.

DESIGN
Experimental design : Whole blood collected in tempus tubes from patients with different spectra of TB disease and healthy controls.  All patients were sampled prior to the initiation of any antimycobacterial therapy.  Active Pulmonary TB: PTB - All patients confirmed by isolation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis on culture of sputum or bronchoalvelolar lavage fluid.  Latent TB: LTB - All patients were screened at a tuberculosis clinic, being either new entrants to the UK from endemic countries or being household contacts of infectious cases. All were positive by tuberculin skin test ( > 14mm if BCG vaccinated, > 5mm if not vaccinated) and were also positive by Interferon-Gamma Release assay(IGRA); specifically Quantiferon Gold In-Tube Assay (Cellestis, Australia). Latent patients had no clinical, radiological or microbiological evidence of active infection and were asymptomatic.  Healthy controls - these were volunteers without exposure to TBwho were negative by both tuberculin skin test ( < 15mm if BCG vaccinated, < 6mm if unvaccinated); who were also negative by IGRA (as described above).  This dataset:  PTB, n= 21.  LTB, n = 21.  BCG+, n = 12.  Experimental variables : Patient group: Active PTB; Latent TB, Healthy controls (BCG vaccinated only).  ethnicity - a wide range of ethnic groups is represented.   The active PTB group incorporates a range of smear positive and smear negative disease and  a spectrum of disease extent/severity.
