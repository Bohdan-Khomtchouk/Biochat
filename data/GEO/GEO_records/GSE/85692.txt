TITLE
H3K27Ac ChIP-seq for TL-om1 cells and primary ATL cell samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis was performed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells to analyze acetylation of histone H3K27.

DESIGN
TL-Om1 and primary ATL cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde for 10 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Illumina Hiseq 4000.  A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac: Abcam, ab4729).
