SUMMARY
Interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-2 possess distinct immunological functions despite both signaling through IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor γ-chain, γc, We find that in the IL-15/IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc quaternary complex structure, IL-15 heterodimerizes IL-2Rβ and γc identically to the IL-2/IL-2Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc complex, despite differing receptor-binding chemistries. IL-15Rα dramatically increases the affinity of IL-15 for IL-2Rβ, and this allostery is required for IL-15 trans-signaling versus IL-2 cis-signaling.  Consistent with the identical IL-2Rβ/γc dimer geometry, IL-2 and IL-15 exhibited similar signaling properties in lymphocytes, with any differences resulting from disparate receptor affinities. Thus, IL-15 and IL-2 induce similar signals, and the cytokine-specificity of IL-2Rα versus IL-15Rα determines cellular responsiveness.  These results provide important new insights for specific development of IL-15- versus IL-2-based immunotherapeutics.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq is conducted in mouse CD8+ T cells, not treated or treated with IL2 or IL15 for indicated concentrations (1nM or 500nM) and times (4hr or 24hr).
