TITLE
Small RNA profiles in wt and swi6 deletion strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Proteins of the conserved HP1 family are elementary components of heterochromatin and are generally assumed to play a central role in creating a rigid heterochromatic network that is densely packed and inaccessible to the transcription machinery. In this study we demonstrate that the fission yeast HP1 protein Swi6 exists as a single highly dynamic population and rapidly exchanges in cis and in trans between different heterochromatic regions. Binding to methylated H3K9 or to heterochromatic RNA decelerates Swi6 mobility. We further show that Swi6 is largely dispensable to maintain heterochromatin domains. In contrast, our results disclose an unexpected role of Swi6 in demarcating constitutive heterochromatin from neighboring euchromatin. Our results are consistent with a stochastic model of heterochromatin and imply that heterochromatin is permissive for transcription throughout the cell cycle. Rather than promoting maintenance and spreading of heterochromatin, Swi6 appears to limit these processes to ensure that heterochromatin is appropriately confined.
