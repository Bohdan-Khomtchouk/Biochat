TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomes between DMSO-5uM and Torin1-5uM treated mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes cultured in vitro for 14h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify the potential specific roles of the MTOR signalling in cumulus cells by comparing the transcriptomes of the Control (treated with the DMSO vehicle) and MTOR-specific inhibitor Torin 1(5uM)-treated cumulus-oocyte complexes that were cultured for 16 hours. We compared the transcriptomes between DMSO- and Torin 1- treated cumulus-oocyte complexes.

DESIGN
3 individual cumulus-oocyte complex samples of DMSO- and Torin1-treated were collected. Comparison was done between DMSO- and Torin1-treated groups.
