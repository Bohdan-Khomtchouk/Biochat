TITLE
A global profiling of  gene expression in chilling stress in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was performed to study the change of gene expression before and after chilling treatment  in rice. Different change patterns were identified. We have provided a complete view of  transcriptome under cold stress condition, which will deepen our understanding of gene expression regulation in cold stress response as well as cold stress response mechanism for monocot plants.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of 15-day-old rice seedlings with and without chilling treatment  (4 Â°C for 33 h)  were generated by deep sequencing using  Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform.
