TITLE
Effect of overexpression of OsTGAP1 in chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-treated rice cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To see the effect of overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, we compared the gene expression profiles in wild type rice cells and OsTGAP1-overexpressing rice cells.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in the wild type rice cells and OsTGAP1-overexpressing rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharide for 0, 6, and 24 h was compared using two-color method with four biological replicates.
