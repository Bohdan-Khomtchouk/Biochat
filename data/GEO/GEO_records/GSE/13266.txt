TITLE
Canine CNVs associated with canFam2 segmental duplications

ORGANISM
Canis lupus ; Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
This study centered on using a custom made Nimblegen aCGH chip that targeted all segmental duplications in the canine genome to identify associated CNVs.  A total of 19 hybridizations were performed in a panel of diverse dogs and a single wolf.

DESIGN
Using computational approaches all segmental duplications were identified in the canFam2 genome of the dog.  A custom aCGH chip was then built that densely interrogated these segmental duplications for CNVs in a panel of diverse dog breeds and a single wolf.
