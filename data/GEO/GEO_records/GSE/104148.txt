TITLE
Characterization of rubella-specific humoral immunity following two doses of MMR vaccine using proteome microarray technology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study uses proteome microarray technology/data to identify predictive biomarkers of neutralizing antibody response and potential new correlates of protective immunity in rubella virus serology.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a well-characterized cohort of 75 high and 75 low rubella virus-specific neutralizing antibody responders after two MMR vaccine doses was used to acquire microarray antibody measurements to all rubella virus proteins. These data were used in multivariate penalized logistic regression modeling of rubella-specific neutralizing antibody response after vaccination.
