TITLE
Expression data from hsr containing human embryonic stem cell line, H14, and parent H14  human embryonic stem cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Homogenous staining regions (hsr) are cytogenetic representations of a gene amplification. They are found exclusively in tumour cells. We found a hsr in the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line H14, this is the first report of a hsr in hESCs. FISH and CGH studies showed that the hsr was derived from chromosome 17p11.2. The gene expression analysis studies were performed to identify the genes upregulated due to the hsr by comparison the the hsr-contianing H14 cells with a karyotypically normal parent H14 cell line. Keywords: karyotypically abnormal hESC vs karyotypically normal hESC.
