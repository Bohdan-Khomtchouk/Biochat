TITLE
Response of tobacco cells to Glucan elicitor

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
We have previously reported that the responses of tobacco tissues treated with AaGlucan are similar to those for laminarin [1]. To better understand the overall responses and signaling pathways in tobacco, we have identified here AaGlucan and laminarin early response genes, using a custom 16K BY-2 microarray [2,3]. BY-2 cells were treated with laminarin or an AaGlucan-enriched fraction prepared from A. alternata 102 culture-medium and subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
AaGlucan was purified from Alternaria alternata 102 as a potent elicitor for tobacco [1] Four-day-old tobacco BY-2 cells after subculture were treated with 10 microg/ml AaGlucan enriched fraction for 1h. Total RNA was prepared from the control and treated samples and used for microarray experiment after reverse transcription and labeling with Cy5 fluorescent dye.
