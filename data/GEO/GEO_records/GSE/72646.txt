TITLE
The analysis of differential gene expression after remote ischemic preconditioning of renal ischemia reperfusion injury

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism by which ischemic preconditioning (IPC) produces tissue tolerance to renal ischemia reperfusion injury in a pig model

DESIGN
15 female Yorkshire pigs were divided into three groups: 1: no IPC and 90 minutes warm ischemia; 2: remote IPC with an early window followed by 90 min warm ischemia; 3: remote IPC with a late window followed by warm ischemia 24 hrs later. Kidney tissues were obtained after 72 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL16571 Agilent-026440 Sus scrofa (Pig) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
