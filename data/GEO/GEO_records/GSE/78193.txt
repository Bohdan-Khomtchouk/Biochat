TITLE
Blockade of interferon-γ normalizes IFN regulated gene expression in subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal donor blood was incubated with or without IFN-g stimulation to establish an IFN-g gene signature. Systemic lupus erythematosus subjects were treated with placebo or AMG 811, a therapeutic anti-IFN--g antibody, and changes in the IFN--g signature in whole blood of these subjects was measured.

DESIGN
Blood from healthy volunteers (n=4) was collected into sodium heparin tubes, and then untreated or treated with 294 pM recombinant human IFN-γ for 0, 24, or 48 hours with incubation at 37oC, 5 % CO2. The blood was then added to PAXgene tubes and processed for RNA purification. Twenty six subjects with stable, mild to moderate SLE were administered placebo or a single dose of AMG 811 ranging from 2 mg to 180 mg SC or 60 mg IV. Whole blood PAXgene tube samples were collected from all cohorts at baseline, day-1 (pre-dose), and at days 15, 56, and end of study (EOS) after treatment Arrays were hybridized in a Loop design.
