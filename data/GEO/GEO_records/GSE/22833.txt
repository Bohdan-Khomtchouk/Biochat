TITLE
Expression data from indole deficient E.coli (MG1655âˆ†tnaA) exposed to indole and norfloxacin during continuous culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We sought to determine the effect of indole on cells under antibiotic stress.

DESIGN
To determine the effects of indole during norfloxacin treatment, we continuously cultured MG1655_delta_tnaA and exposed the culture to three conditions: 1. initial exposure to norfloxacin, 2. exposure to indole and norfloxacin, and 3. reexposure to norfloxacin
