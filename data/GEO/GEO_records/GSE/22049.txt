TITLE
MicroRNA-30c inhibits Human Breast Tumor Chemotherapy Resistance by regulating TWF1 and IL-11: Patient DataSet

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotherapy resistance frequently drives tumor progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to correlate with therapy resistance, but the functional link and signaling pathways remain to be elucidated. We report here that miR-30c, a human breast tumor prognostic marker, plays a pivotal role in chemo-resistance by a direct targeting of the actin-transporter TWF1, which promotes EMT. An IL-6 family member, IL-11 was identified as a secondary target of TWF1 in the miR-30c signaling pathway. Expression of miR-30c inversely correlated with IL-11 expression in clinical tumors and IL-11 correlated with relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. Identification of a novel miRNA-mediated pathway that regulates chemo-resistance in breast cancer will facilitate the development of new management strategies.
