TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation analysis of leukemia and reprogrammed leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We apply cellular reprogramming to an induced pluripotent cell state to human cell lines and primary samples exhibiting Chronic Myoloid Leukemia (CML). Addtionally, we generated an inducible CML BCR-ABL transgenic mouse model. Biological replicates (duplicates) were available for all samples. DNA methylation profiles for all cells were generated using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS).

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiling of human leukemia cell lines, primary cells, derived iPS cells as well as transgenic mouse models for CML in duplicates using RRBS.
