TITLE
Expression data from livers in  wildtype and Sox17+/-mice at 17dpc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The onset of the liver inflamentation in the Sox17+/- embryos. The expression of Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Cxcl1 and stress-induced heat shock protein Hspa1a and Hspa1b were elevated in Sox17+/- livers at 17dpc, as compared with the wildtype livers.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from liver tissues of wildtype and Sox17+/- mice at 17dpc were subjected to microarray analyses. Two biological replicates of each genotype were analyzed.
