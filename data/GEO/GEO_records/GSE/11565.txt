TITLE
Discovery of the targets of the immune response to chronic myeloid leukemia in 3 patients using protein microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three patients who had relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplant and received an immunotherapeutic intervention (donor lymphocyte infusion, or DLI) without further treatment were studied. The binding of serum immunoglobulins to proteins after immunotherapy was compared to before in two patients using Invitrogen ProtoArrays from a single lot. For a third patient, comparison was made between two timepoints after immunotherapy against one timepoint before using Invitrogen ProtoArrays from a separate lot. Significant interactions were determined by comparing each after sample separately against the before sample from that patient, using the Concentration-Dependent Analysis described in Marina et al., J Proteome Res, 2008. The goal was to identify proteins with significantly-increased reactivity after donor lymphocyte infusion. Keywords: Immune response discovery
