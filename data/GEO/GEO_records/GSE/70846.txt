TITLE
Tribbles-1 regulates hepatic lipogenesis through post-transcriptional regulation of C/EBPÎ± [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in livers of either WT mice or mice with hepatic specific deletion of the gene Tribbles1. Animal groups were both Trib1 cKO mice homozygous for a floxed allele of Trib1. Mice aged 8-10 weeks were treated with adeno associated virus (AAV) encoding Cre recombinase (AAV_Cre) or no gene (AAV_null). The WT group is mice treated with AAV_Null, the liver-specific KO group treated with AAV_Cre. Gene expression data was then used in Ingenuity Pathway analysis to attempt to identify upstream transcription factors that might be responsible for the gene expression changes observed.

DESIGN
All animals were 8-10 weeks of age, and all animals were homozygous for the floxed allele of Trib1. WT animals were treated with AAV_Null, Trib1 liver specific KO mice were treated with AAV_Cre. Mice were euthanized at 1-week post injection of AAV, and RNA collected from whole liver tissue.
