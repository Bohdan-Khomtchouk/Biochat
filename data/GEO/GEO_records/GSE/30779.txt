TITLE
Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of aroma synthesis in two hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii in winemaking conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This research work investigates the expression of the genes involved in flavor compound production in two hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii under low (12°C) and moderate fermentation temperatures (28°C).
