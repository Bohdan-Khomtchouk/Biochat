TITLE
Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of aroma synthesis in two hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii in winemaking conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces kudriavzevii

SUMMARY
This research work investigates the expression of the genes involved in flavor compound production in two hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii under low (12°C) and moderate fermentation temperatures (28°C).

DESIGN
RNA samples taken from wine fermentations at 12ºC and 28ºC at the beginning of stationary phase. Three biological replicates. S. cerevisiae Lalvin T.73 used as reference strain.
