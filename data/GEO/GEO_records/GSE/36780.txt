TITLE
The global gene expression profile of gain of function miR34c in osteoblast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the unbiased global gene expression of gain of miR34c in committed osteoblast in mouse we have performed expression microarray. This approach will allow us to define the novel targets that are negatively regulated by over-expression of miR34c in osteoblast.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from primary calvaria from WT and GOF miR34c mouse (n=3) at the age of P3. WT primary calvarial samples were served as control.
