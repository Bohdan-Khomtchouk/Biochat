TITLE
Genome-wide replication analysis of a yeast eco1 mutant by deep sequencing.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Eco1 is the acetyltransferase that establishes sister-chromatid cohesion during DNA replication. Budding yeast with an eco1 mutation that genocopies Roberts syndrome displaysreduced ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription and a transcriptional signature of starvation. Weshow that deleting FOB1, a gene encoding a specific replication fork blocking protein for therDNA region, rescues rRNA production and partially rescues transcription genome-wide. This experiment examines the effect of eco1 mutation on replication genome-wide. Furtherstudies show that deletion of FOB1 corrects the genome-wide replication defects, nucleolarstructure, and rDNA segregation in an eco1 mutant. Our study highlights cohesin's central role atthe rDNA for global control of DNA replication and gene expression.

DESIGN
DNA content in eco1-W216G mutant and wt yeast is measured in duplicate by sequencing at 0, 20, and 40 minutes following release from G1 arrest.

PLATFORM
