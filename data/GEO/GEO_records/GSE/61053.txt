TITLE
Liver microarray from eIF6 heterozygotes or wild-type 3 weeks-old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver is primary involved in the response to insulin after feeding. Hepatocytes activates a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are modulates in response to insulin, for activation of the anabolic pathways. We used microarrays analysis to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver upon eIF6 haploinsufficiency and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes and up-regulated genes during this process, that globally defines reprogramming of metabolism

DESIGN
Liver of 3 weeks-old mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
