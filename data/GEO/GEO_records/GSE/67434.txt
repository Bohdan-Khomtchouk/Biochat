TITLE
Transcriptomics Analyses of tobacco leaves and roots sample during water-deficit

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were performed on the roots and leaves samples seperately using custom based Nimblegen platform (12plex). This is a time-course study. The plants were grown in controlled growth chamber condiditons.  The seeds were sown in sterile petri plates with modified half-strength MS agar medium. The seedlings were then aseptically transferred into sterile polycarbonate container  with half-strength MS liquid medium. Seedlings were grown for 2 weeks in an incubator set at 25 oC with constant light and subjected to dehydration for 20min, 40min, 1hr, 2hrs, and 4hrs.

DESIGN
We used a hydrophonics system for the trancriptome profiling of tobacco (cv Burley 21) root and leaves samples to study plant reponses during water- deficit or drought. Plants were grown in controlled growth chamber conditions and subjected to water deficit condition after 2 weeks.The plants were transferred to empty containers without touching to nullify any possibility of wounding and harvested subsequently. For 0mins, plants were taken out of the well-watered conditions and transfered to empty boxes and immediately harvested for both tissues and hence called 0-min dehydrated tissue. Similarly other time-points were processed( for instance, 20 min of dehydration, plants were dehydrated for 20 min after being taken out from the container and then harvested). Tissues for three biological replicates and 20 plants per biological replicates were collected for each time-point. RNA was isolated from both tissues using RNeasy Kit from Qiagen and quality was accessed with Nano-drop as well as with Agilent-Bioanalyzer using RNA-600 kit. 20ug of sample was processed at Micro Array Facility.
