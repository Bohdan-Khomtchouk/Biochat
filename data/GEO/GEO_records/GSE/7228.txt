TITLE
Monitoring Burma mangrove transcriptome changes in response to salt and osmotic stress.

ORGANISM
Bruguiera gymnorhiza

SUMMARY
Generally, salt stress causes both osmotic and ionic stress. To discern the effects of osmotic and ionic specific effects on Burma mangrove transcriptome, we conducted expression profiling in 500 mM NaCl or 1M solbitol treated leaves. This study will lead to a rapid and effective selection of gene that confers high salt tolerance in transgenic plants and to a comprehensive understanding of plant stress response. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
The 19 hybridizations were carried out, 18 hybridizations in 6 conditions (NaCl treated for [0h, 6h, 1d], and Solbitol treated for [0h, 6h, 1d]) with 3 biological replicates [A,B,C] per condition) and 1 additional hybridization for the initial self- vs. self-hybridization to assess technical variability.
