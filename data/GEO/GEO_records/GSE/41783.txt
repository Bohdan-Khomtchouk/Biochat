TITLE
IGROV1 miRNA expression analysis after in vivo locoregional treatment with CpG-ODN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported that peri-tumoral CpG-ODN treatment, probably activating TLR9-expressing cells present in the tumor microenvironment, sensitized cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy (Cancer Res 2011 Oct 15;71(20):6382-90). Here, we investigated whether this treatment induces a modulation of miRNAs and their involvement in chemotherapy sensitivity. Twenty miRNAs were found differentially expressed in tumors from CpG-ODN-treated mice versus controls. Evaluation of the role of miR-424, miR-340 and miR-302b on cisplatin sensitivity revealed that ectopic expression of miR-302b (up-modulated in our array) in IGROV1 cells significantly improved cisplatin activity. The identification of miRNAs able to modify sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment will provide an experimental base for its future possible use as a target or tool of specific therapies.

DESIGN
IGROV1 human ovarian carcinoma cells were adapted to growth intraperitoneally (i.p.) and maintained by serial i.p. passages of ascitic cells into healthy mice. Mice were injected i.p. with 2.5 x 10^6 ascitic cells in 0.2 ml of saline and treated starting 10-11 days later, when mice showed evident and established ascites, with CpG-ODN [phosphorothioated ODN1826 (5'-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3')] delivered i.p. at a dose of 20 Âµg/mouse for 3 consecutive days, control mice received saline (4 mice/group). 24 hours after the last treatment, ascites-bearing mice were sacrificed. Tumor cells adherent to peritoneal wall were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction.
