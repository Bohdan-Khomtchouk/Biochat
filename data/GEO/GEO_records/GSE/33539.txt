TITLE
Expression data obtained from ALLSIL cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed in order to knock down the expression of TLX1 gene in T-ALL cell line We used microarrays to identify the gene expression signatures associated with TLX1 knock down in ALLSIL

DESIGN
ALLSIL cell lines were infected with pLKO.1-shTLX1 and pLKO.1-luc control lentivirus. After 5 days of puromycin selection cells were collected and RNA was extracted in order to analyze the global changes in gene expression by Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 array.
