TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E14 ESCs treated with low levels of HDAC inhibitors for 16 hrs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of E14 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) before and after treatment with low levels of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (NaBu).

DESIGN
E14 cells were treated with VPA or NaBu for 16 hrs in duplicates. Cells were harvested along with untreated control E14 cells. RNA was isolated from the cells and hybridized on Affymetrix chips.
