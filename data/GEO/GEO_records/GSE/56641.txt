TITLE
Expression data from aged wild-type, met15Δ and rtg3Δ met15Δ yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To explore putative connections between genetic methionine restriction and the retrograde response, we asked whether the altered transcriptional program of methionine-restricted cells required RTG3 (which is indispensible for retrograde signaling in yeast).

DESIGN
Towards this end, we used Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 arrays to perform expression profiling of aged (Day 3) wild-type, met15Δ and rtg3Δ met15Δ yeast.
