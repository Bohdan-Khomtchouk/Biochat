TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of 293T and 293T-Aire-expressing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the impact of Aire on gene expression profile in a model cell line, we used 293T cells and transfected them either with an Aire expression plasmid pCMV-Aire (where mAire is driven by CMV promoter) or with a control plasmid pCMV2B. Total RNA was extracted 48 hours post transfection, processed and used for gene expression profiling by Affymetrix. The data demonstrate that Aire has a very broad impact, effecting (upregulating and downregulating) hundreds of differents genes, however these genes differ dramatically from its targets in medullary epithelial cells. Keywords: transfection

DESIGN
293T cells were seeded on 10cm plates and were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS under standard TC conditions. Next day, the cells were transfected either by pCMV-Aire (6ug/plate) or empty pCMV (6ug/plate) using Mirus reagent, according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted 48 hrs post transfection by Trizol protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 biological replicates were used for Aire transfection and 2 replicates for transfection with a control plasmid.
