TITLE
CGH analysis of Campylobacter jejuni isolates previously analyzed by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we hava analyzed a set of 45 C. jejuni strains by CGH and MLST in order to investigate whether the strain relationships inferred from the analysis of a small number of loci (MLST) reflect whole-genome gene conservation patterns observed by CGH. Keywords: individual hybridizations, comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
We performed microarray CGH on 45 strains previously characterized by MLST. Genomic DNA from each experimental strain was compared in a CGH experiment against the reference strain NCTC 11168. We measured signal intensity for each tester strain versus the control strain NCTC 11168. Values represent mean of replicate spots. Replicate arrays are not included.
