TITLE
CGH analysis of Campylobacter jejuni isolates previously analyzed by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we hava analyzed a set of 45 C. jejuni strains by CGH and MLST in order to investigate whether the strain relationships inferred from the analysis of a small number of loci (MLST) reflect whole-genome gene conservation patterns observed by CGH. Keywords: individual hybridizations, comparative genomic hybridization
