TITLE
The effect of PRRSV on modulation of porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MoDC)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression of MoDC after PRRSV stimulation and nucleocapsid protein transfection

DESIGN
MoDC were cultured with 0.1 m.o.i. of PRRSV or mock-infected MARC 145 cell lysate for 24 hr. In another experiment, MoDC were transfected with plasmid encoding nucleocapsid protein or null plasmid for 24 hr. Total mRNA were subjected to Microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16571 Agilent-026440 Sus scrofa (Pig) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
