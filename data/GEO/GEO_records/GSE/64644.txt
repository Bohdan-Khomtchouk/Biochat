TITLE
Vascular niche induction of hematopoietic progenitors from pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Macaca nemestrina ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) represent an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Clinical translation is impeded by limited engraftment of human (h)PSC-multipotent progenitor cells (MPP). This barrier suggests that additional cues are required for definitive hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that vascular niche producing Notch ligands Jagged-1 (JAG1) and Delta-like ligand-4 (DLL4) would drive definitive hematopoiesis. To test our hypothesis, hes2 human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 2 and Macaca nemestrina (Mn) iPSC line-7 were differentiated with cytokines ± endothelial cells (EC), which express JAG1 and DLL4. EC co-culture supported emergence of 8-fold more CD34+CD45+ cells compared to co-culture with cytokines ± ECs with JAG1 or DLL4 knockdown. EC-induced cells exhibit Notch activation and express HSC-specific targets of Notch signaling RUNX1 and GATA2. EC-induced PSC-MPP engraft at a higher level in NSG mice compared to cytokine-induced cells (10% > 5 months), and selection increased engraftment (30%). Long-term engraftment and the myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio achieved with vascular niche induction is similar to levels achieved for cord blood MPP and up to 20-fold higher than hPSC-MPP engraftment. Our findings identify a previously underappreciated role for endothelial Notch ligands in PSC definitive hematopoiesis and production of long-term engrafting CD34+ cells and suggest they are critical for HSC emergence.
