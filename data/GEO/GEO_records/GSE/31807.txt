TITLE
Expression data from Ralstonia solanacearum-inoculated tomato stem

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a lethal, soil-borne disease of tomato. Control of the disease with chemicals and crop rotation is insufficient, because the pathogen is particularly well adapted for surviving in the soil and rhizosphere. Therefore, cultivar resistance is the most effective means for controlling bacterial wilt, but the molecular mechanisms of resistance responses remain unclear. We used microarrays to obtain the characteristics of the gene expression changes that are induced by R. solanacearum infection in resistant cultivar LS-89 and susceptible cultivar Ponderosa.

DESIGN
Stems of LS-89 and Ponderosa seedlings at the five to six leaf-stage were inoculated just above the cotyledon by cutting the stem to one-third of its diameter with a razor, adding 5 µl of bacterial suspension (1e+6 CFU/ml of R. solanacearum strain 8107S) or distilled water for mock inoculation to the opening, then clipping the wound site to avoid bending. Inoculated plants were grown in a growth chamber at 30ºC under 30,000 lux light intensity for 12 h/day. At 1 dpi, stems were sampled by dissecting 5 mm long sections at 5 mm below the inoculation site. For each hybridization, RNA from 15 plants was used. Three biological replicates of microarray analysis were performed.
