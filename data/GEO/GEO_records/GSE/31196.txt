TITLE
The gene responses of the rice plant treated with both continuous simulated acid fog (pH3.0) and natural fog (pH5.6) treatments

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice plants cultivated on mountain areas are frequently exposed to acid fog and natural fog events. In this report, we analyzed the expression profiles of the rice plant with acid fog (SiAF) or neutral fog (SiNF) treatment for 1 and 7 days. Microarray results suggested that ROS generation was induced by not only SiAF, but also SiNF treatment, and it occurred in apoplast, not in organelles. Genes for defense- and stress-responses was also induced by both SiAF and SiNF treatments. The induction occurred in plants treated with SiAF for both 1 day and 7 days, and it was also detected in plants treated with SiAF for 7 days. These results suggest that both SiAF and SiNF treatments are abiotic stresses accompanying ROS generation in apoplast.

DESIGN
Comparison between continuous fog treated shoots and control shoots. Biological replicates: 3 simulated acid fog (pH 3.0) treated (SiAF) for 1 day; 3 simulated acid fog (pH 3.0) treated (SiAF) for 7 days; 3 simulated neutral fog (SiNF) treated for 1 day; 3 simulated neutral fog (SiNF) treated for 7 days; 3 controls for 1 day; 3 controls for 7 days. Independently grown and harvested. Cultivar: Hinohikari 1 sample derived from 5 plants grown under the same conditons. Total: 18 samples, 12 comparisons.
