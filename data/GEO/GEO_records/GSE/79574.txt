TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of miR10a inhibitor transfection for 24 hours in primary human mesangial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis genes which are elevated after miR10a inhibitor transfection for 24 hours with transfection efficiency more than 95 %inhibition in mesangial cells.  The hypothesis is genes which up-regulated significantly can be potential targets for miR-10a in primary human mesangial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from human mesangial cells (1x106 cells) transcient transfected with miR-10a inhibitor (assay ID MH10787) for 24 hours.  Transfection efficiency were determined by stem-loop RT PCR and Real-Time PCR against miR-10a.  The result showed more than 95% inhibition.
