TITLE
Identification of pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory probiotics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Affymetrix data analysis, important signalling pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory action of probiotics were identified using the clinically validated probiotic VSL#3 and the IL10-knockout mouse, an animal model for inflammatory bowel disease. VSL#3 increased expression of genes involved in PPAR signalling and metabolism of xenobiotics and decreased expression of genes involved in immune response/inflammatory response.
