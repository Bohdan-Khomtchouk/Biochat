TITLE
Identification of pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory probiotics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Affymetrix data analysis, important signalling pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory action of probiotics were identified using the clinically validated probiotic VSL#3 and the IL10-knockout mouse, an animal model for inflammatory bowel disease. VSL#3 increased expression of genes involved in PPAR signalling and metabolism of xenobiotics and decreased expression of genes involved in immune response/inflammatory response.

DESIGN
IL10-knockout (IL10-KO) and wildtype (WT) mice housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions were sacrificed at 24 weeks by cervical dislocation. The study is comprised of two independent Microarray experiments. Microarray experiment1 compares gene expression of IL10-KO and WT colon tissue. For microarray analysis RNA was extracted from the colon tissue of each mouse (WT n=7, IL10-KO n=6). Microarray experiment2 compares gene expression of WT and IL10-KO mice fed with either placebo or probiotic VSL#3. IL10-KO and WT mice were fed with placebo or 1.3x109 cfu of lyophilized VSL#3 bacteria post weaning for 21 weeks. For microarray analysis RNA was extracted from the caecum tissue of each mouse (WT Placebo n=6, IL10-KO Placebo n=6, IL10-KO VSL#3 n=6).
