TITLE
Gene expression change in the liver of tumor bearing mice by TSU68 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSU68, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRÎ²) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), on colon cancer liver metastasis and to test the hypothesis that TSU68 modulates the microenvironment in the liver before the formation of metastasis.

DESIGN
The human colon cancer TK-4 was implanted orthotopically into cecal walls of 6-week-old male BALB/c nu/nu mice (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The animals were treated with TSU68 (400 mg/kg/day, twice-daily, p.o.) or vehicle from 7 days after orthotopic implantation. After one week of drug administration, livers were removed and total RNA was extracted. We established four different groups of mice; non-tumor-bearing and treated with vehicle alone (NT-Co), non-tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68 (NT-TSU), tumor-bearing and treated with vehicle (T-Co), and tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68 (T-TSU). NT-Co, T-Co and T-TSU group were applied to microarray analysis.
