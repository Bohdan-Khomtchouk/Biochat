TITLE
S. pombe acetyltransferase mutants identifies redundant pathways of gene regulation, Affymetrix dataset

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Analysis of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) from the MYST and GNAT families in S. pombe to identify functional differences or overlap with regard to gene expression. Mutations were made to Elp3 and Gcn5 (GNAT family), and to Mst2 (MYST family). Mutants showed distinct phenotypes which were repressed or enhanced by mutant combinations.

DESIGN
Mutations were made to Elp3 and Gcn5 (GNAT family), and to Mst2 (MYST family) in S. pombe. RNA was extracted from the various mutants and hybridized on Affymetrix arrays.
