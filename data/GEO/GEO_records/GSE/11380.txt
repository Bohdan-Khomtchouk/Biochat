TITLE
Regulation by the homologous Ace2 and Swi5 factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The homologous Ace2 and Swi5 transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identical DNA-binding domains, and both are cell cycle regulated. There are common target genes, as well as genes activated only by Ace2 and other genes activated only by Swi5. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from four strains: wild type, ace2 gene deletion, swi5 gene deletion, and the ace2 swi5 double gene deletion. RNAs from the three mutant strains were compared to wild type RNA in a microarray hybridization experiment.
