TITLE
Expression profile of early and mid-secretory healthy human endometrium revealed by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inner uterine lining or endometrium is a unique constantly self-renewed adult tissue that is vital for embryo implantation. As the footrace for universal endometrial receptivity markers continues, RNA-seq remains the most powerful tool for transcriptomic marker discovery. In this study, we aimed to elucidate endometrial maturation mechanisms at transcriptomic level and identify novel robust biomarker candidates for endometrial receptivity.

DESIGN
The differential gene expression profiles of early secretory and mid-secretory phase endometrial biopsies obtained from 20 healthy fertile women across one menstrual cycle were analysed using paired sample study design.
