TITLE
BRE silencing effect on gene expression profile of human umbilical cord perivascular (HUCPV) progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HUCPV progenitor cells following BRE silencing using BRE-siRNA. BRE (Brain and reproductive organ-expressed) protein is also known as TNFRSF1A (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A) modulator and BRCC45 (BRCA-1 containing complex subunit 45). Results identify gene targets of BRE.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 3 separate cell cultures that have been transfected with BRE-siRNA and 3 separate cell cultures that have been transfected with ctl (scrambled)-siRNA.

PLATFORM
