TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression variation in CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA. We have integrated gene expression with genotyping data in order to identify eQTLs that characterize the gene expression of CD4+ T cells in active RA.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cell RNA was extracted from 26 patients with active RA. All samples were used to study the genetic regulatory mechanisms of CD4+ T cells in active Rheumatoid Arthritis.
