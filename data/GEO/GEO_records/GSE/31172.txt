TITLE
Expression analysis of mutant U2AF35 transduced cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, to obtain the biological impact of the mutated U2AF35, HeLa and TF-1 cells were retrovirally transduced with either mock, wild-type or S34F mutant of U2AF35, and Expression array was performed.

DESIGN
Expression analysis was performed for mock, wild-type U2AF35 or S34F mutant transduced HeLa and MDS-derived TF-1 cell line in triplicate.
