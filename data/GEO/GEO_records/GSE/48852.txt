TITLE
Expression profiles from Drosophila melanogaster scrib and lgl mutant wing imaginal disc and brain complexes at day 9 after egg deposition (AED) versus wild type at day 5 AED

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
mRNA microarray of Drosophila wing imaginal discs or brain complexes from lgl27S3/lglE2S31 (lgl-null), scrib1/scrib2 or wild-type 3rd instar larvae RNA was isolated from 20 pairs of wing discs/brain complexes per sample (i.e 20 individuals). Samples were from 5 day AED wildtype and 9 day AED mutant tissue

DESIGN
Samples were prepared in triplicate from lgl27S3/lglE2S31 (lgl-null) and scrib1/scrib2 samples and in duplicate from the wild-type 3rd instar larvae
