TITLE
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae during a natural infection in pigs

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a respiratory disease which causes great economic losses worldwide. Many virulence factors are involved in the pathogenesis, namely capsular polysaccharides, RTX toxins, LPS and many iron acquisition systems. In order to identify genes that are expressed in vivo during a natural infection, we undertook transcript profiling experiments with an A. pleuropneumoniae DNA microarray, after recovery of bacterial mRNAs from serotype 5b-infected porcine lungs.

DESIGN
Comparative Genomic Hybridizations between Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b strain L20 (ref) and serotype 5b fresh field isolate 896-07, recovered from infected pig lung tissues following natural acute infection. Two condition transcript profiling experiments : infectious 5b field strain isolated directly from lungs of naturally deceased pigs after acute infection vs infectious 5b field strain grown in BHI broth to an OD600 of 0.300.
