TITLE
Transcriptional signature of human pro-inflammatory TH17 cells [ex vivo TH17 cells]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human peripheral blood IFN-γ+IL-17+ (TH1/17) and IFN-γ–IL-17+ (TH17) CD4+ T cells display distinct transcriptional profiles in high-throughput transcription analyses. Compared to TH17 cells, TH1/17 cells have similar gene signatures to mouse pathogenic TH17 cells.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells isolated from PBMC of healthy donors (n=5) were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 3hr. TH1/17, TH17, TH1 (IFN-γ–IL-17-) and DN (IFN-γ and IL-17 double negative) CD4+ T subsets were sorted utilizing a capture assay that separates live CD4+ T subsets based on differential secretion of IL-17 and/or IFN-γ. sorted CD4 T cell subsets were subjected to gene expression analysis using the nCounter Nanostring Custom Codeset HuTH17.
