TITLE
Divergent immunity and energetic programs in the gills of migratory and resident Oncorhynchus mykiss

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression differences between Oncorhynchus mykiss that migrate and those that reside in freshwater, we compared gill transcriptomes of fish prior to release from a hatchery with those of fish recaptured eight days post-release while all fish were still in freshwater, but some were captured next to the hatchery (non-migrants) and others were captured moving toward the ocean (migrants). The in-hatchery sampling method represents a highly similar environment for all the fish, and allows for the determination of activated genes predictive of smolting programs prior to release into streams. Morphological (e.g. color) and physiological (gill NaCl-ATPase activity) data were also obtained and correlated to gene expression differences to aid in predictions.
