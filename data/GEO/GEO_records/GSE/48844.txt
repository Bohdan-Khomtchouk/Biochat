TITLE
Divergent immunity and energetic programs in the gills of migratory and resident Oncorhynchus mykiss

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression differences between Oncorhynchus mykiss that migrate and those that reside in freshwater, we compared gill transcriptomes of fish prior to release from a hatchery with those of fish recaptured eight days post-release while all fish were still in freshwater, but some were captured next to the hatchery (non-migrants) and others were captured moving toward the ocean (migrants). The in-hatchery sampling method represents a highly similar environment for all the fish, and allows for the determination of activated genes predictive of smolting programs prior to release into streams. Morphological (e.g. color) and physiological (gill NaCl-ATPase activity) data were also obtained and correlated to gene expression differences to aid in predictions.

DESIGN
Gill tissue was sampled for transcriptome profiling 13 days prior to two different releases from the hatchery (total sampled within hatchery n = 19). Samples were also taken eight days after the two releases near-hatchery (total in-creek n = 20) or migrating towards the ocean but still in freshwater (second release only n = 20). Finally, 48 days after the second release a final set of resident fish were sampled near the hatchery (n =10). In terms of time after release, the most parallel comparison is the second 8 day post release sample in-creek and migrating. Although all samples were obtained in freshwater, the samples with the most similar local environment are the pre-release samples.
