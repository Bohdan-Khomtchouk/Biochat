TITLE
Gene expression profile of primary cortical neurons from necdin-null mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Necdin, a pleiotropic protein expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons of mammals, regulates neuronal development and survival by interacting with various regulatory proteins. To understand a novel function of necdin, we analyzed gene expression profile of primary cortical neurons prepared from necdin-null mice at embryonic day 14.5.

DESIGN
Wild-type and necdin-null cortical cells were prepared from mice at embryonic day 14.5.  These cells were incubated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and differentiated into neurons for 4 days ( > 97% MAP2-positive postmitotic neurons). Three mice per genotype were used for analysis.
