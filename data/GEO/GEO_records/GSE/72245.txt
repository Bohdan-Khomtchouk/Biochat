TITLE
DNA methylation-based immune response signature improves patient diagnosis in multiple cancers (Cohort 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common and deadliest malignancies in women worldwide. Tumor immune response is increasingly recognized to be associated with better clinical outcome in breast and other cancers. However, the quantitative evaluation of the tumor immune response by measuring tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) remains challenging, since it relies on subjective measurements, which are limited in accuracy and reproducibility. In this study, we sought to identify a set of DNA methylation markers (MeTIL signature) that better recapitulate the evaluation of TILs and their impact on long-term outcome in BC. We showed that the MeTIL score measures TIL distributions in a more robust and sensitive manner than conventional pathological TIL counts and that this translates into better prediction of survival and response to chemotherapy in BC. We demonstrated that the MeTIL score can be determined in low amounts of DNA from FFPE tumor tissue by bisulfite pyrosequencing allowing for the fast and cost-efficient evaluation of TILs in the clinical setting.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA of the 118 samples from the Cohort 1 were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
