TITLE
Compulsory expression of miR-210 in normal endometrial stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compulsory expression of miR-210 in normal endometrial stromal cells directed the induction of cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor production, and the inhibition of apoptosis in through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs play definite roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The objective of the study was to determine the role of miR-210, one of the upregulated microRNA in endometriotic cyst stromal cells, in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Downstream targets of miR-210 were identified by Compulsory expression of miR-210 in normal eutopic endometrial stromal cells, a global mRNA microarray technique, and Ingenuity pathways analysis.

DESIGN
NESCs were transfected with precursor hsa-miR-210 (Pre-miRTM miRNA precursor- hsa-miR-210, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) or negative control precursor miRNA (Pre-miRTM miRNA precursor-negative control #1 Ambion) at a final concentration of 10 nM, using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA from cultured NESCs transfected with precursor hsa-miR-210 (n=4) and NESCs (n=4) transfected with negative control precursor miRNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Then, the samples were subjected to a gene expression microarray analysis with a commercially available human mRNA microarray (G4845A, Human Gene Expression 4x44K v2, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
