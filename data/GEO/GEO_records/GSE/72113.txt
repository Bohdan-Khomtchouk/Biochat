TITLE
Genome-wide transcription profiling of oxic and anoxic cultures

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome of stationary-phase cells with mature biofilm cultured with and without oxygen. The reads were mapped to the genome and then normalized counts for each gene were calculated, thus enabling the comparison of gene-expression levels between samples. Our results depicts the severe stress the lack of oxygen imposes on biofilms by altered gene expression

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of aerobic and anaerobic biofilm and planktonic cultures were generated by deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL15010 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655)
