TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of grape berry skin induced by UV irradiation.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
We conducted transcript profiling and metabolome profiling induced by UV irradiation in grape berry skin. Transcriptome analysis was carried out with genome-wide microarray and two hundred thirty eight genes were more than 5-fold up-regulated by UV irradiation. The enrichment analysis showed GO terms including stilbene synthase (STS) gene. Moreover, the principal component analysis (PCA) of metabolome analysis showed a compound, identified resveratrol, accumulated in grape berry skin specifically. Our result clearly shows that UV irradiation induced only accumulation of resveratrol and its analogues but did not induce accumulation of the other phenolic compounds.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome profile in Vitis vinifera cv Pinot noir berry skin induced by UV irradiation. 2 samples examined: Control (=dark 1h), UV treated 1h. Each data point was performed three different biological replicates for treatment.
