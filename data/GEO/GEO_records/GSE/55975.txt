TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in human iPSCs and NSCs engineered by safe-harbor TALEN-mediated gene targeting

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human iPSCs and NSCs were engineered by AAVS1 and/or C13 safe-harbor TALENs which mediated targeted integration of various reporter genes at single or dual safe-harbor loci. Multiple clones of targeted human iPSCs were used to compare with parental untargeted NCRM5 iPSCs. Polyclonal targeted human NSCs were used to compare with their parental untargeted NCRM1NSCs or H9NSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from targeted human iPSCs or NSCs compared to untargeted control iPSCs or NSCs.
