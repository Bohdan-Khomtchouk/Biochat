TITLE
Expression data from DHT stimulation vs. control in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Expression data from DHT stimulation vs. control in LNCaP cells

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were maintained in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran stripped FCS for three days before stimulation with 100 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 48 hours
