TITLE
Expression data from CpG treated Common Lymphoid Progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLPs) have two subsets, Ly-6d- which are mutli-potent, and Ly-6d, which derive from Ly-6d- and are committeed to the B-cell fate.  Treatment of a mouse with CpG DNA causes an inflammatory response that alters both subsets.  We used expression data to understand the changes in transcription in the transition of Ly-6d- CLPs to Ly-6d+ CLPs ion the presence and absence of CpG induced inflammation.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were treated over 10 days with either PBS or 50 ug of CpG1826.  On day 10, bone marrow was harvested and CLPs populations were sorted by flow cytometry directly into RNAeasy buffer (Qiagen).
