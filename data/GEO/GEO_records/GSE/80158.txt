TITLE
Photorespiratory stress  low CO2 conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Six weeks old Arabidopsis plants were transferred to a low CO2 (100 ppm) environment during 24 hours and compared to control plants kept under ambient CO2 conditions. Limited CO2 availability will cause higher rates of photorespiration and affect the plant redox homeostasis. We studied the transcriptomic impact of exposing plants to a lower CO2 environment to further eliculidate the signaling pathways during photorespiratory stress.

DESIGN
After 6 weeks plants were transferred to low CO2 conditions (100 ppm) during 24 h or kept at 400 ppm CO2 (control condition). Design: 3 replicates x 2 conditions (low CO2 - ambient CO2)
