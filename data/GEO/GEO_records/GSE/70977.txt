TITLE
CpG island methylation profile in non-invasive oral rinse samples is predictive of oral and pharyngeal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of oral rinse samples from a case-control study of 154 cases and 72 controls. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in oral rinse samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 226 oral rinse samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
