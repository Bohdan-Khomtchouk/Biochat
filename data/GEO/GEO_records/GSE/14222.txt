TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of the SSC-Enriched Thy1+ and SSC-Depleted Thy1- Fractions of Prepubertal Mouse Testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provides the foundation for testis homeostasis, yet mechanisms that control their functions in mammals are poorly defined. We used microarray transcript profiling to identify specific genes whose expression are augmented in the SSC-enriched Thy1+ germ cell fraction of mouse pup testes. Comparisons of gene expression in the Thy1+ germ cell fraction to the Thy1-depeleted testis cell population identified 202 genes that are expressed 10-fold or higher in Thy1+ cells. This database provided a mining tool to investigate specific characteristics of SSCs and identify novel mechanisms that potentially influence their functions.
