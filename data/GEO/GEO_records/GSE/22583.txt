TITLE
Comparison of endogenous and viral microRNA profile of Arabidopsis thaliana with and without Turnip Mosaic Virus infection.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Individual miRNA profile was identified for two Col-0 WT replicates and two Col-0 TuMV infected plant replicate samples, with 12-15 plants in each replicate.Comparison was done based on the microRNA expression profile in both biological replicates for infected and uninfected plant samples .

DESIGN
12-15 plants were used in all sample replicates independently.

PLATFORM
GPL10615 Arabidopsis thaliana 0.3K Sanger miRBase release 12.0 + custom probes
