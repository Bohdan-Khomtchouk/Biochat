TITLE
CGH array in neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we investigated the structure of MYCN amplifications, examples of both dmin and hsr, in eight neuroblastoma (NB) and two small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines.

DESIGN
Ten cell lines were analyzed for gene amplification: STA-NB3 (NB), STA-NB4 (NB), STA-NB8 (NB), STA-NB10DM (NB), STA-NB10HSR (NB), STA-NB13 (NB), STA-NB15 (NB), SK-N-BE (NB), GLC8 (SCLC), GLC14 (SCLC). NimbleGen human reference sample was used as reference DNA.
