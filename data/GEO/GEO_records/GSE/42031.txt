TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile of naive versus arsenic trioxide resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the potential mechanism of resistance to arsenic trioxide (ATO). The gene expression profile of naive (NB4) (Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line and one of its in house generated ATO resistant sub clone (NB4-VM-AsR1) was done using whole genome microarray and compared to generate the differential expression profile which will give insight into the mechanisms of ATO resistance in APL.
