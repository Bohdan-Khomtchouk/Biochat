TITLE
Differential expression of genes after alterations in cellular levels of hsa-miR-195

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to identify the genes which get altered after over-expression and depletion of hsa-miR-195 levels in MCF7 and HEK 293T cells. Recent research has established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of many cell processes including those often deregulated in cancer such as apoptosis. In our previous work we have shown that hsa-miR-195 targets the key anti-apoptotic molecule BCL2 and its over-expression induces apoptosis and augments sensitivity of cancer cells towards chemotherapeutic drug. These results suggested a possible anticancer role of miR-195 and therefore oblige its complete functional characterization. In this study global effect of alterations in cellular miR-195 levels on transcriptome was analysed in order to identify the regulatory functions of miR-195. Together our findings highlight a novel and important role of hsa-miR-195 potentially opening new avenues for the treatment of various diseases.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates of six samples were used viz. MCF7 cells depleted of endogenous miR-195 using 100nM antimiR-195 (MCF7-AntimiR), MCF7 cells with overexpressed miR-195 using 3 µg p195 (MCF7-195), MCF7 untransfected (MCF7-Control) ; HEK 293T cells depleted of endogenous miR-195 using 100nM antimiR-195 (HEK 293T-AntimiR), HEK 293T cells with overexpressed miR-195 using 3µg p195 (HEK 293T-195) and untransfected HEK 293T cells (HEK 293T control)
