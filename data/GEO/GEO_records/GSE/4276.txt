TITLE
Soybean cultivars OX951 & OX736, seed coat permeablity comparison

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean cultivars, OX951 & OX736, comparison of seed coat at 3 growth stages, early, mid & late Keywords: time course

DESIGN
26 microarray slides GPL3015; 2 soybean cultivars, OX951 (with impermeable seed coat) and OX736 (with permeable seed coat); 2 technical reps for each growth stage (dye swap);4 biological reps from 2 consecutive growing seasons, 2004 & 2005 (2 reps per year); 3 growth stages, early (E) 10 to 20 days after pollination (dap), mid (M) 21 to 35 dap and late (L) 36 to 50 dap; total RNA isolated from the whole seed  for the early stage and seed coat only for the mid & late stages. The slide data was analyzed in GeneSpringGX7.3 Agilent Technologies, using background subtracted values. The ratio for OX736/OX951 was calculated from the 2 colour hybridization (same slide) and relative expression for seed coat development as a function of time was calculated using all the slides treated as single channel data.The slide identites are 2004 rep1 GSM97598 to 97603, 2004 rep 2 GSM97606 to 97611, 2005 rep3 GSM97612 to 97617, 2005 rep4 GSM97618 to 97623. Two self test slides were included for 2004 rep1 L stage,  OX951/OX951 and OX736/OX736 , GSM907604-97605
