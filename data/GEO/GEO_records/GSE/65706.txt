TITLE
Characterization of miRNomes in Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Erythroid Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the genome-wide miRNAs dynamics that occur during the differentitation of HESCs into the erythroid lineage using high throughput sequencing technology.  Undifferentiated HESCs as well as erythroid cells at three developmental stages-ESER (embryonic stage), FLER (fetal stage) and PBER (adult stage) were analyzed.

DESIGN
Compare the miRNomes of embryonic stem cells and three erythroid cell types at different development stages
