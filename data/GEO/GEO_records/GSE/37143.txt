TITLE
Gene expression induced by 5SA-Atoh1 in DLD1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the function of Atoh1 in colon cancer cells. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to iedntify the gene expression induced by Atoh1 in colon cancer cells.

DESIGN
Mutated Atoh1 (5SA-Atoh1) replaced 5 serine residues to Alanin  for the protein stabilization were expressed in human colon cancer cellline; DLD1 cells. Triplicated RNAs were generated from GFP expressing DLD1 cells and 5SA-Atoh1 expressing DLD1 cell, respectively.
