TITLE
A comparison of gene expression between the skin and flesh tissue of grape berries (CLAsf_05)

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression were compared for grape berry flesh and skin. The aim of this analysis is to identify key genes that are differentially expressed in the skin or flesh during berry development. Keywords: Tissue specific gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were collected for each treatment. Biotin labeled probes were prepared from the extracted RNA from each deseeded berry sample and hybridized to the Vitis vinifera GeneChip. The sample/GeneChip position on the Affymetrix hybridization station was randomized using the AlgDesign package from R.
