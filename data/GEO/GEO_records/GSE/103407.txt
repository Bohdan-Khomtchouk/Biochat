TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing: Epignetics 300 CRISPR sgRNA screen in THP-1 Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify critical epigenetic regulators of acute myeloid leukemia cell surival (AML), we performed a CRISPR screen with an sgRNA library containing 6121 sgRNAs against the epigenome and controls. We collected samples at day 7 (reference) and day 21 to look for sgRNAs that dropped out of the population and hence, may be critical for for AML cell growth or survival. Conclusions: Our study reveals a novel epigenetic regulator of innate immunity in AML. This gene is critical for AML surivival and loss of this gene induces a type I IFN response. This particular dataset show the dropout of this gene at day 21, as well as other potential genes that regulate AML cell survival or growth.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was profiled from 3 samples treated with the lentiviral sgRNA library at day 7 and 3 samples at day 21. One sample at day 21 was dropped in the final analysis due to low quality.
