SUMMARY
To investigate genes that are involved in hematopoietic cells production in vivo, we used microarray technology combined with a transgenic mouse model IIb-tk previously developed in our laboratory (Tropel et al., 1997). In these mice, the promoter region of the murine CD41 (GPIIb) gene was used to target the expression of the thymidine kinase (tk) toxigene in cells specifically expressing the CD41 gene. The strength of the model resides in the fact that the depletion of the entire myelo-megakaryocytic lineage including stem cells/early progenitors by ganciclovir (GCV) administration could be inverted by discontinuing the treatment. A nearly full recovery of mature myelo-megakaryocytic cells is then observed within 3 days. To determine at the molecular level how BM cells could be regenerated in vivo following the eradication of all myeloid progenitors by the GCV treatment, microarray technology was applied. The strategy involved monitoring early transcriptional changes for the first 3-day of BM regeneration. Keywords: time-course
