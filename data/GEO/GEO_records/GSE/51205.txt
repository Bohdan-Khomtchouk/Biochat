TITLE
Alteration of renal gene expression affected by atypical chemokine receptor D6 knockout in diabetic OVE26 (OVE) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The D6 receptor can bind and internalize inflammatory chemokines without activating intracellular pathways. D6 can reduce tissue inflammation, presumably by scavenging inflammatory chemokines. In diabetic kidney there is extensive inflammation but the possible role of the D6 receptor has never been tested. In this study, we included the renal gene expression dataset generated from whole kidney RNA extraction in diabetic mice with or without D6 gene knockout, their controls are age and sex matched D6 deficient or wild type mice on FVB background. These data are used to analyze the effects of D6 deletion on progression of diabetic nephropathy.

DESIGN
D6 knockout mice were crossing with FVB stain to produce D6 knockout mice in FVB background (D6). Then D6 was crossed with diabetic mice (OVE) to produce D6 defficient diabetic mice (OVE-D6). These mice were followed up for albuminuria from 2 month old, and sacrificied at 6 months for gene expression and renal morphology analysis. 12 kidney samples (3 per group) were used in this gene array study.
