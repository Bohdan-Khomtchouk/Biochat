TITLE
Expression data from mouse SCN after 30-min light pulse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transmission of information about the photic environment to the circadian clock involves a complex array of neurotransmitters, receptors, and second messenger systems.  Using laser capture microscopy and microarray analysis, a population of genes rapidly induced by light in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is identified. Keywords: comparative expression analysis

DESIGN
Mice were exposed starting at 1 hour after lights off to a 30-minute light pulse.  At the end of the light pulse, mice were euthanized and the brains extracted.  Cells from the suprachiasmatic nucleus were extracted using laser capture microscopy and gene expression was quantified using Affymetrix microarrays.  Genes showing a significant increase in expression following the light pulse as compared to a sham light pulse were identified.
