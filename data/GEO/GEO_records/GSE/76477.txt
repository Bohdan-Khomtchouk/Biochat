TITLE
Genome-wide RNA sequencing of B6 mouse islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Isoform quantification results for B6 mouse using Bowtie and RSEM.

DESIGN
~400 islets were isolated and pooled from two B6 mice.  Whole islet RNA was isolated using Rneasy purification columns (Qiagen), quantified (Nanodrop) and integrity verified (Agilent) prior to sequencing.  ~94M total paired-end RNA-Seq reads were sequenced.
