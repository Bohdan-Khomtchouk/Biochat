TITLE
Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP: QKI data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess whether the transcripts identified by PAR-CLIP are regulated by the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Quaking (QKI), we analyzed the mRNA levels of mock-transfected and QKI-specific siRNA-transfected cells with microarrays. Transcripts crosslinked to QKI were significantly upregulated upon siRNA transfection, indicating that QKI negatively regulates bound mRNAs (Figure 3H of PMID 20371350), consistent with previous reports of QKI being a repressor.

DESIGN
The RBP QKI was depleted by siRNAs and the expression level was compared to mock-transfected HEK 293 cells.
