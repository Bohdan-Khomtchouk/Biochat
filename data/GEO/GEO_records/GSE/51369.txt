TITLE
Identification of Novel Virulence-related Genes in Burkholderia pseudomallei by Comparing Gene Expression Profiles in Two Mice Model Through Microarray

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei ; Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles were investigated and compared in spleen, lungs and liver of susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) hosts to identify genes participated in survival and virulence functions encoded in the B. pseudomallei genome. Subsequently, genes with unknown function and located with virulence gene clusters or suspected to be transcription regulator were selected for a novel virulence gene investigation

DESIGN
DNA microarray was used to compare gene expression profiles of B. pseudomallei 1909a in spleen, lung and liver of infection-susceptible BALB/c mice (Th2 prototype) and infection-resistant C57BL/6 mice, (Th1 prototype) during an acute infection. The gene expression profile of B. pseudomallei in culture medium at mid-log phase was used to identify genes that expressed higher or lower in vivo when compared to the in vitro gene profile KEYWORDS: Gene expression
