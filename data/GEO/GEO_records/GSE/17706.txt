TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis TraSH experiment: Growth in wild type C57BL/6J versus iNOS-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
A M. tuberculosis transposon library was used to infect WT and iNOS-/- mice.  Surviving mutants were recovered from spleens, genomic DNA was extracted, and labeled probes were synthesized from transposon ends.  Probes from each WT mouse were hybridized with probes from a similar iNOS-/- mouse.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Growth in WT vs. iNOS-/- mice.  Biological replicates: TraSH probe made from 5 wild type and 5 iNOS-/- mice after 3 weeks of infection and from 8 wild type and 8 iNOS-/- mice after 4 weeks of infection.  Technical replicates: TraSH probe was synthesized twice from each mouse and dyes were swapped.  One array contains probe from one iNOS-/- and one WT mouse.  Each biological replicate has two arrays, representing technical replicate dye swaps from one iNOS-/- and one WT mouse.
