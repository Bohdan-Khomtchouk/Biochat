TITLE
Robust production of human neural cells by establishing neuroepithelial-like stem cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived feeder-free iPSCs under xeno-free conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a microarray experiment to analyze the transcriptional profile of human fetal tissue derived neural stem/progenitor cells, human iPSCs, or human iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells generated using xenogenic or xeno-free reagents.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns were compared among human fetal tissue derived neural stem/progenitor cells, human iPSCs, or human iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells generated using xenogenic or xeno-free reagents. Samples with a title including " Xf " (201B7-lt-NES (Xf)-1, 201B7-lt-NES (Xf)-2, 1210B2-lt-NES (Xf)-1,1210B2-lt-NES (Xf)-2, 1231A3-lt-NES (Xf)-1, 1231A3-lt-NES (Xf)-2) correspond to human iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells generated using xeno-free reagents, whereas samples with a title including " Con " (201B7-lt-NES (Con)-1, 201B7-lt-NES (Con)-2) correspond to those generated using xenogenic reagents.
