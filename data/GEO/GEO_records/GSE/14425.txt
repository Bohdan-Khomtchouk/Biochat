TITLE
Change in expression of genes after retinoic acid treatment of stellate cells: dose response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the change in expression of genes after treatment of stellate cells with retinoic acid to understand how the stellate cells can de-differentiate and effect their physiological behaviour in pathological conditions. We then tested the changes in the gene expression in 2D and 3D culture conditions for pancreatic stellate cells and in a pancreatic cancer model. Keywords: gene expression change, dose response, matrix conditions
