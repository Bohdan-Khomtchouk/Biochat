TITLE
Change in expression of genes after retinoic acid treatment of stellate cells: dose response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the change in expression of genes after treatment of stellate cells with retinoic acid to understand how the stellate cells can de-differentiate and effect their physiological behaviour in pathological conditions. We then tested the changes in the gene expression in 2D and 3D culture conditions for pancreatic stellate cells and in a pancreatic cancer model. Keywords: gene expression change, dose response, matrix conditions

DESIGN
We treated a pancreatic stellate cell line on plastic or Matrigel with 1 or 10 micromolar dose of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). RNA was extracted and hybridized on Illumina Human microarrays. We looked for target genes regulated by ATRA and evaluated for dose repsonse and change due to background culture conditions.
