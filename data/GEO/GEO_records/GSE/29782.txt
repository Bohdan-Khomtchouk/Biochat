TITLE
Study of the role of miR-205 in prostate epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression has been assessed on RWPE-1 cells, derived from normal prostate, upon silencing of miR-205 by an antisense locked nucleic acid.

DESIGN
RWPE-1 cells were transfected in triplicate either with 100nM of an antisense locked nucleic acid targeting miR-205 (LNA-205) or a scrambled oligomer (LNA-Scr). Gene expression was assessed 72h after transfection.
