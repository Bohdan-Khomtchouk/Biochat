TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A virus (A/Singapore/478/2009 (pH1N1)) infected A549 cells at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on A549 cells infected with Influenza A virus (A/Singapore/478/2009 (pH1N1))

DESIGN
The Influenza A virus (A/Singapore/478/2009 (pH1N1)) infected A549 cells were harvested at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A virus (A/Singapore/478/2009 (pH1N1)) infection.
