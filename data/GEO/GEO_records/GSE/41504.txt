TITLE
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) induces limited changes in the transcriptome of primary CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated primary CD4+ T cell gene expression treated with pharmacologically achievable concentration (340 nM) of SAHA for 24 hours in order to evaluate potential side effects of this compound in cells relevant to HIV infection.

DESIGN
Analysis of human primary CD4+ T cells taken from 9 healthy donors treated with 340 nM of SAHA for 24 hours. Results identify genes modulated by SAHA treatment in human primary CD4+ T cells.
