TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of Campylobacter jejuni strains: IA3902 vs NCTC11168

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
A highly pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni clone has recently emerged as the major cause of Campylobacter-associated sheep abortion in the U.S. and is also associated with foodborne gastroenteritis in humans. A distinct phenotype of this clone is its ability to induce bacteremia and abortion. To facilitate understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of this hyper virulent clone,  the differences in global gene expression patterns between this hyper virulent clone (IA3902) and a non-abortifacient strain (NCTC 11168) were compared by DNA microarray.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment,  IA3902 vs NCTC11168. Biological replicates: 3 IA3902 , 3 NCTC11168. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL16897 JCVI_PFGRC_Campylobacter jejuni version 3_NCTC11168
