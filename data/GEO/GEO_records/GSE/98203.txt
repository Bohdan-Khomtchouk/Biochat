TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of human prefrontal cortex neurons in heroin users shows significant difference between genomic contexts of hyper- and hypomethylation and a younger epigenetic age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina 450K Infinium microarray profiling of DNA methylation in FACS-separated neuronal nuclei from the postmortem orbitofrontal (OF) cortex of heroin users, controls and sucide individuals.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from FACS-sorted human brain neuronal nuclei. DNA was bisulfite-converted and hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human Methylation Beadchip array. 88 subjects were analyzed.
