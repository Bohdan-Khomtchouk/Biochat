TITLE
CD133+ vs. CD133- cells in GBML8, a primary glioblastoma tumorsphere culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD133+ and CD133- cells were FACS islated from GBML8 cells to find gene signatures upregulated in cancer stem cells

DESIGN
After surface immuno staining, CD133+ and CD133- cells were FACS isolated and subjected to RNA isolation. Experiment represent averaged data of 2 independent FACS isolations.
