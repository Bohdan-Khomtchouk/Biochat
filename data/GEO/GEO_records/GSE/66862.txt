TITLE
Eed conditional knockout in chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary rib chondrocyte  were isoloated from P0.5-day old wildtype and Col2-Cre:floxed EED conditional knockout mouse pups,and cultured overnight in 10%FCS containing DMEM.  RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 array.

DESIGN
Primary rib chondrocyte  were isoloated from P0.5-day old wildtype and Col2-Cre:floxed EED conditional knockout mouse pups,and cultured overnight in 10%FCS containing DMEM.  RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 array.  Biological duplicate.  Mice were in a mixed genetic background of C57/B6 and 129sv.
