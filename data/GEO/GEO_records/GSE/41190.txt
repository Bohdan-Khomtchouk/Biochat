TITLE
High-throughput Solexa sequencing of total RNA from Escherichia coli wild type and ∆fnr strain (PK4854)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655star

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆fnr mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into this strain produce a strain lacking the FNR protein.

DESIGN
A RNA-seq study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and two separate cultures of the ∆fnr mutant strain.The results are further described in the article " Genome-scale Analysis of E.coli FNR Revealse the Complexity of Bacterial Regulon Structure " .
