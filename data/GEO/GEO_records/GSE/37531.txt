TITLE
Prostasphere-forming cells of human prostate cancer cell LNCaP: Control vs. Hormone treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of LNCaP prostasphere-forming cells,  comparing control untreated sphere-forming cells with hormone treated sphere-forming cells. Both estrogen (estradiol) and androgen (R1881) promote the sphere formation of human prostate cancer cell LNCaP. Goal was to determine the effects of hormones on global gene expression of LNCaP sphere-forming cells.

DESIGN
Five samples were analyzed. Control (ethanol 1hr), estradiol 1 hour, estradiol 24 hour, R1881 1 hour, R1881 24 hour.
