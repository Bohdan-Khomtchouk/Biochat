TITLE
Expression profiling in adipocytes of obese humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis comparing gene expression profiles of adipocytes from non-diabetic lean vs non-diabetic obese Pima Indian subjects to identify differentially expressed adipocyte genes with obesity. RNA samples of isolated abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes from 20 lean (10 Males / 10 Females, aged 31±6 year, Body Mass Index 25±3 kg/m2 ) and 19 obese (9M/10F, 29±5y, 55±8 kg/m2 ) subjects were hybridized individually to Affymetrix  oligonucleotide arrays HG-U95A, B, C, D, and E. Keywords = adipocyte Keywords = obesity Keywords = inflammation Keywords = gene expression Keywords: other
