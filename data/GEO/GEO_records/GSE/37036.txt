TITLE
The microRNA expression profile of C2C12 cell upon 72 hours of BMP2 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify osteoblast specific miRNAs that can contribute to osteoblastogenesis by post-transcriptionally regulates their targets, BMP2 are treated to C2C12 for 72 hours and performed miRNA microarray.

DESIGN
C2C12 cells were treated with vehicles or BMP2 (300 ng/mL) supplemented alpha-MEM media for 72 days and total RNA was harvested and performed exiqon miRNA microarray. Duplicates were used for each condition. Dye swaps were done.
