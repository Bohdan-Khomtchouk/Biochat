TITLE
Global DNA CpG methylation profiling of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblast iPSC, and low passage stromal primed myeloid iPSC before and after conversion to the naïve state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global DNA CpG methylation profiling of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblast iPSC, and low passage stromal primed myeloid iPSC before and after conversion to the naïve state

DESIGN
Total DNA was harvested from indicated donor cells, hESC, or iPSC. A single sample of each cell line was used for this analysis.
