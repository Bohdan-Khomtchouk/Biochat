TITLE
An PWI- and RRM Motif-Containing Protein Is Critical for Pre-mRNA Splicing and ABA Responses in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq platform to determine role of a splicing factor RBM25 in regulation of gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing.  We found that a loss-of-function allele of RBM25, rbm25-1, causes up- and down-regulation of a large number of genes. We further found that the rbm25-1 mutation results in defects in altenative splicing of transcripts of many genes including signal transduction components in stress responses.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in bulked individual wild type and rbm25-1 mutant seedlings before and after ABA treatment.
