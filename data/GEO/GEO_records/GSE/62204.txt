TITLE
Transcription in wounded rat vocal folds and vocal fold fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to characterize transcriptome profiles of rat vocal fold tissue following surgical injury (vs. naive tissue); rat vocal fold fibroblasts harvested from scar tissue at the 60 d time point (vs. naive fibroblasts);  rat vocal fold scar fibroblasts treated with siRNA against the collagen chaperone protein rat gp46 (vs. scramble siRNA).

DESIGN
Adult Fischer 344 rat vocal fold tissue was harvested at 3, 14, and 60 days following surgical injury (control = age-matched naive tissue); rat vocal fold scar fibroblasts were obtained via explant culture of tissue obtained 60 days following surgical injury and harvested at 80% confluence during passage 1 (control = age-matched naive rat vocal fold fibroblasts); rat vocal fold scar fibroblasts were treated for 1 h with 50 nM liposome-delivered siRNA against rat gp46 when 80% confluent at passage 1, cultured for an additional 24 h in fresh media, then harvested (control = rat vocal fold scar fibroblasts treated with 50 nM liposome-delivered scramble siRNA).
