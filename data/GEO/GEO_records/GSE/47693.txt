TITLE
Expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) knock down (KD) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells results in characteristic changes in gene expression profiles.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HSF1-down regulation of HCC cells at gene expression level. Results provide important information of genes involved in HSF1, such as liver proliferation, apoptosis, stress response, metabolism, these genes were up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HSF1-KD KYN2 (HCC) cells and HSF1-control KYN2 cells. To identify genes generally involved in HSF1 associated, we compared expression profiles between HSF1-KD KYN2 (HCC) cells and HSF1-control KYN2 cells by using Illumina HumanWG-6 BeadChip.
