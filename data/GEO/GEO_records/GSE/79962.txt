TITLE
Widespread downregulation of cardiac mitochondrial and sarcomeric genes in patients with sepsis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanism(s) for septic cardiomyopathy in humans is not known. To address this, we performed transcriptional profiling of hearts from patients who died from sepsis, in comparison to non-failing human donor hearts that could not be transplanted for technical reasons.

DESIGN
20 sepsis patients, 11 ischemic heart disease (IHD), 9 nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 11 non-failing donors. The additional de-identified, clinical data for GSM2109161-66, GSM2109168-79 (total 18 samples) is provided in the 'Clinical_metadata.xls' (as a series supplementary file).
