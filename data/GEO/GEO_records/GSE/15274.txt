TITLE
Diurnally synchronized transitions between oxic and anoxic physiologies in an archaeon, experiment " Control-1 "

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum

SUMMARY
By sensing changes in one or few environmental factors biological systems can anticipate future changes in multiple factors over a wide range of time scales (daily to seasonal). This anticipatory behavior is important to the fitness of diverse species, and in context of the diurnal cycle it is overall typical of eukaryotes and some photoautotrophic bacteria but is yet to be observed in archaea.   Here, we report the first observation of light-dark (LD)-entrained diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12% of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1.  Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the LD stimulus (free-running rhythms).  The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the LD cycle.  Our results suggest that under nutrient limited conditions halophilic archaea take advantage of the causal influence of sunlight (via temperature) on O2 diffusivity in a closed hypersaline environment to streamline their physiology and operate oxically during nighttime and anoxically during daytime.

DESIGN
This publication consists of five experiments, known as A, B, C, Control-1, and Control-2. A,B, and C are entrained as described in the publication, and Control-1 and Control-2 were not entrained.
