TITLE
Rose bengal pretreatment

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Photoautotrophically grown wild type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures were either " treated " with 2uM rose bengal at 50 umol photons m-2 s-1 or " untreated " with the same volume of water at the same light intensity. The purpose is to identify genes that are regulated by singlet oxygen. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Microarray slides were printed as part of the C. reinhardtii Genome Project (Im et al., 2002; Shrager et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). Fragments corresponding to the last 400 bp at the 3â€™ ends of 2761 C. reinhardtii cDNAs were amplified and spotted onto polyamine-coated slides (Corning, Acton, MA). Each slide contained four replicate spots arrayed in four distinct grids. A total of 4 slides were used, encompassing two biological replicates, each with a dye switch control. Slides GSM105771 and GSM105772 used the same biological samples, but with a dye switch. Slides GSM105773 and GSM105774 used the same biological samples, but with a dye switch.
