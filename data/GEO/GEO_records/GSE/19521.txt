TITLE
SuperSeries for the analysis of transcriptional regulation by Thermus themophilus CsoR (TTHA1719)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the copper response of Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type and csoR deficient strain at 0 and 30 min after the addition of 1.25 mM CuSO4, and zinc response of T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 0 and 30 min after the addition of 1.0 mM ZnSO4. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Three wild-type and three csoR deficient strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 3 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (1 mL) were inoculated into 250 mL of the synthetic medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C for 8 hours. Then the 1.25 mM of CuSO4 or 1.0 mM ZnSO4 was added into the medium cultivating wild type, and 1.25 mm CuSO4 was added into the medium cultivating csoR deficient strain, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 0 and 30 min time point after the addition of copper or zinc ion, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample.
