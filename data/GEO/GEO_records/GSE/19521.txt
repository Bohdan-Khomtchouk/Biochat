TITLE
SuperSeries for the analysis of transcriptional regulation by Thermus themophilus CsoR (TTHA1719)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the copper response of Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type and csoR deficient strain at 0 and 30 min after the addition of 1.25 mM CuSO4, and zinc response of T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 0 and 30 min after the addition of 1.0 mM ZnSO4. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
