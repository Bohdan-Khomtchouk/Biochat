TITLE
TET1 is a maintenance DNA demethylase that prevents methylation spreading in adult cells [MeDIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that full length TET1 (TET1-FL) overexpression fails to induce global DNA demethylation in HEK293T cells. The preferential binding of TET1-FL to hypomethylated CpG islands (CGIs) through its CXXC domain leads to its inhibited 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) production as methylation level increases. TET1-FL-induced 5hmC accumulates at CGI edges, while TET1 knockdown induces methylation spreading from methylated edges into hypomethylated CGIs. However, TET1 can regulate gene transcription independent of its dioxygenase catalytic function. Thus, our results identify TET1 as a maintenance DNA demethylase that does not purposely decrease methylation levels, but specifically maintains the DNA hypomethylation state of CGIs in adult cells.
