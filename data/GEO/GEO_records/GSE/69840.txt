TITLE
Gene expression data of mRNA from skeletal muscle sample of pig breed Duroc and Pietrain with malignant hyperthermia syndrome homozygous negative

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
47,880 probe-sets were screened, in the first part of this study, they were analysed for differential expression between different breeds (Duroc and Pietrain) at adult stage.

DESIGN
RNAs of skeletal muscle from Duroc and Pietrain at adult stage were hybridized to Affymetrix Porcine Snowball Array.
