TITLE
Whole genome analysis of p38 SAPK-mediated gene expression upon stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells have the ability to respond and adapt to environmental changes through the activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Although it has been shown that p38 SAPK signalling participates in the regulation of gene transcription, there is not a comprehensive genome-wide transcription study reported to date describing neither the role of the p38 SAPK on the immediate response to stress and its kinetics nor a comparative vision of the genes that respond to different stimuli that activate the p38 SAPK. Here, we report a whole genome microarray analyses on wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with different p38 SAPK activators, namely the physiological cytokine TNF alpha, the protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic anisomycin and osmostress. In addition, we have analysed the contribution of p38 alpha the major isoform of p38 present in MEF cells, in the overall transcription in response to those stimuli by both, the inhibition of p38 SAPK by using a chemical inhibitor (SB203580) and the use of p38 alpha knock out MEFs. Furthermore, we have analysed the kinetics of the gene expression response to osmostress by the p38 SAPK.

DESIGN
Two samples have been analysed; wild type Mouse embryonic fibroblast (WT-MEFs) and MAPK p38alfa knock out MEFs (KO-MEFs) respectively treated with 11 and 4 different treatments. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and referenced to a pool of two non-treated WT MEFs.
