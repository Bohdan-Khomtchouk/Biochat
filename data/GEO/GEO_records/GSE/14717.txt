TITLE
Direct calibration of PICKY-designed microarrays

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Picky is an optimal microarray design software which designed the NSF Rice 45K Array. A series of microarray experiments using a one-chip version of this array were conducted to validate as well as to develop a calibration method for Picky designed microarrays. Synthesized samples with known content were used in the validation. PICKY designed microarrays were found to be highly reliable. The PICKY predicted closest nontarget information was used to quantitatively calibrate the best microarray hybridization conditions using the same microarrays and synthesized samples. Because this method works under most microarray protocols, it is generally applicable in any lab that uses PICKY as their microarray design tool. The associate publication provides more details about the experiment design and discussions about its results. Keywords: Microarray Calibration
