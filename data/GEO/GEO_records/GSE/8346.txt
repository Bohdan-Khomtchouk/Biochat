TITLE
Gene expression profiling of N-CoR2 overexpression in response to death induction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The series represent gene expression profiles of T4-2 neoplastic breast epithelial cells that overexpressed N-CoR2 and were treated with the death ligand TRAIL in three-dimensional reconstituted basement membrane culture. Keywords: Genetic modification; response to death induction

DESIGN
Four replicate cultures were established for each of the 4 experiment groups, including those using T4-2 cells that stably expressed N-CoR2 (T4-2_NCOR2), T4-2 cells expressing the empty vector (T4-2_vector), TRAIL-treated T4-2 N-CoR2 cells (T4-2_NCOR2_TRAIL), and TRAIL-treated T4-2 vector cells (T4-2_vector_TRAIL). Cells were grown on top of reconstituted basement membrane for 6 days and then treated with TRAIL (1 Î¼g/mL) or vehicles for 4 hours before the collection of RNA samples.
