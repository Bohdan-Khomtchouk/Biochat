TITLE
Gene expression profiling of N-CoR2 overexpression in response to death induction

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The series represent gene expression profiles of T4-2 neoplastic breast epithelial cells that overexpressed N-CoR2 and were treated with the death ligand TRAIL in three-dimensional reconstituted basement membrane culture. Keywords: Genetic modification; response to death induction
