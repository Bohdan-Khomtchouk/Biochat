TITLE
Allele-specific expression between Arabidopsis genus

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyzed allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaf and floral tissues of F1 interspecific hybrids generated between the two closely related species of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata with a whole-genome SNP tiling array (AtSNPtile1).
