TITLE
Allele-specific expression between Arabidopsis genus

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Arabidopsis lyrata ; Arabidopsis thaliana x Arabidopsis lyrata

SUMMARY
We analyzed allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaf and floral tissues of F1 interspecific hybrids generated between the two closely related species of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata with a whole-genome SNP tiling array (AtSNPtile1).

DESIGN
24 sampes, 12 DNA samples from parents and hybrids, 12 RNA sample from leaf and flowers of hybrids

PLATFORM
GPL13483 Arabidopsis thaliana AtSNPtile 1
