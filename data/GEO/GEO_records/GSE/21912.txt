TITLE
The Polycomb Group Protein Bmi-1 is essential for the growth of Multiple Myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The RPMI-8226 human multiple myeloma cell line was stably infected with either a validated shRNA against BMI1 or a control shRNA.  RNA was prepared from these lines, +/- doxycycline induction and at various time points post-induction.  Samples were hybridized on the Affymetrix U133plus2 human genome expression microarray.
