TITLE
Global gene expresssion profiling the gills of amoebic gill disease (AGD) affected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is an ectoparasitic condition of some farm-reared marine fish and is caused by Neoparamoeba perurans. Tanks housing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were inoculated with Neoparamoeba perurans and fish were sampled at 36 days postinoculation (pi.). AGD-affected gill tissue was dissected from N. perurans infected fish, and a DNA microarray was used to compare global gene expression against tissues from AGD-naive fish. To determine whether the changes in gene expression were restricted to AGD-lesions, lesion tissue from AGD-affected fish was also compared with non-lesion gill tissue dissected from the same gill arch. Samples were assessed using a DNA microarray. Keywords: comparative gene expression, parasite-induced lesion, Neoparamoeba perurans, amoebic gill disease

DESIGN
mRNA from lesion and non-lesion gill tissue was amplified and labeled. Six biological and two technical replicates were utilised to hybridise to 12 arrays using amplified RNA from AGD-affected lesion gill tissue with AGD-naive fish as a control. Four biological and two technical replicates were utilised to hybridise to 8 arrays using amplified RNA from AGD-affected lesion gill tissue with non-lesion tissue from the same gill arch as a control. The assignment of microarrays to treatment groups for hybridization was randomised by using a random number generator.
