TITLE
Cell-specific gene expression profiling of warm-sensitive neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TRAP-seq gene expression profiling. GFP-L10a is expressed in BDNF+ or PACAP+ in preoptic area.   Bdnf+ or Pacap+ cells in the preoptic area are labelled with GFP-L10a fusion protein expression to study cell-type specific gene expression. We used adult BDNF-Cre (custom generated, discussed in submitted paper) and Pacap-Cre mice (Allen Brain Institute, gift Hongkui Zeng) and injected Cre-depndent adenoassociated virus (AAV2-EF1a-DIO-EGFP-L10a, custom made) into the ventromedial preoptic area.

DESIGN
Comparison of Immunoprecipitation and Input fraction mRNA

PLATFORM
