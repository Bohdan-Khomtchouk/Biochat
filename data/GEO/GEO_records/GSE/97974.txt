TITLE
Combinatorial control of gene expression in Aspergillus niger grown on sugar beet pectin

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to better understand the contribution of the transcriptional activators GaaR, RhaR and AraR in regulation of pectin degradation in A. niger.

DESIGN
Single, double and triple mutants of gaaR, rhaR and araR were constructed and their phenotype and transcriptional response on pectin was analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL21721 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Aspergillus niger)
