TITLE
Activation of defense pathways in Scots pine bark after feeding by Pine Weevil (Hylobius abietis)

ORGANISM
Pinus sylvestris

SUMMARY
Coniferous trees  use the oleoresin, a mixture of non-volatile non-volatile diterpene acids and a large (20-50%) volatile fraction of mono- and sesquiterpenes, as a defence tool against damaging herbivores and pathogens. Volatilization of monoterpenes increases  viscosity of oleoresin and finally leading to polymerization of resin and a formation of protective solid plug. Resin storing conifers form an important source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mainly dominated by volatile monoterpenes. In the atmosphere, conifer VOCs react with ozone and OH and nitrous oxide radicals forming secondary organic compounds. This project seeks a better understanding of the genetic control of conifer defences and the role of monoterpenoid compounds under biotic stresses.

DESIGN
Two separate samples were analysed (control-unchallenged and treatment-infected with the insect). There were a total of 3 biological replicates for the control samples and another set of three  biological replicates for the treatment samples.
