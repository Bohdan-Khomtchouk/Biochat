TITLE
Identifying salt stress-responsive miRNAs and their targets in soybean (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role as regulators of gene expression. In plants they affect a wide variety of biological process like growth, development and response to biotic and abiotic stress. Glycine max is one of the most important crop worldwide due to its rich protein and oil content. Drought and salt stress are the main abiotic stresses that affect soybean. Salt stress impacts the fisiology of the plants due to the damage in the photosynthetic rate, growth and development. This work aim to identify salt-stress responsive miRNAs and their respective targets in Glycine max using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Four mRNAseq libraries from soybean leaves. Each library consist in a pool of three different plants treated with 200mM of NaCl or control. The libraries were contructed in duplicates.
