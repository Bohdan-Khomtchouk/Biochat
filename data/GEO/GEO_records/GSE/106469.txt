TITLE
miRNA expression in mature natural killer cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression of 800 miRNAs in three human matura natural killer cell subsets was measured.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was measured in primary human NK cells sorted for the following three phenotypes: CD56bright/CD94high, CD56dim/CD94high, CD56dim/CD94low.
