TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, unstimulated or stimulated with Bifidobacterium in vitro.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) unstimulated or stimulated with Bifidobacterium in vitro.

DESIGN
BMDC stimulation with Bifidobacterium in vitro: Cells isolated from the tibiae and femurs of WT C57BL/6 mice were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, in the presence of rmGM-CSF (20 ng/ml; BioLegend) for 8 days at 37°C with 5% CO2.  BMDCs were then stimulated for 4 hours with medium alone or with rehydrated Bifidobacterium-containing medium at a ratio of 1:10 BMDCs to bacterial cells.  Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy® Micro kit (Qiagen) and submitted to the Functional Genomics Facility at the University of Chicago for gene expression profiling.  RNA integrity and concentration were assessed using an AgilentBioanalyzer 2100, and all RNA samples used for microarray analysis had an RNA Integrity Number = 10.0.
