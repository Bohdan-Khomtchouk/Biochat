TITLE
Correlation between gene expression responses to FUS, EWS, and TAF15 reduction and the stress granule sequestering capacity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes after siRNA mediated knock-down of the FET-family of proteins; the FUS, EWS, and TAF15 proteins. The FET-proteins are thought to function as transcription factors, and this hypothesis is tested in the present study. Results provide important information of the genes which expression are controlled by the FET-family of proteins.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained HEK293-cells transfected with siRNA targeted against the FUS, EWS, or TAF15 mRNA, or a combination of all three of them. Control cells are transfected with an equal amount of unspecific siRNA without known targets.
