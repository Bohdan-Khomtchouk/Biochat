TITLE
Detection of the genes induced by the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 system in oral cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Robust genes were up-regulated in the oral cancer cells with SDF-1/CXCR4 system; however, most of the genes did not exhibit metastasis-related functions.

DESIGN
Mock cells and B88-SDF-1 cells, which have an autocrine SDF-1/CXCR4 system and exhibit distant metastatic potential in vivo were used.
