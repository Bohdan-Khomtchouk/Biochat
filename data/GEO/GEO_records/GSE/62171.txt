TITLE
RNA Polymerase II-associated factor 1 regulates the release and phosphorylation of paused RNA Polymerase II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early elongation is a critical step in transcriptional regulation in metazoan cells. Paused Pol II release is thought to require the kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) for the phosphorylation of DRB sensitivity-inducing factor, negative elongation factor, and C-terminal domain (CTD) serine-2 of Pol II. We found that Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) is a critical regulator of paused Pol II release, that positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) directly regulates the initial recruitment of PAF1 complex (PAF1C) to genes, and that the subsequent recruitment of CDK12 is dependent on PAF1C. These findings reveal cooperativity among P-TEFb, PAF1C, and CDK12 in pausing release and Pol II CTD phosphorylation.

DESIGN
Comparison of the chromatin occupancy of [1] PAF1, CDC73, LEO1, CTR9, total Pol II, and CTD serine 2-phosphorylated Pol II by ChIP-seq in THP1 cells; [2] PAF1, Pol II, Pol II (ser-5p), CDK12, and CDK9 by ChIP-seq in control and PAF1 knockdown cells; [3] LEO1 and Pol II by ChIP-seq in control and flavopiridol treated THP1 cells.
