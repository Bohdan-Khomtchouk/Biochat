TITLE
The role of SPK-1 in alternative splicing regulation in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify target genes of the SR protein kinase SPK-1. spk-1(RNAi) leads to defects in cell polarity. We were therefore primarily interested in genes who exhibit changes in splicing regulation upon depletion of SPK-1 and could underlie the polarity phenotype of spk-1(RNAi).

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of control and spk-1(RNAi) worms by RNAseq
