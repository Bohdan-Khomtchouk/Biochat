TITLE
Microarray expression profile of circular RNAs in lung tissues from rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a common and devastating syndrome. CircRNAs are crucial in a variety of diseases and can provide new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for disease. The development of circular RNA (circRNA) microarray has facilitated the study of the role of circRNAs in regulating gene expression. This research was designed to explore the expression profile of circRNAs in lung tissues from rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced ARDS. Our findings indicate that the expression profiles of circRNAs has changed in ARDS as compared with normal rat lung tissue, and may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and potential novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets for ARDS.

DESIGN
Microarray expression profiling of circRNAs were conducted using RNA extracted from three ARDS rat lung samples and three normal rat lung tissue samples.
