TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of mutants of CALMODULIN-LIKE (CML) family genes and CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) family genes in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES4326

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We observed that mutations in CBP60a, CML46, CML47 and WRKY70 enhanced plant resistance to Pma likely through different mechanisms. To investigate their contributions to enhanced resistance at the transcriptome level, we designed this experiment to measure their response to Pma using the SMART-3Seq method.

DESIGN
Mature leaves of Arabidopsis plants of seven different genotypes were infiltrated with mock or Pma. Samples were collected 24 hours after treatment. Each experiment contains one sample consisted of two leaves for each genotype-treatment combination. In total three independent experiments were conducted.

PLATFORM
