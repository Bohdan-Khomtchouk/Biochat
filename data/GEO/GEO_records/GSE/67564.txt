TITLE
Differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) for annotation of transcriptional start sites and small RNAs in Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
In this study transcriptional start sites (TSS) for H. pylori 26695 were determined

DESIGN
To detect the complement of transcripts expressed from H. pylori, we collected three independent biological replicates (B1 – B3) from 26695 wild type strain grown to mid-exponential (OD 600 ~0.6) phase under microaerophilic conditions at 37°C in BHI medium. For all three samples, total RNA was extracted and subjected to differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) library preparation for primary transcriptome analysis as described previously (Sharma et al., 2010). Specifically, prior to cDNA library construction half of each RNA sample was treated with 5’ terminator exonuclease (+TEX samples), which degrades RNAs containing a 5’-monophosphate (5’-P) and, thus, enriches for primary transcripts containing 5’-triphosphates (5’-PPP). The other half of each sample was left untreated (-TEX samples) and thus contains both primary transcripts (5’-PPP) and processed RNAs (5’-P).
