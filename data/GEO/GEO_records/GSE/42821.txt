TITLE
Tiling microarray analysis of gene expression profile of Escherichia coli galT mutant cells under D-galactose-stressed condition

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To understand the altered gene expression by D-galactose in galT cells, the cells were grown in the presence and absence of D-galactose and tiling array analysis was performed for transcriptome profiling. A galT defect causes the disease Galactosemia in human. This work helps us to study the human metabolic disease Galactosemia.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from Escherichia coli galT strain grown in the absence and presence of D-galactose. The transcriptome profile of galT cells was figured out in the galactose-stressed condition.
