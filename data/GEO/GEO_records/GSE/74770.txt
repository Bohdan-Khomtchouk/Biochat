TITLE
Circulating microRNAs: Association with lung function in asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood serum from 160 Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) subjects were microRNA profiles with 13 subjects profiled twice. Each subject has diverse clinical phenotypes notably spirometry related phenotypes.

DESIGN
Least squares linear regression was applied with subject phenotypes as the dependent variable, and microRNA Ct values (data matrix quantile normalized) as the independent variable to identify significant associations between subject phenotype and microRNA abundance.

PLATFORM
