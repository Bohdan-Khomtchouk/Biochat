TITLE
Agilent data from Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell tissue and leafs.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify genes of the guard cell transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell samples were compared with total leaf tissue. Genes of the abscisic acid and humidity response of Arabidopsis thaliana guard cells were identified by treatment with ABA-Spray and low humidity.

DESIGN
total samples analysed are 24: 4 biological independent replicates of: total leaf (COL-0) vs. enriched guard cells (COL-0); ABA-sprayed enriched guard cells (gl1-1) vs. control-sprayed enriched guard cells (gl1-1); low humidity (20%rh) treated enriched guard cells (COL-0) vs. high humidity (80%) treated enriched guard cells (COL-0)
