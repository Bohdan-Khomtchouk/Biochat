TITLE
Murine study of combined LPS and modified immunoglobulins associated gene expression changes in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We systematically assessed the transcriptomic changes of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of mice upon stimulation with immunoglobulins (IVIg), modified immunoglobulins (modIVIg) or vehicle controls in kidney, blood and liver in vivo. Data indicate different in vivo responses to LPS in conjunction with IVIg, modIVIg or vehicle.

DESIGN
RNA from murine liver and kidney tissues (LPS+vehicle, LPS+IVIg, LPS+modIVIg; four samples each group) as well as circulating leukocytes from WBC (three samples each group) was extracted and subject to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses. Normalization and quality control was performed for each organ separately.
