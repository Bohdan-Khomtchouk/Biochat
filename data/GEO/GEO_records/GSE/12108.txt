TITLE
Microarray analysis of human monocytes infected with Francisella tularensis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression in human peripheral blood monocytes between F. novicida-infected and uninfected, and between Francisella tularensis tularensis isolate Schu S4 and uninfected. The goal was to examine genomewide transcriptional reponses to these two strains, and identify differentially-regulated genes that may help explain the virulence of Schu S4. Keywords: Immune Response, Human Monocytes, Bacteria, Francisella
