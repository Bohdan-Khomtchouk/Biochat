TITLE
mRNA-seq analysis of superficial zone (SFZ) and deeper layers (deep AC) of articular cartilage of adult rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of SFZ and deep AC of articular cartilage through laser microdissection (LMD) using adhesive tape, linear amplification of mRNA, and mRNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
gene expression profiles of SFZ and deep AC obtained from the proximal tibia of two adult rats

PLATFORM
