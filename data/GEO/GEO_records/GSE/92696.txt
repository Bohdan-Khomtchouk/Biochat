TITLE
Identification of novel biomarkers for prediction of neurological prognosis following cardiac arrest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined 22 comatose patients resuscitated after CA and obtained peripheral blood from the patients at 48 hours after CA. To identify novel blood biomarkers, we aimed to measure neurological outcomes according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 6 months after CA and to determine blood transcriptome-based molecular signature of poor neurological outcome group.

DESIGN
22 participants were dichotomized into good neurological outcome, CPC 1 (n=10), and poor neurological outcome CPC 4 (n=4) and CPC 5 (n=8) were analyzed on whole genome expression microarray to profile post-CA with its innate characteristic molecular signature.
