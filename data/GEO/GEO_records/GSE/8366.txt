TITLE
Nitric oxide-dependent changes in Schistosoma mansoni gene expression

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous intercellular signaling molecule that also plays a role in host-parasite relations. NO acts rapidly, either via regulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, or by direct interactions with enzymes and other proteins, and has also been shown to have effects on gene expression. Here, we use SAGE  (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) to identify NO-responsive changes in gene expression in Schistosoma mansoni following a 3 hour exposure to sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor. Overall, these results indicate that NO does not rapidly induce large-scale changes in schistosome gene expression, but that expression of particular genes of interest appear to respond to NO. Keywords: Schistosoma, SAGE, NOS, nitric oxide, gene expression

DESIGN
Adult S. mansoni perfused from infected Swiss-Webster female mice (obtained from the NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center) 42-49 days postinfection were maintained in culture (RPMI medium) overnight and then exposed for 3 hours to either 1 mM sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a well-characterized NO donor, or to RPMI alone. Worms remained viable and motile following treatment. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNAse 1 (Ambion) to remove contaminating genomic DNA, and Long-SAGE libraries constructed.
