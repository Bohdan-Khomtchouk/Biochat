TITLE
DNA microarrays (time course) of MEFs transduced with SKO plus HDAC7 or MEF2C

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression HDAC7 can enhance iPS efficiency in SKO by supressing MEF2 factors We used microarrays to identify changes induced by overexpression of HDAC7 or MEF2C.

DESIGN
MEFs were transduced with SKO plus HDAC7 or MEF2C compared to SKO plus empty vector(Flag), GFP as controls. TRIZOL cell lysates were prepared from D6 and D10.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
