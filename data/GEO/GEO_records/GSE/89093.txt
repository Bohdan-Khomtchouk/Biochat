TITLE
DNA methylome analysis of human peripheral blood samples in cancer discordant monozygotic twin-pairs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling with the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k) of peripheral blood samples of 46 adult female monozygotic twin-pairs obtained at the same time point. Samples included 41 healthy females (not diagnosed with cancer to date) paired with their co-twin diagnosed with cancer within a 5 year window around the time of sampling as well as 5 extra pairs with a co-twin diagnosed with cancer within 11 to 5 years prior to blood sampling.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 92 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
