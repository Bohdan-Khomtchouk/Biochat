TITLE
Array-CGH screening of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (stPNETs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA copy-number profiling of 10 primary stPNETs Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Comparison of tumor DNA (stPNET) versus control DNA (pool of lymphocyte DNA from 10 healthy donors). Whole-genome screening for DNA copy-number aberrations using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Tumor DNA labeled in Cy3 and control DNA labeled in Cy5.

PLATFORM
