TITLE
TT-seq captures simultaneous activation of eRNAs and promoters during T cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Jurkat T cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin. Total and Labeled fragmented RNA was extracted every 5 minutes during a time course up to 15min after activation. Biological duplicates of all samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 1500
