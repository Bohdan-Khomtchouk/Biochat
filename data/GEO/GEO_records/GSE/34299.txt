TITLE
Expression of BRAF inhibitor resistant colon cancer lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colon cancer cell lines with partial sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 were grown in increasing concentration of the drug to develop acquired resistance.  Gene expression was performed for comparison of the resistant clones to the parental lines.
