TITLE
An improved method for identifying biological circular RNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Purpose: We are using the illumina sequencing to compare the false positive and true positive circular RNA findings to confine the method to detect the true circular RNAs Methods: The testis whole transcriptome profiling was generated from 4-week mouse testis using illumina Nextseq, duplicated. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: our data suggest that circular RNAs identified based on junction sequences in the RNA-seq reads, especially those from Illumina Hiseq sequencing, mostly result from template-switching events during reverse transcription by MMLV-derived reverse transcriptases.  It is critical to employ reverse transcriptases lacking terminal transferase activity (e.g., MonsterScript) to construct sequencing library or perform RT-PCR for identification and quantification of true circular RNAs. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

DESIGN
