TITLE
Global loss of DNA methylation uncovers intronic enhancers in genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with and without mutations in DNA methyltransferases (resulting in a 95% reduction in global DNA methylation levels) to study the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene expression. (The double knockout cell line is called DKO1)

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation, two histone modifications, RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq and RNA expression in two cell line (HCT116 and DKO1). One of relipates of HCT116 RNA P II ChIP-seq is from GSM970210. Histone modification data(H3K27ac, H3K4me3) of HCT116 are from GSM945304, GSE31755. Two replicates of RNA-seq data in HCT116 are from GSM1266733 and GSM1266734
