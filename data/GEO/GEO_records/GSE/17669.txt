TITLE
Gene expression in the barley spike during drought stress

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The photosynthetic organs of the barley spike (lemma, palea and awn) are  resistant to drought. This is a beneficial trait because they can sustain grain-filling when drought occurs at the reproductive stage. There is little information about gene expression in the spike organs under drought conditions. In this study, we compared gene expression in drought-stressed lemma, palea, awn and seed at the grain-filling stage using the Barley1 Genome Array in order to identify drought-regulated organ-specific genes.

DESIGN
Barley plants were drough-stressed for 4 days at the grain-filling stage by withholding water. Lemma, palea, awn and seed were collected to determine gene expression during drought in each organ. For each organ three biological replications were collected on three different dates. On each of the three dates, one replication of each organ was collected from plants grown in separate pots using a randomized complete block design (RCBD). In ths design, organ type and drought treatment were treatment effects and date of sample collection (replication) was the block. To get enough tissue for RNA extraction, each replication for each organ was collected from four plants in the same pot. RNA from each replicate sample was hybridized to individual Barley1 GeneChips. Thus, for four organs with three replications (blocks) and two treatment levels, a total of 24 Barley1 GeneChips were used.
