TITLE
Genome wide analysis of RNA species present in SMN-containing RNPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Several studies indicate that SMN-containing mRNP complexes could be involved in the axonal localization of a large number of mRNAs. We have used murine motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells and RNA Immuno-Precipitation experiments coupled to microarray analyses to perform a genome-wide analysis of RNA species present in mRNP complexes containing the full length SMN protein (flSMN). In situ hybridization and immuno-fluorescence experiments performed on several candidates indicate that these mRNAs colocalize with the SMN protein in neurites and axons of differentiated NSC-34 cells. Moreover, they localize in cell processes in a SMN-dependent manner. Thus, low SMN levels might result in localization deficiencies of mRNAs required for axonogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA species coimmunoprecipitated with the SMN protein were used for hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays
