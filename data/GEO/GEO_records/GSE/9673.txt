TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic reveals signatures specific to various interactions with Melampsora rust fungi

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We aim to understand the global transcriptional response of hybrid poplar NM6 (Populus nigra x Populus maximoviczii) to infection by two biotrophic Melampsora fungi, M. larici-populina and M. medusae f. sp. deltoidae separately and simultanously. Transcript profilling revealed 699 differentially expressed genes whose expression level was equal or higher than 2-fold between infected and noninfected tissues. In the mixed infection, our results showed an additive response of the two pathogens. Genes regulated as a result of Melampsora infection were generally induced and mainly involved in primary/secondary metabolism that include cell wall reinforcement and lignification, defense-related processes like pathogenesis-related and stress response, signal perception and transduction mechanisms and regulation of transcription. Keywords: Stress response
