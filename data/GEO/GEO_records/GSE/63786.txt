TITLE
An ultrasensitive mechanism regulates influenza virus-induced inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole-genome, time-course data was developed from the lungs of influenza infected mice to better characterize the dynamics of the host immune response during infection.

DESIGN
Lung  for microarray studies were obtained from female, five-week old C57BL/6Js infected with influenza viruses. Forty-two animals per group were inoculated with 10^5 PFU of A/Kawasaki/UTK-4/09 H1N1 virus [Kawasaki], A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) [SOIV], A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 virus (H5N1), 10^3 PFU A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 virus (H5N1) [VN1203] or mock-infected with PBS. Spanning the first week of the infections, three animals per infection group were sacrificed at 14 predetermined time points, lungs isolated and the homogenate was used to assess changes in genes expression over time and between infections.
