TITLE
Effects on the transcriptome of adult mouse pancreas (principally acinar cells) by the inactivation of the Ptf1a gene in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis documented mRNA changes in total pancreatic RNA preparations 14 days after Ptf1a inactivation.

DESIGN
pancreas mRNA profiles of Tamoxifen treated adult control mice [Ptf1a(CreER/+)] and Ptf1a conditional knockout mice [Ptf1a(CreER/fl)] were generated by deep sequencing using an Illumina Hiseq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
