TITLE
Gene expression data of BCR-ABL1 transformed myeloid cells from BCL6 wild-type and BCL6 knockout mice treated with and without Imatinib and RI-BPI

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differences in the gene regulation between BCL6+/+ and BCL6-/- CML cells a gene expression analysis has been performed. We investigated the gene expression pattern in BCL6+/+ cells in the presence or absence of Imatinib and a combination of Imatinib and RI-BPI (a novel retro-inverso BCL6 peptide inhibitor). In BCL6-/- CML cells, we investigated the gene expression pattern in the presence or absence of Imatinib.

DESIGN
BCR-ABL1 transformed myeloid cells from BCL6+/+ mice were cultured in the presence or absence of 10µM Imatinib or 10µM Imatinib and 20µM RI-BPI for 16 hours. BCR-ABL1 transformed myeloid cells from BCL6-/- mice were cultured in the presence or absence of 10µM Imatinib. Two samples for each condition were processed.
