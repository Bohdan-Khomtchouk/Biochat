TITLE
Post-transcription initiation function of the ubiquitous SAGA complex in tissue-specific gene activation (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
SAGA is a highly conserved transcriptional co-activator complex involved in multiple steps of transcription with activities that function both pre and post initiation. Loss of individual subunits results in developmental defects, suggesting a role in development. To better understand the roles of SAGA functions in developmental gene expression and it's relationship with RNA polymerase II, we examined its composition, binding profile, and the effects of subunit loss on gene expression in two distinct cell types in late stage Drosophila embryos: muscle and neurons.
