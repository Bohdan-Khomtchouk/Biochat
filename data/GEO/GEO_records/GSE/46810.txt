TITLE
Nucleotide-resolution, genome-wide, 5'-end maps of the transcriptome of Propionibacterium acnes (cultured with and without potassium downshift)

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202

SUMMARY
The differential RNA-seq data contained within this entry is complemented by global RNA-seq and microarray data, which is also deposited in GEO.

DESIGN
Duplicate cultures of Propionibacterium acnes strain KPA171202 were grown exponentially in batch culture under anaerobic growth. Samples were taken following subculture with and without potassium downshift (i.e. removal from medium). This produced 4 samples; 2 replicates x 2 conditions.  Aliquots of each of the 4 samples were then incubated with or without incubation TAP (tobacco acid pyrophosphatase) before library construction.  Thus, 8 libraries were analysed.  TAP treatment allows the cloning and sequencing of 5' ends that were originally triphosphorylated.
