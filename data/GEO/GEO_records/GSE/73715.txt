TITLE
Identification of potassium and chloride channels in eccrine sweat glands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
K and Cl channels play critical role for sweat secretion, however, individual K or Cl channels and their functions are largely unknown. By comparing expreession profilings between wild-type and Eda mutant Tabby footpads we identified 4 K and 2 Cl channels highly expressed in mouse eccrine sweat glands.

DESIGN
Total RNAs isolated from microdissected wild-type and Tabby footpads were profiled with Agilent 44K NIA mouse microarrays.
