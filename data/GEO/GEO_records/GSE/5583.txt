TITLE
Expression data from wild type versus HDAC knock out mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is an enzyme that promotes deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins. Histone acetylation is often associated with gene activation and expression. Los of HDAC1 leads to severe problems in development and proliferation. Moreover, it seems to be the major histone deacetylase in mouse embryonic stem cells. We used microarrays to identify putative HDAC1 target genes. Keywords: Fold change anaylsis between wild type nad HDAC KO ES cells

DESIGN
Wild type and HDAC1 mouse embryonic stem cell, originating from same litter, were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
