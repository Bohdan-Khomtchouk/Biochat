TITLE
E. coli K-12 wild type with R1drd19 biofilm vs wild type without R1drd19 biofilm

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli K-12 wild type strains gene expression in biofilm cells with R1drd19 relative to that in biofilm cells of E. coli K-12 wild type strains without R1drd19. All the samples were cultured in LB or M9C glu on glass wool at different time. Keywords: biofilm

DESIGN
Strains: E. coli K-12 strains with and without R1drd19 respectively; Medium: LB was used for BW25113 strains, and M9C glu was used for MG1655 strains; Biofilm grown on glass wool; Time: 7h, 15h, 24h respectively; Cell type: biofilm.
