TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of Hoxa2/Hoxb2 mutants versus wild type in Math1 positive cells from the Cochlear Nucleus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression was analyzed for FACS sorted Math1::Cre; ROSA-tdTomato from hand dissected cochlear nuclei of wild type and Hoxa2/Hoxb2 mutant mice

DESIGN
In order to investigate the role of Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 transcription factors in a subset of cells of the cochlear nucleus, we generated double conditional knock-out by crossing the deleter line Math1::Cre crossed with Rosa tdTomato; Hoxa2fl/fl; Hoxb2fl/fl and Rosa tdTomato wild type background. FACS sorted cells from hand dissected cochlear nuclei were than processed and RNA-seq performed (see extract protocol and library construction protocol).
