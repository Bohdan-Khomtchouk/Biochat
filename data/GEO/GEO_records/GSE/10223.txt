TITLE
Genetic homogeneity among strains of Clostridium botulinum type A1 with a unique toxin gene cluster organization

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridizations were performed to compare bont/A1 strains with an A2-like toxin gene cluster organization to the genome sequenced strain, C. botulinum ATCC 3502. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
For each hybridization, the reference strain (C. botulinum ATCC 3502) was labeled with Cy5 and each test strain was labeled with Cy3.
