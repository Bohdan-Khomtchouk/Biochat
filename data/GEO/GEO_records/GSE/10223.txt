TITLE
Genetic homogeneity among strains of Clostridium botulinum type A1 with a unique toxin gene cluster organization

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridizations were performed to compare bont/A1 strains with an A2-like toxin gene cluster organization to the genome sequenced strain, C. botulinum ATCC 3502. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
