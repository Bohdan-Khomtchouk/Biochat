TITLE
Evaluation of DNA-binding preferences of non-metazoan C2H2 zinc finger proteins by PBM

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The largest and most diverse class of eukaryotic transcription factors contain Cys2-His2 zinc fingers (C2H2-ZFs). Here, we have explored the diversity of sequence preferences of C2H2-ZF proteins in non-metazoan organisms using PBM experiments.
