TITLE
RNA profiling by deepSAGE sequencing in the cortex of a migraine mouse model after induction of cortical spreading depression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1) is a rare monogenic subtype of migraine with aura caused by mutations in CACNA1A that encodes the a1A subunit of voltage-gated CaV2.1 calcium channels. Transgenic knock-in mice that carry the human FHM1 R192Q missense mutation (“FHM1 R192Q mice”) exhibit an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD), the mechanism underlying migraine aura. Here we analysed gene expression profiles from isolated cortical tissue of FHM1 R192Q mice 24 hours after experimentally induced CSD in order to identify molecular pathways affected by CSD. Gene expression profiles were generated using deep Serial Analysis of Gene Expression sequencing. Our data reveal a signature of inflammatory signalling upon CSD in the cortex of both mutant and wild-type mice. However, only in the brains of FHM1 R192Q mice specific genes are up-regulated in response to CSD that are implicated in interferon-related inflammatory signalling. Our findings show that CSD modulates inflammatory processes in both wild-type and mutant brains, but that an additional unique inflammatory signature becomes expressed after CSD in a relevant mouse model of migraine.

DESIGN
Cortical RNA expression analysis using deepSAGE sequencing of wild-type (C57BL/6J) or transgenic R192Q FHM1 mice (n=6 per experimental group) 24 hours after sham surgery or the induction of 7 cortical spreading depression episodes
