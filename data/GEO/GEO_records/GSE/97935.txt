TITLE
Serotype-specific gene expression in GAS

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1 ; Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M3

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to compare gene expression between representative serotype M1 and M3 GAS isolates

DESIGN
Triplicate THY broth cultures of MGAS2221 (M1) and MGAS10870 (M3) were growth to the mid-exponential phase of growth.  RNA was isolated and used in RNA-Seq analysis.

PLATFORM
