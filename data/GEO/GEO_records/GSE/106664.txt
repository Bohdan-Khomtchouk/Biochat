TITLE
Transcriptome expression pattern of E11.5 PGCs, P2 GSCs, and CD49f+GSCs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cell identities of CD49f+GSCs were further identified by comparing them with the E11.5 PGCs and P2 GSCs. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that the CD49f+GSCs had 1/3 similar genes profile to the E11.5 PGCs and P2 GSCs. Further gene ontology (GO) analysis demonstrated that the E11.5 PGCs, P2 GSCs, and CD49f+GSCs shared the partial similar gene expression profile of pluripotency regulation signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling, chemokine signaling, and HIF-1 signaling.

DESIGN
Isolation of the gonadal cells from 67 E11.5 ICR embryos, and testicular cells from 80 newborn to P2 ICR mice (0- to 2-day-old postpartum), followed by stem cell colony formation under 5% O2 hypoxia for 7 days, and subjected to transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, CD49f+GSCs from 100 newborn to P2 ICR mice were purified and subjected to transcriptome analysis.
