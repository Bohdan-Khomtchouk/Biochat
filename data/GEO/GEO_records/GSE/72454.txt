TITLE
Gene expression in livers and thymi of uninjected or MegaFasL-injected C57BL/6 and MSM/Ms mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus domesticus

SUMMARY
Here we examine the expression of genes in unstimulated or following intraperitoneal injection with MegaFasL in MSM/Ms and C57BL/6 mouse livers and thymi

DESIGN
This dataset is from two groups of 2 mice (1 MSM/Ms [MSM] and 1 C57BL/6 [B6] mouse) - either untreated (#1-#4) or injected intraperitoneally with 1.5ug of MegaFasL (#5-#8). Each group has four (4) samples - one liver (L) and one thymus (T) sample from each mouse. The liver and thymi were harvested from the same mouse. Unstimulated samples: 1_S1 = B6 T, 2_S=MSM T, 3_S3=B6 L, 4_S4=MSM L; MegaFasL-injected samples: 5_S1=B6 T, 6_S2=MSM T, 7_S3=B6 L, 8_S4=MSM L.
