TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of murine T lymphopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we describe microRNA profiling of a single differentiation pathway from the stem cell through to terminally differentated mature cells.

DESIGN
Populations corresponding to distinct stages in T lymphocyte development, from the hematopoietic stem cell-enriched Lin-Sca+Kit+ population through to mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were FACS-sorted to purity from the bone marrow and thymus of C57BL/6 mice. Total RNA was extract from each population from which microRNA sequencing libraries were constructed.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
