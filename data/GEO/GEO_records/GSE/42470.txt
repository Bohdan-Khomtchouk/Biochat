TITLE
Agilent data from Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell tissue of ost1-2,slac 1-5, gl1-1 and landsberg erecta

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify genes of the guard cell transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell samples of ost1-2 and slac1-5 mutants were compared to their wildtype.

DESIGN
Total samples analysed are 11: biological independent replicates of: enriched guard cells (slac1-5) vs. enriched guard cells (gl1-1); enriched guard cells (ost1-2) vs. guard cells (ler);
