TITLE
Effect of selection on residual feed intake on gene expression in pig subcutaneous adipose tissue (115 kg body weight)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 24 pigs of 115 kg body weight from lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI): low-RFI pigs (RFIneg), high-RFI pigs (RFIpl) and high-RFI pigs restricted at RFIneg feeding level (RFIplR) to investigate the impact of feeding independently of selection.

DESIGN
Three conditions experiment: low-RFI (RFIneg), high-RFI (RFIpl) and restricted high-RFI (RFIplR). 8 pigs per condition. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL15007 Agilent-026440 Sus scrofa (Pig) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
