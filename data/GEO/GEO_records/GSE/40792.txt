TITLE
IM010 - Infection with A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 influenza virus of C57BL/6J mice, IDO1 KO mice or TNFRSF1B KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the host response to VN1203 infection in three different strains of mice: Wild-type C57BL/6J mice, IDO1 KO mice and TNFRSF1B KO.

DESIGN
Groups of 6-week-old mice were infected with A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 influenza virus at a dose of 10^3 PFU or mock infected. Mice were euthanized on days 2 and 6 post-infection to measure virus load and isolate samples for measurement of virus load, lung pathology, transcriptional analysis and proteomics analysis. Mock-infected animals were also harvested at each time point. Mice were weighed every 24 hours to measure general disease progression and any mouse approaching 30% weight loss was euthanized.

PLATFORM
