TITLE
Non-genotoxic Hepatocarcinogens

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
There is no accurate and well-validated short-term test for non-genotoxic carcinogens, necessitating an expensive two year rodent bioassay before a risk assessment can begin. We have developed a short-term in vivo rat assay that predicts whether non-genotoxic chemicals are likely to induce hepatic tumors based on transcript profiles in the liver. Using a large independent test set, assay accuracy was found to be superior to existing pathological and genomic markers. Comparison of the test chemical's signature profile to reference carcinogens of known mechanism can also identify a potential mode(s) of action, allowing an early assessment of human cancer risk. Guidelines for commercial use: Keywords: dose response, time course, compound treatment
