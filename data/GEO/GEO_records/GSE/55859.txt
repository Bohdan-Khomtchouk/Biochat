TITLE
Gene expression profile of TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant H460 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated H460 cells with acquired TRAIL resistance by exposing the parental sentisitve cells to subtoxic concentrations of TRAIL for 6 months. Then we compared the gene expression profile of the sensitive versus the resistant cells. We generated acquired TRAIL-resistant H460 cells from the sentisitve cells by treating subtoxic range of TRAIL for 6 month. And we tried to compare the expressional profile of the genes between two cell types to isolate genes regulating acquired TRAIL-resistance

DESIGN
H460 cells were treated with subtoxic concentrations of TRAIL for 6 month. After confirmation of the resistance, the RNA was extracted and the gene expression profile was analyzed.
