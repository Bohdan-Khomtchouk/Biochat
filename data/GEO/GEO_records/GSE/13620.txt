TITLE
Genomic hybridization of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids,  bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to AtTILE1 forward array. Study on genetic ploymorphic between arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Van-0, and set the scale of F1 hybrid intensity for SFPs.

DESIGN
Each genotype has four replicates, Single chanel. Total four genotypes (Col, Van, Van female x Col male, Col female x Van male). Total 16 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL1979 AtTile1F to Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0F
