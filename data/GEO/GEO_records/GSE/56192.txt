TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the Novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Human, MRC5 cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We will use the EMC/2012 strain of the novel beta Coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was initially passaged on Vero E6 cells in Saudi Arabia before being sequenced at the Erasmus Medical College in Rotterdam, Netherlands by Dr Ron Fouchier. We propose to perform a time course of infection of hCoV-EMC on MRC5 cells (Human Lung origin) and Vero cells (African Green Monkey Kidney cells). Both cell lines readily grow and replicate the virus. Importantly these cell lines show signs of Cytopathic effect (CPE), such as cell rounding and release from the petri dish that coincide with time points high virus replication demonstrating the effects of virus replication on the cells. Transcriptomic analysis will be performed after infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) to compare the host gene induction that occurs during infection.

DESIGN
MRC5 and Vero E6 cells will be infected at an MOI of 0.1 and 3 and RNA harvested from cells at 24 and 48 post infection. RNA will be processed for library creation and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq. Sequencing reads will be analyzed and compared across the time course and between each virus to identify common response pathways induced during infection as well as unique pathways specific to each virus.
