TITLE
Effects of acLDL loading on macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
acLDL loading of mouse peritoneal macrophage is an in vitro foam cell model. We have used microarray analysis and proteomics to characterize the effects of acLDL loading on the cells.

DESIGN
Macrophages were harvested from the peritoneum of C57Bl/6J mice 5 days after injection of thioglycolate.  Thioglycollate elicited macrophage were cultured for 2 days in DMEM + 10%FBS either in the presence or absence of 50 microgram/mL acLDL. 4 indepdendent biological replicates were used for each condition.
