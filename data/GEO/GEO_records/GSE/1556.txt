TITLE
Control vs. APPSw mice gene expressions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (Tg2576; APPSw).  The gene expression levels in male 12 month-old APPSw mice (GSM26708, GSM26709) were compared to those in male nontransgenic littermate control mice (GSM26706, GSM26707).  Data were analyzed with MAS 5.0 and scaled to 2500.
