TITLE
Expression profile for PA14 lasR rhlR double mutant with H2O2 stress

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Quorum sensing controls the expression of multiple virulence factors.  PA14 genes lasR and rhlR are necessary for quorum sensing via homoserine lactones. A PA14 lasR rhlR deficient mutant exhibits a reduced oxidative stress response.  Here we conducted a microarray to determine oxidative stress response gene regulation mediated by the homoserine lactone quorum sensing circuits.

DESIGN
A PA14 lasR rhlR deficient mutant was compared to the wild-type with and without H2O2 stress.
