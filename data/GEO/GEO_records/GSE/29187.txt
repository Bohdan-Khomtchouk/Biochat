TITLE
Impact of RAP2.12 alterations on gene expression in hypoxic and aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the effect of overexpression of an HA-tagged version of the ERF RAP2.12 on the transcriptome levels in aerobic and hypoxic-treated (O2 21% and 1%, respectively) Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. We also analyzed the effect of a RAP2.12 and RAP2.2 simultaneous silencing in aerobic and hypoxic-treated (O2 21% and 1%, respectively) Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes.

DESIGN
We treated Arabidopsis Col-0 (wt) rosettes and transgenic HA::RAP2.12 and amiRAP2.2-12 , 5-week old, grown in 8/16 light/dark photoperiod with: -Control (22°C, dark, 21% O2, 1.5h). -Hypoxia (22°C, dark, 1% O2, 1.5h).
