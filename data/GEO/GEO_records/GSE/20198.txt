TITLE
ATF3 is a positive regulator of human IFN gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes regulated by IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-alpha during early differentiation of human Th1 cells

DESIGN
Human cord blood CD4+ T cells were activated via TCR and cultured in the presence of IL-12, IFN-alpha or IL-12+IL-18. Cytokine induced gene expression was compared to activation only after 2h, 6h or 48h of cell culture. 12 samples were analyzed in total.
