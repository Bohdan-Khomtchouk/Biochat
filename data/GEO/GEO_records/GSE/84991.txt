TITLE
Expression data from human primary skeletal muscle myotubes treated with aldosterone alone or co-incubated with aldosterone plus spironolactone, eplerenone, or mifepristone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To uncover whether aldosterone induces gene expression changes through mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptors and determine if eplerenone and spironolactone could block aldosterone induced gene expression to the same extent

DESIGN
12 total samples were analyzed.  3 biological replicates for each of the following treatment groups were included: 1) aldosterone; 2) spironolactone plus aldosterone; 3) eplerenone plus aldosterone; 4) mifepristone plus aldosterone.  Pairwise comparison between groups were carried out and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
