Memory T Cell Subsets

SUMMARY
Microarray deconvolution is a technique for quantifying the relative abundance of constituent cells in a mixture based on that mixture's microarray signature and the signatures of the purified constituents.  It has been applied to yeast and other systems but not to blood samples. Here we test the ability of this technique to determine the fractions of subsets of memory T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Keywords: cell type comparison
