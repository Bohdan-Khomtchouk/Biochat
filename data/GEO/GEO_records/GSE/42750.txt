TITLE
Expression data from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to find gene signatures associated with different subgroups of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines defined by differences in detection of pro-apoptotic stress

DESIGN
RNA from cultured cell lines was isolated the same day and used for subsequent expression profiling
