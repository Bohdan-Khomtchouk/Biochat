TITLE
Gene expression variation in mediastinal (pulmonary-draining) lymph nodes of heaves-affected horses versus controls

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
We undertook gene expression microarray experiments to identify genes that are differentially expressed in heaves-affected horses versus matched controls. Mediastinal (pulmonary-draining) lymph nodes were sterilely obtained from affected and control horses, dissected, and frozen at -80oC. RNA was extracted from these tissues for downstream applications. These experiments utilized a commercially available Agilent horse array that featured > 43,000 probes on a 4x44k array format.

DESIGN
Mediastinal lymph node RNA from seven heaves-affected horses was compared to matching RNA from healthy, normal control horses.
