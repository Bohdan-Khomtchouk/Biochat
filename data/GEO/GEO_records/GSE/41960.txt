TITLE
Expression data from primary human dermal fibroblasts with STAT2 deficiency and control fibroblasts treated with interferon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human dermal fibroblasts were isolated from an individual showing a genetic defect in innate antiviral immunity associated with profound failure of type 1 interferon signaling and absence of the STAT2 protein. The transcriptional response of these cells to a 10h treatment with interferon-alpha was compared with that of control dermal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression resulting from interferon-alpha treatment in STAT 2 deficient and control fibroblasts. Primary human dermal fibroblasts were grown in the presence or absence of 1,000U/ml interferon-alpha (IFNa) for 10 hours before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
