TITLE
Infection exposure is a causal factor in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a result of Pax5 inherited susceptibility

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in tumor-bearing Pax5+/- mice

DESIGN
Tumor-bearing bone marrows of six Pax5+/- mice compared with B220+ bone marrow B cells from five WT mice and with ProB and PreB cells from three WT mice. ProB and PreB cells from three Pax5+/- mice compared with ProB and PreB cells from three WT mice.
