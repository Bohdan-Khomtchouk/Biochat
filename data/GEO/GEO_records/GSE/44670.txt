TITLE
Effect of GDF3 on NCCIT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to characterize the role of GDF3 in NCCIT cells as a model of cancer stem cells. The NCCIT cells were stimulated for 3h with (1) 100ng/mL and (2) 300ng/mL GDF3, (3) 300ng/mL Nodal and (4) 100ng/mL GDF3 + 300ng/mL Nodal and compared to unstimulated control. Additionally a stable, lentiviral knockdown of GDF3 was performed in NCCIT cells and the transciption profile of these cells was compared to cells transduced with mock-virus.
