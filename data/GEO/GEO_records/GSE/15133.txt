TITLE
Exon level expression data from the liver of adult control and Dhx32 homozygous mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the whole mRNA transcript expression from control and homozygous mutant Dhx32 mice by Affymetrix Mouse Exon ST 1.0 Array ST to identify alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts We include exon level expression data from the liver of three control and three Dhx32 homozygous mutant mice

DESIGN
6 total samples (three control and three Dhx32 homozygous mutant) were analyzed. The p values for alternatively spliced transcripts were calculated by using the algorithms of Partek Genomics Suite version 6.4, on core probes excluding probe sets with signals less than 3.
