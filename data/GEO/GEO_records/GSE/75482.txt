TITLE
microRNAs differentially regulated in organoids derived from tumors of Apc-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA expression profiles were investigated in organoids derived from tumors of Apc-deficient mice and normal intestinal epitehlia of wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Intestinal tumor organoids were established from tumors of ApcMin mice. microRNA expression profiles were analyzed by microarray in organoids derived from tumors of ApcMin mice and intestinal epitehlia of wild-type mice.
