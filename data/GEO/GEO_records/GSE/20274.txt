TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Listeria monocytogenes during growth on a RTE-meat matrix

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes strain F2365 grown in BHI agar (reference) or on a turkey deli meat (query) was examined. Aminosilane-coated cDNA microarray slide was used. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. Thirty nine and forty five genes in L. monocytogenes grown on a turkey meat matrix were upregulated and downregulated, respectively.

DESIGN
To examine the gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes grown in BHI agar or on a turkey deli meat, L. monocytogenes strains 4b F2365 aminosilane-coated cDNA microarray slide was used. Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were used for cDNA labelling. Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). Each biological replicate included a flip dye assay. TM4 package developed by TIGR was used to analyze the data.
