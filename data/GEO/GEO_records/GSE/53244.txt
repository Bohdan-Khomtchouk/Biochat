TITLE
m6a peak analysis in normal, FTO deficient and five stages of adipogenesis (D-2/0/2/5/10) in Mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted using TRI® Reagent (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized by RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit with Oligo dT primers (K1622, Fermentas) following manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR reactions were carried out on a DNAEngine® Thermal Cycler (PTC-0200G, Bio-Rad) in 25 μl reaction volume containing 1 μl cDNA, 200 nM primer pairs and components of TaKaRa Taq™ kit (R001A, Takara). All samples were analyzed in triplicate RT-qPCR.mRNAs were extracted using biotinylated poly(dT) oligo, followed by further removing of contaminated rRNA using RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation Kit (K1550-02, Invitrogen). Then mRNAs were fragmented into 100-200nt length and subjected to immunoprecipitation with m6A specific antibody.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.
