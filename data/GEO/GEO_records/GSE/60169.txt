TITLE
Inflorescence apices: rtr-2 versus wild type samples

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of inflorescence apices from wild type and rtr-2 mutant plants . Goal was to determine the differentially expressed genes between wild type and mutant plants in inflorescence apices.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, rtr-2 vs. Wild type inflorescence apices. Biological replicates: 4 wild type replicates, 4 rtr-2 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
