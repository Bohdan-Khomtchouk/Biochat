Transcriptional responses to UV irradiation in CS-B cells

SUMMARY
Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein is a member of the SWI/SNF family and has DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities.  The CSB protein is missing or altered in CS-B cells.  CS-B cells are hypersensitive to UV light and defective in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). TCR efficiently removes a variety of lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes.  It has been shown that lesions specifically in the transcribed strand of active genes trigger the induction of apoptosis following UV irradiation.  Several DNA damage signaling cascades, including the ATR/Chk1, p38 kinase, p53, and jun N-terminal kinase pathways are activated following UV irradiation.  However, the role of TCR in cellular global transcriptional responses to UV irradiation remains to be elucidated.  Using oligonucleotide microarray technology, we analyzed the time course of responses of CS-B cells (CS-B) and CS-B cells complemented with wild-type CSB cDNA (CS-B wt). Keywords: UV response, time course, disease state analysis
