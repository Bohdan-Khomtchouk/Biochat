TITLE
Recurrent 15q13 microdeletions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a recurrent microdeletion syndrome causing mental retardation, epilepsy and variable facial and digital dysmorphisms. We describe nine patients, including six probands; two with de novo deletions, two who inherited the deletion from an affected parent, and two with unknown inheritance. The proximal breakpoint of the largest deletion is contiguous with breakpoint 3 (BP3) of the Prader-Willi/Angelman region extending 3.95 Mb distally to BP5. A smaller 1.5 Mb deletion has proximal breakpoint within the larger deletion (BP4) and shares the same distal BP5. This recurrent 1.5 Mb deletion contains six genes, including a candidate gene for epilepsy (CHRNA7) that is likely responsible for the observed seizure phenotype. The BP4-BP5 region undergoes frequent inversion, suggesting a possible link between this inversion polymorphism and recurrent deletion. The frequency of these microdeletions in mental retardation cases is ~0.3% (6/2082 tested), a prevalence comparable to that of the Williams, Angelman, and Prader-Willi syndromes. Keywords: microdeletion, genomic disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy

DESIGN
Patients were intially screened by BAC array CGH (n=290) or qPCR (n=1040). Patients with potential 15q13 deletions were then analyzed on a custom oligonucleotide array targeted to the 15q13 region, results of which are shown here.
