TITLE
The mRNA and microRNA (miR) transcriptome of lung neutrophils during S. pneumoniae pneumonia in wild type (WT) mice [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies profiled the expression of mRNAs and microRNAs (miRs) in lung neutrophils in WT mice during S. pneumoniae pneumonia and performed in depth in silico analyses. Lung neutrophils were isolated 24 hours after intratracheal instillation of PBS or S. pneumoniae, and mRNAs and miRs differentially expressed (DE) between S. pneumoniae- and PBS-treated samples were identified using microarrays.

DESIGN
Lung neutrophils were isolated from WT mice 24 hours after intratracheal instillation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) or an equivalent volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  mRNA expression was profiled using Mouse Gene 1.1 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) which cover over 26,000 RefSeq transcripts.  microRNAs were profiled using SurePrint G3 Mouse miRNA 8X60K Microarray kits (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) designed based on miRbase release 17.
