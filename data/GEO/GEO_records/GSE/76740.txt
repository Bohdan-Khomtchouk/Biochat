TITLE
Abundant DNA 6mA methylation during early embryogenesis of zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
DNA N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA) is a well known prokaryotic DNA modification and has been shown to exist and play epigenetic roles in eukaryotic DNA. Here we report that 6mA accumulates up to 0.1% of total deoxyadenosine during early embryogenesis of vertebates, but diminishes with progression of the embryo development. During this process most 6mA locates in repetitive regions of the genome.

DESIGN
The antibody-based  immunoprecipitation of 6mA‑containing DNA followed by next generation high-throughput sequencing (6mA‑IP‑seq) on early embryos of zebrafish.
