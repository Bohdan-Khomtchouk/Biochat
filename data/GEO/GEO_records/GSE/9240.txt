TITLE
Therapeutic use of microRNA-181a in the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The generation of highly-reactive T lymphocytes against tumor-associated antigens remains an obstacle for effective adoptive immunotherapy of cancer. Recently, we found that microRNA-181a (miR-181a) acts as an intrinsic modulator of T cell antigen sensitivity in a transgenic T cell line in vitro. This molecule is part of a growing family of evolutionarily selected small interfering RNA that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation or translational repression. Here, we explored the use of miR-181a to improve anti-tumor T cell responsiveness against weakly immunogenic tumor-associated antigens. We found that genetic engineering of T lymphocytes with miR-181a dramatically augmented the function of poorly responsive human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and TCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes, resulting in potent anti-tumor reactivity. Furthermore, in a mouse model, miR-181a increased the function of self/tumor-specific CD8+ T cells enabling effective tumor destruction in the absence of vaccination or exogenous cytokines that were otherwise essential requirements and thus represents a significant advance over previous approaches. Although miRNAs have been previously shown to play critical functional roles in the development and function of vertebrate immune systems and pathogenesis of cancer, this report comprises the first use of a miRNA gene as tool in the treatment of disease. Keywords: cellular modification design

DESIGN
For the 6 mouse samples the Operon Array-Ready Oligo Set (AROSâ„¢) V 4.0 contains 35,852 longmer probes representing 25,000 genes and about 38,000 gene transcripts and also includes 380 controls platform was used and each sample was hybridized in duplicate. For the 6 human samples, the human cDNA microarray platform was used which consist of 17 k cDNA array included a combination from a RG_HsKG_031901 7 k clone set and 10,000 clones from the RG_Hs_seq_ver_070700 40 k clone set (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The cDNA clones include 12,072 uniquely named genes, 875 duplicates of named genes.
