ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of yeast Saccharomyces serevisiae cells exposed to stress (30 min) compared to no stress conditions (YPD) in a hot1delta mutant Two stress condition experiments, YP20 and YPS, each one compared to no-stress conditions (YPD) in a hot1delta mutant

DESIGN
Two replicates of each condition

PLATFORM
