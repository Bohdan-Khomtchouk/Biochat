TITLE
Expression data from 24 hours of Sox17 overexpression in pancreatic islets of a 16-week old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose is central for glucose homeostasis, and dysregulation of this process is a hallmark of the early stages of diabetes. We utilized a tetracycline-inducible approach to investigate the immediate impact of a pulse of Sox17 expression on the insulin secretory pathway. Sox17 gain-of-function animals (Sox17-GOF) were generated using an Ins2-rtTA mouse line and a line in which Sox17 expression is regulated by the tetracycline transactivator (tetO-Sox17).  Administering doxycycline to 16-week old mice resulted in Sox17 overexpression in mature β cells in the islets. In order to identify the molecular basis by which Sox17 regulates the secretory pathway in β cells, we performed microarray analysis on isolated islets following a 24-hour pulse of Sox17 overexpression.

DESIGN
We chose to analyze a 24 hour pulse of Sox17  for islet pancreas RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays since it was sufficient to stimulate the insulin secretory pathway without causing changes in islet architecture.
