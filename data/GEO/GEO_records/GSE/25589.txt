TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for Pediatric malignant glioma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data includes all available Affymetrix SNP data from a cohort of Pediatric malignant glioma samples, isolated from Formalin-fixed Paraffin embedded tissue. No clinical data is available.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 250K Sty SNP arrays was performed for 28 pediatric malignant gliomas. The VN algorithm was used to generate the reference signal based on 48  Mapping 500k HapMap Trio Dataset template.
