TITLE
Expression profile of Yeast Frataxin Mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast Frataxin Homologue 1 has been involved in oxidative stress and iron-sulfur biogenesis within the mitochondria. We have investigated the expression profile of conditional Yfh1 mutants. Yfh1 depletion leads to activation of iron uptake and repression

DESIGN
Two strains were used: WT (strain W303-1A) and tetYFH1 (YFH1 gene under the control of a tet promoter regulatable with doxycycline). We compared the expression profile of tetYFH1 vs tetYFH1 + 10h doxycycline. As control we also compared W303-1A vs W303-1A
