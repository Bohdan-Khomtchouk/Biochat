TITLE
DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) mutations in ICF syndrome: gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained by the coordinated action of three DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMT3B hypomorphic germline mutations are responsible for two-thirds of Immunodeficiency, Centromere Instability, Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome cases. The molecular defects in transcription, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure in ICF cells remain relatively uncharacterized. We used expressing microarrays to define the global program of gene expression to elucidate the role of DNMT3B in these processes using EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from ICF syndrome and normal individuals. Keywords: disease-state analysis
