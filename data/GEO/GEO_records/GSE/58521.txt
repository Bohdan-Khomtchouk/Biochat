TITLE
Expression data from seedligs of wild type tomato  seedlings (control) and InsP 5-ptase tansgenic line  (L7) exposed to light stress

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in tomato InsP 5-ptase transgenic lines exposed to continous light for 7 days (light stress).

DESIGN
The RNA was isolated from seedlings of wild-type (WT) and Ins P 5-ptase transgenic line 7 that were germinated on MS medium in a growth chamber with 50 umol m-2 s-1 light intencity at 12 h day-light and 12 h dark for 10 days and then exposed to continous light for 7 days. Affymetrix platform was used for expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL4741 [Tomato] Affymetrix Tomato Genome Array
