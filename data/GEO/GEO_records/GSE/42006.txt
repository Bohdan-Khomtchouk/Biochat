TITLE
Translatome of A549, H1299 and HBE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed translatome and transcriptome sequencing of A549, H1299 and HBE cells and analyzed the translation ratio (TR) of all genes

DESIGN
Total RNA and ribosome-bound RNA were extracted from A549, H1299 and HBE cells, and the polyA+ mRNA was sequenced using Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq-2000. The reads were mapped to RefSeq RNA reference sequences and the expression level were quantified by rpkM calculation.
