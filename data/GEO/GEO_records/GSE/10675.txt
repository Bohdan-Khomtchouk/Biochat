TITLE
methotrexate treatment-dynamics of Arabidopsis transcriptome during folate depletion

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea06-02_folate - methotrexate treatment - global analysis of the folate metabolism in Arabidopsis - Treatment of cells of Arabidopsis by methotrexate which is an inhibitor of the synthesis of the folate. Consequently, the pool of folates presents a strong reduction. The goal of this project is to look at the variations of expression in the Arabidopsis genome and specifically in some genes implied in the metabolism of the folate. Keywords: time course,treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
