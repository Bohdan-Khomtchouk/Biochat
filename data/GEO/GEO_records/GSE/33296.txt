TITLE
Gene expression analysis in normal and regenerating liver from lean mice and mice with diet induced obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression after sham surgery, 70% hepatectomy or 80% hepatectomy in normal mice or mice made obese through feeding of a high-fat diet.

DESIGN
Diet-induced obese (DIO) and lean control male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and maintained in our colony by feeding of the same dietary forumlation used by Jackson Labs. After several weeks of acclimation, mice were subjected to sham surgery (midline incision and liver manipulation only), 70% hepatectomy or 80% hepatectomy. Mice were euthanized under isoflurane anesthesia 6 hours later. Total RNA was isolated from snap frozen liver and subjected to Illumina gene expression analysis.
