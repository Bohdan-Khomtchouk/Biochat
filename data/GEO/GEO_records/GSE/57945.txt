TITLE
Core Ileal Transcriptome in Pediatric Crohn Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the global pattern of ileal gene expression in a cohort of 359 treatment-na√Øve pediatric Crohn Disease, Ulcerative Colitis patients and controls. We focus on genes with consistent altered expression in inflamed and unaffected ileum of CD [ileal-involved CD (iCD) and non-invloved ileal CD (cCD)], but not in the ileum of ulcerative colitis or control.

DESIGN
Ileal biopsies were obtained during diagnostic colonoscopies of children and adolescents aged less than 17 years, who presented with IBD-like symptoms. All patients underwent baseline colonoscopy and histological characterization; non-IBD controls were those with suspected IBD, but with no microscopic or macroscopic inflammation and normal radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic findings. Biopsies were stored at -80 degrees.
