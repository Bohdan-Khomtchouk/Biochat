TITLE
The microRNA expression profiles changes associated with constant heat stress in porcine skeletal muscle as measured by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To characterize the changes of miRNAs in skeletal muscle responding to heat stress, the miRNA expression profiles of longissimus dorsi muscles of pigs raised under constant heat stress (30°C, n=8) or control temperature (22 C, n=8) for 21 days were analyzed by Illumina deep sequencing. 58 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified with 30 down-regulated and 28 up-regulated and 63 differentially expressed target genes were predicted by miRNA-mRNA joint analysis. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the genes regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in glucose metabolism, cytoskeletal structure and function, and stress response. Real-time PCR showed that the mRNA levels of PDK4, HSP90 and DES were significantly increased whereas those of SCD and LDH-A significantly decreased by heat exposure. The protein levels of CALM, DES and HIF1α were also significantly increased by constant heat. These results demonstrated that the change of miRNA expression in porcine longissimus dorsi muscle underlie the changes of muscle structure and metabolism in porcine skeletal muscle affected by constant heat stress.

DESIGN
Characterize and compare expression profiling of the miRNA transcriptome in 2 groups of porcine skeletal muscle.
