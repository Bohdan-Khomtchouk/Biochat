TITLE
Dosage compensation in the mouse balances up regulation and silencing of X-linked genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dosage compensation in mammals involves silencing of one X chromosome in XX females, and requires expression, in cis, of Xist silencing RNA. Using microarray analysis to assay expression of X-linked genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that dosage compensation also involves global up-regulation of expression from the active X in both males and females. Up-regulation is complete (ie. 2-fold) only after 2-3 weeks of differentiation. X-linked gene silencing in female cells occurs on a gene-by-gene basis throughout differentiation and includes a sub-group of genes silenced prior to the onset of differentiation and independently of enhanced Xist expression. Keywords: dosage compensation, gene silencing, Xist RNA, microarray

DESIGN
TheNIA 15K cDNA library contains 15,247 cDNA clones with an average insert size of 1.5Kb, which were printed in duplicate. The data presented in the manuscript are derived from the 252 X-linked clones (180 genes) and 6945 autosomal clones (5085 genes) that both correspond to named genes and consistently gave above-background signals with ES cell cDNAs. cDNAs from female and male ES cells at the same stage of differentiation were labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 and equal amounts were co-hybridised to arrays. Each time point have between 2~5 biological replicates.
