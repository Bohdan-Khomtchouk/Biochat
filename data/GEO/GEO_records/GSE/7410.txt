TITLE
Gene expression in early stage cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of early stage cervical cancer tumours with and without lymph node metastasis, in order to predict lymph node metastasis before treatment. Subsequently, comparing gene expression profiles between healthy cervical tissue and early stage cervical cancer tissue. Keywords: Disease stage analysis
