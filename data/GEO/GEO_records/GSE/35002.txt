TITLE
Human peripheral IL-10-secreting vs non- IL-10-secreting B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human peripheral B cell subsets sorted by flow cytometry based on the secretion of IL-10 in response to CpG2006 stimulation. Goal was to identify molecular markers to distinguish IL-10-producing B cells form non-IL-10-producing B cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, non-IL-10-secreting B cells vs. IL-10-secreting B cells. Healthy donors. Biological replicates: 6
