TITLE
Mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage and digest parenchymal lung tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stromal support is critical to the achievement of lung homeostasis and the maintenance of an effective epithelial barrier, and yet previous studies have found a positive association between the number of mesenchymal stromal cell populations (MSCs) isolated from the alveolar space and human diseases associated with epithelial dysfunctional. We hypothesised that alveolar MSCs (A-MSCs) represent a dysfunctional population which would be distinct from lung tissue MSCs (LT-MSCs) and which would not be recoverable from healthy humans. In this study, we comprehensively interrogated the phenotype and transcriptome of human A-MSCs and LT-MSCs. We found that MSCs were rarely recoverable from the alveolar space in healthy humans, but were readily isolated from lung transplant recipients, where they expressed a CD90Hi, CD73Hi, CD45Neg, CD105Lo immunophenotype and were bipotent, lacking adipogenic potential. In contrast, MSCs were readily recoverable from healthy lung tissue and were CD90Hi or Lo, CD73Hi, CD45Neg, CD105Int and had full tri-lineage potential. Transcriptome profiling of the two populations confirmed their status as MSCs and revealed a high degree of similarity between each other and the archetypal bone-marrow MSC. 105 genes were differentially expressed, with genes involved in fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodelling being up-regulated in A-MSCs. Finally, we found the fibroblast markers collagen 1 and Î±-smooth muscle actin was increased in A-MSCs. Our data suggest that in healthy humans, lung MSCs reside within the tissue, but in disease can differentiate to acquire a profibrotic phenotype and so move out of their niche into the alveolar space.
