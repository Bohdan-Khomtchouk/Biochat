TITLE
Differential gene expression in ovarian cancer cell lines treated with vehicle or norepinephrine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out HeyA8 and SKOV3-ip1 ovarian cancer cell lines, treated either with vehicle control or 10 uM norepinephrine.  The primary research question is whether ovarian cancer cell gene expression differs as a function of norepinephrine exposure.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out HeyA8 and SKOV3-ip1 ovarian cancer cell lines, treated either with vehicle control or 10 uM norepinephrine.
