TITLE
Gene expression changes in Sebacina vermifera- Arabidopsis thaliana mycorrhizal roots compared to Sebacina vermifera free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Serendipita vermifera

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Sebacina vermifera mycorrhizal roots compared to free-living mycelium . Mycorrhizal roots  were harvested after 3, 7 and 14 days, pooled and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Sebacina vermifera ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Sebve1/Sebve1.home.html ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Sebacina vermifera mycorrhizal roots and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
