TITLE
Immunophenotypic and detailed cytogenetic characterization of cell lines derived from myelodysplastic syndrome patients after progression to acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cultured cells. Five cell lines (MOLM-13, SKM-1, F-36P, SKK-1 and OHN-GM) derived from myelodysplastic syndrome patients after progression to acute myeloid leukemia have been studied by flow cytometry, conventional cytogenetics and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, in order to deeply characterize.

DESIGN
SNP-A (Cytoscan 750K) from 5 cell lines
