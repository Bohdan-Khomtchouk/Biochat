TITLE
Expression profiling of fission yeast strains: wild-type, erh1∆, and ccr4∆

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We report gene expression profiling in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from wild-type, erh1∆, and ccr4∆ strains. We find that many meiotic gene containing degradation sequence DSR are expressed in vegetative erh1∆, while these meiotic mRNAs do not increase in ccr4∆, indicating that Erh1 and Ccr4 target different set of genes during vegetative growth.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing in wild-type, erh1∆ and ccr4∆ strains. Two biological replicates for erh1∆ and ccr4∆, and one sample for wild-type because we already reported wild-type data previously.
