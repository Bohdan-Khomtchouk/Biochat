TITLE
Identification of Exosome-Like Nanoparticle Derived MicroRNAs from Eleven Edible Plants

ORGANISM
Actinidia chinensis ; Cucumis melo ; Pyrus ; Glycine max ; Pisum sativum ; Solanum lycopersicum ; Vaccinium ; Cocos nucifera ; Citrus x paradisi ; Citrus reticulata ; Zingiber officinale

SUMMARY
In this study,we found that the highly expressed miRNAs appear to  miRNAs in EPDELNs have the potential to regulate human mRNA in a cross-kingdom manner. Target prediction and functional analysis revealed that highly expressed miRNAs were closely associated with inflammatory responses and cancer-related pathways.Therefore, we hypothesized that miRNAs in EPDELNs may be a crucial factor behind the regulatory function of EPDELNs.

DESIGN
We investigated miRNA expression profiles from 11 EPDELNs (Blueberry; Coconut; Ginger; Grapefruit; Hami melon; Kiwi; Orange; Pea; Pear; Soybean; Tomato) by using high-throughput sequencing technology.
