TITLE
Distinctive gene expression patterns in gastrointestinal stromal tumors identified with cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are phenotypically and clinically heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors. Using the cDNA array technique, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of 22 GIST and 7 non-neoplastic gastrointestinal smooth muscle specimens, in order to detect molecular differences between GIST and non-neoplastic tissue, and to detect differences between GIST of various phenotypic and clinical subgroups. As a result, we found 796 differentially expressed genes and ESTs between GIST and smooth muscle tissue, including promising new candidate genes for the pathogenesis of GIST. Furthermore, we identified differences in gene expression between GIST of different site, size, and immunohistochemical expression of CD34 and SMA. Our data show that alterations in gene expression are associated with morphologically and clinically detectable features of GIST and provide new aspects for the understanding of these tumors.
