TITLE
Expression profile of ypr045c∆ mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report a new protein complex with a role in transcription elongation that is formed by Ypr045c (Thp3) and the Csn12 component of the COP9-signalosome. Thp3-Csn12 is recruited to transcribed genes. Their mutations suppress the gene expression defects of mutants of the THO complex involved in mRNP biogenesis and export and show defects in mRNA accumulation. In vivo transcription elongation impairment of thp3∆ mutants is shown by reduction of RNAPII recruitment throughout an active gene and in transcript run on analysis performed in G-less systems. This new complex establishes a novel link between transcription and mRNA processing.

DESIGN
Tthree repeats of the wild type control and three of the ypr045c∆ mutant (BY4741 background).
