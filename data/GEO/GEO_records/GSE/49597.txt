TITLE
Global gene expression in rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae treated with a natural rice soil isolate

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae 70-15

SUMMARY
M. oryzae 70-15 was treated with multiple bacteria which inhibit 70-15's growth.  The bacterial treatments were EA105, a pseudomonad naturally isolated from rice soil, as well as P. fluorescens biocontrol strain CHAO and the cyanide non-producing mutant of CHAO, CHA77.

DESIGN
On a standard petri dish with solid complete medium, a 5 mm plug of M. oryzae 70-15 was placed 4 cm from a 5 uL droplet of bacteria (1 X 10 ^ 6 cells per mL)

PLATFORM
GPL9201 Agilent-015060 Magnaporthe grisea 2.0 4 X 44K (Feature Number version)
