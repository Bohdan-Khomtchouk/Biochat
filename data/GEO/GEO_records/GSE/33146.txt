TITLE
Expression data from DKAT breast cancer cell line pre- and post-EMT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DKAT cell line is a novel model of triple-negative breast cancer that was isolated from the pleural effusion of a 35 year-old caucasian woman with triple-negative breast cancer. When cultured in serum-free media (MEGM, Lonza) this cell line exhibits an epithelial morphology and gene expression pattern. However, when cultured in the presence of serum (SCGM, Lonza) it undergoes a reversible EMT. We used microarrays to look at gene expression changes in the DKAT cell line when cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Media (MEGM, where DKAT cells have an epithelial morphology) vs Stromal Cell Growth Media (SCGM, where DKAT cells have a mesenchymal morphology).

DESIGN
DKAT breast cancer cells (passage 10) grown in MEGM (Lonza) were split and cultured in T75 flasks in either in MEGM or SCGM for 14 days. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed. Three separate cDNA reactions were performed and these were run as technical replicates.
