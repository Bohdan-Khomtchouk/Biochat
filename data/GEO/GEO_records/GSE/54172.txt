TITLE
RNA expression data from kidneys lacking von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein in tubular epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cellular response to low oxygen supply is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF is stabilized and target genes are induced. Under normoxia, however, HIF is ubiquitinated through the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), which results in proteasomal degradation. HIF activation leads to induction of genes involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Furthermore, HIF orchestrates a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis to facilitate ATP production under low oxygen conditions. We used microarrays to detail gene expression changes in kidneys with stable HIF activation in renal tubules, which was achieved by tubule-specific VHL ablation.

DESIGN
Three week old Pax8-rtTA;LC-1;Vhl-floxed mice (n=4) and control littermates (n=4) were treated with doxycyline in drinking water for two weeks and put back on normal drinking water for one week. Six weeks old mice were sacrificed and kidneys harvested. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
