TITLE
The tetraspanin CD9 affords high purity capture of all murine hematopoietic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prospective isolation is critical to understand the cellular and molecular aspects of stem cell heterogeneity. Here we identify the cell surface antigen CD9 as a novel positive marker that provides a simple alternative for hematopoietic stem cell-isolation at high purity

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of LT and ST HSCs

PLATFORM
