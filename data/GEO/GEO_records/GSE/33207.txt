TITLE
Identification of SOX2-bound mRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro pull down assay was performed using recombinant GST and GST fusion SOX2 protein to precipitate total RNA from urothelial carcinoma cell line BFTC905 Unbound RNA from both reactions and matrix-associated RNA from SOX2 pull down reaction was extracted using TRIZOL reagent

DESIGN
This experiment is to identify mRNA bound by SOX2 under in vitro experimental condition
