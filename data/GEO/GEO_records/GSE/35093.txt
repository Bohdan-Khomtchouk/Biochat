TITLE
The effect of TGF-beta in Apc-mutated mouse intestinal organoids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intestinal crypts isolated from Apcflox/flox; villin-CreERT mice were treated with Tamoxifen to induce the deletion of Apc. Tamoxifen-treated organoids were selected in the absence of Wnt agonists and then treated with TGF-beta.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Tamoxifen-treated, Apc-deleted intestinal organoids in the absence or presence of 3 ng/ml TGF-beta (18h).
