TITLE
The effect of SUZ12 knockdown on the responsivness of IFNg Stimulated Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the effect of knowking down SUZ12 +/- knowckdown of BRM on the responsivness of IFNg stimulated genes. Cells were transfected with siSZU12+/-siBRM or control siRNA+/-siBRM. Cells were then left untreated or exposed to IFNg for 6 hours. Total RNA was collected and analyzed with Illumina arrays.

DESIGN
SW13 cells were transfected with siSUZ12+/-siBRM or control siRNA+/-siBRM. Cells were left untreated or exposed to IFNg for 6 hours.
