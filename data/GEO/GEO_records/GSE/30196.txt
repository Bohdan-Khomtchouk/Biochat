TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in mouse CD4 naïve and activated T-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes when naïve T-cells are stimulated with antigen. We have stimulated these cells with surrogate antigens (aCD3-aCD28 coated beads) for 48 hours, and then did microarray experiment to identify differentially exprssed genes in the two conditions

DESIGN
CD4 naïve T-cells from C57/Bl6 mouse were stimulated (activated) with aCD3-aCD28 coated beads for 48 hours and used for microarray experiment
