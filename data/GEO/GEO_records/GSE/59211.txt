TITLE
Mouse Liver: Tumors vs livers with transgene turned off for 4 weeks vs livers with transgene turned off for 12 weeks vs Normal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional Profiling of mouse liver tissues comparing normal tissues, livers arising from transgene expression after hepatocy transplantation using the comparative hepatocyte growth assay, and livers with transgene turned off for 4 and 12 weeks. Experimental groups: Control normal liver; Endstage liver tumors, livers with transgene turned off for 4 weeks, and livers with transgene turned off for 12 weeks.

DESIGN
Ten Condition Experiment: ES vs Control, 4wks vs ES, 12wks vs ES; Control normal liver (3 replicate); Endstage(ES) liver tumors, 3 groups(c-Myc (7), TGFa (3), TGFa and c-Myc(3)); livers with transgene turned off for 4 weeks, 3 groups (c-Myc (3), TGFa (3), TGFa and c-Myc(3)); and livers with transgene turned off for 12 weeks, 3 groups (c-Myc (3), TGFa (3), TGFa and c-Myc(3)).

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
