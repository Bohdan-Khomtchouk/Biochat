TITLE
Gene expression profiles in sigmoid colon biopsies from healthy and patients with ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were performed to compare the difference in sigmoid colon biopsies between from healthy control and patients with ulcerative colitis. Keywords: disease signature

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated sigmoid biopdy from 5 healthy and 6 UC patients. Pooled 5 ug total RNA equally for each group was used and followed the Affymetrix standard protocol for microarray.
