TITLE
Effect of live Mycobacterium leprae on primary human Schwann cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In attempt to understand M.leprae interaction with the human host, Applied Biosystems microarrays containing 30,865 probles were used to identify modulated genes in primary human Schwann Cells (SC) infected with live M. leprae at two early time points, 24 and 48 hours.

DESIGN
A total of 4 independent experimental samples were prepared which were hybridized to two replicate microarrays each.The four experimental samples included both uninfected and M. leprae infected Schwann cells at both 24 and 48 hours.
