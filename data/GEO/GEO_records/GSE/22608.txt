TITLE
Changes in Hepatic Gene Expression upon Oral Administration of Taurine-Conjugated Ursodeoxycholic Acid in ob/ob Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the effect of oral TUDCA treatment on hepatic steatosis and associated changes in hepatic gene expression in ob/ob mice.

DESIGN
We administered TUDCA to ob/ob mice at a dose of 500 mg/kg twice a day by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and hepatic gene expression were examined in comparison with control ob/ob mice and normal littermate C57BL/6J mice.
