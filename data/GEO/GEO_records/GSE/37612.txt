TITLE
Effect of small molecules on activated BV2 microglia cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed an assay to test the neuroprotective properties of compounds using stem cell–derived motor neurons and astrocytes, together with activated microglia as a stress paradigm. Hit compounds were discovered and the transcriptional response on activated BV2 cells was tested.

DESIGN
The BV2 cell line was activated with LPS and IFN-γ and treated with hit compound for 4 hr.
