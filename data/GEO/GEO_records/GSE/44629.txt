TITLE
Expression analysis of HFF cells in S phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide expression in S phase was assessed by using TileShuffle (Otto C, Reiche K, Hackerm√ºller J. " Detection of differentially expressed segments in tiling array data " . Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1471-9. Epub 2012 Apr 6.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
