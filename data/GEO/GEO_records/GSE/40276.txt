TITLE
Gene profiling data of CD4+ T cells transduced with FOXP3 and GATA1, then sorted into different fractions, based on the expression of Thy1.1 (FOXP3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor FoxP3 partakes dominantly in the specification and function of FoxP3+ CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), but is neither strictly necessary nor sufficient to determine the characteristic Treg transcriptional signature. Computational network inference and experimental testing assessed the contribution of several other transcription factors (TFs). Enforced expression of Helios or Xbp1 elicited specific signatures, but Eos, Irf4, Satb1, Lef1 and Gata1 elicited exactly the same outcome, synergizing with FoxP3 to activate most of the Treg signature, including key TFs, and enhancing FoxP3 occupancy at its genomic targets. Conversely, the Treg signature was robust to inactivation of any single cofactor. A redundant genetic switch thus locks-in the Treg phenotype, a model which accounts for several aspects of Treg physiology, differentiation and stability.

DESIGN
To study the impact of FOXP3 alone or together with GATA1 on the expression of the Treg transcriptional signature, we sorted and profiled matched bins of FOXP3-transduced cells bearing various levels of FOXP3, alone or co-transduced with GATA1, chosen as a representative of the quintet factors.
