TITLE
Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC comparative genomics with L. iatae

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus gasseri ; Lactobacillus johnsonii ; Lactobacillus iatae

SUMMARY
Whole genome DNA microarray designed for the probiotic L. johnsonii strain NCC533 was used for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of L. johnsonii ATCC 33200T, L. johnsonii BL261, L. gasseri ATCC 33323T and L. iatae BL263 (CECT 7394T). In these experiments, the fluorescence ratio distributions obtained with L. iatae and L. gasseri showed characteristic inter-species profiles. The percentage of conserved L. johnsonii NCC533 genes was about 83% in the L. johnsonii strains comparisons and decreased to 51% and 47% for L. iatae and L. gasseri, respectively. These results confirmed the separate status of L. iatae from L. johnsonii at the level of species, and also that it is closer to L. johnsonii than L. gasseri.

DESIGN
L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, and L. iatae strains were hybridized versus L. johnsonii NCC533, some with replicates
