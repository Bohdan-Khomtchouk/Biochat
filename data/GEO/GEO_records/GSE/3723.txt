TITLE
HTC avian macrophage cells stimulated with 3 species of Eimeria across a 48 hour timecourse

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
HTC avain macrophage cell line was stimulated with E. tenella, acervulina, and maxima for 0, 4, 18, and 48 hours.  Total RNA was extracted, mRNA was purified, and RNA samples were directly labeled with Alexa555 or 647.  The experiment was performed in loop format, so that each sample was labeled with both dyes and hybridized to two different slides.  Images were acquired by the Applied Precision ArrayWoRx scanner and software and then intensity values were obtained using Softworx Tracker. Keywords: timecurse, species comparison
