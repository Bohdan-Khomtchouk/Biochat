SUMMARY
Genome wide patterns of histone modifications in fission yeast Keywords: High resolution maps of nucleosome modifications

DESIGN
We have used oligonucleotide tiling arrays to construct genome-wide high-resolution histone acetylation maps for fission yeast. The maps are corrected for nucleosome density and reveal surprisingly uniform patterns of modifications for five different histone acetylation sites. We found that histone acetylation and methylation patterns are generally polar, i.e. they change as a function of distance from the ATG codon. A typical fission yeast gene shows a distinct peak of histone acetylation around the ATG and gradually decreased acetylation levels in the coding region. The patterns are independent of gene length but dependent on the gene expression levels. H3K9Ac shows a stronger peak near the ATG and is more reduced in the coding regions of genes with high expression compared with genes with low expression levels. H4K16Ac is strongly reduced in coding regions of highly expressed genes. A second microarray platform was used to confirm the 5’ to 3’ polarity effects observed with tiling microarrays. By comparing coding region histone acetylation data in HDAC mutants and wild type, we found that hos2 affects primarily the 5’ regions, sir2 and clr6 affect middle regions, and clr6 affects 3’ regions. Thus, mechanisms involving different HDACs modulate histone acetylation levels to maintain a 5’ to 3’ polarity within the coding regions.
