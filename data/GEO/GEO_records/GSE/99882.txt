TITLE
Identification of LEC1 binding sites in soybean embryos at 3 developmental stages

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), an atypical subunit of the NF-Y CCAAT binding transcription factor, is a central regulator that controls many aspects of seed development including the maturation phase during which seeds accumulate storage macromolecules and embryos acquire the ability to withstand desiccation.    To define the gene network and developmental processes controlled by LEC1, genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were identified.   In order to identify the genes bound by LEC1 in soybean embryos, we used two antibodies specific for soybean LEC1 (GmLEC1) and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using chromatin isolated from soybean embryos at the cotyledon, early maturation and mid-maturation stages.

DESIGN
Identification of LEC1 binding sites in soybean embryos at 3 developmental stages (cotyledon, early maturation and mid-maturation), using two distinct antibodies directed against soybean LEC1 (GmLEC1). ChIP and total chromatin controls (input) were obtained for two biological replicates for each stage/antibody combinations.  A total of 16 samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL15008 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Glycine max)
