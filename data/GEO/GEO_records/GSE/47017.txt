TITLE
MeDIP-Chip of PrEC, LnCAP, and PC3 cells treated with vehicle control, sulforaphane, or 3,3’-diindolylmethane

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effects of sulforaphane and 3,3’-diindolylmethane on genome-wide promoter methylation in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells This study was undertaken to determine the genome-wide effects of sulforaphane (SFN) and 3,3’-diindolylmethane (DIM) on promoter methylation in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells.  Nimblegen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array was used in this study. We hypothesize that both SFN and DIM are effective dietary modulators of DNA methylation due to their inhibitory effects on DNMT expression, and that SFN and DIM can differentially affect the promoter methylation profiles in normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cells (LnCAP) and androgen-independent prostate cancer epithelial cells (PC3) were treated with vehicle control, 15uM SFN, or 15uM DIM for 48h in triplicates
