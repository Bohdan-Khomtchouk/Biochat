TITLE
ssDNA in S phase compared to G1 phase at different timepoints

ORGANISM
Lachancea waltii

SUMMARY
To identify origins of replication in Lachancea waltii by mapping regions of ssDNA that are enriched in S phase.

DESIGN
L. waltii cells are grown in the presence of hydroxyurea, which slows replication forks and causes the accumulation of ssDNA at the replication fork.
