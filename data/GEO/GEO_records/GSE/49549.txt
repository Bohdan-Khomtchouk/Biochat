TITLE
Fitness of natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains [Expression]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To characterize the ecological interactions among S. cerevisiae strains coming from the same geographical area, we examined the fitness of two natural isolates from San Giovese grapes, alone or in competition, in synthetic wine must (SWM). We performed genome-wide analyses in order to identify the genes involved in yeast competition and cooperation.

DESIGN
2 samples and 4 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9294 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
