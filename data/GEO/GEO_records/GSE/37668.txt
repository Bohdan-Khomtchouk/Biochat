TITLE
Time-varying expression data from WI38 cell lines that were exposed to a challenge dose with or without a priming dose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to elucidate temporal activities and biological processes that can be inferred in response to a 200cGy challenging dose with or without a 10 cGy priming dose in embryonic human fibroblasts

DESIGN
The experiment is designed around the human diploid embryonic lung fibroblast cell line WI38 (TP53 proficient), which was grown as a monolayer (2D) under physiological cell culture conditions (3% O2; 10% CO2). Cells are exposed to 2Gy (e.g., the challenge dose) of ionizing radiation (160 kV X-rays) with or without a priming dose of 10cGy (e.g., the adaptive dose)  4 hours prior to the challenge dose. Three biological replicates for each treatment group (e.g., with and without the priming dose) were collected 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours after the challenge dose. The time course was selected on the basis of our prior research on early response to ionizing radiation [1,2]. Purified total cellular RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified for Affymetrix microarray analysis using Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. Robust multi-array analysis (RMA) was performed to normalize data collected from the different samples. Samples were examined for quality control using the NUSE protocol.
