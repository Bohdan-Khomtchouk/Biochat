TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of prostatic tissue gene expression from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in prostatic tissue from BPH patients with and without SRD5A2 gene methylation. The hypothesis is that BPH patients with DNA methylation of the SRD5A2 gene promoter have impaired conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and therefore may use an alternative signaling pathway for prostatic tissue growth. Here, we compare gene expression profiles of SRD5A2-methylated vs. unmethylated prostatic tissue to nominate alternative biological pathways relevant in each molecular subtype of BPH.

DESIGN
22 unique patient samples were analyzed (12 SRD5A2-methylated, 10 SRD5A2-unmethylated). All samples were transitional zone prostatic tissue obtained during transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) surgery.
