TITLE
mRNA profiles of four developmentally related hematopoietic cell types (LSK, L-S-K+, Gr1+ and Ter119+) isolated from the BM of B6 and D2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The combination of valproic acid and lithium delays hematopoietic stem\progenitor differentiation

DESIGN
Microarray-based microRNA profiling study was peformed of four developmentally related hematopoietic cell types isolated from the BM of B6 and D2 mice. Total RNA isolated from purified LSK multilineage cells, committed LSâˆ’K+ cells, erythroid TER-119+ cells and myeloid Gr-1+ cells was hybridized to Single Color Illumina mouse WG-6_V2 mRNA arrays. Triplicates were generated for each of the 8 conditions (4 cell types, 2 mouse strains).
