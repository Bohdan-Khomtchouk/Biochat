TITLE
Effects of dietary forage and calf starter on ruminal pH and transcriptomic adaptation of the rumen epithelium in Holstein calves during the weaning transition

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We assessed the transcriptomic adaptation of the calf rumen epithelium to changes in ruminal pH caused by feeding calf starter with and without forage during weaning transition.

DESIGN
The calves were divided into a gorage provision group (HAY group, n = 3) and forage non-provision group (CON group, n = 4) 3 weeks after weaning.
