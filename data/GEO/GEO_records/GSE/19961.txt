TITLE
Gene Expression Profile in kidneys from Cldn16 +/+, +/-, -/- female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Claudin-16 deficiency leads to renal salt wasting in humans and mice. Analysis of renal gene expression in Claudin-16 deficient mice, compared to heterozygous and wild type littermates, was performed to gain insights into molecular mechanisms compensating salt loss. Our results indicate the upregulation of known and putative genes for renal transcellular transporters. Furthermore, we could identify a transcript so far not associated with renal salt metabolism, which will provide a first link to a human electrolyte disorder disease.

DESIGN
Female Cldn16 +/+, +/-, -/- mice were sacrificed at the age of 8 weeks for kidney dissection, removal of kidney poles and preparation of total RNA for expression analysis.
