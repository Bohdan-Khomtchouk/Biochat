TITLE
Identification of target genes of ABI3 [Agilent 2x244k]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ABI3 is a key regulator of seed development in Arabidopsis and other plants.To identify DNA fragments(promoters) bound by ABI3 we performed array based ChIP analysis.

DESIGN
Two ChIP experiments were performed with chromatin of seeds of Arabidopsis and an anti-ABI3 antibody directed against a N-terminal fragment of ABI3, raised in rabbits. Non precipitated chromatin (input) served as control.
