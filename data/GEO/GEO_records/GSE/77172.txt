TITLE
The effect of IL-17A on osteoblastogenesis of PαS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to elucidate the effects of inflammation on bone metabolism. As we found IL-17A is induced immediately after bone injury and Il17a−/− mice showed delayed healing, we analyzed the effects of IL-17A on mesenchymal cells in the repair tissue. Most of the IL-17RA+ cells were PαS cells. We collected these cells and analyzed their response to IL-17A by RNA sequencing. This analysis will provide a mechanistic insight into the mechanism of how IL-17A promote bone formation in the context of bone fracture healing.

DESIGN
PαS cells were harvested from the injury tissue of wild-type mice and cultured with or without IL-17A or BMP-2. RNAs were harvested at day 7.
