TITLE
Prospective gene expression analysis of  human RNA samples from Hepatocellular Carcinoma in relation with growth rate and survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify  by  whole genome microarray  expression profiling a molecular  signature of HCC samples that correlates with growth rate of the tumor and survival. This signature could eventually be used as prognostic marker. The samples were prospectively derived from hepatocellular carcinoma tissue as well as non-tumor tissue from the livers of the same patients.  Expression of five genes (ANGPT2, NETO2,NR4A1,DLL4,ESM1) from this signature was re-evaluated in  a validation cohort by real-time PCR, confirming its correlation with growth rate and survival.

DESIGN
The bioinformatical analysis of 161 microarray datasets were obtained from single color hybridization of human RNAs on Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays after T7 RNA  amplification. For the purpose of this study, two discriminatory gene sets analysis were performed: up-regulated and down regulated in fast-growing tumors. For the discrimination between fast- and slow-growing tumors, the fastest quartile of the growth rate spectrum was compared with the three other quartiles. For a gene to be included, a significant discrimination (uncorrected p-value < 0.01) and a 2-fold expression difference was required.
