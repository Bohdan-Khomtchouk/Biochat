TITLE
Regulation of intestinal epithelial cells transcriptome by enteric glial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of cellular functions and signalling pathways of intestinal epithelial cells modulated by enteric glial cells Keywords: Transcriptome regulation

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment (intestinal epithelial cells cultured in absence or in presence of enteric glial cells) with 3 time points (t=0, 8 and 24h). 4 Biological replicates/condition. Every replicate was hybridized against a reference pool composed by a mix of the 4 replicates of t=0 condition in equal quantity.
