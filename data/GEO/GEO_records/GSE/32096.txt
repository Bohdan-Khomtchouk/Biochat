TITLE
Gene expression in Rspo2 and/or Wnt3a treated C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
R-spondins (Rspos) comprise a family of four secreted proteins that have important roles in cell proliferation, cell fate determination and organogenesis.  Rspos typically exert their effects by potentiating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. To systematically investigate the impact of Rspo/Wnt on gene expression, we performed a microarray analysis using C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cells treated with recombinant Rspo2 and/or Wnt3a.

DESIGN
This study compares gene expression in C57MG cells after 24h treatment with recombinant Rspo2 and recombinant Wnt3a alone or in combination versus BSA treatment. Control cells were treated with BSA, since it was used as carrier for the recombinant proteins. Each treatment was done in biological triplicate.
