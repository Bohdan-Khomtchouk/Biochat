TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiles of dental follicleand and papilla tissues at E17 and PN2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the differences in dental follicle and papilla tissues of mouse first lower molar between E17 and PN2 at the molecular level by combinational use of laser microdissection and microarray. Two-condition experiment

DESIGN
Differentially expressed genes that either up-regulated or down-regulated by over 2-fold between E17 and PN2 group  in dental follicle and papilla tissues were compared.
