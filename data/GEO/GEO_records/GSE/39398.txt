TITLE
smRNAs generated by single-stranded and double-stranded silencers

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate possible smRNAs linked to TMM silencing by single-stranded and double-stranded silencers, we determined sequences of smRNAs by the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform and compared silencing efficiency of different strategies. We found that single-stranded silencer alone could promote the production of smRNAs.

DESIGN
smRNA profiles of 2-week-old wide type seedlings (WT) and different silencers were generated by Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx.
