TITLE
Expression in dissected larval tissues including gut, salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, and the remaining cascade

ORGANISM
Mayetiola destructor

SUMMARY
Genes expressed in the salivary glands and gut of Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae are likely involved in interactions with host plants.

DESIGN
Hessian fly larval tissues were derived from three day old larvae that were cultured on susceptible cultivar Newton. Each tissue sample contained 200 individuals dissected from the same stage of insects. The same type of dissected tissues were pooled and total RNA was extracted from development of microarray probes.
