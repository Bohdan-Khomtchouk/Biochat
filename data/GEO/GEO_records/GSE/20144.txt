TITLE
aCGH profiles of parental and oxaliplatin resistant colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxaliplatin resistance was induced in 2 colorectal cancer cell lines (LoVo-92, wt-p53 and LoVo-Li, functionally inactive p53) and one ovarian cancer cell line (A2780, wt-p53). Resistance was induced by weekly exposure to oxaliplatin for 4 hrs or 72 hrs with increasing concentrations for a period of 7 months

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of oxaliplatin and cisplatin resistant colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines as well as the parental cell lines were labeled and subsequently hybridized against pooled reference DNA of healthy volunteers of the opposite gender using across array hybridization. Extracted raw-data were normalised and smoothend using the R-script NOWAVE resulting in normalised log2 ratio profiles of resistant cell line versus parental cell line and parental cell line versus reference DNA.
