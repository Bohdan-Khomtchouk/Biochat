TITLE
Differentially regulated genes induced by in vitro generated Mycobacterium smegmatis cell wall deficient form

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of chemically generated Mycobacterium smegmatis cell wall deficient forms, comparing untreated control cells (bacillary forms) and cell wall deficient cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MSMEG-K vs. MSMEG-Sph cells. Biological replicates: 3 controls, 3 spheroplasts, independently grown and harvested. In controls and spheroplasts, good quality RNA samples obtained from each pellet were pooled together and used for microarray experiments to get an average of three separate experiments, Three replicates per array.
