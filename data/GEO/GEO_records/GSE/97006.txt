TITLE
Expression data from Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 wild-type and Bmul_2557 (ldhR) gene deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Burkholderia multivorans

SUMMARY
Within this work we identified and characterized gene Bmul_2557 (ldhR) of B. multivorans ATCC 17616, a bacterial species associated with chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. LdhR belongs to the LysR-type family of transcriptional regulators and its deletion from the B. multivorans genome affected considerably the formation of planktonic cellular aggregates and surface-attached biofilms.

DESIGN
For expression profiling, triplicates of the wild-type Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 and the Bmul_2557 (delta ldhR) deletion mutant were grown in S liquid medium supplemented with 20 g/l of D-glucose for 22 hours at 37ÂºC and 200 rpm, followed by total RNA extraction. The wild-type strain was additionally grown in S liquid medium supplemented with 20 g/l of D-mannitol (SM medium) under the same incubation  and RNA extraction conditions.
