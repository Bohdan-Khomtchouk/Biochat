TITLE
Ribosomal footprinting of MDA_Ctrl and MDA_Arg overexpression cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Illlumina Artseq Ribo Profile to perform ribosome footprinting on the above cell lines

DESIGN
We followed the manufacturer's protocol: Cells were treated with cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) to inhibit translation; total RNA(tt) and ribosome-protected RNA fragments (RPF) were isolated and library preped for sequencing simultaneously.

PLATFORM
