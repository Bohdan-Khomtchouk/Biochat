TITLE
E. coli K12 Bw25113/pCA24N-hha with 2 mM IPTG vs BW25113/pCA24N with 2 mM IPTG

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
gene expression profiles by overexpressing Hha from pCA24N-hha using 2 mM IPTG induction in BW25113 wild type suspension cells in LB medium at 37C relative to BW25113 carrying the empty vector plasmid in the same test conditions. Keywords: overexpression, gene expression profiles

DESIGN
Strains: E. coli K12 BW25113/pCA24N, BW25113/pCA24N-hha Growth conditions: grow culture in LB medium at 37C to OD600 0.1 and add 2 mM IPTG to induce, and grow to OD600 0.5 to collect cells. RNA was extraction, and gene expression profiles were evaluated.
