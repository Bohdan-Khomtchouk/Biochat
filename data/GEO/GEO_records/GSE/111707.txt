TITLE
Expression data in subcutaneous xenografts of Huh7 cells overexpressing or not insulin receptor isoform A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma. We used microarrays to investigate gene expression patterns in subcutaneous xenografts derived from Huh7 stably overexpressing IR-A

DESIGN
Huh7 cells were stably transfected with the expression plasmid pRcCMVi.hIR-A(GFP) or the empty vector and selected for G418 resistance and GFP expression by cytometry. 2 x 106 cells were then sc injected to nude mice. Tumors (Control (n=3) and  IR-A overexpressing (n=3)) were harvested and RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
