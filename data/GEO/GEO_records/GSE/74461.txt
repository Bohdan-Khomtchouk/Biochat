TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Quantitative Analysis of steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA1) Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The steroid receptor RNA activator gene (SRA1) produces both a functional RNA (SRA) and a protein (SRAP), whose exact roles remain unknown. To identify cellular processes regulated by this unusual bi-faceted system, we characterized the transcriptome of two differenct cell lines upon depletion of these molecules.

DESIGN
Two differenct cell lines including breast cancer MBD-MDA-231 and cervical cancer Hela cells upon SRA1 depletion and SRAP overexpression
