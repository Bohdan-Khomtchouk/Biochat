TITLE
The identification and tumorigenecity of neuronal progenitors in developing cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is generally believed that cerebellar granule neurons originate exclusively from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in the external germinal layer (EGL). Here we identify a rare population of neuronal progenitors in the developing cerebellum that expresses Nestin. Although Nestin is widely considered a marker for multipotent stem cells, these Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) are committed to the granule neuron lineage. Unlike conventional GNPs, which reside in the outer EGL and proliferate extensively, NEPs reside in the deep part of the EGL and are quiescent. Expression profiling reveals that NEPs are distinct from GNPs, and in particular, express markedly reduced levels of genes associated with DNA repair. Consistent with this, upon aberrant activation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, NEPs exhibit more severe genomic instability and give rise to tumors more efficiently than GNPs. These studies identify a novel progenitor for cerebellar granule neurons and a novel cell of origin for medulloblastoma.

DESIGN
4 samples of Nestin expressing progenitors (NEPs), 4 samples of Math1 positive cells (GNPs) and 3 samples of Neural stem cells (CD133+ NSCs) were used for microarray analysis to determine the distinct genetic profile of NEPs. 4 samples of NEP-derived tumor and 4 samples of GNP-derived tumor were used to determine the similarity of those tumors by microarray analysis.
