TITLE
University of Washington Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium aims to produce a public resource of epigenomic maps for stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease. Study of chromatin accessibility and expression using exon arrays. **************** For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nih-common-fund/epigenomics-data-access-policies ****************

DESIGN
University of Washington Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project - samples and experiments will continue to be added to this study over the course of the project.
