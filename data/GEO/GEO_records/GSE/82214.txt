TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression for SAEC after treatment with demethylatiog agent (5-aza-dC) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess transcriptional regulation by DNA demethylation in SAEC, we carried out a microarray analysis of SAEC treated with a demethylating agent (5-aza-dC) and a HDAC inhibitor (TSA). We used the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v3 microarray which contains probes for 26,083 Entrez genes and 30,606 lncRNAs.

DESIGN
SAECs were treated with 3 μg/ml of 5-aza-dC on day1, 3 and 1 μg/ml of TSA on day4. Total RNA was extracted on day5, and microarray analysis was carried out using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v3.
