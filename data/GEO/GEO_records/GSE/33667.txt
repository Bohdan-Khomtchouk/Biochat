TITLE
Avian 12th motor neuron

ORGANISM
Calypte anna ; Melopsittacus undulatus ; Taeniopygia guttata ; Coturnix japonica ; Streptopelia risoria

SUMMARY
To determine what kind of genes are involved in vocal learning ability, we performed microarray experiments using 3 vocal learning species (zebra finch, budgerigar, Anna's hummingbird) and 2 non-vocal learning species(ring dive, and Japanese quail) from the bird group. All of the animals are male adults. They were isolated over night and had 1hour light exposure at morning. Birds who did not sing were used in this experiment.

DESIGN
We used 2-3 animals each species. We used the 12th motor neuron for both vocal learners and non-vocal learners. We used the Supra Spinal motor neuron (ssp) as control area for both groups.
