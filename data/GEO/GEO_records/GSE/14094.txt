TITLE
Diet induced gene expression in rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by microarray analysis in normoweight and in diet-induced obese rats (cafeteria rats). The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in energy homeostasis that are altered in the obese state. Keywords: Dietary treatment, obese-state analysis
