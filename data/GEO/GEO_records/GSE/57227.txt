TITLE
Genome wide binding and transcriptome analysis of human FXR in primary human hepatocytes [HTS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide profiling of FXR binding by ChIP-seq from GW4064 or DMSO treated primary human hepatocytes. We reported altered RNA expression profiles in primary human hepatocypes upon GW4064 treatment compared to DMSO control by RNA-seq. We also reported the altered RNA expression profiles in livers from WT C57BL/6J mice upon GW4064 treatment compared to vehicle control.

DESIGN
Primary human hepatocytes were treated with 5uM GW4064 or DMSO control, 1 hour later, cells were fixed and collected for chromatin isolation. 24 hours post treatment, cells were isolated for RNA isolation. This submission represents HTS component of study.
