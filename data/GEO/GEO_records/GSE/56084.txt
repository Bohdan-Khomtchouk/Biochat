TITLE
Gene expression data from the ATAD3A stable knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells and the control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From our previous data, we found that loss of ATAD3A gene expression in breast cancer cells results in loss of cell motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo. To obtain a better understanding of oncogenic pathway of ATAD3A, we have established the stable ATAD3A knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells using lentiviral strategy. We used the whole genome microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after depleting of ATAD3A and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated metastmir associated with breast cancer cells migration

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from ATAD3A stable knockdown cells (shATAD3A) and the control cells (shGFP). The labeled RNA was hybridized on U133 plus 2.0 Array. To identify altered gene expression patterns with or without ATAD3A expression, we compared average mRNA expression levels between the ATAD3A knockdown and control MDA-MB-231 cells.
