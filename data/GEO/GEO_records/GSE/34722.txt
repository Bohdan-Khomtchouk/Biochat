TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to analyze the expression of genes in cytogenetically distinct cases of AML.

DESIGN
We used total RNA obtained from 6 AML samples, consisting of 3 cytogenetically distinct subtypes, to establish the expression levels of 27,868 individual human genes. Expression data from the ABI Human Genome Survey Microarray were filtered, quantile-normalized and subjected to significance analysis of microarrays. Established gene expression profiles were further compared with corresponding DNA methylation in analyzed AML patients.
