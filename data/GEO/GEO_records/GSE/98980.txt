TITLE
Transcriptome differences during blebbishield emergency program and between cell lines that differ in tumorigenecity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blebbishields and spheres (transformed) from blebbishields after apoptosis were compared for gene expression changed from live RT4P cells. Highly tumorigenic cells RT4v6, PBSHMS, RT4P-BSE2 were compared for gene expression differences from RT4P cells

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated were subjected to gene expression analysis using Illumina human HT chip version-4

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
