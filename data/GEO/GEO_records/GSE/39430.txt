TITLE
Dynamics of yeast ISWI and CHD chromatin remodeler genomic association (part 1)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Chromatin remodelers influence genetic processes by altering nucleosome occupancy, positioning, and composition. In vitro, yeast ISWI and CHD remodelers require > 20 bp of extranucleosomal DNA for remodeling, but linker DNA in S. cerevisiae averages < 20 bp. To resolve this paradox, we have mapped the genomic distributions of the yeast Isw1, Isw2, and Chd1 remodelers at base-pair resolution. Surprisingly, remodelers are highly enriched at promoter nucleosome depleted regions (5' NDRs), where they bind to regions of extended linker DNA. Remodelers are also enriched in the bodies of genes displaying high nucleosome turnover. We hypothesize that remodelers bind but do not act at 5' NDRs, remaining in physical proximity to gene bodies, where they act on regions of transient nucleosome depletion following transcriptional elongation.

DESIGN
We have analyzed the dynamics of yeast ISWI and CHD chromatin remodeler genomic association at base-pair resolution using native chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (N-ChIP-seq).
