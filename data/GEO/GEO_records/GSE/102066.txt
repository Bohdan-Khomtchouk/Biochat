TITLE
Time course profiling of scRNA-seq of non-directed differentiation of human Neural precursor cells (NPCs) generated from hESC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) offer a unique cellular model to study the molecular details underpinning embryonic development. We profiled single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on 957 single cells collected at 6 time points over a 30-day period of non-directed differentiation of human neural progenitor cells (NPC) generated from hESC. Computational and experimental analyses of this comprehensive data set enabled us to: 1) define distinct subpopulations of developing neurons and their specific gene expression patters; 2) elucidate alternative cell developmental trajectories within discrete time points of the differentiating populations; and 3) decipher gene regulatory networks and validated key regulators (transcription factors and lincRNAs) that dictate alternative cell fate specifications. In this submission, 957 bam files are provided: 1) 573 single cells from time course profiling (day 0, 1, 5, 7, 10, 30) as first batch and 2) 384 single cells from time course profiling (day 0, 3, 7, 14) as second batch.
