TITLE
MicroRNA-188 regulates age-related switch between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs which differentially expressed in the BMSCs of aged and young mice and and investigate its influences on BMSCs differentiation with ageing.

DESIGN
The microRNAs expressions of BMSCs from 3 aged mice and 3 young mice were measured.
