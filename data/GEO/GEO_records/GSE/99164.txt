TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing  Quantitative Analysis of Tshz1GFP/+ and Tshz1GFP/RA purified amygdalar ITCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was performed on the transcriptomes of amygdalar ITCs from Tshz1 GFP/+ embryonic mice (controls) and Tshz1GFP/RA  embryonic mice (knockouts) in order to identify genes functioning downstream of Tshz1 in the development of these cells.

DESIGN
ITC mRNA profiles of E16.5 Tshz1 GFP/+ embryonic mice (controls) and Tshz1GFP/RA  embryonic mice (knockouts) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
