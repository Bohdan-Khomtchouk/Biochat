TITLE
Interspecies Pinaceae comparison experiment

ORGANISM
Picea glauca

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the potential for utilising this oligonucleotide microarray in other species and genera of the Pinaceae family by using comparative RNA hybridizations in four different spruces (Picea spp), two pines (Pinus spp.) and a larch (Larix laricina), across two tissues, xylem and phelloderm.
