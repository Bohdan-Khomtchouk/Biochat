TITLE
Interspecies Pinaceae comparison experiment

ORGANISM
Larix laricina ; Picea abies ; Picea glauca ; Picea sitchensis ; Picea mariana ; Pinus strobus ; Pinus resinosa

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the potential for utilising this oligonucleotide microarray in other species and genera of the Pinaceae family by using comparative RNA hybridizations in four different spruces (Picea spp), two pines (Pinus spp.) and a larch (Larix laricina), across two tissues, xylem and phelloderm.

DESIGN
One-color comparison of 7 conifer species in 2 tissue types: xylem and phelloderm. Between 4 and 28 biological repetitions per sample type, depending on the species, for a total of 142 slides.
