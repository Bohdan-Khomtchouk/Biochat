TITLE
A. lyrata transcriptomic responses against UV-B stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata

SUMMARY
By using A. lyrata microarray platform, the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at 4h and 8h post exposure to UV-B radiation at wavelength of 300 nm..

DESIGN
Six weeks old Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata rosettes were exposed to UV-B radiation in the environmental chamber of Helmholtz Zentrum, Muenchen and tissues were harvested at 4h and 8h post-exposure time points.

PLATFORM
GPL21706 Agilent-030951 A. lyrata 8X60 {Probe Name version]
