TITLE
Spinal Cord Injury Murine Model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) initiates a complex series of pathophysiological secondary responses that lead to tissue loss and functional deficits.This study represents a comprehensive database of temporal changes in gene expression that underlie the secondary injury response that occurs in a well-defined mouse model of contusion injury. Keywords: Time-Series

DESIGN
Global changes in gene expression that contribute to secondary injury in a C57BL6 mouse model of contusion injury were evaluated using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.Mice were subjected to a moderate injury at the T8 spinal segment under isoflurane anesthesia.Sections of cord (0.4 cm in length) were analyzed from the site of impact and from the immediately adjacent rostral and caudal regions at 0.5, 4, 24, 72 h and 7 and 28 days after injury (n=3/per group), sham-injury (n=2 per group), or from na√Øve mice (n=2). Four mice were pooled for each individual n, for a total of 12 mice for each injury time point.
