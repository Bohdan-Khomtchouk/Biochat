TITLE
Expression data from control and gentamicin-treated chick basilar papilla

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In chick basilar papilla, hair cells can be regenerated after gentamicin treatment. To identify genes and pathways involved in this process, we performed microarray analysis on the basilar papilla 0, 48 and 72 hours after gentamicin.

DESIGN
12-16-day-old chicks were treated with gentamicin to induce death of hair cells. Basilar papilla samples at different time points after gentamicin treatment were dissected and the basal halves were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the pooled samples. Biological duplicates of the pooled RNA were used for microarray.
