TITLE
5Z-7-Oxozeanol inhibits the effect of TGFB1 on human gingival fibroblasts

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to show that in gingival fibroblasts essentially all TGFB1 responsive genes were blocked by TAK inhibition

DESIGN
Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used to identify differential gene expression changes bewteen samples.
