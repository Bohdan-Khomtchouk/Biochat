TITLE
A mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Bank for inducible overexpression of human chromosome 21 genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The HSA21-mES Cell Bank includes, in triplicate clones, thirty-two murine orthologs of HSA21 genes, which can be overexpressed in an inducible manner using the Tet-off system integrated in the Rosa26 locus. The following subset of twenty clones were characterized by microarray analysis: Bach1, Erg, Ets2, Gabpa, ZFP295, Nrip1, Olig1, Olig2, Pknox1, 1810007M14Rik, Runx1, Aire, Sim2, Dscr1, DYRK1A, SNF1LK, Ripk4 , Hunk,  Pdxk, Pfkl.

DESIGN
Each triplicate clone was transcriptionally profiled by microarray analysis using Affymetrix Mouse 430_2 arrays before and after induction (Affymetrix 430A_2 in case of Runx1), yielding six arrays for each overexpression experiment.
