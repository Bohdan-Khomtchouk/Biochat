TITLE
Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [RIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many transcriptional and epigenetic networks must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming.  Here, we explore the role of Zfp217and Mettl3 as RNA-binding proteins.

DESIGN
Identification and characterization of RNAs associated with Zfp217 and Mettl3 in mouse embryoinc stem cells
