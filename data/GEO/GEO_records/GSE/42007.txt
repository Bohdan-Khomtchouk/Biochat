TITLE
A Kinetic Analysis of Auxin-mediated Changes in Transcript Abundance in Arabidopsis Reveals New Mediators of Root Growth and Development

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Auxin-dependent transcript abundance was assayed by transferring 6 day old Arabidopsis grown on a a nylon mesh to IAA-containing or control media

DESIGN
Seedling roots were harvested 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours after treatment and the resultant RNA was used for microarray analysis to determine the kinetic profiles of auxin-responsive gene expression. 8 timepoints after control or IAA treatment done in triplicate
