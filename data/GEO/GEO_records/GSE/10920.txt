TITLE
Analysis of the physiological status of Geobacter uraniireducens growing in uranium-contaminated subsurface sediments

ORGANISM
Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4

SUMMARY
Geobacteraceae transfer electrons from a donor such as acetate to an electron acceptor such as Fe(III) or U(VI).  Geobacter uraniireducens is found in uranium-contaminated sites and plays an important role in in situ bioremediation.  In this experiment, gene expression was compared between G. uraniireducens cultures grown in sediments from a uranium contaminated site amended with acetate and cultures grown in acetate/fumarate medium. Keywords: two-condition comparison

DESIGN
This was a dual channel experiment using aRNA directly labeled with either cy5 (experimental) or cy3 (control). Three biological replicates were labeled and hybridized in duplicate (two technical replicates).
