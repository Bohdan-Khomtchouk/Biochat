TITLE
OsGLK1 regulated genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcription factors encoded by GLK genes are putative positive regulators of chloroplast development. To identify the potential downstream genes regulated by OsGLK1, we performed the rice 44k oligo microarray analysis. Keywords: over-expression of full-length cDNAs

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from calluses derived from T1 seeds of the OsGLK1 full length cDNA overexpression line and the control line grown on the N6D medium with 30 mg/l of Hyg for 14 days at 30ËšC, and subjected to 44k oligo-DNA microarray with 4 biological replicates.
