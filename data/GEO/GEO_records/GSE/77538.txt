TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile in FH-deficient (UOK262) vs FH-competent (UOK262pFH) human cells derived from metastatsis to the mediastinum of a HLRCC patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptome of human kideny cancer cells either wild-type for FH or FH-deficient. The UOK262 cells were isolated from mediastinum metastasis of a HLRCC patient (Yang et al. Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics, Volume 196, Issue 1, 1 January 2010, Pages 45â€“55). FH function was restored in the UOK262 by re-expressing the FH transcript from an exogenous plasmid.

DESIGN
Examination of gene transciption in 2 cell types.
