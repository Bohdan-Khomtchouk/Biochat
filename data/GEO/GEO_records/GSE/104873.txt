TITLE
RNA Seq of Alagille liver biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Needle biopsies were performed to obtain liver samples from patients for clinical purposes from patients with Alagille syndrome. A small portion was snap frozen and later used for RNA sequencing analysis. Needle biospies from 5 patients with other liver disorders were included as controls.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in Alagille patients' liver samples, compared to other control liver samples (with other chronic liver diseases).

PLATFORM
