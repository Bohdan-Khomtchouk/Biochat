TITLE
Expression data from Trp53- or Atm-deficient Eµ-TCL1 murine CLL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze expression differences between Trp53 pro-and deficient as well as Atm pro- and deficient murine CLL tumors developing in the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model, we analyzed splenocytes isolated from heavily infiltrated spleens of sick mice. To investigate differences in the response to cyclophosphamide, we also analyzed splenocytes from leukemic animals that were isolated twelve hours after intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide.

DESIGN
Eµ:TCL1;Cd19:Cre;Atmfl/fl (TCA), Eµ:TCL1;Cd19:Cre;Trp53fl/fl (TCP) and Eµ:TCL1;Cd19:Cre (TC) mice were monitored for disease progression by MRI and were sacrificed when strongly infiltrated spleens were detectable, either with or without acute stimulation by injection of cyclophosphamide ('CTX', 200mg/kg, i.p.) 12 hours prior to splenocyte isolation.
