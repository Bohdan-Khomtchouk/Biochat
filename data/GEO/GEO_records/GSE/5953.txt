TITLE
Vasopressin (AVP) and the V2R specific agonist dDAVP 7 day infusion into Aquaporin 1 knockout animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone, acts on the renal collecting duct. In this experiment both vasopressin (AVP) and the V2R specific agonist dDAVP were infused into Aquaporin 1 knockout animals for 7 days. The aim of the experiment was to identify genes increased by vasopressin receptors in the renal medullary collecting ducts, in the absence of an increase in renal medullary osmolarity (the AQP1 knockouts are concentrating mechanism knockouts). All experiments used inner medulla tissue for the RNA isolation. Keywords: Vasopressin treatment study

DESIGN
Hybridizations were performed that compared kidney inner medulla total RNA from three control mice against kidney medulla total RNA from 3 mice infused with either arginine vasopressin (AVP) or des-amino-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).
