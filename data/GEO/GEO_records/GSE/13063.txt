TITLE
Effects of extensive fasting and subsequent feeding on hepatic transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporally restricted feeding has a profound effect on the circadian clock. Fasting and feeding paradigms are known to influence hepatic transcription. This dataset shows the dynamic effects of refeeding mice after a 24hour fasting period.

DESIGN
Mice were entrained for two weeks under ad libitum access to food. Mice were then released into constant darkness and food was withdrawn at CT4 on the first day in constant darkness. On the second day in constant darkness mice were either fed (Refed) or continously fasted (Fast) at CT4. Liver tissue was collected at the indicated timepoints. Total RNA was extracted and standard Affymetrix protocol were used for amplification, labeling and hybridization
