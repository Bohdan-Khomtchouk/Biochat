TITLE
Comparative Genomic Analyses among Citrus-Associated strains of Xylella fastidiosa

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa

SUMMARY
With the aid of a biochip, carrying  representative sequences from approximately 2200 sequences from the genome of isolate 9a5c from X. fastidiosa (Xf), microarray-based comparisons have been performed with 6 different Xf isolates obtained from citrus plants (Table 1). Four of these isolates (56a, 9.12c, 187b, and 36f) were obtained from CVC-affected trees and are representatives of the most prevalent Xf haplotypes found in sweet orange orchards across the state of São Paulo, while isolate CV21 was obtained from a non-symptomatic tree from the same region. Isolate Fb7, on the other hand, was obtained from a sweet orange tree that displayed symptoms of “Pecosita”, a disease similar to CVC that occurs in some citrus-growing regions of Argentina. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization
