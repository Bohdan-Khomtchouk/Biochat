TITLE
Orphan Nuclear Receptors ERRα/γ are competence factors for somatic cell reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the expression profiles of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, known regulators of metabolism, during iPSC generation. Unique but overlapping expression patterns were found in iPSCs derived from adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and embryonic fibroblasts (human and mouse) that correlate with developmental transitions in the cell.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from human embryonic fibroblast IMR90 cells (IMR90s) untreated, transduced with GFP or with the four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc; OSKM) at day 5 of reprogramming.
