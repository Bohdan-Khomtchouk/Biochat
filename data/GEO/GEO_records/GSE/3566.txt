TITLE
Enigma (CG9006) RNAi vs control RNAi in Drosophila Kc-167 cells.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
5 day RNAi treatment to knockdown Enigma, CG9006, a Drosophila mitochondrial protein with homology to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Kc-167 cells, 5 day treatment with Enigma-specific RNAi or beta-lactamase control RNAi. Specifics:1.6X10^6 cells in 0.5mL of serum-free Sang's M3 media incubated for 1 hour with 20ug of dsRNA, subsequently equal volume of M3 media containing 10% serum was added. Cells harvested after 5 days. RNAi efficiency measured by immunoblot for Enigma.
