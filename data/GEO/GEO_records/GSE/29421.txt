TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and Activin-induced/derived cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nodal/Activin signaling directs mesendoderm specification in early vertebrate embryogenesis. We have characterized transcriptional profiling of human embryonic stem cells and Activin-treated cells at different timepoints. In this dataset, we include the timecourse gene expression data obtained from hESC differentiation post Activin treatment, examining at day 0, 1, 3 and 5.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates were used for day 0, three for day 1, three for day 3, and four for day 5. Cells were harvested and used for total RNA preparation using Trizol (Invitrogen). Gene expression was analyzed using GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix).
