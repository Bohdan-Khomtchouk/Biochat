TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and Activin-induced/derived cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nodal/Activin signaling directs mesendoderm specification in early vertebrate embryogenesis. We have characterized transcriptional profiling of human embryonic stem cells and Activin-treated cells at different timepoints. In this dataset, we include the timecourse gene expression data obtained from hESC differentiation post Activin treatment, examining at day 0, 1, 3 and 5.
