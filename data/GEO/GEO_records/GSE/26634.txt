TITLE
Expression changes following siRNA knockdown of ADRM1 in ovarian cell line OAW42

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knock-down of ovarian cancer amplification target ADRM1 leads to down regulation of GIPC1 and up-regulation of RECK. Among 20q13-amplified genes in ovarian cancer, ADRM1 overexpression was the most highly correlated with amplification, and was significantly upregulated with respect to stage, recurrence and metastasis. In addition, overexpression of ADRM1 correlated significantly with shorter time to recurrence and overall survival.  Herein, array-CGH and microarray expression of ovarian cancer cell lines, provides evidence consistent with the primary tumor data that ADRM1 is a 20q13 amplification target. Knock-down of ADRM1 in amplified ovarian cell line OAW42 results in down-regulation of growth factor GIPC1 and up-regulation of tumor-suppressor RECK RNA and protein.  In our dataset of 141 ovarian primary tumors, ADRM1 overexpression significantly correlates with GIPC1 overexpression.  In addition, there is a significant anticorrelation between ADRM1 overexpression and RECK expression.  Further research is necessary to determine whether targeting knock-down of ADRM1 in 20q13-amplified ovarian cancers results in growth inhibition and tumor suppression via downstream targets GIPC1 and RECK.
