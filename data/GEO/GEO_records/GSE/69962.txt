TITLE
CTCF ChIP-seq in human monocytic THP-1 cells with replicates (4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq for the insulator protein CTCF in THP-1 cells after stimulation with the the natural VDR ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)

DESIGN
THP-1 cells were treated for 24 h with 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 before ChIP assay
