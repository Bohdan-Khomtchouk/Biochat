TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of microRNAs target transcripts in sweet orange

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
miRNAs-mediated gene silencing pathway plays vital roles in plant development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we carried out a high-throughput sequencing approach to identify miRNAs targets in leaves, flowers and fruit of sweet orange.C onsequently, 55257, 62365 and 19393 degraded mRNA fragments were identified in leaf, flower and fruit, respectively.

DESIGN
miRNAs-mediated degraded fragments sequencing of the leaves, flowers and fruit in sweet orange
