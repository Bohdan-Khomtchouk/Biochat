TITLE
The transcription factors Snail and Slug activate the TGF-B signaling pathway in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling to determine transcriptome changes following Snail or Slug expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells Samples were isolated in three biological replicates for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Four MCF-7 breast cancer cell subsets:  MCF-7(untreated), MCF-7 (with Control adenovirus), MCF-7 (with Snail adenovirus) and MCF-7 (with Slug adenovirus). RNA was purified on Day 0 for untreated, and on days 1,2 and 4 for the remaining three subsets for gene expression profiling on microarray.
