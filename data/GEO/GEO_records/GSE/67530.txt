TITLE
Epigenetic Contribution of the Myosin Light Chain Kinase Gene to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nested case-control study included 39 ARDS cases, 75 non-ARDS ICU controls, and 30 healthy controls. Cytosine modification levels were profiled using the Illumina 450K BeadChip and genotypic data for 29 ARDS cases and 52 ICU controls were used in mQTL analysis

DESIGN
Approximately 150 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA from each sample was used for profiling DNA methylation levels using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip (450K array)
