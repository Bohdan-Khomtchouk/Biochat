TITLE
Candida albicans TRKO rbf1Δ/hfl1Δ/dpb4Δ vs WT transcriptome data

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
To determine potential roles of three transcript factors (Rbf1p, Hfl1p and Dpb4p) in cell metabolic activities and other cellular bioprocesses, we have performed genomic microarray in each gene knockout strain and transcription profiles were compared  to its parental strain SN250

DESIGN
The total RNAs were extracted from exponential growth of null mutants  and SN250, then used to synthesize cDNA for microarray assays in Aglient array that contains 6101 genes in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL18166 Agilent-037557 C. albicans 12K (111122 Georgetown David on C Albicans)
