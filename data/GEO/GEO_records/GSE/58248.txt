TITLE
Multi-Omic Integrated networks connect DNA methylation and miRNA with skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in type 2 diabetic obesity [miRNA data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle miRNA expression from type 2 diabetic volunteers before and after 16 weeks of chronic exercise training (two groups, one undergoing aerobic ecercise and the other resistance training exercise)

DESIGN
A biopsy was collected from the right Vastus Lateralis under local anaesthesia and RNA was isolated from muscle (~10 mg) using mirVana™ Kit , Low molecular weight RNA was biotin-labeled with FlashTag™ Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit. 21.5 µl of high-quality biotin-labeled miRNA sample was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene-Chip® miRNA 2.0, stained on  Affymetrix Fluidics station 400 and scanned with a Hewlett Packard G2500A gene Array Scanner. Affymetrix® miRNA QC Tool v 1.1.1.0 was used for the data summarization, normalization, and microarray quality control.
