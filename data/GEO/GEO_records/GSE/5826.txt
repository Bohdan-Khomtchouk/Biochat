TITLE
Liver fenofibrate feeding mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify novel PPARalpha target genes involved in lipid metabolism Keywords: gene expression changes, drug treatment, fibrates, liver

DESIGN
8 week old male 129SvEJ mice (wild-type and pparalpha -/-) mice were fed a chow diet of 0.2% fenofibrate for 7 days. Liver RNA was isolated and pooled from 3 mice from each genotype and used for Affymetrix gene array analysis
