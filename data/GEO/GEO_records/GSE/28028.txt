TITLE
Differential expressions of microRNAs involve the development of superior and inferior spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify differential expression of microRNAs between superior and inferior spikelets by using a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa (Illumina). Two small RNA libraries were constructed from superior and inferior spikelets at 18 days after fertilization, and more than nine million small RNA sequence reads were generated for each library. Totals of 351 and 312 known miRNAs were obtained from the superior and inferior spikelets, respectively. Analysis of the expression profiles of these miRNAs showed that 189 miRNAs were differentially expressed between superior spikelets and inferior spikelets. In addition, 43 novel miRNAs were identified mostly by the accumulations of miRNA*s were also expressed differentially. Further analysis shows that these miRNAs may individually participate in regulating hormone metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic pathways, and cell division during rice grain development. These results indicate that slow grain filling and low grain weight of rice inferior spikelets probably relation to the expression and function differences between superior and inferior spikelet miRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different small RNA expression profilings in superior and inferior spikelets at 18 days after fertilization.
