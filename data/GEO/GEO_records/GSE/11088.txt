TITLE
TEV-Arabidopsis pathosystem

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of Arabidopsis plants infected with the Tobacco etch potyvirus TEV and the evolved TEV-At17, which was generated by serial passes of ancestral TEV in Arabidopsis. Infection with TEV-At17 cause severe symptoms in the plant, compared with the asymptomatic TEV-infection. Keywords: Virus infection

DESIGN
Five replicates for each sample category (Arabidopsis Ler infected with mock, or with TEV and TEV-At17 viruses) were generated, and compared with a global reference, generated from an equimolar mix of amplified RNAs from each of the 15 plants. Three replicas (#1,2, and 3) in each group were labeled with Cy5 and compared with Cy3-labeled reference mix, while the other two replicas (#4 and 5)  were reversed-labeled.
