TITLE
Directed differentiation of oligodendrocytes from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we compare the transcriptional profile of the undifferentiated hESC with the anterior oligodendroctes derived from the hESC using our new differentiation protocol.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated hES cells and from hES derived oligodendrocytes, 70 days old and FACS sorted for O4 marker. Samples for each group in triplicate were processed for Illumina bead arrays (Illumina HT-12) by the MSKCC genomics core facility according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
