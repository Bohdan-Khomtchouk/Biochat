TITLE
Integrated genome, transcriptome and translatome profiling of neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based genome-wide measurements of copy number alterations and of transcriptome variations are proposed for neuroblastoma prognosis and possible treatment choice. Nonetheless, they lack to provide clues on a neglected layer of systems-level changes, the translatome, whose variations are defined by the activity of the translational regulatory machinery.   Our study extends the conventional genome-wide approaches to translatome profiling in neuroblastoma, by means of polysomal sucrose gradient separation followed by microarray analysis.   The panel of fourteen parental (not subcloned) neuroblastoma cell lines used in the study includes: CHP-134, SIMA, NB-69, LAN-1, KELLY, CHP-126, CHP-212, SK-N-BE(2), IMR-32, SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, STA-NB-7, STA-NB-1, STA-NB-10 cells. Each cell line has been profiled with high resolution array CGH analysis for copy number changes, and for transcriptome and translatome variations.   The integration of these three types of data sets obtained from the same cells can  provide information on the impact in neuroblastoma of a defined pattern of genomic lesions on both transcriptional and translational alterations of gene expression.
