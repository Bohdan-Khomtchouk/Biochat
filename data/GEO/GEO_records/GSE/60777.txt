TITLE
Active Demethylation of Both Maternal and Paternal Genomes in Mouse Zygotes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The epigenomes of mammalian sperm and oocytes, characterized by gamete-specific 5-methylcytosine (5mC) patterns, are reprogrammed in early embryogenesis to establish full developmental potential. It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively demethylated in the zygote while the maternal genome undergoes passive demethylation thanks to DNA replication over the subsequent cleavage divisions. Here we reveal that both maternal and paternal genomes undergo widespread active and passive demethylation in the pronuclear zygote before the first mitotic division. Whereas the passive demethylation requires DNA replication, the active demethylation relies on enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, as deletion of the DNA dioxygenase, Tet3, but not the inhibition of replication, blocks the active demethylation. At actively demethylated loci, 5mCs appear to be processed to unmodified cytosines in a manner independent of the DNA glycosylase TDG. These observations suggest the occurrence of genuine active demethylation in both parental genomes following fertilization.
