TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of SH-SY5Y cells in response to enterovirus type 71 infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Today, the pathogenesis of human enterovirus type 71 (HEV71) infection in human central neural system remains unclear. HEV71 is the major pathogen of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), and has been associated with severe neurological disease and even death in infants and young children. We employed the human whole genome microarray analyze the transcriptome profiling inhuman neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y infected with HEV71. The results showed that HEV71 infection lead to altered expression of 161 human mRNAs including 74 up-regulated genes and 87 down-regulated genes. Then we found that the possible roles of the differentially regulated mRNAs in selected pathways including cell cycle/proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine/chemokine responses by Bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we validated the microarray results by real-time RT-PCR with high identity. Overall, our results provided fundamental information about host response to HEV71 infection in human neuroblastoma cells, and this finding will help to understand the pathogenesis of HEV71 infection and virus-host interaction.

DESIGN
Total RNA of cells infected with HEV71 was extracted using the TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-expression profiling was performed for each pooling RNA sample separately on the GeneChip_ Porcine Genome Array (Affymetrix) at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China) in which GeneChip microarray service was certificated by Affymetrix.
