TITLE
mRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) treatment [Agilent gene expression array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult male mice were exposed to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) or solvent for 3 days and sampled 4 or 24 hours after the last dose. mRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver were measured using Agilent arrays. We found widespread changes in mRNA in pathways consistent with known response (xenobiotic metabolism, glutathione). We also found that BaP caused changes in the circadian rhythm pathway. We measured miRNA changes in the same samples and found no evidence for any change in transcription of miRNA as a result of the exposure. Keywords: Toxicology, time course

DESIGN
Adult male B6C3F1 mice were exposed to a daily dose of corn oil (vehicle control group) or 150 mg/kg BaP (treatment group) for 3 days (n=5 per group). Mice were sacrificed at 4 h or 24 h following the last dose and liver lobes were extracted and flash frozen. RNA was extracted from median liver lobes and hybridized to the Agilent 4 x 44K mouse DNA arrays using a randomized block design.
