TITLE
Oxidative stress elicits a rapid and global RNA polymerase II transcriptional response in human cells [PRO-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared nuclear walk-on results with PRO-Seq, both of which were performed using nuclei from DMSO- and flavopiridol-treated cells. In GSE93931, we also used ChIP-Seq to show that hydrogen peroxide causes rapid accumulation of Pol II at promoters and enhancers. Over time, a fraction of accumulated Pol II loses NELF and creeps downstream.

DESIGN
PRO-Seq using nuclei from HeLa cells

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
