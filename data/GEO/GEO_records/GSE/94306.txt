TITLE
Sin3a regulates epithelial progenitor cell fate during lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of global transcription profiles in mouse E12.5 embryonic lung from Shh-Cre;Sin3a flox/+ control with Shh-Cre;Sin3a flox/flox revealed a large change genes due to loss of Sin3a in early lung development.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different transcriptomes in 2 genotypes with three replicates.

PLATFORM
