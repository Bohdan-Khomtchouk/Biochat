TITLE
PPARG regulated genes in the day 14 ovine conceptus

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
PPARG ChIP seq analysis was conducted to determine genes bound by and potentially regulated by PPARG in the developing ovine conceptus. Determination of gene regulation by prostaglandins through PPARG helps to improve our understanding of early pregnancy events and provides a basis for strategies to improve fertility and reproductive efficiency in ruminants.

DESIGN
PPARG ChIP seq analysis of 4 conceptuses from 4 individual Day 14 pregnant columbia/ramboulette crossbred ewes

PLATFORM
GPL15670 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Ovis aries)
