TITLE
Uterine gene profiles from WT, KIKO (DNA-binding deficient ERα) and aERKO mice treated with estradiol or xenoestrogens

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovariectomized WT, KIKO (DNA-binding deficient ERα) or αERKO female mice were injected (ip) with saline (vehicle), estradiol (E2; 250 ng), bisphenol A (BPA; 750 µg) or 2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE; 750 µg) and uteri were collected after 2 or 24 hours. Uterine profiles were compared and indicated the early (2 hour) responses to E2 were highly correlated to the BPA and HPTE profiles. KIKO patterns included overlap with WT but also included distinct responses. Later (24 hour) responses in the KIKO were weaker, indicating DNA binding is needed to maintain the estrogenic response. BPA and HPTE also showed a weakened late response in the WT, suggesting they are impeded estrogens.

DESIGN
Three WT, KIKO or αERKO ovariectomized mice per treatment group were injected with vehicle, E2, BPA or HPTE and uterine tissue was collected after 2 or 24 hour and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated from a pool of the three uteri using Trizol reagent and then cleaned with a Qiagen RNA easy mini kit. RNA quality was validated with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer in the microarray facility.  RNA samples were then analyzed by 2-color Agilent Whole Mouse arrays with fluor flips.  Each array was co hybridized with vehicle and treated RNA within the genotype (WT, KIKO or aERKO).
