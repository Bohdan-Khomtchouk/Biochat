TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of several temperate extrachromosomal actinobacteriophages during various stages of growth

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
Several temperate actinobacteriophages have been identified that lack integration machinery and instead have genes with predicted partitioning functions. The goal of this sequencing project was to measure transcription levels of these extrachromosomal phages during different stages of their lifecycle, including lysogeny, early infection (30 minutes), and late infection (2 hours 30 minutes), in order to study which genes contribute to extrachromosomal stability.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from cultures grown in log phase, depleted of rRNA and prepared for sequencing using a strand-specific library kit during lysogeny, early infection (30 minutes), and late infection (2 hours 30 minutes) of phages Alma, EagleEye, Pioneer, and RedRock. A total of seven different RNA samples were prepared.
