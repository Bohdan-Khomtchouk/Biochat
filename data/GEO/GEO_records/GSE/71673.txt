TITLE
Expression data from Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 infected SK-N-SH cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both viruses differently express genes at 48 and 72 hours involving cell cycle, cellular damage and inflammatory response We used microarrays to detail the total gene expression underlying two virus infection in neuronal cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process at specific time.

DESIGN
Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 infected SK-N-SH cells at 48 hours and 72 hours were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, respectively. We sought to obtain high number of infected cell populations of SK-N-SH cells at each time point in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we ensured using flow cytometry data for confirmation of more than 60% of SK-N-SH cells are infected by the viruses.
