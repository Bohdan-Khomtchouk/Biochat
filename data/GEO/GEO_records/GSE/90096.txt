TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves treated with BrvC

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Brevicompanines are natural products isolated from the culture filtrate of the fungus Penicillium brevicompactum. They showed plant growth regulating properties in several species including lettuce, rice or Arabidopsis thaliana. We used microarrays to gather information about the reprogramming of gene transcription when Arabidopsis leaves were treated with Brevicompanine C (BrvC) that showed significant activity in plant growth assays.

DESIGN
30-days old Arabidopsis leaves were treated with 50 ÔÅ≠M BrvC for 6 h or 48 h or left untreated (DMSO only) and subsequently used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
