TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K4me2/3 in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in prostate cancer cells. By obtaining over 1 billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of prostate cancer cells. we found androgen treatment dismisses a nucleosome over AR binding sites that are flanked by a pair of H3K4me2 marked nucleosomes. A novel quantitative model built on the behavior of such nucleosome pairs correctly identified regions bound by the regulators of the immediate androgen response including AR and FoxA1. More importantly this model also correctly predicted novel binding sites for other transcription factors present following prolonged androgen stimulation including Oct1 and NKX3.1. Thus quantitative modeling of enhancer structure provides a powerful predictive method to infer the identity of transcription factors involved in cellular responses to specific stimuli.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in prostate cancer cells with and without androgen (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) treatment.
