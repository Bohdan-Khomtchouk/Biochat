TITLE
Transcript structures in Shewanella sp ANA-3

ORGANISM
Shewanella sp. ANA-3

SUMMARY
5' RNASeq of mRNA from Shewanella sp ANA-3 grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) and defined lactate minimal medium

DESIGN
5'-end mRNA profiles of mid-log phase bacterial cells growing in LB or lactate medium were generated by next-generation sequencing.
