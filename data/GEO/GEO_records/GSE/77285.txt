TITLE
Impact of tRNA-Glu(UUC) and tRNA-Arg(CCG) on mRNA abundance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stable expression of tRNA-Glu(UUC) and tRNA-Arg(CCG) followed by transcriptomic profiling to measure transcripts.

DESIGN
Transfer RNA loci chr1.trna5 (Glu-TTC) and chr16.trna1 (Arg-CCG) were stably over-expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were then subjected to transcripome profiling in comparison to mock-transfected cells.
