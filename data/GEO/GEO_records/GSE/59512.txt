TITLE
Whole brain expression data from postnatal day 7-aged mice exposed to ethanol at postnatal day 7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The developing brain is particularly sensitive to ethanol during the brain growth spurt or synaptogenesis (third human trimester equivalent).  This has been shown to lead to abnormal brain development and behavioural changes in the adult mouse that are relevant to those seen in humans with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).  We evaluated the acute (4h post-treatment) gene expression changes that occur in the brain due to ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis (postnatal day 7). We used microarray analyses to evaluate the changes in brain gene expression at postnatal day 7 that occur due to ethanol treatment at postnatal day 7 (synaptogenesis).

DESIGN
To generate samples, C57BL/6J pups were injected with ethanol (experimental) or saline (control) at postnatal day 7 (2 x 2.5 g/kg at 0h and 2h).   Pups were sacrificed 4 hours following the initial injection.  Total RNA was extracted from whole brain tissue and RNA from three male mice from three different litters were pooled as one biological replicate.  Each male ethanol-treated mouse represented in a sample was matched by a control littermate present in a control sample.  This study consists of two experimental (ethanol-treated) biological replicates and four control (saline vehicle-treated) replicates (total mice used was n=18).
