TITLE
Sequencing of synthetic small RNAs hsa-miR-34b-5p, hsa-miR-449c-5p and their isomir variant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this small RNA Seq is to determine if the sequence reads observed for hsa-miR-34b-5p and hsa-miR-449c-5p represent library artifacts or sequencing artifacts

DESIGN
Each mature miRNA isomer has been sequenced alone in a complex mixture of RNA. The two forms of hsa-miR-34b-5p and hsa-miR-449c-5p were sequenced with a 1:1 ratio (mix)
