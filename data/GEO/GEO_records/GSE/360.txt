TITLE
Macrophages and dendritic cells exposed to phylogenetically distinct parasites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (MÎ¦) generated in vitro from the same individual blood donors were exposed to five different pathogens, and gene expression profiles were assessed by microarray analysis.  Responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to phylogenetically distinct protozoan (Leishmania major, L. donovani, Toxoplasma gondii) and helminth (Brugia malayi) parasites were examined, each of which produces chronic infections in humans yet vary considerably in the nature of the immune responses they trigger.
