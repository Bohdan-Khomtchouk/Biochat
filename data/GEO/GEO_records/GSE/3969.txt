TITLE
Puf3delta vs. wild type comparison

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Three independent experiments: S. cervisiae wild-type (BY4741) and Puf3 mutant cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 3% glycerol. Cells were harvested in mid-log phase by centrifugation and total RNA was prepared by hot-phenol extraction. cDNA was prepared with oligo-dT and using a mixture of amino-allyl dUTP and dNTPs, fluorescently labeled (Cy3= wild-type, Cy5 = mutant) and hybridize on S. cerevisiae DNA microarray. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
