TITLE
Wnt/b-catenin signaling regulates sequential fate decisions of murine cortical precursor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to compare expression changes upon Wnt/b-catenin signaling inactivation in the forebrain of mouse embryos, we have isolated dorso-medial pallium from E11.5 mutant and control embryos and performed microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Dorso-medial pallium from E11.5 control and mutant embryos was dissected and snap-frozen. RNA isolation on single embryo brains was performed with RNAeasy kit with on-column Dnase digestion.
