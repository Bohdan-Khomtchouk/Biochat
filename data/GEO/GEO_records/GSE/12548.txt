TITLE
EMT Time series in ARPE19

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in gene expression by a human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line (ARPE-19) in response to combination treatment of TGF and TNF, which induces phenotypic changes in vitro that mimic the EMT (Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition). For this purpose, total RNA was extracted from TGF and TNF-treated ARPE-19 cells and differential gene expression between each time point (0, 1, 6, 16, 24, 42, and 60 hours) was determined using genechip arrays (Affymetrix, Human Genome U133). Keywords: time course
