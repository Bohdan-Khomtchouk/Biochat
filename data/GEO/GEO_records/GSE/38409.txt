TITLE
Expression data from mouse lungs, exposed in-utero to second-hand smoke (SHS) and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) as adults.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SHS exposure during pregnancy has adverse effects on offspring. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes caused by in-utero SHS exposure and adult (19-23 weeks) OVA challenge in 23-week mouse lungs.

DESIGN
Left lungs from Balb/c male and female mice were collected at 23 weeks of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarrays. Based on the gender differences and in-utero exposure status, there are 4 groups of mice, females and males, exposed in-utero to filtered-air or SHS. All were exposure to OVA (19-23 weeks). We extracted RNA from 4 animals from each group for microarray analysis (total N = 16 samples).
