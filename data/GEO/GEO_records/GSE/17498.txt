Identification of MicroRNA Expression Patterns and a MicroRNAs/mRNA Regulatory Network in Multiple Myeloma

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To date, little evidence of miRNA expression/deregulation in multiple myeloma (MM) has been reported. To characterize miRNA expression profiling of MM plasma cells (PCs) and integrate miRNA expression data with other molecular features of MM patients, global miRNA expression profiles were generated for PCs isolated from BM biopsies of 38 newly diagnosed MM, 2 plasma cell leukemia patients, and 3 healthy donors; the samples were also profiled for global gene expression, and nineteen of them underwent genome-wide DNA analysis using high-density SNP-microarrays. Differential miRNA expression patterns were mainly identified in association with the major IGH translocations: in particular, t(4;14) showed specific over-expression of let-7e, miR-125a-5p and miR-99b belonging to a cluster at 19q13.33. The occurrence of other lesions, such as 1q gain, 13q and 17p deletions, and hyperdiploidy, was less well characterized by specific miRNA signatures. Genome-wide analysis showed that some allelic imbalances led to the significantly altered expression of miRNAs located in the involved regions, such as let-7b at 22q13.31 loss and miR-142-3p at 17q22 gain. The integrative analysis based on computational target prediction, miRNA and mRNA profiling defined a network of putative functional miRNA-target regulatory relations supported by expression data.
