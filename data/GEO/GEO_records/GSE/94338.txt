TITLE
Effect of  low dose docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on bovine cumulus cells during in vitro maturation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In order to decipher the pathways of DHA via cumulus cells (CC) surrounding an oocytes,  microarray hybridization of cumulus cells after 4h IVM in the presence or absence of 1µM DHA was performed.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of cumulus cells from the oocytes after 4 hours of in vitro maturation (IVM) in the presence or absence of 1µM DHA were compared.
