TITLE
Cumulus cell gene expression associated with pre-ovulatory acquisition of developmental competence in bovine oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study investigated the cumulus cell (CC) transcriptomic changes during the oocyte developmental competence acquisition period.

DESIGN
Six dairy cows were used for 24 oocyte collections and received FSH twice daily over 3 days, followed by FSH withdrawal for 20, 44, 68 and 92 h in four different oestrous cycles for each of the six cows. Half of the cumulusâ€“oocyte complexes were subjected to in vitro maturation, fertilisation and culture to assess blastocyst rate. The other half of the CC underwent microarray analysis and qRT-PCR.
