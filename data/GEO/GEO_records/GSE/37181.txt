TITLE
Subtype-dependent prognostic relevance of an interferon-induced pathway metagene in human node negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified and validated the pivotal role for a metagene containing IFN-induced genes in association to higher metastatic potential as a function of the specific molecular subtype

DESIGN
Fresh frozen primary tumors were collected at the time of diagnosis from 123 patients with operable breast cancer previously untreated and undergoing radical or conservative surgery at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milano (INTM) between1990 and 1998. All patients were pathologically defined as axillary node negative and were not submitted to any type of adjuvant systemic treatment until relapse. Patients were selected in order to have a comparable pattern of classical risk factors (age, tumor size).
