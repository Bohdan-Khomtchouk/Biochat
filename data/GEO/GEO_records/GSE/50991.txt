TITLE
Gene expression profile of A549 Circulating Tumor Cells from 4D Model.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CTCs in cancer patients are thought to be responsible for metastasis. Currently, there is no ex vivo model that can isolate this group of cells. We have developed an ex vivo 4D lung cancer model that forms perfusable tumor nodules and form CTCs. Gene array analyses show 2504 differentially expressed genes when comparing CTCs from the 4D model seeded with A549 cells to the same cells grown on a petri dish (2D).

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profile (Human OneArray v5 chip) of A549 cells, human lung cancer cell line, grown on petri dish (2D) and same cells circulating as tumor cells in our ex vivo model (4D/CTC).
