TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Human Endometrial Endothelial Cells Exposed to Bisphenol A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) can affect reproductive organs, tissues and cells in several species. Treatment of human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) with 50 ÂµM BPA decreased their proliferation compared with the control. Microarray analyses revealed that BPA affected biological processes such as the cell cycle, cell division, and cytoskeleton organization, confirming the results of the proliferation assay. Expression of three of the most differentially expressed genes identified in the microarray analysis was verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in five HEEC cultures obtained from women in the proliferative phase and in five cultures obtained from women in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle after treatment with BPA. The present study supports our previous findings of decreased proliferation and increased cell death in response to BPA, and may offer important clues to the mechanisms of action of BPA. Keywords: Exposure analysis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, BPA-exposed vs. control HEEC. Biological replicates: 5 HEEC cultures, independently grown, exposed and harvested. One replicate per array. Dye-swaps for exposed and reference samples between replicates.
