TITLE
Expression data from retinas of wildtype and Nhlh2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nhlh2 is a neuronal helix-loop-helix transcription factor. The goal of this study was to determine the pattern of gene expression in wildtype mouse retina and to compare it to that in the retinas of mice in which the nhlh2 gene had been knocked out.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from three pairs of littermates, each comprising one wildtype and one knockout sample. The littermate samples are: retina_wt_rep1 & retina_nhlh2_rep1; retina_wt_rep2 and retina_nhlh2_rep2; retina_wt_rep3 & retina_nhlh2_rep3.
