TITLE
AMPD2 Regulates GTP Synthesis and is Mutated in a Potentially-Treatable Neurodegenerative Brainstem Disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purine biosynthesis and metabolism, conserved in all living organisms, is essential for cellular energy homeostasis and nucleic acids synthesis. The de novo synthesis of purine precursors is under tight negative feedback regulation mediated by adenine and guanine nucleotides. We describe a new early-onset distinct neurodegenerative condition resulting from mutations in the adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 gene (AMPD2). Patients have characteristic brain imaging features of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), due to loss of brainstem and cerebellar parenchyma. We found that AMPD2 plays an evolutionary conserved role in the maintenance of cellular guanine nucleotide pools by regulating the feedback inhibition of adenosine derivatives on de novo purine synthesis. AMPD2 deficiency results in defective GTP-dependent initiation of protein translation, which can be rescued by administration of purine precursors. These data suggest AMPD2-related PCH as a new potentially treatable early-onset neurodegenerative disease.

DESIGN
An 18 chip study, that compares iPSC derived neural progenitor cells from two individuals: a patient with pontocerebellar hypoplasia and an unaffected parent. Samples are run as either non-treated, treated with Adenosine, or treated with Adenosine and AICAr. Three replicates are included for every individuals in every treatment condition.
