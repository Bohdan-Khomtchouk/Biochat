TITLE
microRNA expression in human tonsillar B cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
small RNA profiles of 6 human tonsillar B cell populatios (naive B cells, pre-germinal center B cells, centrocytes, centroblasts, memory B cells, and plasma cells) were determined by deep sequencing.  These samples were compared to mouse developing lymphocytes, various hematopoietic cell lineages, and tissues.

DESIGN
small RNA expression profiles of 6 well defined B cell populations isolated from human tonsils.
