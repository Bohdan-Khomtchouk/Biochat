TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptome profiling of equine inner cell mass and trophectoderm

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of ICM and TE from in vivo-derived equine blastocysts using Illumina sequencing technology

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from individual equine blastocyst ICM and TE (Arcturus Picopure), cDNA was synthesized and amplified (Nugen Ovation V2) and indexed libraries were created for sequencing (TruSeq DNA V1)

PLATFORM
GPL15545 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Equus caballus)
