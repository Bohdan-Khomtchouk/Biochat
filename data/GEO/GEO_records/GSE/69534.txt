TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for subconfluent and overconfluent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the changes in gene expression profile between subconfluent (80%) and overconfluent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line.

DESIGN
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes expression profiles in HT-1080 cells. Total RNAs from subconfluent (HT-1080_80%) and overconfluent (HT-1080_overconfluent) HT-1080 cells were harvested and subjected to the microarray analysis.
