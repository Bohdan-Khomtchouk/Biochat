TITLE
CD34+ and Treatment with UTP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) untreated and treated with UTP 10uM at 1, 6 and 24 h Keywords: Time couse

DESIGN
Highly purified CD34+ cells from 6 healthy donors were seeded at 1000000 cells/ml in serum free medium (EX vivo 15) w/o cytokines and treated with 10 uM UTP  for 1, 6 and 24 hours. As a control, CD34+ untreated cells were maintened in the same culture conditions for the same times. RNAs originating from the 6 donors were pooled in order to obtain at least 2 mg per sample (untreated and UTP-treated respectively).
