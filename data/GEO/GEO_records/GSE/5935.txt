TITLE
O1- > O37 serogroup conversion; KanR selected

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to show a serogroup conversion in Vibrio cholerae from O1 to O139. For this purpose, V. cholerae O1 WT = A1552 was grown on crab shell fragments to induce natural competence for transformation. Purified DNA (2 ug each) from strain VC73-orf6/7-Kan-A was added after 24h and the cells grown further for 24h. The VC73-orf6/7-Kan-A strain is a ATCC25873 derivative (both O37 serogroup) which harbors a Kanamycin cassette in the O37 region (as part of the operon between orf6 and orf7 w/o own promotor) for better selection. Transformants were selected on LB+Kan plates. Three clones were selected from each experiment and analyzed by microarray hybridization (BioPrime. Array CGH Genomic Labeling from Invitrogen). Two microarray replicates were done per clone.   Comparison of A1552 versus VC73-orf6/7-Kan-A is shown as control. A genotyping experiment design type classifies an individual or group of individuals on the basis of alleles, haplotypes, SNP's. Keywords: genotyping_design
