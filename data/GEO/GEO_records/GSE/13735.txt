SUMMARY
Salt Stress response of salt-tolerant genotype FL478 compared to IR29 Rice GeneChip was used to find differential expression between two rice genotypes under control and salt stress conditions Keywords: genotype and treatment comparison

DESIGN
Roots (tips) tissue was used for hybridization to GeneChips
