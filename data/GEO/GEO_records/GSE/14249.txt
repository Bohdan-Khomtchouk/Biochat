TITLE
Genes induced by IL-9 in the colon of transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to identify genes induced by IL-9 in the colon of IL-9-tarnsgenic mice (Tg5). Therefore, we performed a comprehensive study of the genes expressed in the colon of IL-9 transgenic and wild type FVB mice, taking advantage of the affymetrix microarray technology. Keywords: cytokine-induced response

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from a piece of the distal colon from IL-9 transgenic or wild type TVB mice. RNA samples from 4 different mice were pooled for each group before  hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
