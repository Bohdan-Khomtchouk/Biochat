TITLE
Expression data from white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT) of per2-/- and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that the circadian protein PER2 interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARgamma to repress its activity. PPARgamma is a master regulator of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism and is very abundant in adipose tissue. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in adipose tissue lacking the per2 gene. This analysis identified several PPARgamma target genes up-regulated in adipose tissue from per2-/- mice.

DESIGN
Per2-/- and per2+/+ male mice (Bae et al., 2001) were housed under 12 hr light/12 hr dark (LD) cycles. Mice 20 weeks old were sacrificed at the same time and adipose tissue (WAT and BAT) was collected for RNA extraction. 3 biological replicates per mouse/tissue.
