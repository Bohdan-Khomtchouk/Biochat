TITLE
Expression change in materal and fetal part of Cxcl14-/- placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cxcl14+/- mice were mated with Cxcl14+/- mice, the embryos of pregnant females were collected on E13.5. After genotyping, the maternal part and fetal part of Cxcl14-/- and Cxcl14+/+ placentas were dissect out to extract total RNA respectively (n = 3). Total RNA was extracted using PureYield™ RNA Midiprep System (Promega).The maternal part of placenta that contained mesometrial lymphoid aggregate of pregnancy (MLAp) and decidua basalis (DB); the fetal part ofplacenta consisted of spongiotrophoblast and labyrinthin layer.Microarray hybridization was performed using a Mouse NimbleGen cDNA Microarray Kit (Roche), at CapitalBio Co., Ltd.(Beijing,China). Primary data were scaned using NimbleGen MS200 (Roche), and then extracted using NimbleScan system (Roche).
