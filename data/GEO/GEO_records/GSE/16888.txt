TITLE
Expression data from GA-modified polpar transgenic roots

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We studied expression in roots of transgenic poplar (7171B4 genotype) plants expressing PcGA2ox1 or rgl1 under 35S promoter. Dwarf, semidwarf, wt-like and wt plants were used.

DESIGN
In vitro grown plants were sampled. Transgenic events with different levels of dwarfism were used. Two biological replications were used for each genotype.
