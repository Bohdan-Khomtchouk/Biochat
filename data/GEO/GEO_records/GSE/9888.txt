TITLE
Hybrid wine yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum

SUMMARY
This experiment is the analysis of the transcriptomes of several hybrid yeast strains obtained by crossing natural (from wine) isolates of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum. All isolations have been done from hybrid strains growing in exponential phase in YPD. Keywords: Strain comparison

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of three independent replicates of each yeast strain growing in exponential phase. Each replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F19-F22-F24) as indicated in the sample files. A single DNA (S. cerevisiae 3002 wine strain) genomic hybridization, from the same labeling reaction, was done on the same macroarrays for normalization.
