TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in isoflavone and 3,3’-diindolylmethane treated C4-2B prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of isoflavone and 3,3’-diindolylmethane treated C4-2B prostate cancer cells was conducted using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0. Array

DESIGN
C4-2B prostate cancer cells were treated with isoflavone and B-DIM for 6 hours or longer up to 72 hours. Gene expression profiling was conducted

PLATFORM
