TITLE
MCM2-7-dependent cohesin loading during S phase promotes sister-chromatid cohesion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employ ChIP-seq methodology to study genome-wide distribution of MCM2, NIPBL and cohesin in thymidine-arrested cells

DESIGN
Antibodies against MCM2, RAD21 or NIPBL were used to detect MCM2, RAD21 or NIPBL bound DNA in thymidine-arrested HeLa Tet-On cells

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
