TITLE
p53 and 5hmC in gene regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers, which could regulate multiple target genes involved in a widespread of cellular processes. The regulation of DNA methylation dynamics is critical for maintaining genome stability and proper gene expression. Recently a family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins has been shown to possess the enzymatic activity to oxidize 5mC to 5hmC, and contribute to DNA demethylation. Here we explore the relationship between p53 binding, 5hmC modification and gene activation using human p53-deficient cells (H1299).

DESIGN
H1299 Cells with and without p53

PLATFORM
