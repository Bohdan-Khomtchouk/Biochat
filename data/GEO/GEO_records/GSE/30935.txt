TITLE
The effect of mequindox on gene expression in rat liver tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Veterinary drug mequindox, 3-methyl-2-acethyl-quindoxaline-N-1,4-dioxide, belongs to a class of antibiotic and growth-prompting drug called quinoxalines that are often used in livestock and poultry industry. Previous researches focused on traditional toxicity. However, the effect of mequindox on endogenous metabolic profile remains unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying mequindox toxicity.

DESIGN
Two groups (control and high-dosed mequindox) were selected for GeneChip analysis based on PCA score of liver aqueous extracts and clinical chemistry changes.
