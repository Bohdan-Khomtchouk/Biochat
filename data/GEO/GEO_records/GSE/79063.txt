TITLE
Plasma-specific microRNA responses in rats treated with acute toxicity doses of aristolochic acid I

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study, goal was to scan the potential biomarker for acute kidney injury induced by aristolochic acid I (AAI).We utilized the microarry analysis to investigate the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in kidneys from rat treated by 40mg/kg AA I for 2-6 days. miRNAs with significantly different expression of global miRNA expression profile were validated by qRT-PCR. For miRNAs still significantly disregulation, we further examined the expression in plasma of rats treated with AAI dosed at 10, 20 and 40mg/kg AAI for 2-6 days by qRT-PCR. miRNAs with significantly dysregulation in plasma, their expressionÂ in brain, liver and heart was examined for kicking out the non-specific disregulation in AAI induced acute kidney injury, so that the significant dysregulation miRNAs with specificity in kidney and plasma was found as potential biomarkers for AAI induced acute kidney injury.

DESIGN
Five control and 15 kidneys treated with 40mg/kg AAI on day 2, 4 and 6 was examined by microarray.
