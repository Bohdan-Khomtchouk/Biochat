TITLE
Transcriptional response to stress in serum deprived mouse fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed gene expression profiling in order to identify targets of transcriptional response to stress in mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, where we induced p38/MAP kinase pathway using anisomycin.

DESIGN
Serum starved (72 h) mouse 3T3 cells were treated with anisomycin (188.5 nM) for 1, 3, and 6 h (in triplicates). Untreated, serum-starved cells were used as a control. RNA was collected and gene expression profiling using mouse Agilent expression array (4x44k) was performed.
