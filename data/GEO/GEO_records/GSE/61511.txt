TITLE
Gene expression data of human dermal pilla cells, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CD271+CD90+ mesenchymal stem cells before and after the induction toward dermal papilla cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess if human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs) could be induce to acquire dermal papilla (DP) properties (especially hair inductive capacity), hiPSCs were initially programmed in serum-free MSC medium with  FGF, TGFbeta and PDGF. Subsequently, hiMSCs were exposed to retinoic acid and activators of WNT, BMP and FGF signaling pathways. Global gene expression profiles were compared among primarily cultured human DP cells, hiPSC-MSCs before and after induction.

DESIGN
Human dermal papillae were microdissected and cultured from different donors. Induction from hiPSCs to MSCs and subsequent sorting of CD271+CD90+ subpopulation and thier induction to DP was performed using WD39 hiPSC lines in two independent experimentations to generate hiPSC-MSC-1,hiPSC-MSC-2 ipDPSC-1 and ipDPSC-2.
