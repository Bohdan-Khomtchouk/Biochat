TITLE
The effect on gene expression of Smchd1 deletion in primary MEFs, transformed MEFs and MEF tumours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Smchd1 appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the transformed fibroblast model. We find gene expression differences are most pronounced in the transformed MEFs. We always detect a small number of clustered genes and imprinted genes as differentially expressed, along with others involved in tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
The microarrays compared Smchd1 null and Smchd1 wildtype samples from different cell types (primary MEFs, transformed MEFs, tumours derived from transformed MEFs). Wildtype mice are FVB/N and Smchd1 null mice have the MommeD1 point mutation on a FBV/N background.
