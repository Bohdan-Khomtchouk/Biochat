TITLE
Expression data from lungs of Vldlr-/- mice and wild type (WT) B6129SF2/J mice that had received intranasal house dust mite (HDM) challenges to induce experimental asthma or saline, as a control.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is a multi-ligand receptor that mediates pleiotropic biological processes, such as brain development. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from lungs from mice that had been challenged with house dust mite to induce experimental asthma or saline, as a control. These data are used to obtain genes that are differentially expressed in response to VLDLR signaling.

DESIGN
We compared wild type and VLDLR knock out mice that had been sensitized and challenged with house dust mite or saline, as a control. There were total 16 samples with four biological relicates in each group.
