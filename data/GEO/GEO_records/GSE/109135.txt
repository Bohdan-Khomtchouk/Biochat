TITLE
Expression profiles of Ramularia collo-cygni (strain urug 2) grown on 6 conditions revealed common and different sets of regulated genes

ORGANISM
Ramularia collo-cygni

SUMMARY
The fungal RNA from 6 different conditions, especially one that mimics the plant environment (Barley Straw Agar â€“BSagar) was also sequenced to help in one hand the annotation and in other hand to uncover putative gene of interest that might be involved in the pathogenicity or the fungicide resistances for example.

DESIGN
Expression analysis of Ramularia collo-cygni (strain urug 2) grown on 6 conditions using RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL24511 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Ramularia collo-cygni)
