TITLE
Genome-wide study reveals dual function of histone binding protein ENAP1 in ethylene signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to study the gene expression in different samples under air and ethylene treatment. The goal of this study is to uncover how ENAP1 and H3K23Ac dynamically coordinate with EIN3 to regulate gene expression in response to ethylene.

DESIGN
Whole seedling mRNA profiles of 3-day old ein2, ein3eil1, ENAP1ox/ein2 and ENAP1ox/ein3eil1 (in COL background) were generated by sequencing, in 2 replications, using Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
