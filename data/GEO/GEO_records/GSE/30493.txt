TITLE
ECS-induced gene expression changes in mouse dentate gyrus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuronal activity-dependent gene expression plays important roles in neural plasticity. We use electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) as an in vivo model for neuronal activation to identify genes that are regulated by neuronal activity. Dentate gyri (DG) were microdissected 4 hours after sham or ECS treatment for gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
4 total samples were analysed (2 for each condition). Averaged expression values between sham and ECS samples were pair-wise compared.
