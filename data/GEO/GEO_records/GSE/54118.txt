TITLE
Validation experiment of copy number variations identified by next-generation sequencing in chickens (part 2)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Copy number variation (CNV) is important and widespread in the genome, and is a major cause of disease and phenotypic diversity. Herein, we perform a genome-wide analysis of CNVs in the 12 diversified chicken genomes based on next-generation sequencing. We apply aCGH experiments to confirm our predicted CNVs. Results from aCGH agree well with our findings and the Pearsonâ€™s correlation values between the test and reference samples range from 0.644 to 0.722.

DESIGN
The whole blood samples from Cornish, Rhode Island Red, and White Leghorn

PLATFORM
GPL18175 Agilent custom 1*1M chicken CGH array
