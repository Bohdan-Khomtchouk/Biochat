TITLE
microRNAs profiling in hippocampal cells of Self-Sustaining Status Epilepticus (SSSE) mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Status Epilepticus (SE) is induced in mice (C57Bl/6J) through electrical stimulation (90min, 100 ms trains of 1 ms, 2 trains per 1 s, 250 μA peak current intensity). RNA was extracted from the hippocampi at 24 h and 28 d after induction. In wild-type RNA was extracted on the 22nd day. microRNA expressions were measured via microarray technology using Exiqon's miCURY™ LNA Arrays.

DESIGN
3 conditions, SSSE mouse model at 24 h and 28 d, and a control group, each of 8 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11432 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 5th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
