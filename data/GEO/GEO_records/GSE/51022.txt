TITLE
ChIP-seq of MDA-MB-134 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP seq experiment in MDA-MB-134 cell line in order to map the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) binding sites following the estrogen treatment in an ILC model. We have characterized the genome wide recruit of ER and scaned the binding sites for the presence of cofactor motifs. The binding peaks were also correlated to E2 regulated genes in this ILC model.

DESIGN
Four samples were subjected to high throughput sequencing: E-ER (estrogen treated followed by ER IP), E-IgG (estrogen treated followed by IgG), V-ER (EtOH treated followed by ER IP) and Input (MCF7 genomic DNA)

PLATFORM
