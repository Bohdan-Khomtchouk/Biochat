TITLE
Expression data from cumulus cells that surround oocytes resulting in early or late cleaving embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Besides the established selection criteria based on embryo morphology and blastomere number, new parameters for embryo viability are needed to improve the clinical outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and more particular of elective single embryo transfer (eSET). The aim of the study was to analyse genome-wide whether the embryo viability was reflected by the expression of genes in the oocyte surrounding cumulus cells. Early cleavage (EC) was chosen as a parameter for embryo viability. Keywords: class comparison
