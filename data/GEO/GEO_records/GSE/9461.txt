TITLE
Paraquat treatment with 35 ppm for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The number and type of synthetic chemicals that are being produced worldwide continues to increase significantly. While these industrial chemicals provide numerous benefits, there is no doubt that some have potential to damage the environment and health. Toxicity must be evaluated and use must be carefully controlled and monitored in order to minimize potential damage. DNA microarray technology has become an important new technique in toxicology. We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism for toxicological study because it is a simple, fast-growing eukaryote that has been thoroughly characterized. In order to evaluate toxicity by newly synthesized or mixture chemicals, toxicity-induced gene expression alteration profiles by known chemicals should be collected. In our study, cells need to be exposed with same experimental cellular condition, semi lethal (IC50), respectively. In the case of paraquat (CAS; 1910-42-5), IC 50 was decided as 1250 ppm by growth curve with continuously diluted exposure, however, we had chosen 35 ppm for this experimental series because the reaction with low dose should be explored. Paraquat is used as a quaternary ammonium herbicide, and suspected to be a carcinogen, cardiovascular or blood toxicant, gastrointestinal or liver toxicant, kidney toxicant, neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant, respiratory toxicant, skin or sense organ toxicant. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Series contains 3 hybridization results from independent biological samples, and each experiment have high and low power scanned data respectively.
