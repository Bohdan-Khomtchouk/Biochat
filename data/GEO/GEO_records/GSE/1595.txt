TITLE
Human bladder smooth muscle cells - effect of stretch in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to determine the effect of cyclic stretch-relaxation ( " stretch " ) on gene expression patterns in normal diploid human bladder smooth muscle cells. Cells plated on silicone elastomer bottomed 6-well culture dishes were grown to ~80% confluence, serum-depleted for 48h and subjected to cyclic stretch-relaxation at 20% elongation for 4h. Cells seeded in stretch plates but not subjected to stretch served as controls. Total RNA was extracted from both groups of cells, reverse-transcribed, biotin-labeled, fragmented and hybridized to HG-U133A.  Four biological replicates were generated for each treatment group (non-stretched or stretched).
