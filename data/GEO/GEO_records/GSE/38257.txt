TITLE
A Novel Tumor suppressor network in squamous malignancies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The specific ablation of Rb1 gene in stratified epithelia (RbF/F;K14cre) promotes proliferation and altered differentiation but is insufficient to produce spontaneous tumors. The pRb relative, p107, compensates some of the functions of pRb in these tissues, however RbF/F;K14cre;p107-/- mice die postnatally. Acute pRb loss in stratified epithelia, using an inducible mouse model (RbF/F;K14creERTM), shows that p107 exerts specific tumor suppressor functions in its absence. After simultaneous absence of pRb and p107, p53 transcriptional function is impaired and Pten expression is reduced. All mutant mice develop spontaneous squamous tumors carcinomas rapidly. Gene expression analysis of mouse tumors, besides supporting the impaired p53 function and the susceptibility to Akt/mTOR inhibitors, also revealed significant overlap with human squamous carcinomas. Thus, RbF/F;K14creERTM;p107-/- may constitute a new mouse model for these malignancies. Collectively, these data demonstrate the existence of a previously unreported functional connection between pRb, Pten and p53 tumor suppressors, through p107, of a particular relevance in squamous tumor development.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between normal mouse skin and carcinomas arising in the skin of RbF/F;K14creERTM;p107-/- mouse. All mice were treated with tamoxifen.
