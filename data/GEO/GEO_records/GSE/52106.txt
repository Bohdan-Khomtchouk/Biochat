TITLE
Hes1 and Liver Glucocorticoid Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of HES1 during glucocorticoid signaling in the liver, we employed whole-genome microarray expressions in liver mRNA extracted from control and Hes1-liver knockout male mice (HESKOL) that had been adrenalectomized to remove endogenous glucocorticoids.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from the liver of control and HESKOL animals either untreated or treated with 1mg/kg of synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) for 6hours. Each group had an n of 3 mice.
