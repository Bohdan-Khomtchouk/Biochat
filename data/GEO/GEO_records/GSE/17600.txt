TITLE
Transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22 (RACE mapping)

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The purpose of these experiments was to determine the 5' and 3' transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22. Towards this end, we first carried out 5’ and 3’ RACE reactions from 1193 exons from 492 genes in these chromosomes using RNA isolated from 11 normal tissues and 5 cell lines. An average of 3 to 4 RACE reactions (5’ and 3’) was carried out from each gene. The products of the RACE reactions were analyzed by hybridization to tiling arrays interrogating the non-repeat portions of these chromosomes at 17 nucleotide resolution. A total of 26,688 RACE reactions were performed and pooled to be placed on to 1020 tiling arrays For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
