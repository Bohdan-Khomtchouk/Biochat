TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the injected Ppara-KO mice overexpressing TFEB specifically in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from Ppara (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) KO mice injected with TFEB specifically in liver. In order to identify the effects of TFEB overexpression together with Ppara absence on the liver transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the injected mice

DESIGN
For the analysis on the injected Ppara-KO mice overexpressing TFEB, total RNA was extracted from the liver of three mice; RNA extracted from the liver of not-injected mice was used as control.
