TITLE
H2A.B and MeDIP sequence result

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H2A.B is a unique histone H2A variant that shares only 40 ~ 50 % sequence identity with canonical H2A. It has only been identified in mammals and has quickly evolved with remarkable sequence diversity among different species. H2A.B is ubiquitously expressed in most cells and tissues. It is mainly deposited in gene body region. The localization of H2A.B is associated with methylated CpG islands in mouse ES cells. H2A.B facilitates transcription elongation to go through methylated CpG islands in the gene bodies. One typical example is that H2A.B regulates transcription elongation at imprinted loci.

DESIGN
We found H2A.B enriched in some methylated loci. Using ChIP-seq and MeDIP-seq, we test the correlation of H2A.B and DNA methylation.
