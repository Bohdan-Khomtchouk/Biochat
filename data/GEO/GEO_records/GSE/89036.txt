TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K27me3 in CD8 T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand epigenetic repression mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell differentiation, we performed ChIP-seq of repressive mark H3K27me3 in CD8 T cell subsets.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 histone modification in 4 CD8 T cell subsets.
