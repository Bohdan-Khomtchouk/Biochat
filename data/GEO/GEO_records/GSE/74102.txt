TITLE
Transcription Profiles of Regulatory T Cells in Follicular Lymphoma Lymph Nodes, Normal Lymph Nodes and Reactive Lymph Nodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that Tregs infiltrating follicular lymphoma lymph nodes (FLN) are quantitatively and qualitatively different than those infiltrating normal and reactive nodes (NLN, RLN, respectively). To gain insight into how such Treg populations differ, we performed RNA sequence (RNAseq) analyses on flow sorted Tregs from all three sources. We identify several molecules that could contribute to the observed increased suppressive capacity of FLN tregs, including upregulation of CTLA-4, IL-10, and GITR, all confirmed by protein expression. In addition, we identify, and confirm functionally, a novel mechanism by which Tregs target to and accumulate within a human tumor microenvironment, through the down regulation of S1PR1, SELL (L-selectin) and CCR7, potentially resulting in greater lymph node retention. In addition we identify and confirm functionally the upregulation of CXCR5, CXCL13 and IL-16 demonstrating the unique ability of the follicular derived Tregs to localize and accumulate within not only the malignant lymph node, but also localize and accumulate within the malignant B cell follicle itself. Such findings offer significant new insights into how FLN Tregs may contribute to the biology of follicular lymphoma and identify several novel therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Cross sectional comparison of transcription profiles of human regulatory T cells from normal lymph nodes (n=10), follicular lymphoma lymph nodes (n=12) and reactive lymph nodes (n=5).
