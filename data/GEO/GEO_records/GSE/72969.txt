TITLE
Molecular subtypes of metastatic colorectal cancer are predictive of patient response to chemo and targeted therapies (part 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that previously described molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer are associated with the response to therapy in patients with metastatic disease. We also identified a patient population with high FOLFIRI sensitivity, as indicated by their 2.7-fold longer overall survival when treated with FOLFIRI, as first-line regimen, instead of FOLFOX. Our results demonstrate the interest of molecular classifications to develop tailored therapies for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
The COSIVAL cohort was a retrospective multicenter study involving 6 French hospitals (CHU Trousseau - Tours, Hôpital Purpan - Toulouse, Hôpital Central - Nancy, Hôpital Dupuytren - Limoges, Hôpital Ambroise Paré – Boulogne Billancourt, Hopital de Lille ) and 2 comprehensive Cancer Centers (ICM, Montpellier; Institut Bergonié, Bordeaux)  and contained 68 patients
