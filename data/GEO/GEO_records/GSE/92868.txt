TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Wild-type and lncKdm2b-deficient ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially expressed genes in lncKdm2b-deficient ES cells

DESIGN
A two chip study using wild-type and lncKdm2b-deficient ES cells. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray were performed in accordance with the NimbleGen Gene Expression Analysis protocol (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., USA).

PLATFORM
GPL15887 NimbleGen Mouse gene expression array [100718_MM9_EXP] (gene-level version)
