TITLE
Comparison of murine whole gene expression on ligand immobilized surfaces

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For the studies of cell migration in various micro-environments, self-assembled monolayer surfaces presenting adhesive ligand, RGD peptide, were used for the assay. Presentation of RGD ligands was based on the immobilization reaction with alkanethiols on a gold surface. There were differences in cell morphology and migration according to the ligand affinity (linear vs. cyclic RGD) and manner of ligand presentation (dynamic vs. non-dynamic). In dynamic surface experiment, cells initially grown on the fibronectin-coated patterns were exposed to either linear or cyclic RGD while in non-dynamic surface experiment cells interacted with the immobilized RGD from the beginning. Goal was to compare how the affinity and spatio-temporal exposure of ligand affect the overall transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
Five conditioned surfaces were prepared by chemical treatment for cell culture:  Fibronectin, Dynamic linear RGD, Dynamic cyclic RGD, Non-dynamic linear RGD, and Non-dynamic cyclic RGD surfaces. Reference:  cells cultured in standard tissue culture flasks. Biological replicates:  triplicates for each experiment (each surface was 1.25 cm x 1.25 cm and three surfaces were used for each condition). When reached 70-80% of confluency, cells from the triplicates were pooled and harvested for RNA extraction. Hybridization replicates:  4 replicates for each condition.
