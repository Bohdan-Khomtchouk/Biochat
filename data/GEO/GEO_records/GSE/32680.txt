TITLE
miR-18a regulates the miRNAs by target  Dicer in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma HK-1 cell.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As the biogenesis of miRNAs depends on the cleavage by the RNase III enzyme Dicer, miR-18a may change the miRNA expression profiles by targeting dicer. We then performed the miRNA array assay to investigate the miRNA profiles change caused by miR-18a.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from two pairs,one is the miR-18a overexpression cell line compared to the miRNAs (control), the other is the over-expression miR-18a cell line transfected Dicer plasmid.
