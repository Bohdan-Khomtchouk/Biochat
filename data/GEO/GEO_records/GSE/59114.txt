TITLE
Single cell RNA_Seq in aging of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we use single-cell RNA-Seq to examine variation between individual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) as they age. We prepared libraries from long-term (LT-HSCs) (LSK CD150+CD48-), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) (LSK CD150-CD48-) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (LSK CD150+CD48+) from young (2-3 months) and old mice (22 months for C57BL/6 and 20 months for DBA/2). Population controls for each cell type and age were isolated by sorting processed in parallel.

DESIGN
RNA seq libraries from single cells and population controls. All prepared with SMARTer protocol for cDNA and amplification followed by Nextera protocol for library preparation.
