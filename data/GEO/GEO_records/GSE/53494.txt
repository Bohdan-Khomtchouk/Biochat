TITLE
Growth inhibition by Merlin expression correlates with a cross-tissue transcriptional signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found a broad case of tumour suppressor hypersensitivity for Merlin in cancer: Merlin expression in Merlin deficient cells (but not Merlin wild type cells) strongly suppresses proliferation regardless of tumour type or of additional somatic mutations. To study how Merlin selectively induced growth arrest in Merlin-deficient cells, global gene expression regulation by Merlin was examined by microarray in a set of four cell line pairs derived from different tumour types

DESIGN
Four Merlin-deficient and four Merlin wild type cell lines derived from four different tissues/tumour types (meninges, thyroid, kidney, breast) were infected with pLEX lentiviruses (Open Biosystems) expressing either wt Merlin or Merlin L46R (a tumour-derived loss-of-function mutant, used as a control). 24 hours after infection, fresh media containing 2.5ug/ml puromycin was added (drug selection) and cells grown for a further 24 hours, i.e. cells were harvested 48hour after infection. RNA was analyzed using GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). n=2 for Merlin-deficient cell lines; n=1 for Merlin wt cell lines
