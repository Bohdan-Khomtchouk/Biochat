TITLE
Expression analysis of human CRABP1 gene and R131A CRABP1 mutant in HT1080 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line after transfection CRABP1 gene and R131A CRABP1 mutant (arginine-alanine substitution in a protein active site, protein lacks the ability to interact with retinoic acid), compared to HT1080 line transfected with empty pLXSN vector.

DESIGN
A twelve samples on one chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate cultures of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line transfected with empty pLXSN vector, four HT1080 cell line cultures  transfected with CRABP1 gene and four HT1080 cell line cultures  transfected with R131A CRABP1 mutant. Each sample on a chip measures the expression level of 44,049 genes from human genome with three-fold technical redundancy.
