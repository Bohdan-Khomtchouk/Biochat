TITLE
Nucleosome mapping data from GR and cell-cycle regulated genes in human cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human UL3 cells (U20S derivatives containing GR and an MMTV-luc transgene) were treated with dexamethasone for 0, 1 or 4 hrs. Chromatin was harvested, digested with to ~70% mononucleosomes with MNase, and isolated mononucleosome fragments were used to probe custom Nimblegen genomic tiling microarrays. In addition, human HL60 cells were treated with or without DMSO to induce granulocyte differentiaton, and mononucleosome positions mapped. MNase digested bare DNA fragments of ~500 bp average length from UL3 cells was used as a control.

DESIGN
Mononucleosome positions at tiled genes for UL3 cells +/- dexamethasone and HL60 cells +/- DMSO.
