TITLE
RNA sequencing of mice spermatozoa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported RNA profiles of mice spermatozoa, a total of 35,288,825 reads matching 33,039 transcripts, including 27,310 coding transcripts, were obtained.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of the spermatozoa of 9-10 weeks adult mice were sequenced by RNA-seq,using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
