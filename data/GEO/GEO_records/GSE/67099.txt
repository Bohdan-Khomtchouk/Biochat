TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rectal tissues of E. coli O157 super-shedding and E. coli O157 negative cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Total RNA from rectal tissues of E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000 system. For comparative analysis, differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR. Fifteen of differentially expressed genes were related to innate and adaptive immune functions and were down-regulated in super-shedders, which could be one of reasons for super-shedding phenomenon.

DESIGN
We performed a differential analysis of transcriptomes of rectal tissues collected from E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders, to study molecular mechanisms of super-shedding phenomenon.
