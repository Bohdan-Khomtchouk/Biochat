TITLE
Gene Expression of Circulating B Lymphocytes for Smoking-related Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Females

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cells produce important cytokines regulate bone metabolism. We comparison gene expression patterns of circulating B cells in blood from 20 postmenopausal female smokers with low or high bone mineral density (BMD): 10 low BMD vs. 10 high BMD. In total 17 differentially expressed genes were identified with smoking-related osteoporosis. Keywords: disease state analysis
