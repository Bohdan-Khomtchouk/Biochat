TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa response to potable (tap) water and freshwater from a pond

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common bacterium in the terminal plumbing system of buildings and it is from this niche that a substantial fraction of infections are acquired. To better understand P. aeruginosa biology in this environment, we examined the transcriptomes in tap water and pond water.

DESIGN
Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptomes from four conditions were compared using dilute R2B (1/2R2B) as the control condition. Three conditions were in duplicate and the tap water condition was in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
