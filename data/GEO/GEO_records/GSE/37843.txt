TITLE
Expression data generated by syndecan-1 silencing in malignant mesothelioma STAV-AB cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic responses of syndecan-1 silencing in a human mesothelioma cell line was followed with microarray analysis. To project the transcriptome analysis on the full-dimensional picture of cellular regulation, we applied a novel method of network enrichment analysis which elucidated signalling relations between differentially expressed genes and pathways acting via various molecular mechanisms. Our results suggest that syndecan-1 regulates cell proliferation in a highly complex way, although the exact contribution of the altered pathways necessitates further functional studies.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (Human Gene 1.0 ST) of malignant mesothelioma cells were studied in cells silenced for syndecan-1  (N=3) and scrambled control cells (N=3)
