TITLE
Modulation of Lactobacillus plantarum gastrointestinal robustness by fermentation conditions enables identification of bacterial robustness markers

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles of control Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 cells were compared with a lp_1669 deletion mutant in MRS and 2*CDM media.

DESIGN
A continuous culture was performed on MRS and 2*CDM media and whole genome transcriptome analysis was perfomred on the WCFS1 and NZ3417CM (harboring a chlooramphenicol resistance marker (cat) replacement mutation in lp_1669) strains.

PLATFORM
GPL13984 Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 15K 60-mer array, Version 3.1, our ID LPAG3.1_8
