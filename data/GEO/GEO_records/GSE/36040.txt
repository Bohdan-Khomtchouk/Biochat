TITLE
Diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of leaf throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed at regular interval during a 48-hr period in 9 different growth stages from transplanting until harvesting to characterize the diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of rice and to understand the transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire the growth under natural field conditions.
