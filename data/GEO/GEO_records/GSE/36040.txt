TITLE
Diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of leaf throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed at regular interval during a 48-hr period in 9 different growth stages from transplanting until harvesting to characterize the diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of rice and to understand the transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire the growth under natural field conditions.

DESIGN
The uppermost fully expanded leaf in the main stem was collected at 2-hr intervals during a 48-hr period at 9 different growth stages encompassing the vegetative, reproductive and ripening stages. All samples were obtained from rice plants grown in the field during the 2008 cultivation season.
