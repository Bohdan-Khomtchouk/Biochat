TITLE
Role of the AMP deaminase Amd1p in purines interconversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this work, we show that under specific conditions, defect in AMP deaminase activity strongly impairs yeast cell growth and we establish that AMP deaminase is required for correct balance between adenylic and guanylic nucleotides. Study of the Amd1p homologs, Yjl070p and Ybr284p, reveals that overexpression of these proteins cannot suppress phenotypes associated to /amd1/ deletion but instead mimic in a wild-type strain a loss of Amd1p function. Data presented combined  global transcription analyses to measurements of intracellular  nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: yeast strains implied in purines interconversion.
