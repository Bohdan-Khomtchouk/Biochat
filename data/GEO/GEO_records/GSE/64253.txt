TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the Arabidopsis root quiescent center

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis quiescent center (QC) is a small group of cells with low mitotic activity located at the center of the root stem cell niche. Its transcriptional profile was previously analyzed using two repeats of cells FACS isolated using the WOX5 marker. To get more power in analyzing QC transcriptional profile, we generated three additional samples of the QC, using the QC-specific marker WOX5.

DESIGN
Three replicates of FACS-sorted GFP-positive cells from WOX5:GFP roots.
