TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in the salmon parr precocious and non-precocious testis

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
The objective was to compare gene expression in salmon precocious and non-precocious parr testis tissue.

DESIGN
Nine microarray hybridisations were carried out in total as part of this loop design. Total RNA from 3 pools(PG1-PG3) each of 4 precocious fish testes were compared with 3 pools (NP1-NP3) each of 10 non-precocious fish testes. There were no direct dye swaps but there was overall dye balance in the loop
