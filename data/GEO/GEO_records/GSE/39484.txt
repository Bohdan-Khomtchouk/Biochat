TITLE
Differential expression analysis of miRNAs in goat (Capra hircus) mammary gland  between peak and late lactation by Solexa sequencing

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Solexa high-throuthput sequencing technology for miRNA differential expression profiles.  Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to Ovis aries genome.  The results were validated by qRT-PCR.  Our study represents the first detailed analysis of miRNA expression profiles in goat mammary gland tissues, with biologic replicates generated by RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
miRNA  expression profiles of goat mammary gland tissues between peak lactation and late lactation were generated by Illumina/Solexa sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL15473 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Capra hircus)
