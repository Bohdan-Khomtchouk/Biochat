TITLE
VEPH1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and its relationship to TGF-B signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study examines the functional role of VEPH1, a PH domain containing protein and the human ortholog of Drosophila melted, in ovarian cancer cell lines. Elevated VEPH1 is associated with FOXO and Hippo signaling and was found to suppress TGF-ß induced target genes.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cell lines were established as either CdCl2 inducible Flag-tagged VEPH1 expression or mock-transfected. Gene expression profiles were then generated both with and without the presence of TGF-ß to induce TGF-ß signaling.  3 replicates per treatment group were used.
