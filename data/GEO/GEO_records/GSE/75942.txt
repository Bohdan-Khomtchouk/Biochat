TITLE
Zac1 is a regulator of the imprinted gene network (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the imprinted transcription factor Zac1 targets, we overexpressed Zac1 in a neuroblastoma cell line and measured both the regulated expressed genes by Differential Gene Expressed analysis and Zac1 binding sites throughout the mouse genome by ChIP-seq. We have shown that Zac1 regulates and binds closed to many genes belonging to the Imprinted Gene Network.

DESIGN
Determination of Zac1 binding sites in transfected Neuro-2A cells (2 biolobical replicates) using ChIP-seq, with the chromatin input as a control.
