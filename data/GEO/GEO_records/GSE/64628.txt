TITLE
siRNA knockdown of GALNT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma HA22T and PLC5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the whole genome profile of GALNT1 silenced HA22T and PLC5 cells

DESIGN
HA22T and PLC5 cells were transfected with non-targeting and GALNT1 specific siRNA with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for 48 hours and extracted for total RNA
