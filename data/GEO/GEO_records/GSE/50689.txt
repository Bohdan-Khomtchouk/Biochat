TITLE
The Fusarium graminearum Histone H3 K27 Methyltransferase KMT6 Regulates Development and Expression of Secondary Metabolite Gene Clusters

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq of histone modifications and RNA-seq in WT and kmt6 mutant Fusarium graminearum grown in high and low nitrogen conditions.

DESIGN
Two replicates of RNA seq for WT and kmt6 strains at high and low nitrogen. Four histone modification ChIPs in WT and kmt6 mutant strains at high and low nitrogen, plus two histone modifications in a kmt6+ complemented strain at high nitrogen.

PLATFORM
