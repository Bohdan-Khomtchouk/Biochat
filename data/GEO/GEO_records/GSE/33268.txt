TITLE
Synergistic, context-dependent and hierarchical functions of hematopoietic progenitor niche components.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Specialized niche environments specify and maintain stem and progenitor cells, but little is known about the identities and functional interactions of niche components in vivo. Here, we describe a modular system for the generation of artificial hematopoietic niches in the mouse embryo. A circumscribed tissue that lacks niche function but is physiologically accessible for hematopoietic progenitor cells is functionalized by individual and combinatorial expression of four factors, the chemokines Ccl25 and Cxcl12, the cytokine Scf and the Notch ligand DLL4. The distinct phenotypes and variable numbers of hematopoietic cells in the resulting niches reveal synergistic, context-dependent and hierarchical interactions among niche effector molecules. The surprisingly simple rules determining niche outcomes enable the in vivo engineering of artificial niches conducive to the presence of distinct myeloid or T or B lymphoid lineage precursors.

DESIGN
The dataset comprises 24 samples divided into eight sample groups each representing a different lymphoid progenitor cell type isolated from wild-type (+/-) or transgenic (-/-) thymic niches. -/-, Foxn1-deficient genotype; +/-, Foxn1 heterozygous phenotype; DP, CD4/CD8 double-poisztive thymocytes; DN3, CD4/CD8-negative stage 3 thymocytes; SP4, CD4 single-positive thymocytes; SP8, CD8 single-positive thymocytes; B IgM-, IgM surface negative B cells; B IgM+, IgM surface positive B cells; B IgM- -/-, IgM surface negative B cells from Foxn1-deficient genotype.
