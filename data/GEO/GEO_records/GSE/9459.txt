TITLE
pld-Fonctional analysis of the double mutant phospholipasezeta1,2 in response to abiotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-01_pld - pld - Role of PLDzeta to abiotic stress adaptation - A double mutant PLDzeta1,2 was obtained in a Columbia background. 12-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings, wt or double mutant, were treated with either NaCl (200 mM), mannitol (400 mM) or with 4degreeC temperature during 3 h. 3 biological replicates were pooled. Keywords: gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
