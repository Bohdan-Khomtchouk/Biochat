TITLE
Transcription data from Normal Skin and Nonlesional and Lesional Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema Skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common pruritic dermatitis with macroscopically nonlesional skin that is often abnormal.  Therefore, we used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify cutaneous gene transcription changes associated with early AD inflammation as potential disease control targets.  Skin biopsy specimens analyzed included normal skin from five healthy nonatopic adults and both minimally lesional skin and nearby or contralateral nonlesional skin from six adult AD patients. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
We used high-density oligonucleotide Affymetrix Human U133A GeneChip arrays to identify cutaneous gene transcription changes associated with early AD inflammation as potential disease control targets.  Skin biopsy specimens analyzed included normal skin from five healthy nonatopic adults and both minimally lesional skin and nearby or contralateral nonlesional skin from six adult AD patients.
