TITLE
Gene expression profiles of DLD1 cells in which GATA6 or LGR5 expression was suppressed.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations in APC or Î²-catenin that cause aberrant activation of Wnt signaling are responsible for the initiation of colorectal tumor development. LGR5 is specifically expressed in stem cells of the intestine, stomach and hair follicle, and plays essential roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis. LGR5-positive stem cells have been shown to be responsible for the intestinal adenoma initiated by some mutations in APC . Furthermore, it has recently been reported that Lgr5, which is associated with the Frizzled/Lrp Wnt receptor complex, interacts with R-spondins and thereby activates Wnt signaling. However, the function of LGR5 in colorectal tumorigenesis has been unclear. Here we show that LGR5 is required for the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells. We also show that the transcription factor GATA6 directly enhances the expression of LGR5.

DESIGN
DLD1 cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing an shRNA targeting GATA6 or LGR5.
