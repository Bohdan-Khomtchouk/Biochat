TITLE
Bead-based kinase phosphorylation profiling identifies SRC as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we describe a bead-based method capable of profiling tyrosine kinase phosphorylations in a multiplexed, high-throughput and low-cost manner. This approach allows for the discovery of tyrosine kinase-activating events, even when the DNA sequence is wild-type. In an effort to pilot the establishment of a tyrosine kinase activation catalog, we profiled tyrosine phosphorylation levels of 62 tyrosine kinases in 130 human cancer lines, and followed-up on the frequent SRC phosphorylation in glioblastoma. Keywords: quantitative measurements of tyrosine phosphorylation levels on tyrosine kinases

DESIGN
Total protein lysates were collected from 130 cancer cell lines. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels on 62 tyrosine kinases were measured with the bead assay.
