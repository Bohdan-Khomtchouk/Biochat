TITLE
Bead-based kinase phosphorylation profiling identifies SRC as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we describe a bead-based method capable of profiling tyrosine kinase phosphorylations in a multiplexed, high-throughput and low-cost manner. This approach allows for the discovery of tyrosine kinase-activating events, even when the DNA sequence is wild-type. In an effort to pilot the establishment of a tyrosine kinase activation catalog, we profiled tyrosine phosphorylation levels of 62 tyrosine kinases in 130 human cancer lines, and followed-up on the frequent SRC phosphorylation in glioblastoma. Keywords: quantitative measurements of tyrosine phosphorylation levels on tyrosine kinases
