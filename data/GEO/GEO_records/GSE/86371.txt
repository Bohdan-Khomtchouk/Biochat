TITLE
RNA-Seq analyses of liver samples in mice fed ad libitum or subject to a 24 hr fast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To systemically identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulating energy metabolism, we performed transcriptome analyses to simultaneously profile mRNAs and lncRNAs in key metabolic organs in mice under pathophysiologically representative metabolic conditions by using a microarray platform (Mouse LncRNA Array V2.0, Arraystar). This microarray platform has been thoroughly evaluated for detecting mRNAs, but to further confirm its accuracy in detecting lncRNA expression at a genome-wide level, we performed RNA-seq for the same ad libitum and fasting liver samples used for the microarray. For those differentially expressed lncRNAs (fasting vs ad libitum) identified by microarray, 93.4% could be detected by RNA-seq and the Pearson correlation between microarray and RNA-seq of expression changes for these lncRNAs is 0.71.

DESIGN
Examination of livers from four mice fed ad libitum and four mice subject to a 24 hr fast

PLATFORM
GPL21493 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Mus musculus)
