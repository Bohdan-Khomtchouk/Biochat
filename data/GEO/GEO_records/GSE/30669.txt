TITLE
PDK1 Signaling Towards PLK1-Myc Activation Confers Oncogenic Transformation and Tumor Initiating Cell Activation and Resistance to mTOR-targeted Therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) has been predominately linked to PI3K-AKT pathway, it may also evoke additional signaling outputs to promote tumorigenesis. Here we report that PDK1 directly induces phosphorylation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which in turn induces Myc phosphorylation and protein accumulation. We show that PDK1-PLK1-Myc signaling is critical for cancer cell growth and survival and small molecule inhibition of PDK1/PLK1 provides an effective approach for therapeutic targeting Myc-dependency. Intriguingly, PDK1-PLK1-Myc signaling induces an embryonic stem cell-like gene signature associated with aggressive tumor behaviors and is a robust signaling axis driving cancer stem cell (CSC) self renewal. Finally, we show that PLK1 inhibitor synergizes with mTOR inhibitor to induce synergistic anti-tumor effect in colorectal cancer by antagonizing a compensatory Myc induction. These findings identify a novel pathway in human cancer and CSC activation and provide a therapeutic strategy for targeting Myc-associated tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance.
