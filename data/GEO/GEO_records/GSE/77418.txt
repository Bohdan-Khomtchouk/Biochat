TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of adult cardiac tissue of control versus overfed female sheep prenatally treated with bisphenol A

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Developmental programming is the concept that environmental factors during fetal growth can alter development, metabolism and physiology of an organism, thus diseases can be programmed by intrauterine influences. The fetal origin of health and disease hypothesis has received strong support from experimental studies in animals including livestock species.  Using a sheep model, it has been shown that developmental changes of ewe offspring may be susceptible to maternal pregnancy bisphenol A (BPA) treatment. For example, prenatally BPA treated female offspring tended to have reduced birth weight. In this study we sought to identify gene expression differences in ewe offspring as a result of maternal pregnancy BPA treatment on a control or high-caloried diet. Samples of heart tissues were collected during the second breeding season, allowing us to examine gene expression changes in ewes prenatally treated with BPA and maturing under the different diets.

DESIGN
Pregnant ewes were randomized to two groups and then treated with bisphenol A+vehicle or vehicle alone. Their female offspring were assigned randomly to either a control-fed or over-fed group. This division of each of the treatment groups by feeding assignment created four groups: control, prenatal BPA-treated (BPA), overfed control (obese) and overfed prenatal BPA-treated (ObBPA). Four biological replicates were sequenced for each of the four groups using mRNA-seq.
