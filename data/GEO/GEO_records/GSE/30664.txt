TITLE
Analysis of Gene expression of human Th17 and Th1 clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T cell clones were derived according to standard protocols using different mix of cytokines, once assessed for their functional profile were studied for gene expression. The purpose of this study is to analyze human Th1 and Th17 clones with and without stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin to measure differences in gene expression that can distinguish the two lineages.

DESIGN
Human T cell clones were derived according to standard protocols using different mix of cytokines, once assessed for their functional profile were studied for gene expression
