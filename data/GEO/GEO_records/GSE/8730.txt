TITLE
Effects of TGF-β1 on expression profile of human pulp and odontoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) is the most extensively studied growth factor in dentin-pulp complex, with pleiotropic effects on pulp response and healing. Our main objective was to analyze the expression profile of pulp tissue and odontoblasts, and the effects of TGF-β1 on these profiles in cultured human pulp and odontoblasts with a specific interest in the anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Keywords: Response to TGF-β1 treatment
