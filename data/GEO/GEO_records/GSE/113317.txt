TITLE
RNA splicing in the transition from B cells to antibody secreting cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to explore the splicing landscape in unstimulated versus stimulated B cells in both ELL2 sufficient and deficient mice.  This would allow us to see the magnitidue of splicing changes in the transition from unstimulated to stimulated B cells, as well as the importance of ELL2 in this process.

DESIGN
We analyzed 15 mouse B cell samples.  Four of the samples were replicates for wild type unstimulated B cells, four were unstimulated ELL2-/- B cells, four were +LPS wild type stimulated B cells collected @ 72 hours, and the final three were +LPS ELL2-/- stimulated B cells collected @ 72 hours.
