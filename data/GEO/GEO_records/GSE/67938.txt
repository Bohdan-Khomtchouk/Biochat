TITLE
Germline duplication of ATG2B and GSKIP predisposes to familial essential thrombocythemia rapidly progressing to acute leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
No major predisposing gene for familial myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the autosomal dominant transmission of a 700 kb duplication in four geographically-related families predisposes to MPN rapidly progressing to acute leukemia. Using induced pluripotent stem and primary cells to explore hematopoietic differentiation, we demonstrate that overexpressed ATG2B and GSKIP enhance hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, including megakaryocytic through increasing their sensitivity to TPO. ATG2B and GSKIP cooperate with acquired JAK2, MPL and CALR mutations during MPN development. Thus, the germline duplication changes the fitness of cells harboring signaling mutations and increases the probability of disease development.

DESIGN
14 samples corresponding to iPSC and control cases (Cy5) where hybridized in dual color against commercial normal reference DNA (Cy3) of matched sex, except for samples with unknown gender for which male normal was used as reference.
