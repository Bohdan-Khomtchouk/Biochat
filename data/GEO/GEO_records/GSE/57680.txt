TITLE
RNA-sequencing of luminal epithelium and stroma cells isolated by LCM from pseudopregnant day 4 Msx1/Msx2 knockout and control uteri

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently demonstrated that Msx genes, which encode muscle segment homeobox (Msh) transcription factors, regulate the transition of the luminal epithelium from high to low apicobasal polarity that is critical for implantation. In Msx deficient uteri (Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d), apicobasal polarity remains high and implantation fails to occur. However, information on the underlying molecular mechanism of Msx-dependent regulation of epithelial polarity, and the nature of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are characteristic of Msx genes, remain limited. In this study, we analyzed gene expression by RNA-sequencing in the luminal epithelium and stroma isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) on day 4 of pseudopregnancy in Msx1f/f/Msx2f/f and Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d uteri. We found upregulation of extracellular matrix components in the stroma and downregulation of immunity-related genes in both the luminal epithelium and stroma isolated from Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d mice. In addition, tight junction protein Claudin 1 and small proline-rich protein (Sprr2) were substantially upregulated in Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d epithelia.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of luminal epithelium and stroma from a wildtype Msx1f/f/Msx2f/f and a uterine-specific knockout Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d mouse were asessed by RNA-sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq 1500 system
