TITLE
Expression data from OVCAR-3 cells overexpressing histone H1.3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is a deadly gynecological malignancy for which novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets are imperative for improving survival. To investigate the role of histone H1 in ovarian cancer cells, we overexpress a histone H1 variant, H1.3, in the OVCAR-3 epithelial ovarian cancer cell line.  RNA was extracted from OV-3/H1.3(H) cells (OVCAR-3 with overexpression of H1.3) and control cells of OVCAR-3 transfected with vectors without H1.3.  The microarray chip used was human Affymetrix ST1.0 array.  Gene expression changes caused by overexpression of H1.3 in OVCAR-3 cells were identified.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array was used to identify the changes in transcriptome of OVCAR-3 caused by overexpression of H1.3
