TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of targets regulated by miR-146a in primary endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human vein umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) were transfected with pre-miR control and pre-miR 146 (Ambion) in order to identify targets (direct and indirect) downregulated by miR-146a in endothelial cells. 164 transcripts were downregulated with a fold change â‰¥ 1.2.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from cells transfected in HUVEC with pre-miR control and pre-miR 146a. Three independent transfections were performed for each condition. 2 replicates for control re-control and 3 for pre-miR 146a were analyzed.
