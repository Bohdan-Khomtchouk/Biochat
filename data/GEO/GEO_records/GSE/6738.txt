TITLE
Identification of novel functional TBP-binding sites and general factor repertoires

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a comprehensive ChIP-on-chip analysis for 28 transcription factors on a large set of known and novel TBP binding sites experimentally identified via ChIP-cloning. A large fraction of identified TBP binding sites is located in introns or lacks a gene/mRNA annotation and found to direct transcription. Distinct profiles for general transcription factors and TAF-containing complexes were uncovered for RNAP II promoters located in CpG- and non-CpG islands suggesting distinct transcription initiation pathways. Keywords: TBP, Promoter, ChIP-on-chip, transcription factor profiling
