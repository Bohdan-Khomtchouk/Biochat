TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in different T cell clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to analyze the expression of genes in Th17 cell clones derived from a patient affected by multiple sclerosis before and after activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Keywords: Gene expression, T cell clones, Th17 characterisation

DESIGN
The T cell clones were derived according to well known protocol, using different cytokines, and classified on the basis of their ability to produce cytokines. Once characterized for their production of different cytokines, they were stimulated with anti-CD23 and anti-CD28 and used to prepare microarray experiments comparing the stimulated clones against the unstimulated ones.
