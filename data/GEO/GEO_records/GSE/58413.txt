TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells and epithelial cells purified from Pten KO prostate tumours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gr-1+ myeloid cells are recruited in prostate conditioanal Pten null tumours (Ptenpc-/-). To identify the secreted factors that may be released by Gr-1+ cells and epithelial cells in the tumour microenvironment, we compared, by gene expression analysis, the cytokine profile of Gr-1+ myeloid cells sorted from Ptenpc-/- tumours with the profile of immune cell-depleted Ptenpc-/-  epithelial cells. qRT-PCR validation for IL-10, IL1rn, IL-1α, IL-6, VEGF, TNFα, CXCL1, CCL2 and CXCL12 was also performed.

DESIGN
Pten pc-/- 8 weeks old mice were sacrificed and whole prostates were isolated and processed to single cell suspension. mRNA from sorted Gr-1+ myeloid cells and epithelial cells was used for gene expression analysis. Cells sorted from 3 mice/each experiment were pulled together. 2 independent experiments were performed.
