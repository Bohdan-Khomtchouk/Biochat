TITLE
Whole genome RNA-seq analysis of wild type or HIPK2-/- immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM), with or without vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or HIPK2-/- immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM) were infected with VSV for 6h, followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis. Conclusions: HIPK2 deficiency aggravates viral infection and inhibited the production of IFNÎ².

DESIGN
Wild type or HIPK2-/- immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM) were infected with VSV for 6h. Cells were harvested, followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis.

PLATFORM
