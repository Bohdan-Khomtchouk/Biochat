TITLE
Potential link between biotic defense activation and recalcitrance to induction of somatic embryogenesis in shoot primordia from adult trees of white spruce (Picea glauca)

ORGANISM
Picea glauca

SUMMARY
The goal is to examine the molecular aspects underpinning somatic embryogenesis (SE) within shoot tissues of adult white spruce trees by conducting transcriptome-wide expression profiling of shoot explants taken from responsive and nonresponsive genotypes.
