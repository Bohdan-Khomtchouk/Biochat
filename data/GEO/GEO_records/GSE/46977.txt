TITLE
Potential link between biotic defense activation and recalcitrance to induction of somatic embryogenesis in shoot primordia from adult trees of white spruce (Picea glauca)

ORGANISM
Picea glauca

SUMMARY
The goal is to examine the molecular aspects underpinning somatic embryogenesis (SE) within shoot tissues of adult white spruce trees by conducting transcriptome-wide expression profiling of shoot explants taken from responsive and nonresponsive genotypes.

DESIGN
One-color analysis of vegetative buds in somatic embryogenesis responsive and nonresponsive genotypes, before and after 7 days of SE induction. There are 5 biological replicates for each of the 4 combinations of genotype/time of induction for a total of 20 slides. Each replicate is comprised of a pool of 6 buds.
