TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Tcf1 binding locations in splenic CD8 T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped genome-wide Tcf1 binding locations in mature CD8 T cells to identify its direct target genes.

DESIGN
This experiment aims to identify genome-wide binding locations for Tcf1 transcription factor in mature CD8 T cells. The CD8 T cells were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice by negative selection. The chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated by an anti-Tcf1 antiserum or control rabbit serum (without immunization). The immunoprecipitated fragments were then used in high throughput sequencing. Data processing then revealed > 3000 high-confidence Tcf1 binding peaks across the CD8 T cell genome. One important finding is that Tcf1 binds directly to Cd4 gene silencer, and thus explain its important role in suppressing the CD4 coreceptor in mature CD8 T cells.
