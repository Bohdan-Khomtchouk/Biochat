TITLE
SOX2 overexpression effect on human lung squamous cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified SOX2 as a new oncogene and a likely driver of recurrent 3q26.3 amplifications in lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.  SOX2 is a crucial transcription factor implicated in Embryonic and Neural Stem Cells, that we found widely activatd in human lung SCC. This part of the study aimed at analyzing the transcriptomic consequences of SOX2 overexpression in a simple in vitro model (human lung squamous immortalized cells).

DESIGN
Human lung squamous BEAS-2B cells were transduced for Control or SOX2 expression, and their transcriptomes compared using Affymetrix arrays.
