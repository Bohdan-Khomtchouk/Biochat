TITLE
Tn-seq experiment with sub-inhibitory concentrations of WhiB7-specific antibiotics in Mycobacterium smegmatis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
A pool of ~55,000 transposon mutants was exposed to sub-MIC antibiotics to monitor for conditionally essential genes under all selections with the hypothesis the genes would be positive regulators of WhiB7

DESIGN
Tn-seq of Mycobacterium smegmatis untreated or treated with one of the following antibiotics: Roxithromycin, Chloramphenicol, or Tetracycline.
