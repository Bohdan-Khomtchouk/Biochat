TITLE
Histone turnover marks the boundaries of cis-regulatory domains

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cellular memory is maintained at the Drosophila homeotic gene clusters by cis-regulatory elements who mechanism of action is unknown. We have examined chromatin dynamics in the Drosophila genome by measuring histone turnover levels at high resolution. Surprisingly, homeotic gene clusters display characteristic histone turnover profiles with conspicuous peaks at boundaries of cis-regulatory domains superimposed over regions of very low turnover. Peaks of histone turnover precisely correspond to nuclease hypersensitive sites for epigenetic silencing proteins. Our results suggest that epigenetic regulation is facilitated by histone turnover, which maintains continuous accessibility ov cis-regulatory DNA.
