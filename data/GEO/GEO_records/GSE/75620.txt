TITLE
Transcriptomic study of hepatocarcinoma cells exposed to sorafenib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
sorafenib is the treatment of reference for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We applied sorafenib on the human HCC cell line Huh7 and the subclone shRb, carrying a stable knock-down of the expression of the RB1 gene, a key regulator of liver carcinogenesis. Our aim was to better understand the physiologic and metabolic consequences of the exposure of HCC cells to sorafenib. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression at an early time point (9h) after exposure to sorafenib

DESIGN
Whole-genome microarrays were used to study the transcriptome of Huh7 cells exposed to Sorafenib
