TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of mRNA from oocyte, 1 cell, 16/32 cells, 128/256 cells, 3.5hpf and 5.3hpf zebrafish embryos (Wild type; AB line)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
mRNA seq based approach to determine the transcriptome dynamics during early development To study the mechanisms regulating this developmental event in zebrafish, we applied RNA deep sequencing technology and generated comprehensive transcriptome profiles of 6 developmental stages from oocyte to early gastrulation. We determined the expression levels of maternal and zygotic transcripts and clustered them based on expression pattern. We identified a large number of novel transcribed regions in un-annotated regions of the genome, as well as splice variants with an estimated frequency of 40-75% during early zebrafish embryogenesis. Our data constitute a useful resource for developmental studies, gene discovery, and genome annotation.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from pooled embryos of desired stages and one RNA seq library was generated for each sample.  Totally 6 stages were selected: Maternal, 1cell, 16/32 cells, 128/256 cells, 3.5hpf and 5.3hpf
