TITLE
Gene expression analysis in wild-type and OsHOX24 Arabidopsis overexpression line

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Homeobox transcription factors are known to regulate plant growth and development. Recently, they have also been implicated in abiotic stress responses. To analyze the role of HD-ZIP I subfamily member, OsHOX24, we constitutively overexpressed it in Arabidopsis. The physiological analyses revealed that overexpression of OsHOX24 gene severely reduced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants as compared to wild-type. We used microarrays to study the global effect of OsHOX24 overexpression in Arabidopsis under control condition.

DESIGN
Wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on MS medium for 10-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14 h light and 10 h dark. The 500 ng of total RNA sample isolated from each tissue sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Three biological replicates for each sample of wild-type and OsHOX24 overexpression line were used for microarray analysis.
