TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisae strains overexpressing RNA-binding hnRNP Yra1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with an imbalance proportion of Yra1, a component of THO/TREX. We used microarrays to the global impact of Yra1 overexpression and found that no general impact was observed.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in minimal medium raffinose and were shifted to galactose (2%) for four hours in liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
