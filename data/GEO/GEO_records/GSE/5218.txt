TITLE
Comparison of gene regulation by Gcn5 under KCl stress in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
This is parallel comparison of gene regulation by Gcn5 in evolutionarily divergent yeasts S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Our study showed Gcn5 is required for a similar spectrum of stress responses in both organisms, including the response to KCl. This DNA microarray studies is to find conserved or diverged gene regulation pattern under KCl stress condition in the two yeasts.  There are 6 subsets in total, 3 subsets in each evolutionarily divergent yeasts including the following: 1 gcn5 mutant compared to wt under rich medium without treatment, 2 gcn5 mutant compared to wild type both under KCl treatment,  3 wild type strains under KCl treatment compared to wild type without treatment.
