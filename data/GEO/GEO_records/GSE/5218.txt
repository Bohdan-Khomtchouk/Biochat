TITLE
Comparison of gene regulation by Gcn5 under KCl stress in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This is parallel comparison of gene regulation by Gcn5 in evolutionarily divergent yeasts S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Our study showed Gcn5 is required for a similar spectrum of stress responses in both organisms, including the response to KCl. This DNA microarray studies is to find conserved or diverged gene regulation pattern under KCl stress condition in the two yeasts.  There are 6 subsets in total, 3 subsets in each evolutionarily divergent yeasts including the following: 1 gcn5 mutant compared to wt under rich medium without treatment, 2 gcn5 mutant compared to wild type both under KCl treatment,  3 wild type strains under KCl treatment compared to wild type without treatment. Keywords: stress response, Gcn5, Comparative genomics, Transcriptional co-activator

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling experiment in which gene expression in logarithmically growing cultures of test groups was compared to that of the control groups in rich medium at 25C. There are 6 subsets in total, 3 subsets in each yeast including the following: 1 gcn5 mutant compared to wt under rich medium without treatment, 2 gcn5 mutant compared to wild type both under KCl treatment, 3 wild type strains under KCl treatment compared to wild type without treatment.  RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA expression profiling analysis using the established protocols (Xue et al, 2004). Independent RNA preparations were used to hybridize to microarray slides with dye swap. Data normalized with 'Lowess' per chip per spot normalization.
