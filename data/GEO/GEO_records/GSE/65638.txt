TITLE
Epigenome analysis of female identical twins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of blood samples from eight female identical twins of Han Chinese for forensic age prediction, age 21 to 32. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs at a single-nucleotide resolution. Samples included 8 pairs of identical female twins of Han Chinese.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA isolated from blood of identical twin pairs were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
