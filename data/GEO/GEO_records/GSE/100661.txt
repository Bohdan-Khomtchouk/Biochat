TITLE
MT1-MMP (MMP14)-dependent gene expression in APOE-null vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
VSMC-specific MT1-MMP gene targeting in APOE-null mice promotes atherosclerosis and iliac artery aneurysm formation. To determine the MT1-MMP-dependent regulation of VSMC function, whole-genome transcriptomes of wild-type and MT1-MMP-null APOE-null VSMCs were determined. We used microarray-based transcriptome analysis to detect MT1-MMP-dependent regulation of VSMC function under atherogenic conditions.

DESIGN
VSMCs were isolated from two independent pairs of SM22α-Cre(−)Mmp14(fl/fl)Apoe(−/−) and SM22α-Cre(+)Mmp14(fl/fl)Apoe(−/−) mice fed Western diet for 3 months. Total RNA was extracted and used for hybridization with Mouse Gene ST 2.1 Strip.
