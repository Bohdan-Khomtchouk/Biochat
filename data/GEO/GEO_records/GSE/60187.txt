TITLE
Evaluation of Niacinamide effects on murine primary macrophage transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine MafB/c-MAF double KO (Maf-DKO) primary macrophages are known for their unlimited non-tumorigenic self-renewal ability (Aziz et al., 2009). In an in vitro screen for cytokines and small molecules we identified Niacinamide (NAM) a potent inhibitor of their proliferative potential characterized by a reversible cell cycle arrest.

DESIGN
The aim of the project is to identify the transcriptional network established in Maf-DKO macrophages upon Niacinamide (NAM) treatment., during an early (1 hour) and a late (10 hours) response phases.
