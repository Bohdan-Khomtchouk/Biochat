TITLE
Characterizing the monocyte H3K4me3 landscape throughout development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) was then performed to establish the H3K4me3 landscape in neonatal and adult CD14+ monocytes. As development progressed from neonate to adult, monocytes gained the activating mark H3K4me3. The decreased H3K4me3 abundance at immunologically important neonatal monocyte gene promoters correlated with reduced gene expression, providing evidence that neonatal immune cells exist in an epigenetic state that is distinctly different from adults, and that this state contributes to neonatal specific immune responses.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K4me3 in CD14+ monocytes in 4 experimental groups, each in triplicate: under 30 weeks gestation preterm neonate, 30-36 weeks gestation preterm neonate, over 37 weeks term neonate, adult

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
