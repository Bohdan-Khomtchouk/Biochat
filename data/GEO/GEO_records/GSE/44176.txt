TITLE
Genome wide binding of Insensitive in w[1118] embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq for Drosophila Insensitive, together with IgG control. Chromatin extracted from 2.5-6h w[1118]  embryos and 6.5-12h w[1118]  embryos.

DESIGN
Samples from two time points were analyzed:  2.5-6h embryos and 6.5-12h embryos. In each time point there is one Insv ChIP sample and one IgG control sample.
