TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of peripheral monocytes and glioblastoma-infiltrating macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation that have been shown to modulate tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and to act as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Although miRNAs have been linked to tumor progression, the connection between tumor-mediated immune modulation and miRNAs has yet to be explored. Specifically, how the miRNA dysregulation affects the monocyte-derived glioblastoma-infiltrating macrophages, the most abundant immune cell population within the glioblastoma microenvironment, and their immune suppressive properties has not been evaluated to date. Here we managed to purify the glioblastoma-infiltrating macrophages from the tumor microenvironment and compared their miRNA expression profile with the matched peripheral monocytes from the peripheral blood of the same GBM patient as well as with healthy donors. Of note, several most down-regulated miRNA candidates revealed in this study, including miR-142-3p, were also known for their role in mediating tumor-associated immunosuppression. These results suggest a novel approach to identify miRNA immune therapeutics using a two-step process: 1) screen miRNA expression from tumor-associated immune cells relative to normal immune cell, and 2) select and prioritize potential candidates on the basis of binding to immunosuppressive pathways or mechanisms.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 12 samples, including peripheral monocyte samples from 4 healthy donors, peripheral monocytes from 4 GBM patients and matched tumor-infiltrating macrophages extracted from the glioblastoma microenvironment, were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiles of 1732 unique mature miRNA sequences via the Phalanx Human miRNA OneArray Microarray v3 Platform.
