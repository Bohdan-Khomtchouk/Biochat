TITLE
Altered hepatic lipid metabolism in mice lacking both the melanocortin type 4 receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the effect of normal chow (0 % cholesterol) or a semisynthetic diet (high sugar, 0.02 % cholesterol) fed to mice lacking either Mc4r, Ldlr or both and wildtype animals (total of 4 genotypes) by generating an expression profile of their livers after 6 months by RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
We investigated mice lacking either Mc4r, Ldlr or both and wildtype animals fed with normal chow or a semisynthetic diet with 10 replicates for each of the 8 resulting groups (4 genotypes * 2 diets).
