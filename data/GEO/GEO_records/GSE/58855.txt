TITLE
A transcriptional map following the developmental trajectory of the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Developmental transitions can be described in terms of morphology and individual genes expression patterns, but also in terms of global transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Most of the large-scale studies of such transitions, however, have only been possible in synchronized cell culture systems. Here we generate a cell type specific transcriptome of an adult stem-cell lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf using RNA sequencing and microarrays. RNA profiles of stomatal entry, commitment, and differentiating cells, as well as of mature stomata and the entire aerial epidermis give a comprehensive view of the developmental progression.

DESIGN
To obtain pure cell populations corresponding to different stomatal lineage cell types we used Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in combination with markers of early (SPCHp::SPCH-YFP, SSY), middle (MUTEp::nucGFP, MG), and late (FAMAp::GFP-FAMA, FGF) precursor stages, as well of mature stomata (enhancer trap E1728::GFP, E1728G) and a marker of the entire epidermis (ML1p::YFP-RCI2A, ML1Y). To minimize transcriptional differences due to age, all cell types were sorted from 14-day old aerial rosettes, and the specificity of expression pattern at this common time point confirmed via confocal microscopy. Total RNA was extracted from purified protoplasts (2,000 to 20,000 cells/replicate; 3 replicates/marker line) and transcript abundance measured using ATH1-121501 microarrays.
