TITLE
A TATA binding protein regulatory network

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Background:  Eukaryotic genes are controlled by proteins that assemble stepwise into a transcription complex.  How the individual biochemically-defined assembly steps are coordinated and applied throughout a genome is largely unknown.  Here, we model and experimentally test a portion of the assembly process involving the regulation of the TATA binding protein (TBP) throughout the yeast genome.  Results:  Biochemical knowledge is used to formulate a series of coupled TBP regulatory reactions involving TFIID, SAGA, NC2, Mot1, and promoter DNA.  The reactions are then linked to basic segments of the transcription cycle and modeled computationally. A single framework is employed, allowing the contribution of specific steps to vary from gene to gene.  Promoter binding and transcriptional output are measured genome-wide using ChIP-chip and expression microarray assays.  Mutagenesis is used to test the framework by shutting down specific parts of the network. Conclusion:  The model accounts for the regulation of TBP at most transcriptionally active promoters and provides a conceptual tool for interpreting genome-wide data sets.  The findings further demonstrate the interconnections of TBP regulation on a genome-wide scale. Keywords: genetic mutation analysis

DESIGN
We analyzed at least 2 dye-swapped individual biological replicates for each mutant.  All included are 16 homotypic (independent biological replicates of reference vs. reference genotype) hybs which were used for the independent " no change " data set.  There are a total of 150 expression arrays.
