TITLE
Murine pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells: Wild-type vs. NOX1 deficiency (miRNA profiling)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NOX1 is a catalytic subunit of nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase, mainly localized to smooth muscle cells in the vasculature. We investigated the pathology underlying the pulmonary arterial hypertension-like phenotype demonstrated in mice deficient in the Nox1 gene (Nox1-KO). Spontaneous enlargement and hypertrophy of the right ventricle, accompanied by hypertrophy of pulmonary vessels, were demonstrated in Nox1-KO at 9-18 weeks of age. Since an increased number of Î±-smooth muscle actin-positive vessels was observed in Nox1-KO, pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were isolated and characterized by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. In Nox1-/Y PASMC, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced without any change in the expression of endothelin-1, and hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1a and HIF-2a, factors implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. microRNA expression profiling of mouse pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells in wild-type and NOX1-KO was analyzed.

DESIGN
Pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were harvested form 3 mice.
