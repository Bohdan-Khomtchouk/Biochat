TITLE
microRNA profilling in dendritic cells of systemic lupus erythematosus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that alterations in the function of dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the role of DCs participating in SLE remains unclear. We profiled the microRNAs (miRNAs) of LPS-stimulated DCs in SLE patients and found diffentially expressed miRNAs in DCs of such group patients.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, DC (as controls) vs. SLG (as patients with SLE group) cells. Biological replicates: 5 control replicates, 5 patient replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL18402 Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
