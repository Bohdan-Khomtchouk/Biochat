TITLE
BMP4-directed trophoblast differentiation of human embryonic stem cells is mediated through a Î”Np63+ cytotrophoblast stem cell state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that FCM-BMP4-treated hESC differentiate into bona fide CTB by direct comparison to primary human placental tissues and isolated CTB through gene expresson profiling.

DESIGN
We have compared gene expression profiling of FCM-BMP4-treated hESC to a panel of fetal tissues and first trimester tissues. Moreover, we have analysed the expression profiles of cells after shRNA knock-down of p63 compared to Scramble upon BMP4 treatment. Difference in expression between CTB trimester 1 / trimester 3 and PSC were compared the difference between FCM-BMP4-treated hESC and PSC at each time point collected.
