TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for Monoclonal Gammopathies samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic events mediating transformation from the pre-malignant monoclonal gammopathies (MG) to multiple myeloma (MM) are unknown.

DESIGN
To obtain a comprehensive genomic profile of MG from the early to the late stages we performed high resolution analysis on purified plasma cells from 20 MGUS, 20 smoldering MM (SMM) and 34 MM by high density 6.0 SNP-array.
