TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression between a mouse genetic model of glioma (Mut6) and an origin cell type (neural stem cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression (mRNA) between neurosphere cultures from Mut6 gliomas and wt SVZ neural stem cells (NSCs)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from neurosphere cultures from Mut6 gliomas was compared to those from wt SVZ

PLATFORM
GPL6099 Illumina mouse-6 v1.0 expression beadchip
