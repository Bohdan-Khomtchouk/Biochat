TITLE
Identification of DNA methylation-independent epigenetic events underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of endogenous and exogenous methylation in human ccRCC tumor and adjacent normal tissue to determine DNA methylation and chromatin structure states in ccRCC.

DESIGN
Nuclei from the 6 patient kidney tumor and normal samples were either treated or not-treated with M.SssI enzyme, DNA was extracted and bisulfite-converted, then hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
