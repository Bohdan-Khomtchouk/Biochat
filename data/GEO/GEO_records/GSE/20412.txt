TITLE
Global gene expression of Poncirus trifoliata, Citrus sunki and their hybrids under infection of Phytophthora parasitica

ORGANISM
Citrus trifoliata ; Citrus sunki ; Citrus sunki x Citrus trifoloata

SUMMARY
A microarray containing 62,876 unigenes selected from CitEST database and prepared by Nimblegen Systems was used for identifying candidate resistance genes against P. parasitica at 48 hours after inoculation Four resistant and four susceptible F1 hybrids were selected from the population derived from the cross between Citrus sunki Hort. ex. Tan. and Poncirus trifoliate (L.) Raf cv. Rubidoux, respectively susceptible and resistant to P. parasitica. It was proposed that differentially expressed genes between resistant and susceptible hybrids and their parents provide essential candidates for identifying transcripts involved in disease resistance

DESIGN
A total of 62,876 unigenes (18,712 unigenes of Citrus sinensis; 31,583 unigenes of Citrus reticulata and 12,581 unigenes of Poncirus trifoliate) selected from CitEST database assembled from the EST submitted to NCBI (Genebank accession number EY649559 to EY842485) were used to construct genome-wide oligonucleotide cDNA microarrays by Roche NimbleGen Systems using a multi-step approach to select probes with optimal predicted hybridization characteristics. Three probes were selected per unigene, comprising a probe set, and each probe set is represented on the final array by two replicates. All probes were designed as ‘‘perfect match’’ (PM) oligonucleotides (oligos).
