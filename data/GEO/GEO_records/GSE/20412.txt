TITLE
Global gene expression of Poncirus trifoliata, Citrus sunki and their hybrids under infection of Phytophthora parasitica

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
A microarray containing 62,876 unigenes selected from CitEST database and prepared by Nimblegen Systems was used for identifying candidate resistance genes against P. parasitica at 48 hours after inoculation Four resistant and four susceptible F1 hybrids were selected from the population derived from the cross between Citrus sunki Hort. ex. Tan. and Poncirus trifoliate (L.) Raf cv. Rubidoux, respectively susceptible and resistant to P. parasitica. It was proposed that differentially expressed genes between resistant and susceptible hybrids and their parents provide essential candidates for identifying transcripts involved in disease resistance
