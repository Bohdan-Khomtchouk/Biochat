TITLE
Gene expression study of macrophages during early foreign body reaction

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Foreign body reaction (FBR), initiated by adherence of macrophages to biomaterials, is associated with several complications. Searching for mechanisms potentially useful to overcome these complications, we have established the signaling role of macrophages in the development of FBR. This study profiles gene expression of in vitro fibrinogen activated macrophages as well as that of freshly isolated macrophages from 3-days implants, against a background of unactivated macrophages/monocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from fibrinogen activated macrophages, FBR macrophages and macrophages from blood (control). Samples were processed in triplicate on Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array GeneChips, adding up to 9 arrays in total. Microarray processing was performed at DNAVision (Charleroi, Belgium). The RMA comparisons between macrophases are linked below.
