TITLE
Drosophila Sex Hierarchy Regulated Gene Expression in 48 hour APF Pupae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila melanogaster undergoes a complete metamorphosis, during which time the larval male and female forms transition into sexually dimorphic, reproductive adult forms.  To understand this complex morphogenetic process at a molecular-genetic level, we performed whole genome microarray analyses.   In somatic tissues at 48 hour After Puparium Formation (APF), 173 sex-biased transcripts that likely function downstream of the doublesex (dsx) branch of the sex determination hierarchy were identified.  The mode of regulation of the sex-specific isoforms of DSX (DSX-F and DSX-M) was examined.  It was determined that for most downstream targets, DSX-F and DSX-M regulate gene expression in the same manner, but that one isoform acts as a more potent regulator. Keywords: wild type; genetic modification
