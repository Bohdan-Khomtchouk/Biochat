TITLE
Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in human prostate cancer through loss of ABCA1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted gene expression profilling of common prostate cell lines for comparison with genome-wide DNA methylation profiles for the same cell lines to study the impact of differential DNA methylation in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicate sets of PrEC, RWPE-1, DU 145, and LNCaP cells. This Series represents the gene expression profiling data only. The methyl-Seq data were submitted directly to SRA and are represented by accession SRA049689.1.
