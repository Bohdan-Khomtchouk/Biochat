TITLE
Genomic features shaping the landscape of meiotic double-strand break hotspots in maize [MNase-Seq]

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We report the application of next generation sequencing techonology to study nucleosomal occupancy in flowers containing zygotene meiocytes. The results show DSB enrichment in nucleosome depleted regions associated with RAD51

DESIGN
To identify distribution characters of nucleosomal occupancy, we compared the genomic distribution of MNase-Seq reads to Illumina-sequenced meiotic input

PLATFORM
GPL15463 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Zea mays)
