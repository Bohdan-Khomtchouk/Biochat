TITLE
RNA Misplicing in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq splicing data from the  corneal endothelia of FECD patients and controls reveal hundreds  of differential alternative splicing events. These include  events previously characterized in the context of myotonic dystrophy  type 1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well  as splicing changes in genes related to proposed mechanisms of  FECDpathogenesis

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was used to compare corneal endothelial specimens from subjects with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.
