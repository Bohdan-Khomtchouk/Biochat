TITLE
Expression data from miRNAs in colorectal cancer tissues with and without liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to identify miRNAs involved in the pathology of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis and investigate their underlying mechanisms. A total of 39 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between 16 primary CRC tissues with liver metastases and 16 CRC tissues without liver metastases from 32 patients by Affymetric miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
16 coloretcal cancer tissues with liver metastasis and 16 colorectal cancer tissues without liver metastasis were included in this study for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs between colorectal cancer tissues with and without liver metastasis.
