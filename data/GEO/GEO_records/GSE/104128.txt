TITLE
Effects of two weeks of intermittent hypoxia on liver and adipose tissue in lean mice,

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lean mice were submitted to either normoxia (controls) or CIH (CIH+) for 14 days. We analyzed liver and epidydimal adipose tissue signatures using transcriptomic analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver of 7 mice CIH+ and  8 mice controls to liver and 8 mice CIH+ and  8 mice controls to epidydimal adipose tissue .  An Illumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion) was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to obtain biotin-labeled complementary RNA from 250 ng total RNA.

PLATFORM
