TITLE
Evolutionary re-wiring of p63 regulatory landscape has both epigenetic and transcriptomic implications and is the underlying cause for epidermal differences between mouse and human [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mapping p63 regulatory and epigenetic landscape in mouse keratinocytes using ChIP-Seq techniques

DESIGN
p63 ChIP DNA, histone ChIP DNA were extracted from 2 similar mouse keratinocyte cell-lines (MK1, MK2) and sequenced
