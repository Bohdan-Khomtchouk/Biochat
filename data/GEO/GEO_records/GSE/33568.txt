TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors and human neuroendocrine tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) arise from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells. SI-NETs are often well-differentiated tumors and most patients have regional or distant metastases at initial presentation. MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators which are important in diverse biological processes and can function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. This study aims to identify an exclusive SI-NETs miR profile that may have a critical role in development, diagnosis, prognosis and progression of these malignancies.
