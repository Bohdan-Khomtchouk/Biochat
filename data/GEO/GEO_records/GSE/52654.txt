TITLE
SNP arrays to detect copy number changes in t(1;19) E2A-PBX1 positive leukemias

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was to detect the identity and range of copy number alterations in a subtype of childhood leukemia defined by t(1;19) translocaitons The data will be presented in the manuscript " Direct and indirect targets of the E2A-PBX1 leukemia-specific fusion protein " to be published in PLOS One, authors Christofer Diakos, Yuanyuan Xiao, Shichun Zheng, Leo Kager, Michael Dworzak, Joseph L. Wiemels

DESIGN
A series of leukemia DNAs were subjected to Affymetrix SNP 5.0 (Nsp) arrays
