TITLE
Expression data from L3 Drosophila antennal-eyediscs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Growth of the drosophila eye imaginal discs is controlled by the activation of Notch in the dorsal-ventral boundary. Overexpression in the eye disc of the Notch ligand Delta together with lola and pipsqueak from the GS(2)88A8 line induces tumoral growth. We used microarray to analyze the expression profile of tumoral discs.

DESIGN
Antennal-eye discs of Drosophila L3 larvae were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrayas. Two genetic conditions were analyzed: tumoral eye discs (ey-Gal4 GS(2)88A8 UAS-Dl) and control eye discs (GS(2)88A8 UAS-Dl). Three different biological replicates of each condition, each one consisting on 300 hundred pairs of eye discs, were analyzed.
