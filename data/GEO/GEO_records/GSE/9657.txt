TITLE
Characterization of five novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell-surface signaling systems

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Cell-surface signaling is a sophisticated regulatory mechanism used by gram-negative bacteria to sense signals from outside the cell and transmit them into the cytoplasm. This regulatory system consists of an outer membrane-localized TonB-dependent receptor (TonB-dependent transducer), a cytoplasmic membrane-localized anti-sigma factor and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor. By microarray analysis we have identified the regulons of four novel P. aeruginosa signaling systems. For that, the ECF sigmas PA0149, PA2050, PA2093 and PA4896 have been overexpressed in P. aeruginosa and their target gene candidates have been identified using DNA microarray. Keywords: Overexpression of ECF sigma factors
