TITLE
Early parity-induced gene expression in mouse mammary cell subtypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined the effect of early pregnancy on the gene expression profiles of stromal and various epithelial mammary cell subpopulations in mice.

DESIGN
Mammary cell subpopulations were isolated from parous and age-matched virgin control mice. Three independent replicates were assessed per cell subpopulation and treatment group, resulting in a total of 35 samples.
