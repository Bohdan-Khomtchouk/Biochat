TITLE
Genes regulated by TGF-beta in bovine articular chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine articular chondrocytes were grown in micromass culture and were either untreated or treated with 5 ng TGF-b1/ml for 8 hours to identify genes regulated by TGF-b.

DESIGN
Six total samples were analyzed. Three biological replicates of untreated bovine articular chondrocytes grown in micromass culture and three biological replicates of bovine articular chondrocytes grown in micromass culture and treated with 5ng TGF-b1/ ml for 8 hours.
