CLEFMA selectively induces necrotic cell death of H441 lung adenocarcinoma cells via oxidative stress

SUMMARY
Despite the growing understanding about the molecular basis of oncogenesis, prevention and cure of cancer remains an unsurpassed challenge. Chemotherapeutic drugs are the mainstay in managing patients diagnosed with any form of cancer. The emergent chemo-resistance, morbid toxicities and overall inefficacy of current drug portfolios in many cancers necessitate the development of new drugs with novel mechanism of action and selective action on cancer cells.  We investigate the molecular action of new chemotherapeutic drug, CLEFMA, uponH441 lund adenocarcinoma cells. The drug was packaged into liposomes and ectopically applied to cells. A control condition comprised from vehicle treated cells. CLEFMA proved to be an effective means of eliminating lung cance rells via oxidative stress induced necrotic cell death. Investigate the effect of new chemotherapeutic drug, CLEFMA.
