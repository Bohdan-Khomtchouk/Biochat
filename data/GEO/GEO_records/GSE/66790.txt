TITLE
lexA mutant vs Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
The lexA gene was deleted from WP3 genome to construct the WP3ΔlexA strain. The two strains were cultured at 20MPa and 4°C and the transcriptional profiles were compared.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates sample and 6 technical replicates for each experiment

PLATFORM
GPL16568 Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 whole genome microarray
