TITLE
Knockdown and overexpression of SLC3A2 in MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To knock down SLC3A2, MCF10A cells were either transfected with control siRNAs, or siRNAs specifically targetting SLC3A2. Samples were either untreated or treated with TGFb. Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing was performed on these samples. MCF10A cells with and without SLC3A2 overexpression construct were either untreated or treated with TGFb. Ribosome profiling was performed on these samples.

DESIGN
1 biological replicate of each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
