TITLE
Expression analysis of gene expression chang in Homo sapiens Small cell lung carcinoma cells NCIH446  after knock down Follitin1 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Homo sapiens Small cell lung carcinoma cells NCIH446  after knock down of Follitin1 gene expression

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA extracted from  NCIH446 cells transfected with siRNA negative control and NCIH446 cells knock down of Follitin1 with siRNA . Each chip measures the expression level of 34.558 genes  collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI
