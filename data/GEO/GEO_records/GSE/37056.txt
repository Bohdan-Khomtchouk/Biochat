TITLE
Expression data from fosb gene modified mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine fosB regulation of neurogenesis, depression and epilepsy, we compared the gene expression profiles of wild type, fosBd/d and fosB-null mice by microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to neurogenesis, depression and epilepsy are altered in the hippocampus of fosB-null mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the hippocampus of wild-type, fosBd/d and fosB-null mice was prepared using ISOGEN and RNeasy Mini kits.  For DNA microarray experiments, total RNA (100ng) was added to poly-A control and treated with WT Expression Kit. cDNA was labeled using WT terminal labeling kit and hybridized with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform (GPL6246).
