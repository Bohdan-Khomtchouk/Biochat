TITLE
Expression profile by RNA-seq of wild type or Caenorhabditis elegans mutant for the Werner syndrome gene ortholog treated with or without vitamin C

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the impact of a mutation in the wrn-1 gene compared to wild type worms and the dietary supplementation of vitamin C on the global mRNA expression of the whole C. elegans by the RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Whole C. elegans mRNA profiles at the L4 stage of wild type and wrn-1(gk99) mutant animals treated with or without 10 mM ascorbate were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using the HiSeq 2000 machine form Illumina. Detailed statistics on the quality of the reads were calculated with FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). The 50 base pairs raw sequences were aligned on the C. elegans ce10/W220 genome with TopHat using the Ensembl annotations provided with the Illumina iGenomes. The htseq-count software ( http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq ) was used to count the number of reads aligned to each gene. These counts were then normalized relative to the sequencing depth with DESeq.
