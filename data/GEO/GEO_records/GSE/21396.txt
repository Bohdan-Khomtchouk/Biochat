TITLE
Spatio-temporal gene expression of various tissues/organs throughout entire growth in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
An overview of the expression pattern of all rice genes under natural field conditions based on microarray analysis of different organs and tissues at various stages of growth and development from transplanting to harvesting.

DESIGN
A total of 48 samples representing organs/tissues at various stages of growth and development with 3 replicates each except for one anther sample with 2 replicates. Vegetative organs such as leaf blade, leaf sheath, root and stem were sampled during the vegetative, reproductive and ripening stages. Young inflorescence, anther, pistil, lemma, palea, ovary, embryo, and endosperm were sampled at various stages of development.

PLATFORM
