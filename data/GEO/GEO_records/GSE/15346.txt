TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the eukaryotic-type ser/thr kinase PknB in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
The function of the Staphylococcus aureus eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase PknB was investigated by transcriptome analysis using DNA-microarray technology and biochemical assays. The transcriptional profile reveals a strong regulatory impact of PknB on the expression of genes encoding proteins which are involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, and glutamine synthesis.

DESIGN
To investigate the functional role of PknB in S. aureus DNA microarray experiments were performed. In this experiment, the impact of the deletion of PknB was investigated. Each experiment was performed 5 times including a dye swap resulting in five chips per competitive comparison to increase reproducibility. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of cDNA probes.
