TITLE
Differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages in the presence of GM-CSF +/- forskolin (FSK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages are central mediators of the innate immune system that can be differentiated from monocytes upon exposure to cytokines. While increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels inhibit many lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -elicited macrophage inflammatory responses, the effects of elevated cAMP on macrophage differentiation are not well understood. We have differentiated monocytes to macrophages in the presence of GM-CSF or GM-CSF + FSK to elevate cAMP levels and determine its effects on differentiation.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed separately on samples from 3 human donors: 3 control and 3 forskolin-treated samples.
