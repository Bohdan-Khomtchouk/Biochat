TITLE
Global mRNA/LncRNA expression analysis of pancreatic tumors causing type3C Diabetes Mellitus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic tumors with small size can cause type3C Diabetes Mellitus (PCA-DM) but the mechanism is unknown. In this study we aimed at revealing the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) expression patterns of pancreatic tumors that triggered PCA-DM. Four pancreatic tumors from patients with PCA-DM (A1-A4), four pancreatic tumors from patients without PCA-DM (B1-B4), and four pancreatic tissues from patients with pancreatitis were individually profiled with Agilent microarrays(Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0).

DESIGN
Pancreatic tumors with PCA-DM or without PCA-DM, and pancreatic tissues of pancreatitis were individually profiled.
