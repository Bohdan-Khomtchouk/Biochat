TITLE
Insights into the function of long noncoding RNAs in sepsis revealed by gene co-expression network analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of neutrophyl granulocytes from 24 subjects was used to investigate their differences regarding sepsis and aging using gene network approaches.

DESIGN
Two-color hybridization design. Aliquots of total RNA isolated from adult or elder individuals with sepsis or healthy controls were labeled with Cy3 and co-hybridized with a common reference RNA pool (Universal Human Reference RNA, Agilent, cat #740000) labeled with Cy5 to Agilent DNA SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60k v2 Oligoarray (design ID # 039494) . Biological replicates: 6. No technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL22628 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Feature Number version; reannotated)
