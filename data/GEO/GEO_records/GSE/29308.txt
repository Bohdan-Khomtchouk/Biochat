TITLE
Raf/MEK signatures in zebrafish liver cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
An inducible oncogenic cell line ZFL-ΔRaf1-ER was established, in which oncogenic human Raf-1(ΔRaf1) can be activated in zebrafish liver cells by administration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT). Transcriptional profilling of the ZFL-ΔRaf1-ER cells with and without administration of 4HT and/or the MEK inhibitor U0126 defined the gene signatures transcriptionally regulated by hyperactive Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling in zebrafish liver cells.

DESIGN
The ZFL-ΔRaf1-ER cells were cultured in 12-well plates till confluence. Cell were starved for 4h in plain medium and susequently treated with or without 1µM 4HT and/or 30µM U0126 for 12h. Biological triplications were taken for each condition.
