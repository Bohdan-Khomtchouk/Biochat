TITLE
Genome-wide occupancy map of GATA-1 in proliferating and differentiating murine ES cell derived erythroid progenitors (ES-EP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We find GATA-1 occupies 6,600 sites in proliferating erythroid progenitors and 10,600 sites in differentiating progenitors.  80-90% of GATA-1 binds within intragenic or intergenic regions, while < 20% of GATA-1 is found within 2kb of TSS.

DESIGN
Assaying GATA-1 occupancy in normal erythroid progenitors in both proliferating and differentiating conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
