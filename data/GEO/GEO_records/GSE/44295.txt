TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of  primary uveal melanoma cells, normal uveal melanocytes, neural crest stem cells, embryonic stem cells and uveal melanoma cell lines MUM2B and OCM1A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in primary uveal melanoma cells and normal cell controls

DESIGN
The HumanHT-12 v3 gene expression microarray (Illumina) was used to analyze RNA isolated from snap-frozen primary uveal melanoma tissue isolated from enucleated eyes and from normal cell controls.
