TITLE
IL-10 signaling remodels adipose chromatin architecture to limit thermogenesis and energy expenditure [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Signaling pathways that promote adipose tissue thermogenesis are well characterized, but the physiologic limiters of energy expenditure are largely unknown. Here we show that ablation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 improves insulin sensitivity, protects against diet-induced obesity, and elicits the browning of white adipose tissue. Mechanistic studies define bone marrow cells as the source of the IL-10 signal and mature adipocytes as the target cell type mediating these effects. IL-10 receptor alpha is highly enriched in mature adipocytes and is induced in response to cold, obesity and aging. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq reveal that IL-10 represses the transcription of thermogenic genes in adipocytes by altering chromatin accessibility and inhibiting ATF and PGC-1alpha recruitment to key enhancer regions. These findings identify the IL-10 axis as a critical and potentially targetable regulator of thermogenesis, and expand our understanding of the links between inflammatory signaling and adipose tissue function in the setting of obesity.

DESIGN
D5 differentiated cells treated with and without IL10. Input served as a control for C/EBPβ enrichment. ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared using the Kapa LTP Library Preparation Kit (Kapa Biosystems). ChIP-Seq was performed as described (Tong et al., 2016).

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
