TITLE
The effect of ethanol on the cultured human breast cancer line MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for breast cancer in humans. We used the established breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to analyze the effects of ethanol on gene expression at the RNA level. In addition, we carried out studies on protein levels and the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage independent manner. The DNA microarray results are deposited here. We also provide the results of studies on microRNA levels as a separate data set. Cells grown in culture for 1 to 4 weeks were treated with 0-25 mM ethanol. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit and subjected to analysis by DNA microarray, using the Affymetrix human Gene 1.0 ST array (platform GPL19142). RNA samples from different treatments were analysed by the UCLA DNA Core lab. Data were returned as rma values.

DESIGN
There are control experiments in which cells were grown without added ethanol, and there are experiments in which cells were grown in the presence of 25 mM ethanol for either 1 week or 4 weeks. One column shows the gene expression values for another cell line MCF12-A, which was established using non-malignant human breast cells and which was grown in the absence of ethanol. In this particular Affymetrix array, most genes are evaluated as a single Probe Set, but there are some which are included in the array as 2 or more Probe Sets.
