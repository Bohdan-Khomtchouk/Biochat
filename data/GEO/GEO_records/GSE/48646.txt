TITLE
Compare RNA profile between LPS+CPN and LPS+CPN+GGOH treated peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find out genes regulated by geranylgeraniol (GGOH) treatment in peritoneal macrophage, we compared gene expression of cells treated with 200ng ml LPS and 250 micromolar compactin versus 200ng ml LPS, 250 micromolar compactin and 100micromolar GGOH.

DESIGN
To find out upregulated or downregulated genes regulated by GGOH treatment in peritoneal macrophage (LPS+CPN treated cell).
