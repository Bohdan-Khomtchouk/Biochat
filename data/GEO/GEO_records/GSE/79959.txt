TITLE
Expression profiling of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples with microsatellite instability (MSI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of a genomic profiling study of CRCs with MSI, we have performed genome-wide expression analyses of a consecutive patient series.

DESIGN
This series consists of 34 CRC tissue samples with MSI analyzed on Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 Arrays, and is an amendment to a larger series of CRC analyzed for gene expression with exon-level resolution (GSE24550, GSE29638 and GSE69182).

PLATFORM
