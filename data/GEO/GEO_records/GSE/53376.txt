Adipose transcriptome and microRNA profiles after surgery-induced weight loss [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular mechanisms associated with pathophysiological variations in adipose tissue (AT) are not fully recognized. The main aim of this study was to identify novel candidate genes and miRNAs that may contribute to the pathophysiology of hyperplastic AT. Therefore, wide gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns were assessed in subcutaneous AT of 16 morbidly obese women before and after surgery-induced weight loss. Validation of microarray data was performed by quantitative real-time PCR both longitudinally (n=25 paired samples) and cross-sectionally (25 obese vs. 26 age-matched lean women). Analyses in macrophages and differentiated human adipocytes were also performed to try to comprehend the associations found in AT. 5,018 different probe sets identified significant variations in gene expression after treatment (adjusted p-value < 0.05). A set of 16 miRNAs also showed significant modifications. Functional analysis revealed changes in genes and miRNAs associated with cell cycle, development and proliferation, lipid metabolism, and the inflammatory response. Canonical affected pathways included TREM1, PI3K, and EIF2 signaling, hepatic stellate cell activation, and mitochondrial function. Increased expression of SLC27A2, ELOVL6, FASN, GYS2, LGALS12, PKP2, ACLY, and miR-575, as well as decreased FOS, EGFL6, PRG4, AQP9, DUSP1, RGS1, EGR1, SPP1, LYZ, miR-130b, miR-221, and miR-155, were further validated. The clustering of similar expression patterns for gene products with related functions revealed molecular footprints, some of them described for the first time, which elucidate changes in biological processes after the surgery-induced weight loss.

DESIGN
32 samples were analyzed: PRE (n=16) and POST (n=16).
