TITLE
Response of human lymphoblastoid cells to activated medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells comparing mock irradiaed cells resuspended in fresh untreated RPMI 1640 medium with cells resuspended in medium activated by exposure to 2.5 Gy HZE (1 GeV/amu iron ions accelerated at the NASA Space Research Laboratory (NSRL) of Brookhaven National Laboratory).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, mock irradiated vs. cells exposed to activated medium.  3 biological replicates were independently grown and harvested during three different runs at the NSRL. One replicate per array.
