TITLE
Multi-modal proteomic target discovery and orthogonol confirmation of preclinical diabetic retinopathy drug development biomarkers

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify proteomic alterations associated with functional dysregulation of the retina with diabetes that could eventually be used as surrogate endpoints in preclinical drug testing studies. A multi-modal approach of antibody (Luminex)-, electrophoresis (2-DIGE)-, and LC-MS (iTRAQ)-based quantitation methods was used to provide broad coverage of the retinal proteome. Transcriptional profiling through microarray analysis was also included to increase coverage and provide insight into potential regulation of protein expression changes at the mRNA level.  The different technologies proved complementary, with limited coverage overlap between methods.

DESIGN
Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley male rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 10mM sodium citrate pH 4.5 vehicle. Control rats were injected with an equal dose of vehicle only.  Rats had free access to food and water, and were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle. Blood glucose level and body weight were measured 6 days post-STZ or vehicle injection, and biweekly throughout the experiment. Only rats with blood glucose levels > 250 mg/dL at the time of the original test and throughout the experiment were included in the diabetic groups. At the time of retina harvest, rats were given a lethal dose of pentobarbital, 100 mg/kg, (Ovation Pharmaceuticals Inc., Deerfield, IL) by intraperitoneal injection and sacrificed by decapitation. Retinas were rapidly excised snap- frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent experimentation.
