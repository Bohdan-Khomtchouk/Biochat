TITLE
Innate-like functions of natural killer T cell subsets result from highly divergent gene programs [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Natural killer T (NKT) cells have immune stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the immune response that are context-dependent.  This may be attributed in part to the existence of functional NKT cell subsets; however, these functional subsets have only been characterized on the basis of differential expression of a few transcription factors and cell surface molecules.  Here we have analyzed purified populations of thymic NKT cell subsets at both the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels, and by single-cell RNA sequencing.  Our data indicate that despite their similar antigen specificity, the functional NKT cell subsets are highly divergent populations characterized by many gene expression and epigenetic differences.  Therefore the thymus imprints innate-like NKT cells with novel combinations of properties, including differences in proliferative capacity, homing, and effector functions that were not previously anticipated.

DESIGN
Genome wide chromatin accessibility analysis using H3K27Ac ChIP-Seq  datasets in mouse VÎ±14 iNKT thymocyte subsets (NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17).  Samples were generated from three individual experiments using a pool  of thymocytes prepared from five five-week old C57BL/6J females. NKT  cells subtypes were isolated from thymuses and directly sorted by flow cytometry and fix adequately for chromatin immunoprecipitation  downstream experiments.
