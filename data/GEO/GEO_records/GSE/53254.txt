TITLE
Differential expression of genes in the WT and hupB KO strain of Mycobacterium  tuberculosis H37Rv upon iron limitation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
HupB is a 28 kDa in Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is co-expressed with the siderophores mycobactin and carboxymycobactin upon iron limitation. High levels of all the three components are seen in low iron (LI; 0.02 µg Fe / mL) organisms, with negligible expression in high iron organisms (HI; 8 µg Fe / mL). We generated a hupB knock out mutant of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv ∆ hupB) and studied the differential expression of genes upon iron limitation in the WT H37Rv and the mutant.  The RNA transcripts of the WT H37Rv, grown under high and low iron conditions of growth were isolated and subjected to microarray analysis to identify the iron-regulated genes and second, the differential expression of genes in iron-limited H37Rv ∆ hupB vs iron-limited WT H37Rv was analysed. Microarray analysis was done commercially by Genotypic Technology (Bangalore, India), an authorised service provider for Agilent Technologies. The study revealed the up-regulation of all the mbt genes of the mycobactin biosynthetic machinery in LI - H37Rv and several other reported iron-regulated genes. The salient feature of this study is the failure of LI - H37Rv ∆ hupB to show any up-regulation of the mbt genes as compared to LI - H37Rv.  Among several other genes influenced by HupB, the mutant strain showed low levels of mmpL5 and mmpS5 transcripts, whose expressed products are reported to be associated with siderophore transport and biosynthesis.
