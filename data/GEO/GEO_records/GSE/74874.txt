TITLE
Whole-genome effects of elaidic and oleic acids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trans fatty acids (tFAs) may have deleterious, long-term transcriptional effects. To explore that issue, we assessed the effects of the tFA elaidic acid and its cis isomer oleic acid on transcription and, in parallel, on DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Human THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with 50 microM of either fatty acid for 24 h, in triplicate.
