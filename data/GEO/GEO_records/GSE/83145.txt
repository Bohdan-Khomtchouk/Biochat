TITLE
RNA profiling of testis from wild-type and tamoxifen-induced NIPP1 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to explore the role of NIPP1 in adult germline cell proliferation and differentiation, using a ubiquitous inducible NIPP1 knockout (TKO) mouse model. To gain unbiased insight into the molecular mechanism that underly the sertoli-only phenotype in TKO, we performed a comparative RNA sequencing profiling of control and TKO, in which NIPP1 was  tamoxifin-induced depleted.

DESIGN
Two genotypes are compared after treatment with tamoxifen. The control genotype (UBC CRE-ERT2+/- Ppp1r8 fl/+) looses the floxed allele of PPP1R8 (aka NIPP1) as a consequence of the treatment with tamoxifen and becomes heterozygous for PPP1R8. The KO genotype (UBC CRE-ERT2+/- Ppp1r8 fl/-) also looses the floxed allele of PPP1R8 as a consequence of the tamoxifen treatment and becomes homozygous KO. For each genotype, 4 replicates are profiled.
