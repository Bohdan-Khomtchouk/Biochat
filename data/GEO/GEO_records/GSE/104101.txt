TITLE
Malaria Host Pathogen Interaction Center Experiment 24: Host and parasite gene transcript abundances, from whole blood, of Macaca mulatta infected Plasmodium cynomolgi B strain treated with artemether over 3 time points in a 46 day study.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This project is part of the Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) - is a transdisciplinary malaria systems biology research program supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (# HHSN272201200031C; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu ). The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC. 

DESIGN
Male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cleared of previous infection with  P. cynomolgi B strain via treatment with the anti-malarial drugs artemether, chloroquine, and primaquine,  approximately five years of age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites produced and isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple Anopheles species (An. dirus, An. gambiae, and An. stephensi) and then profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment included, 1 pre-inoculation day, 35 experiment days, and 10 post-experiment days.  Pre- and post-experiment days were used to prepare subjects and administer post-experiment curative treatments respectively.  The anti-malarial drugs primaquine and chloroquine were administered to all subjects at the end of the study for curative treatment of the liver and blood-stage infections, respectively.  Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood samples were collected at three time points for functional genomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as ‘Experiment 24’.  This is the second in a series of experiments that includes infection of malaria-naïve subjects (Experiment 23, P. cynomolgi B strain) and heterologous challenge (Experiment 25, P. cynomolgi strain ceylonensis) for the individuals from the same cohort.  This dataset was produced by Dr. Steven E. Bosinger, Nirav Patel, and Greg Tharp at the Emory University Yerkes Genomics Core.

The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
