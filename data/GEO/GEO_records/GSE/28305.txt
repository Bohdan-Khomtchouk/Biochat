TITLE
Effect of 5a-dihydrotestosterone on breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells treated with the androgen 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 6h, 16h and 48h to define the genes that are differentially regulated in response to DHT.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were treated with 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for time course, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, in order to obtain the gene expression profiles at three time points. The vehicle treated samples are used as control.
