TITLE
Bone marrow-derived macrophage responses to classical activation: wild-type vs. MLL1-deficient (Lys2Cre MLL1 fx/fx)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA from wild-type (Cre-) and MLL1-deficient (Cre+) BMDMs were analyzed via gene chip (Mouse Gene ST 2.1, Affymetrix) for relative expression changes. Isolated mRNA from Cre- and Cre+ BMDMs stimulated with classical activation signals (IFNg, LPS or IFNg+LPS) was analyzed using a gene chip panel of > 40,000 RefSeq transcripts, and resulting fold expression was determined by analyzing quality-controlled expression values for validated probesets.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages from wild-type (Cre-) or MLL1-deficient (Cre+) mice were stimulated in vitro with IFNgamma (10 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml) or the combination of IFNgamma+LPS for six hours. Cells were then processed in Trizol reagent for RNA extraction.
