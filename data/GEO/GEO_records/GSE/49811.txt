TITLE
Expression profiles of colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We ortho-topically implanted 16 human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines onto the cecal walls of nude mice . To identify the genes possibly involved in EMT of CRC, we analyze the EMT related changes with the orthotopic implantation method in vivo in combination with that of gene expression profiles using a cDNA microarray in vitro.

DESIGN
We analyzed 16 human colorectal cancer cell lines. For each cell line, the experiments were carried out twice.
