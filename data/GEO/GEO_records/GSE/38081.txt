TITLE
Profiling liver from 5LO KO and WT B6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effects of knocking out the 5-LO gene on gene expression in key metabolic target tissues liver.

DESIGN
The 5LO KO mouse liver profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the liver of 5LO KO mice compared to the corresponding WT B6 controls.
