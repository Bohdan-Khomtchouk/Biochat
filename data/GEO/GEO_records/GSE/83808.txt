TITLE
T cells from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients show an altered TNFR signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify aberrant molecular mechanisms involved in immune targeting of HSCs in bone marrow, RNA-seq was applied to examine the transcriptome of T cell subsets from PNH patients and healthy controls.

DESIGN
RNA seq , 3 PNH patient's T cell subsets (CD4Naive, CD4Memory,CD8Naive, CD8Memory), 3 Healthy T cell subsets (CD4Naive,CD4Memory, CD8Naive, CD8memory)
