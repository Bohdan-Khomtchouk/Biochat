TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human pluripotent cells after kd/oe of SNF5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression by SNF5 level change in human pluripotent and differentiated cells. The core subunit of BAF complex SNF5 is at the nexus of the link between chromatin remodeling and tumor suppression. We demonstrated a role for the remodeler SNF5 as a key executor in regulating pluripotency gene networks during differentiation by using loss and gain of function experiments followed by gene-expression arrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from pluripotent state, differentiated state, absense of SNF5 and overexpression of SNF5

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
