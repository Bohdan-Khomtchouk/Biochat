TITLE
Distinct transcriptional networks in quiescent myoblasts: a role for Wnt signaling in reversible vs irreversible arrest

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using cDNA arrays, we compared G0 myoblasts (S48) with post-mitotic myotubes. Our findings define the transcriptional program of quiescent myoblasts in culture which show important similarities with muscle satellite cells, and establish that distinct gene expression profiles characterize irreversible and reversible arrest

DESIGN
Cell were synchronized in G0 by resuspending them in semi-solid media for 48  hours and harvested for RNA isolation

PLATFORM
