TITLE
RNA-Seq in neurons from E16.5 mouse embryonic cortices from WT and SMCX KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted RNA-Seq (using Direct Ligation of Adapters to first strand cDNA) in neurons from E16.5 mouse embryonic cortices from WT and SMCX KO mice and harvested after 10 days in vitro culture.

DESIGN
We sequenced RNA samples after 10 days in vitro cultures in biological and technical duplicates. 4 RNA samples from WT and SMCX KO neurons. We also sequenced RNA samples from same neurons after stimulation with KCl for 60 mins. So a total of 8 RNA-Seq samples.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
