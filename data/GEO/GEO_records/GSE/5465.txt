TITLE
Gene expression in wild-type and transgenic plants overexpressing rice topoisomerase6 genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
10-day-old wild-type and homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (overexpressing OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B) grown under normal growth conditions were used for total RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Keywords: Arabidopsis, wild-type and transgenic seedlings, differential gene expression

DESIGN
The experiment involves the study of differential gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing rice topoisomerase 6 subunit A (OsTOP6A3) and subunit B (OsTOP6B) cDNAs as compared to wild-type.Two biological replicates for each sample were used for microarray analysis.
