TITLE
Gene expression in wild-type and transgenic plants overexpressing rice topoisomerase6 genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
10-day-old wild-type and homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (overexpressing OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B) grown under normal growth conditions were used for total RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Keywords: Arabidopsis, wild-type and transgenic seedlings, differential gene expression
