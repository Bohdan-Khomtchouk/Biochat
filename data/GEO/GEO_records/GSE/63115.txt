TITLE
Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase Operates as a Metabolic Control Point in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

ORGANISM
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

SUMMARY
We report RNA-seq datasets profiling the transcriptional response to a sudden change in growth substrate, from succinate to ethylamine. This detailed combined dataset provides a dynamic assessment of the transcriptional response to a metabolic perturbation. These datasets are the first reported RNA-seq datasets for gene expression in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

DESIGN
Time course of transcriptome datasets from time zero (succinate growth) and several points after the substrate switch.
