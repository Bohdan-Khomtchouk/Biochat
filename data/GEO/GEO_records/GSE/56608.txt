TITLE
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression pre-/post- oral lipid challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute metabolic challenges provide insight on how the body responds to metabolic stress. In this study, we assessed transcriptomic response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to an acute lipid challenge.

DESIGN
Participants consumed 100 mL Calogen (Nutricia, Ireland) combined with 50 mL Liquid Duocal (SHS Nutrition, Netherlands) for a total of 150 mL with a fat content of 54 g. PBMCs were collected at baseline and 240 minutes post-challenge

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
