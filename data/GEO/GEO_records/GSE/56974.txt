TITLE
Identification of MicroRNAs and Their Targets in Tomato Infected with Cucumber Mosaic Virus

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We constructed two independent small RNA libraries from leaves of mock and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infected tomatoes, respectively, and sequenced with a high-throughput Illumina Solexa system. Based on sequence analysis and hairpin structure prediction, a total of 50 known miRNAs (32 families) and 568 potentially candidate miRNAs (PC-miRNAs) were firstly identified in tomato, with 12 known miRNAs and 154 PC-miRNAs supported by both the 3p and 5p strands. Comparative analysis revealed 79 miRNAs (including 15 novel tomato miRNAs) and 40 PC-miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two libraries. Among these virus responsive miRNAs, expression patters of some novel tomato miRNAs and PC-miRNAs in mock and in CMV-Fny infected tomatoes were further validated by qRT-PCR. Moreover, we revealed 563 potential targets for 66 tomato miRNAs by the recently developed degradome sequencing approach, including 124 targets for 7 new tomato miRNAs and 97 targets for 24 PC-miRNAs. Target annotation for the newly identified miRNA and PC-miRNAs indicated that they were involved in multiple biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and virus resistance. Gene ontology analysis of these target transcripts demonstrated that stress response- and photosynthesis-related genes were most affected in CMV-Fny infected tomatoes.
