TITLE
Exon-level expression profiling in MDA-MB-231 with or without TIP-1 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 stable cell lines transfected with control shRNA or TIP-1 shRNA were cultured overnight. Total RNA of these cell lines was isolated for microarray analysis.  Try to get more information about the difference in the mRNA levels in these cell lines.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression from 6 samples: 2 control MDA-MB-231 (two independent clones) and 4 shRNA TIP-1 MDA-MB-231 cells (2 different shRNAs to silence TIP-1 expression, each shRNA has two independent clones). We used the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by the Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
