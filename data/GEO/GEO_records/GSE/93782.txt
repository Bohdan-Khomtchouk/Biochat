TITLE
Multifunctional glial support by Semper cells in the Drosophila retina

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Using cell-restricted transcriptome analysis, here we show that Drosophila ommatidial cone (or Semper) cells are enriched for conserved glial regulators and effectors, including many characteristic of vertebrate retinal glia: MÃ¼ller glia and astrocytes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq based analysis of Drosophila retinal cone cells (3 developmental stages) and photoreceptors.  1 sample per cell type - 4 total libraries sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
