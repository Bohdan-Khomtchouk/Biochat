TITLE
Posttranscriptional upregulation of HER3 by HER2 mRNA induces Trastuzumab Resistance in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore HER2 3’-UTR-dependent transcriptional programs, we analyzed gene-expression profiles of T47D cells transfected with HER2 3’-UTR.

DESIGN
Comparative microarray analysis of mRNA for T47D cells transfected with pCDNA3.1-HER2 3’-UTR and pCDNA3.1 as a control was performed on Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
