TITLE
RNA-Seq Profiling of Intestinal Expression of Xenobiotic Processing Genes in Germ-Free Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to quantify and compare the mRNA abundance of all major XPGs in liver and intestine between conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice using RNA-Seq.  The CV RNA-Seq data were previously uploaded to GEO database by the same research group (GSE79848). All CV and GF mice were age-matched, and were analyzed under the same conditions (diet, water, bedding, and animal facility).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of liver and four sections of intestine of conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice were generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, by illumina HiSeq 2000.
