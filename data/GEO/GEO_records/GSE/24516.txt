TITLE
Transcriptome of mkk1-mkk2 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au08-02_mkk1-mkk2 - mkk1-mkk2 - Functional redundancy of the two MAPKKs MKK1 and MKK2. - mkk1 and mkk2 k.o. plants were crossed. Seedlings homozygous for mkk1 and/or mkk2, in parallel with control wild type seedlings, were grown on sterile medium. RNA was extracted from non-treated seedlings. aRNA was synthesised using the Ambion aRNA kit. Transcriptome data will be compared with those from a (already available) microarray of a mutant lacking the MAPKKkinase that is upstream of MKK1 and MKK2 (MEKK1).
