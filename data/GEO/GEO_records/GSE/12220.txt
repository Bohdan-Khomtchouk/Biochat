TITLE
Changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA abundance following oxidative stress and DNA damage stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We subjected yeast to two stresses, oxidative stress, which under current settings induces a fast and transient response in mRNA abundance, and DNA damage, which  triggers a slow enduring response. Using microarrays we performed a conventional quantification of change in mRNA abundance. Keywords: Two separate time courses

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix microarrays to quantify changes in mRNA abundance following oxidative stress (using hydrogen peroxide) and DNA damage stress (using methyl methanesulfonate) during a three-hour time course (0, 30 min, 60 min, 100 min, 140 min, 180 min).
