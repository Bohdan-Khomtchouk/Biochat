TITLE
Determining direct targets of the bHLH MIST1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor MIST1 is required for final maturation of secretory cells of diverse tissues, including gastric digestive-enzyme secreting zymogenic (chief) cells (ZCs). Here, we show that MIST1 directly activates RAB26, RAB3D and several other genes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to determine genes upregulated following transient MIST1 transfection. Two gastric cell lines were used: HGC-27 and AGS. Three chips were generated from each cell line: parental (untransfected), GFP+empty vector (a control for effects of transfection), and GFP+MIST1. The latter two chips were generated from cells flow sorted based on GFP fluorescence to isolate cells with high levels of transfection. Chips were analyzed by dChip to identify genes expressed in both MIST1-transfected cell populations relative to their respective controls in multiple Boolean 'AND' comparisons.
