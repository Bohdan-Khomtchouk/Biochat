TITLE
Fine-mapping of DNA modifications in the lactase gene region of humans and mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisulfite padlock probe technique was used to examine DNA modifications at the lactase gene region for human and mouse tissues

DESIGN
DNA modifications were investigated in human sperm, blood, jejunal enterocytes and jejunum lacking enterocytes, as well as mouse jejunal enterocytes and jejunum lacking enterocytes. For WGA samples, a genome devoid of DNA modifications was used to verify the efficiency of the bisulfite conversion reactions (the tissue sources were human or mouse intestine).
