TITLE
miRNA profile of lung adenocarcinoma cells treatment with monoclonal antibody NJ001 [miRNA_72h]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previously, we developed a newly monoclonal antibody named NJ001 which selectively reacted to non-small cell lung cancer and exhibited anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and so on. MiRNA ubiquitously regulates cell processes such as cell cycle regulation, invasion, differentiation and proliferation. We used microarrays to detail the miRNA changes in the lung adenocarcinoma cell SPC-A1 after treatment with NJ001. These miRNA may have contribution to the effect of NJ001 on cancer cells.

DESIGN
SPC-A1 cells treated with or without NJ001 were used as study group or control group respectively and everygroup has three biological repeats. we observed this two groups at 72h to investigate changes in miRNA expression levels following this monoclonal antibody treatment.
