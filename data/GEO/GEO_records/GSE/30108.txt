TITLE
LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing microarray comparison in Yersinia pestis at 30°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
The AI-2 quorum-sensing system has been linked to diverse phenotypes and regulatory changes in pathogenic bacteria. In strain CO92, the AI-2 signal is produced in a luxS-dependent manner, reaching maximal levels of 2.5 μM in late logarithmic growth, and both wild type and pigmentation mutant strains made equivalent levels of AI-2. Y. pestis CO92 possesses a chromosomal lsr locus encoding factors involved in the binding and import of AI-2, and confirming this assignment, an lsr deletion increased extracellular pools of AI-2. To assess the functional role of AI-2 sensing in Y. pestis, microarray study was conducted comparing the ∆Pgm strain R88 to a ∆Pgm ∆luxS mutant at 30°C to mimic the flea gut.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from Y. pestis CO92 ΔPgm cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from ΔPgm ΔluxS cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. A dye-swap design was used to remove the Cy5 and Cy3 dye bias.
