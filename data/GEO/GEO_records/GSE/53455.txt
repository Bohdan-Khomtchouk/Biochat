TITLE
Expression profiling comparisons of human CD4+ T cells treated with RORgt inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differential gene expression resulting from the inhibition of RORgt in human CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Human CD4+ T cells were cultured with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb for 20 to 60 hours concurrent with exposure to Vehicle (DMSO), TMP778 (0.2 uM) or TMP776 (0.2 uM).  All samples were then processed for RNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
