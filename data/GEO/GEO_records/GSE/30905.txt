TITLE
Microarray analysis on livers, spleens and hearts of mice given distilled water fed with either a normal diet or an atherogenic diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BALB/c mice were given an atherogenic diet and compared to those given a normal diet to observe for gene expression changes caused by the atherogenic diet. Both groups of mice received distilled water as drinks ad libitum. Livers, spleens and hearts were harvested six weeks after the feeding regimen for gene expression studies. Results from the separate microarray data analysis carried out on the different organs show that the atherogenic diet caused oxidative stress and inflammation in the organs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from livers, spleens and hearts of BALB/c mice given an atherogenic diet (six weeks after the feeding regimen) was compared to those from organs of mice given normal diet (liver: four replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group; spleen and heart: three replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group for both organs)
