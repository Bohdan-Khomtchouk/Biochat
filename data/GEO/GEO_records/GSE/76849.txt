TITLE
miRNA from leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In primary leukemia cells there is a significant over-representation of positively correlated microRNA and mRNA expression (see GSE66708) for genes containing sequences favoring microRNA-duplex DNA triplex formation, suggesting this as a mechanism by which microRNA may enhance gene transcription.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from fresh leukemic blasts and hybridized to a panel of miRNA probes.
