TITLE
Impact of STAT5 dosage and binding location on genetic and biological programs activated in mouse mammary epithelium during pregnancy.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor STAT5 has long been recognized as an important mediator of prolactin induced mammary development during pregnancy. We have used mouse genetics and genome-wide analyses to determine how altering concentrations of STAT5A and STAT5B impacts different target promoters.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide STAT5A, STAT5B, PolII and H3K4me3 in wild type (AABB) and Stat5a-null (BB) mammary tissues.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
