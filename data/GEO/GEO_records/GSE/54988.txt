TITLE
miR-302-367 regulates cardiomycyte proliferation and differentiation during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define the role of miR-302-367 cluster in cardiac development, we overexpressed miR-302-367 cluster in mouse heart by using R26R-miR-302-367; Nkx2.5-Cre mice. This data set contains the microarrays examining gene expression in the hearts of R26R-miR-302-367; Nkx2.5-Cre mice at postnatal day 14.

DESIGN
We overexpressed miR-302-367 cluster in developing mouse heart using Nkx2.5-Cre mouse line
