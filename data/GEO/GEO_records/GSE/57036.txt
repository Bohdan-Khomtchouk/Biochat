TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of high grade glioma in Ascl1creERTM driven tumor suppressors knockout mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse model with P53f/f;Nf1f/f or P53f/f; Nf1f/- driven by Ascl1creERTM induced at 1 month postnatally forms high grade glioma in the brain. Tumors were harvested and total RNA were extracted for gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Ten tumors were harvested from the Ascl1creERTM mouse model with desired genotype when showing neurological symptomes. Eight control brain tissue were harvested at corresponding anatomaical regions in the control mice. Total RNA were extracted from the tumor tissue and control tissue

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
