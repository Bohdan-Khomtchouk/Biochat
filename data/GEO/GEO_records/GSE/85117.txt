INO80 is required for oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer [ChIP-seq]

SUMMARY
Epigenetic regulators are attractive targets for the development of new cancer therapies. Among them, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes control the chromatin architecture and play important roles in gene regulation. They are often found to be mutated and de-regulated in cancers, but how they influence the cancer gene expression program during cancer initiation and progression is not fully understood. Here we show that the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is required for oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ino80, the SWI/SNF ATPase in the complex, is highly expressed in NSCLC cells compared to normal lung epithelia cells. Further, its expression, as well as that of another subunit Ino80b, negatively correlates with disease prognosis in lung cancer patients. Functionally, Ino80 silencing inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor formation in mouse xenografts. It occupies enhancer regions near lung cancer-associated genes, and its occupancy correlates with increased genome accessibility and enhanced expression of downstream genes. Together, our study defines a critical role of INO80 in promoting oncogenic transcription and NSCLC tumorigenesis, and reveals a potential treatment strategy for inhibiting the cancer transcription network by targeting the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex.

DESIGN
Human lung cancer cell line A549 cells were infected with shNT or shIno80, and total RNA was extracted 4 days after infection. The RNA was submitted to RNA-Seq subsequently. For ChIP-Seq, A549 infected with shNT or shIno80, was used for ChIP-Seq for corresponding factors.
