TITLE
Expression data from Y12-3 and A24-39 roots

ORGANISM
Triticum dicoccoides

SUMMARY
Roots adaptation to drought stress was analyzed using transcriptome and metabolomics profiles in two wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) genotypes: Y12-3 (drought resistance) and A24-39 (drought susceptible).

DESIGN
Roots samples of Y12-3 and A24-39 genotypes grown under well-watered (control) and water-stressed (7 days of withholding water) were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix wheat microarrays chip.
