TITLE
Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and rifampicin effect on human primary hepatocyte transcriptome [Affymetrix platform]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With particular emphasis on interactions between cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism we investigate the transcriptome of human primary hepatocytes treated by two commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering drugs atorvastatin and rosuvastatin and by rifampicin that serves as an outgroup as well as a model substance for induction of nuclear receptor PXR. Expression profiling with Affymetrix whole genome arrays shows that statins induce extensive transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
7 condition experiment: 3 treatments (atorvastatin, rifampicin, rosuvastatin), each measured at 2 time points (24 and 48 hours), and untreated cells. 4-6 biological replicates for each condition.
