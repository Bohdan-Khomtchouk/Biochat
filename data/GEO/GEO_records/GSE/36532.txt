TITLE
Effects of choline intake and pregnancy on peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the influence of choline intake and pregnancy status on gene expression, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes that were differentially expressed between two choline intake groups and between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Healthy third trimester (gestational week 26-29) pregnant women and non-pregnant women were randomized to a 12-week choline controlled feeding study. The participants  consumed  either 480 (n=6 pregnant and n=5 non-pregnant) or 930 (n=6 pregnant and n=5 non-pregnant) mg choline/d. Fasting peripheral blood leukocyte samples were collected at week 0 and week 12 to extract RNA and perform the arrays.

DESIGN
Healthy third trimester (gestational week 26-29) pregnant women and non-pregnant women were randomized to a 12-week choline controlled feeding study. The participants  consumed  either 480 (n=6 pregnant and n=5 non-pregnant) or 930 (n=6 pregnant and n=5 non-pregnant) mg choline/d for 12 weeks. Fasting (10-h) peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression were measured at week 0 and week 12.
