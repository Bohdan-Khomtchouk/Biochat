TITLE
RNA-seq of tumor-educated platelets enables blood-based pan-cancer, multiclass and molecular pathway cancer diagnostics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report RNA-sequencing data of 283 blood platelet samples, including 228 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with six different malignant tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer and hepatobiliary carcinomas). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 55 healthy individuals. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsies' in patients with several types with cancer, including the ability for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics.

DESIGN
Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the human reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq. The processed data includes 285 samples (columns) and 57736 ensemble gene ids (rows). The supplementary data file (TEP_data_matrix.txt) contains the intron-spanning read counts, after data summarization by HTseq.
