TITLE
Gene expression in benzene-exposed workers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of benzene exposure on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression was examined in a population of shoe-factory workers with well-characterized occupational exposures to benzene. We compared data from two microarray platforms (Illumina and Affymetrix). Keywords: occupational exposure

DESIGN
Eight workers exposed to benzene and eight unexposed controls who were frequency-matched to these subjects on the basis of age and gender were analyzed. Affymetrix and Illumina arrays.  Illumina: Group A - control, Group B - benzene.
