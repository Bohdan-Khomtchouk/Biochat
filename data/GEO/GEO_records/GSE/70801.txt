TITLE
Profile of RNAs bound by wild-type (WT) or R534H variant of DDX3 with or without Sodium Arsenite treatment [iCLIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By iCLIP-seq, we demonstrated that DDX3 binds to specific sites on 18S ribosomal RNA and to messenger RNAs at 5â€™ leader and guanidine-rich sequences immediately upstream of ribosome-dense regions and that arsenite treatment redistributes DDX3 binding from 5'UTR to CDS, which is attenuated by DDX3 R534H.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with or without sodium arsenite. RNAs crosslinked by UV to FLAG-tagged DDX3 WT or DDX3 R534H were immunoprecipitated sequentially, first with anti-FLAG antibody and second with anti-DDX3 antibody, then sequenced.

PLATFORM
