TITLE
Genome-scale methylome analysis of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria

ORGANISM
Schistocerca gregaria

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a widely conserved epigenetic modification that is established and maintained by the cooperative activity of DNA methyltransferases. While the complement of DNA methyltransferase genes can vary substantially between animal species, whole-genome methylation analyses have suggested that major features of animal methylomes are widely conserved. We have now used genome-scale bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methylome of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, which represents an economically important pest with a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Interestingly, in this system, DNA methylation appears to be both established and maintained by Dnmt1 methyltransferases, which distinguishes locusts from most other known organisms. Our results indicate that the S. gregaria methylome shares preferential methylation of CpG dinucleotides and exons with other animal methylomes. In contrast to other invertebrates, however, overall methylation levels were substantially higher and a significant fraction of transposons was methylated. Additionally, genes were densely methylated in a pronounced bimodal pattern, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the regulation of locust gene expression. Altogether, our results uncover a unique pattern of genome methylation in locusts and also suggest that animal methylomes may be more diverse than previously thought.

DESIGN
Whole exome methylation analysis of S. gregaria. Two samples were analyzed, one sample containing DNA from brain, one sample containing DNA from MTG.  To date, there exists no sequenced genome of Schistocerca gregaria; thus,  we could only map the data against an EST database (Locust2 EST project) representing the coding part of the genome.
