TITLE
Expression data from mouse amygdala

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A (IP3K-A) is a molecule enriched in the brain and neurons that regulates intracellular calcium levels via signaling through the inositol trisphosphate receptor. In the present study, we found that IP3K-A expression is highly enriched in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which plays a pivotal role in the processing and expression of emotional phenotypes in mammals. We used microarray to identify differentially expressed genes in the amydala of wild type (WT) and IP3K-A KO mice.

DESIGN
Male IP3K-A KO mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls from a C57BL/6N background were used at 10 to 15 weeks old. Mice were housed in temperature (22°C-23°C)- and humidity (50%)-controlled quarters under a 12-hr light/dark photoperiod (lights on at 08:00a.m.) with free access to food and water. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation between 02:00p.m. and 04:00p.m. Amygdala tissue was rapidly dissected from 1-mm thick slices and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
