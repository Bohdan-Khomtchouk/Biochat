TITLE
β-glucans are Masked but Contribute to Pulmonary Inflammation During Pneumocystis Pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
β-glucans, which can activate innate immune responses, are a major component in the cell wall of the cyst form of Pneumocystis. In the current study we examined whether β-1,3 glucans are masked by surface proteins in Pneumocystis, and what role β-glucans play in Pneumocystis-associated inflammation. For 3 species, including P. jirovecii, which causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in humans, P.  carinii, and P. murina, β-1,3 glucans were masked in most organisms, as demonstrated by increased exposure following trypsin treatment. Using Q-PCR and microarray techniques, we demonstrated in a mouse model of PCP that treatment with caspofungin, an inhibitor of β-1,3 glucan synthesis, for 21 days, decreased expression of a broad panel of inflammatory markers, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and multiple chemokines/chemokine ligands. Thus, β-glucans in Pneumocystis cysts are largely masked, which likely decreases innate immune activation; this mechanism presumably was developed for interactions with immunocompetent hosts, in whom organism loads are substantially lower. In immunosuppressed hosts with a high organism burden, organism death and release of glucans appears to be an important contributor to deleterious host inflammatory responses.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarrays from 4 samples of mouse lung tissues infected with Pneumocystis and treated with caspofungin compared with 3 samples of untreated and 4 samples uninfected.
