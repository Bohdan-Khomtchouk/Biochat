TITLE
Cdk5 regulates activity-dependent gene expression and dendrite development [cultured cortical neurons]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying activity-dependent dendrite development regulated by Cdk5, an unbiased microarray analysis was performed to identify activity-dependent genes differentially regulated in cortical neurons from E18 Cdk5-knockout embryos.

DESIGN
Cortical neurons were cultured from E18 Cdk5-knockout embryos and littermates. RNA was extracted and analyzed at 5 days in vitro (DIV) by the GeneChip® WT PLUS Reagent Kit (WT PLUS Kit, Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
