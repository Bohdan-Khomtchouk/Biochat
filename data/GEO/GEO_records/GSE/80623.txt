TITLE
Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) mediated regualtion of uterine stromal cells decidualization.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We extract RNA from mouse implantation sites (IS) on D8 of pregnancy. Mice were treated with or without PRT4165, an inhibitior of PRC1. Total RNAs were analyzed by RNA sequncing.

DESIGN
There are four samples to be analyzed:Control group 1) " D8ISCOT-1 " and 2) " D8ISCOT-2” ; PRT4165 treated groups 3) " D8ISPRT4165-1 " , 4)”D8ISPRT4165-2”
