TITLE
Gene expression and biological pathways in tissue of men with prostate cancer in a randomized clinical trial of lycopene and fish oil

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Animal and epidemiological studies suggest that lycopene and fish oil may modify the risk or delay progression of prostate cancer, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We examined the effects of these micronutrients on prostate gene expression in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (Molecular Effects of Nutritional Supplements, MENS).

DESIGN
Eighty-four men with low risk prostate cancer were stratified based on self-reported dietary consumption of fish and tomatoes and then randomly assigned to a 3-month intervention of lycopene (intervention B; n = 29) or fish oil (intervention C; n = 27) supplementation or placebo (intervention A; n = 28). Gene expression in morphologically normal prostate tissue was studied at baseline and at 3 months via cDNA microarray analysis. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses were performed to identify genes and pathways modulated by dietary intake of fish or tomato or by lycopene or fish oil supplementation.
