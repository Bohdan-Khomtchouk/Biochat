ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
affy_rewatering_poplar - rewatering - Biological question (15 lines max): Xylogenesis is a complex process and is highly influenced by environmental factors. Numerous studies have shown xylem structural acclimation to moderate and long-lasting water deficits. A decrease in cell lumen size and an increase in vessel density are generally observed. Other preliminary experiments in our laboratory focusing on a short and progressive drought-rewatering cycle in poplar show a gradual decrease in fibre size with decreasing water availability and an important rise in vessel number with irrigation recovery. This suggests a reorientation during the early stages of cambial derivatives differentiation towards vessel formation. The aim of this study is to characterize global gene expression in young differentiating xylem of poplar in response to a drought-rewatering cycle. Results should provide a comprehensive genomic basis for the xylem structural modifications observed.-The experimental design consisted in a differential water supply. Experiments were done on tilted trees to induce tension wood formation. Trees were regularly irrigated at full capacitance until July 18, 2007, the beginning of the experiment. Two sets of plants were designed. For each set, irrigation was withheld until July 25, 2007. At this time, one of the two sets (treated-sample) was re-irrigated at full capacitance during 14hrs (WDR) while the other one was maintained under water deficit (WD). Samples were collected after the 14hrs for all trees. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
