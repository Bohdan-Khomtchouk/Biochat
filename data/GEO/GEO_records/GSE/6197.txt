TITLE
Rat Semi-Circular Canal Duct Gene Expression Studies

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal was to screen for the expressed genes in Semi-Circular Canal Duct (SCCD) that are related to ion transport and its regulation.  The objectives was to discover which genes changed expression levels in response to glucocorticoids. Keywords: drug response

DESIGN
Primary cultures were incubated for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 100 nM dexamethasone.  Four independent cultures from each group were processed for total RNA and submitted for gene array analysis.  Although two Samples out of four in each group were done at different time points, we found that there was not much variation between the datasets (by cluster analysis).
