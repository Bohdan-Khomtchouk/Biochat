TITLE
Expression data of fruits in the wildtype and ORR tomato plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
An Ac/Ds transposon tagged mutant population was screened for changes in visible fruit phenotypes. One line showed orange, yellow sectors in the fruit and was named Orange ripening (Orr), its transposase free offspring showed Mendelian segregation yielding red, yellow and orange fruit bearing plants in a ratio of 1:2:1. Crossing the an orange fruit plant line to the wild-type yielded only plants bearing yellow fruit. A cross between the yellow fruit bearing progeny yielded 26 plants having red and 17 plants having yellow fruit, suggesting an over-dominant allele. Using inverse PCR analysis showed an insertion in the putative subunit M of the tomato Ndh complex. Subsequently, an Orr Ds transposon excision line was recovered which only showed red pigmented fruit. Here, we describe microarray profiling of tomato fruits from wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous Orr insertion plants and from fruits harvested from the Orr excision line. Keywords: mutant wild type

DESIGN
Tomato fruits were harvested at breaker stage using wild-type, ORR homozygouse and heterozygous lines as well as Orr excision lines. To investigate the expression changes in the ORR mutants, wildtype and ORR mutant line fruits were harvested at the breaker stage and subjected to Affymetrix microarray profiling
