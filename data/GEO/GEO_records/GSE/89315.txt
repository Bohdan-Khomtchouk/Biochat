TITLE
Tet proteins influence the balance between neuroectoderm and cardiac mesoderm fate choice by inhibiting Wnt signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the global distribution of Tet3 DNA binding sites, we performed ChIP-seq in neural precursor cells (NPCs). We report that Tet3-binding sites clustered close to transcription start sites (TSS), with a low frequency of binding at distal regions relative to the TSS. DNA motif analysis identified a CpG-rich sequence as the highest-ranked motif among Tet3-binding sites. GO analysis of Tet3 target genes showed enrichment for genes related to mesoderm development and neural differentiation. IPA analysis showed that Tet3 target genes were also strongly enriched for components of the Wnt signaling pathway.

DESIGN
To determine the global distribution of Tet3 DNA binding sites, we performed ChIP-seq experiments using Tet3 antibodies in neural precursor cells (NPCs).
