TITLE
A unique role of Cohesin-SA1 in gene regulation and development [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vertebrates have two cohesin complexes that consist of Smc1, Smc3, Rad21/Scc1 and either SA1 or SA2, but their functional specificity is unclear. Mouse embryos lacking SA1 show developmental delay and die before birth. Comparison of the genome wide distribution of cohesin in wild-type and SA1-null cells reveals that SA1 is largely responsible for cohesin accumulation at promoters and at sites bound by the insulator protein CTCF. As a consequence, ablation of SA1 alters transcription of genes involved in biological processes related to Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a genetic disorder linked to dysfunction of cohesin. We show that the presence of cohesin-SA1 at the promoter of myc and of protocadherin genes positively regulates their expression, a task that cannot be assumed by cohesin-SA2. Cohesin binding pattern along some gene clusters is also affected by the lack of SA1, leading to dysregulation of the genes within. We hypothesize that impaired cohesin-SA1 function in gene expression underlies the molecular etiology of CdLS.
