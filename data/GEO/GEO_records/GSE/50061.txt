TITLE
Gene expression in human breast cancer cell lines regulated by HIC1 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to further our understanding of the role that hypermethylatioted in cancer 1 (HIC1) plays in breast cancer progression. Microarrays were searched for some genes that had correlated expression with HIC1 mRNA. According to fold-change screening between restoring expression of HIC1 and its respective control cells in MDA-MB-231 cells, or HIC1 knockdown and its respective control cells in HBL100, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were shown.

DESIGN
The restoring expression HIC1 in MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively noted as MDAMB-231-HIC1 and the respective controls were noted as MDA-MB-231-GFP cells. HIC1 knockdown in HBL100 cells were noted as HBL100-shHIC1 and the respective control HBL100-shCtrl cell.
