TITLE
Effect of P. gingivalis on human primary gingival epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EXPERIMENT: Microarray expression profiles derived from the human primary gingival epithelial cells 24.0h after exposure to heat inactivated P. gingivalis ANIMAL MODEL: NON EXPOSURE: Human primary gingival epithelial cells (at 3rd passage) were exposed to heat inactivated P. gingivalis (MOI:100) at 90% confluence.  Two types of gingival epithelial cells were used.  One with Normal cytokine inducer type (at least 2 fold IL-6/TNF-alpha/IL-1ß when challenged with TLR2/4 agonists) and the other with diminished cytokine inducer type (no change in IL-6/TNF-alpha/IL-1ß when challenged with TLR2/4 agonists). INTERVAL: NON. PLATFORM: microRNA expression profile in gingival epithelial cells - miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Arrays (Exiqon). The RNA samples were subjected to microarray on 8/9/2007 Keywords = Human primary gingival epithelial cells Keywords = P. gingivalis Keywords = Periodontitis Keywords: Ordered

DESIGN
The effect of heat inactivated P. gingivalison human primary gingival epithelial cells were assayed.
