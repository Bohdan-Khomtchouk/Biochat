TITLE
In vitro tracheary element transdifferentiation of Col-0 suspension cells.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment was annotated by TAIR ( http://arabidopsis.org ). Col-0 suspension cells provided by Dr. C. Koncz and Dr. M. Umeda. 15 ml of Arabidopsis Col-0 suspension cells (Mathur et al. 1998) was transferred to 35 ml of a fresh modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 ug /ml 2,4-dichlorphenoxyacetic acid and 3% sucrose every 7 day, and cultured on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in the dark at 22 C for subculture. For xylem vessel element induction, a 7.5 ml aliquot of 7-day-old subcultured cells was transferred into 42.5 ml of fresh medium that included 1 uM brassinolide and 10 mM H3BO3, and cultured as described above. The frequency of xylem vessel element formation was calculated as the proportion of xylem vessel elements to the number of living cells and the vessel elements.
