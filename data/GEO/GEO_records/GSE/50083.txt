TITLE
Microarray analysis of monoclonal K562 lines transfected with pEF1a or pEF1a-Pu.2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ectopic expression of the novel Pu.1 isoform Pu.2 in K562 was performed to investigate the biological function and importance of this novel protein Affymetrix microarrays were performed on RNA from K562 cells transfected with pEF1a or pEF1a-Pu.2

DESIGN
Three monoclonal lines derived from K562 expressing pEF1a and three monoclonal lines of K562 expressing pEF1a-Pu.2

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
