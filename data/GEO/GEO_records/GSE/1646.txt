TITLE
Age-associated alteration of gene expression patterns in mouse oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Decreasing oocyte competence with maternal aging is a major factor in human infertility. To investigate the age-dependent molecular changes in a mouse model, we compared the expression  profiles of metaphase II oocytes collected from 5-6 week old mice with those collected from 40-42 week old mice using the  NIA 22K 60-mer oligo microarray.
