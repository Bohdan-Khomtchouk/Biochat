TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse liver after treatment with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor  (VEGF) inhibitor aflibercept

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse liver was compared between VEGF inhibitor aflibercept and control treatment after 9 weeks.

DESIGN
8-10 week-old SCID mice received VEGF Trap protein (aflibercept) subcutaneously twice per week at 25mg per kg body weight for 9 weeks.   For control groups, mice were treated with humanized Fc (Regeneron).  5 biological replicates were performed for the control group and 4 biological replicates were performed for the treatment group
