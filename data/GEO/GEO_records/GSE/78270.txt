TITLE
Transcriptome profiling in knock-in mouse models of Huntington's disease (cerebellum_mRNA).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric alterations. The mutation responsible for this disease is an abnormally expanded and unstable CAG repeat within the coding region of the gene encoding huntingtin (Htt). Knock-in mouse models of HD with human exon 1 containing expanded CAG repeats inserted in the murine huntingtin gene (Hdh) provide a genetic reconstruction of the human causative mutation within the mouse model. The goal of this study is RNA expression profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in 6 and 10 month old knock-in mice with CAG lengths of 20, 50, 92,  140 along with littermate control wild-type animals

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles were obtained via RNA-seq analysis performed on samples from the Cerebellum tissue of 6 and 10  month old knock-in mice with CAG lengths of 20, 50, 92, 140 along with littermate control wild-type animals.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
