TITLE
Changes in the erythroblast miRNA profile in the bone marrow of a Plasmodium vivax-infected patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human studies of Plasmodium vivax in the bone marrow are scarce. Here, we present a detailed characterization of bone marrow aspirates taken from a P. vivax patient with high parasitaemia on admission and 42 days after treatment. Analysis of miRNAs related to erythropoiesis revealed a distinct series of differentially expressed miRNAs during infection compared to at convalescence. These results suggest that parasites in the bone marrow affect erythropoiesis.
