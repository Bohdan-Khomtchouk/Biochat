TITLE
Characterization of PlcRa, a new PlcR-like regulator involved in oxidative stress response and cysteine metabolism during early stationary phase in Bacillus cereus

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
PlcR, the major virulence transcriptional regulator in the Bacillus cereus group belongs to the RNPP quorum sensor family and is activated through interaction with the secreted heptapeptide PapR7 used as a signalling molecule. We identified using modeling analysis a structural homologue of PlcR, PlcRa, in B. cereus. Whole-genome comparative microarrays identified 119 genes (threshold > 3) differentially expressed at the onset of stationary phase in a plcRa mutant. phBC6A51 and phBC6A52 prophage genes were up-expressed in a plcRa mutant. Genes involved in oxidative stress response and in cysteine metabolism, including genes which belong to the CymR regulon, were down-regulated in a plcRa mutant. Accordingly, deletion of plcRa resulted in increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and disulfide induced stresses. We also characterized a major target of PlcRa, the (BC2444) abrB2 gene, encoding a putative regulator belonging to AbrB family. PlcRa controlled CymR-regulated genes through AbrB2 and deletion of abrB2 gene resulted in increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and disulfide induced stresses. In conclusion, we identified a new early stationary transcriptional regulator specific to B. cereus group members involved in oxidative stress response and CymR regulon activation.

DESIGN
Two different comparisons were performed (both in biological duplo and Cy5-Cy3 dye-swapped) using 2 different time points: (1) B.cereus WT versus B. cereus plcRa overexpression strain at T1 (one hour after the onset of stationary phase) and T2 (two hours after the onset of stationary phase). (2) B.cereus WT versus B.cereus plcRa deletion strain at T1 and T2
