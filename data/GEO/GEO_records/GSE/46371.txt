TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to methyl tert-butyl ether

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been shown to target developing vasculature in piscine and mammalian model systems. In the zebrafish, MTBE induces vascular lesions throughout development. These lesions result from exposure to MTBE at an early stage in development (6-somites to Prim-5 stages). During this time period, transcript levels of vegfa, vegfc, and vegfr1 were significantly decreased in embryos exposed to 5 mM MTBE. We performed global gene analysis as an unbiased approach to discover possible modes of action of MTBE vascular toxicity.

DESIGN
Embryos were exposed at 3 hours post fertilization (hpf) in triplicate to one of three concentrations of MTBE: 5mM (induces vascular lesions and significantly decreases vegfa), 0.625mM (NOAEL; no observed adverse effect level), and 0.00625mM (100-fold below NOAEL), or to embryo media  (control). Samples were collected at 6-somites (~15hpf), 21-somites (~24 hpf), and Prim-5 (~30 hpf) stages of development. Embryos were meticulously staged at exposure and at the time of collection to maintain a homogeneous population. Our experimental design sought to explore the effect of three concentrations MTBE on three different stages of zebrafish embryonic development during the critical period established for the chemical. This time period also corresponds to an important time in the cardiovascular system develop of our model vertebrate.
