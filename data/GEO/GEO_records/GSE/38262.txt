The clinical and molecular significance of different types of C4d staining in renal allografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the clinical and molecular significance of minimal peritubular capillary (PTC) and isolated glomerular C4d+ staining using microarrays. Immunohistochemistry for C4d was performed on paraffin-embedded sections. Of the 255 biopsies analyzed, 51% were C4d negative, 4% were minimal, 15% focal or diffuse PTC C4d+, and 31% isolated glomerular C4d+. Minimal and focal/ diffuse PTC C4d+ staining were associated with a higher frequency of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) (67% vs. 82% vs. 25%), antibody mediated rejection (AMR) (66% vs. 89% vs. 19%) and mean glomerulitis (0.88 vs. 0.65 vs. 0.25, p=0.003), interstitial inflammation (1.25 vs. 1.41 vs. 0.79; p=0.003) and peritubular capillaritis scores (1.5 vs. 1.5 vs. 0.34; p < 0.001), compared to the C4d negative group, respectively. There were no differences in the DSA frequency, AMR rate, and Banff scores between isolated glomerular C4d+ and negative patients. While both minimal and focal/diffuse C4d+ biopsies showed increased expression of genes related to the immune response, and interferon-gamma and rejection induced, cytotoxic T cell and constitutive macrophage-associated pathogenesis based transcripts, there was no activation of immune-response related genes in isolated glomerular C4d+ biopsies. In summary, minimal PTC C4d+ staining but not isolated glomerular C4d+ staining is associated with AMR.

DESIGN
