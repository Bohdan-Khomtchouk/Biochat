TITLE
Correlation between DNase I hypersensitive site distribution and gene expression in HeLa S3 cells [Illumina arrays]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the relationship between the distribution of DNase I hypersensitive site(DHSs) and levels of gene expression. Expression values from 5 to 11 are raw log2 ratio-transformed data from gene expression arrays. We found that the distribution of DHSs in promoter region and CpG islands is positively correlated with gene expression levels and 3â€™UTR DHSs are negatively correlated with active expression of genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa S3 cells.

PLATFORM
