TITLE
static vs simulated microgravity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The below table includes a smaller list of data that was analyzed by dChip and filtered by pvalue such that a file with about 4600 genes was obtained, which allowed for ease of use from 40,000 genes. Keywords: static vs simulated microgravity

DESIGN
The total RNA was extracted from 2T3 pre-osteoblast cells exposed to static or simulated microgravity (Rotating Wall Vessel) conditions.  The RNA was then sent to Affymetrix microarray core facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) for microarray analysis.
