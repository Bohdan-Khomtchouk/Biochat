TITLE
Genome-wide Dnase-Seq profiles in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report corresponding gene expression, promoter methylation patterns of differential DHSs as well as differentially occupied TF binding motifs using surrounding DNAseI cut profiles. Overall, our study provides a framework for model studies of HL and NHL pathologies.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide DNaseI hypersensitive sites in  L1236, L428, L591, Reh and Namalwa cell lines.
