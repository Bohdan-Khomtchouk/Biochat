TITLE
NT2 DMSO vs. RA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NT2 cells were treated with DMSO (control) or 10uM Retinoic Acid (RA).  Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent, and subsequent cleanup with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions.  Hybridizations were performed according to Affymetrix guidelines using the Human HG-U133A chip containing 22,500 unique genetic elements.  Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen).  In vitro transcription labeling was performed with biotin labeled nucleotides using the Bioarray High Yield RNA Labeling Kit (ENZO).  20 ul of labeled RNA per sample was added to the hybridization cocktail, with a total of 15 ug hybridized to the chip (16 hours, 45C).  RMA analysis was performed using Gene Traffic software (Iobion), where raw data for each hybridization was normalized, background corrected and filtered for signal intensity of 50 or greater in at least one comparison.
