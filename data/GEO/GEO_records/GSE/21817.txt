TITLE
Gene expression profiling between chicken tissues

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Different organs play viable function. Different gene expression profiling between tissues will help us to understand the molecular mechanism played in different tissue and provide the fundamental knowledge for research on response to pathogens in different tissues.

DESIGN
Three main tissues, liver, kidney, and bone marrow, were selected in the current study. Shelf hybridization was performed within each tissue. Eight biological replicates were used for each tissue.
