TITLE
An integrated genomic and expression analysis of 7q deletion in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 gene expression microarray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by 7q32 deletion, but the target genes of this deletion remain unknown. In order to elucidate the genetic target of this deletion, we performed an integrative analysis of the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and miRNomic data. High resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of 56 cases of SMZL delineated a minimally deleted region (2.8Mb) at 7q32, but showed no evidence of any cryptic homozygous deletion or recurrent breakpoint in this region. Integrative transcriptomic analysis confirmed significant under-expression of a number of genes in this region in cases of SMZL with deletion, several of which showed hypermethylation. In addition, a cluster of 8 miRNA in this region showed under-expression in cases with the deletion, and three (miR-182/96/183) were also significantly under-expressed (P < 0.05) in SMZL relative to other lymphomas. Genomic sequencing of these miRNA and IRF5, a strong candidate gene, did not show any evidence of somatic mutation in SMZL.

DESIGN
For gene expression microarrays. A total of 48 cases of SMZL (including 15 with 7q deletion) were analysed using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, USA). 14 SMZL and 10 FL/MCL are included in this submission. The other Samples are part of GSE35348. Arrays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, RNA was extracted from snap frozen tissues with > 70% tumour cells using the RNEasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and subjected to DNAse treatment (Turbo DNAse kit, Ambion). RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA synthesis was carried out with 2ug RNA using the GeneChip® One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix), followed by in vitro transcription with biotin-labelled nucleotides using GeneChip® IVT Labeling Kit. Biotinylated cRNA was purified and hybridized to the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips in a GeneChip® Hybridisation Oven 640 at 45oC for 14 hours. The arrays were then washed and stained using the Fluidics station 450 system (Affymetrix). The arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner 3000. Hybridisation and labelling controls were included according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and quality control analysis of microarrays was performed to published standards.
