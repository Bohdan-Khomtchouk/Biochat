TITLE
MicroRNA discovery and analysis of Dirofilaria immitis by deep sequencing.

ORGANISM
Dirofilaria immitis

SUMMARY
To understand how microRNA are involved in the complex biology of this zoonotic parasite, we describe our initial attempts to characterize small RNA in adult Dirofilaria immitis by using Illumina/Solexa deep-sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different adult Dirofilaria immitis (pooled)

PLATFORM
GPL15208 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Dirofilaria immitis)
