TITLE
microbial functional genes are fundamentally different from bacterial phylogenetic distributions in arctic soils

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
Understanding biological diversity and distribution patterns at multiple spatial scales is a central issue in ecology. Here, we investigated the biogeographical patterns of functional genes in soil microbes from 24 arctic heath sites using GeoChip-based metagenomics and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM)-based analysis. Functional gene richness varied considerably among sites, while the proportions of each major functional gene category were evenly distributed. Functional gene composition varied significantly at most medium and broad spatial scales, and the PCNM analyses indicated that 14-20% of the variation in total and major functional gene categories could be attributed primarily to relatively broad-scale spatial effects that were consistent with broad-scale variation in soil pH and total nitrogen. The combination of variance partitioning and multi-scales analysis indicated that spatial distance effects contributed 12% to variation in functional gene compositionï¼Œwhereas environmental factors contributed only 3%. This relatively strong influence of spatial as compared to environmental variation in determining functional gene distributions contrasts sharply with typical microbial phylotype/species-based biogeographical patterns in the Arctic and elsewhere. Our results suggest that the distributions of soil functional genes cannot be predicted from phylogenetic distributions because spatial factors associated with historical contingencies are relatively important determinants of their biogeography.

DESIGN
72 heath tundra surface soil samples across the Canadian, Alaskan and European Arctic including three vegetation type (Empetrum spp., Cassiope spp., Dryas spp.)
