TITLE
PA14_mexR vs. wildtype planktonic cells in minimal medium with C-30

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

SUMMARY
Mutations that made the cells insensitive to the QS inhibition by C-30 were identified in mexR, a multi-drug resistance operon repressor. Gene expression of mexR mutant relative to wild-type at the presence of C-30 was examined.

DESIGN
Strains: PA14_mexR and wildtype. Medium: OS minimal medium + 0.1% Adenosine as carbon source. Compounds: 50 µM C-30 added at OD600=0.25. Time: 2 hr. Temp: 37 ºC. Cell type: Planktonic Cells.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
