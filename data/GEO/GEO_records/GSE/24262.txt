TITLE
PA14_mexR vs. wildtype planktonic cells in minimal medium with C-30

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Mutations that made the cells insensitive to the QS inhibition by C-30 were identified in mexR, a multi-drug resistance operon repressor. Gene expression of mexR mutant relative to wild-type at the presence of C-30 was examined.
