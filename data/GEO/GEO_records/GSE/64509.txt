TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of human brain tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of human tissues and to relate it to chronological age. Toward this end, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115.

DESIGN
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain n=260 Illumina DNA methylation array from the following human Brain  regions: caudate nucleus (n=n=12), cingulate gyrus (n=n12), cerebellum (n=32), frontal cortex (n=41), hippocampus (n=25), midBrain  (n=18), motor cortex (n=33), occipital cortex (n=33), parietal lobe (n=23), sensory cortex (n=12), temporal cortex  (n=29), visual cortex (n=11).
