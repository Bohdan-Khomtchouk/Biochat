TITLE
Gene expression changes induced in Rice (Oryza sativa) leaves following treatment with any one of the following: wild type Xoo, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exopolysaccaride (EPS) deficient Xoo mutant;  LPS proficient but EPS deficient Xoo mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Lipopolysaccharide is a Microbe Associated Molecular Pattern (MAMP) that is known to induce defense responses in plants. In rice we have shown that Xoo LPS induce callose deposition, reactive oxygen production and induced resistance response. The exopolysaccaride (EPS) secreted by Xoo might be involved in supressing these defense responses. We have performed transcriptional profiling of rice leaf gene expression changes after treatment with Xoo strains BXO1003 (LPS-, EPS-), BXO1002 (LPS+ EPS-) and BXO43 (wild type) along with milliQ treated leaves to identify the genes that are differentially expressed.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from mid veins of rice leaves 15 hours after injecting them with Xoo strains BXO1003 (LPS-, EPS-), BXO1002 (EPS-), BXO43 (wild type)  or milli-Q water. The rice gene expression in each of the treatment was normalized based on the gene expression in the milli-Q treatment.
