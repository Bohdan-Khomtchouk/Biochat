TITLE
Expression data from CD8 T cells from LCMV-Clone13 infected mice after two weeks of control or anti-PD-L1 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Blocking PD-1 can reinvigorate exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX) and improve control of chronic infections and cancer. One potential advantage of this immunotherapy is durable protection if immune memory can be established. It is unclear, however, whether blocking PD-1 can reprogram TEX into effector (TEFF) or durable memory T cells (TMEM). Here, we found reinvigoration of TEX by PD-L1 blockade caused re-acquisition of some features of TEFF, but minimal memory development. We used microarray analysis to profile exhausted cells from anti-PD-L1 mice after two weeks of treatment to study if PD-L1 blockade caused re-acquistion of some feature of effector or memory cells.

DESIGN
CD8 T cells from spleens 1-2 days after the final treatment (after receiving 5 total treatments of anti-PD-L1) were enriched by magnetic beads (CD8 negative selection kit, Stem Cell Technologies) and Dbgp276+ CD8 T cells were sorted on a FACSAria (BD). Four biological replicates were performed for each treatment  group and the transcriptional profiles were studied using affymetrix microarrays
