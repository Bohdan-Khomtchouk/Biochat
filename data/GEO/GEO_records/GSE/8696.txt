TITLE
Heme homeostasis is regulated by the conserved and concerted functions of HRG-1 proteins

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Hemes are essential but potentially  cytotoxic cofactors that participate in critical  and diverse biological processes. Although the  pathway and intermediates for heme biosynthesis  have been well defined, the intracellular  networks which mediate heme trafficking remain  unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans and related  helminths are natural heme auxotrophs requiring  environmental heme for growth and development.  We exploited this auxotrophy to identify HRG-1  and HRG-4 in C. elegans and show that they are  essential for heme homeostasis and normal  vertebrate development. We demonstrate that heme  deficiency upregulates expression of hrg-4 and  its evolutionarily conserved paralog hrg-1.  Depletion of either HRG-1 or HRG-4 in worms  results in disruption of organismal heme sensing  and abnormal response to heme analogs. HRG-1 and  HRG-4 are novel transmembrane proteins that bind  heme and have evolutionarily conserved functions.  Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish leads  to hydrocephalus, yolk tube malformations, and,  most strikingly, profound defects in  erythropoiesis - phenotypes that are fully  rescued by worm HRG-1. These findings reveal  unanticipated and conserved pathways for cellular  heme trafficking in animals that defines the  paradigm for eukaryotic heme transport.  Uncovering the mechanisms of heme transport in C.  elegans will provide novel insights into human  disorders of heme metabolism and generate unique  anthelmintics to combat worm infestations.
