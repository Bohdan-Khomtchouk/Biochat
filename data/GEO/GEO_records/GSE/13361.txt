TITLE
Characterisation of modular response of  E. coli Keio collection mutant library to acid adaptation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12 ; Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
To study the dynamics of acid adaptation in E.coli Keio collection mutant library at pH7 and pH5.5 after 15 minutes of adaptation Keywords: Single channel hybridisation were carried out using cy5 dye.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from steady state system at pH7 and at pH5.5 after 15 minutes of adaptation

PLATFORM
