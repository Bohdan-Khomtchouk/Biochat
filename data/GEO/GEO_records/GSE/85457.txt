TITLE
Gene array analysis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines versus normal thyroid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Currently there is a lack of effective therapies which result in long-term durable response for patients presenting with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a very rare and lethal variant of thyroid cancer. ATC is resistant to chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies currently available. In an effort to identify novel tumor-specific therapeutic targets, we performed high throughput gene array analysis screening numerous ATC cell lines, and compared their gene expression levels to normal thyroid cell lines.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer cell lines and Normal Thyroid cell lines. Gene array analysis was performed, and resulting expression levels were compared between Normal and ATC samples
