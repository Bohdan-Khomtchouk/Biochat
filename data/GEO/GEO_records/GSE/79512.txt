TITLE
Ribosome profiling-guided depletion of an mRNA improves CHO cell growth and recombinant product titers

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
We present the first comprehensive genome-wide view of CHO translational activity during recombinant expression by the application of ribosome profiling. The distribution of translational power in CHO cells was analyzed in the context of the recombinant mRNAs and the endogenous mRNA pool. In an antibody-producing CHO cell line, the recombinant mRNAs were found to be the most abundant transcripts and also sequestered a substantial amount of translating ribosomes (up to 15%). The recombinant mRNAs were translated as efficiently as the endogenous mRNAs, and changes in translation and transcription of the recombinant mRNAs were directly reflected in changes in specific productivity. Interestingly, improvements in bioprocess quality attributes were achieved by depleting the highly expressed and translated inert NeoR mRNA by siRNA-mediated knock-down. This resulted in improved cellular growth, which was accompanied by an 18% increase in antibody titers. This study is the first to carefully map the translatome of the CHO cell to the nucleotide level and to demonstrate how recombinant expression affects the cell on the translational level.
