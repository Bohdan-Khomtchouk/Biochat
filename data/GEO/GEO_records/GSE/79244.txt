TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of Klf6 silenced oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the role of Klf6 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and determine that Klf6 acts as a gp130-sensitive transactivator of the nuclear import factor importin-α5 (Impα5), a key controller of nuclear trafficking in oligodendrocytes.

DESIGN
Examination of expression profiles of 2 different cell stages exposed to siRNA vs. control
