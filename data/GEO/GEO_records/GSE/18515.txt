TITLE
Genome-wide map of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the identification of LSD1 binding genomic regions in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) by high throughput sequencing. By obtaining over 10 million 36 bp reads of sequence from each chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide maps for LSD1 and histone H3 dimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2), the substrate for LSD1 in mouse ESCs. Our results showed an extensive overlap between the LSD1 and H3K4me2 genomic regions and a correlation between the genomic levels of LSD1/H3K4me2 and gene expression, including many highly expressed ESC genes. LSD1 is recruited to the chromatin of cells in the G1/S/G2 phases and is displaced from the chromatin of M phase cells, suggesting that LSD1 or H3K4me2 alternatively occupies LSD1 genomic regions during cell cycle progression. LSD1 knockdown by RNA interference or its displacement from the chromatin by anti-neoplastic agents caused an increase in the levels of a subset of LSD1 target genes. Taken together, these results suggest that cell-cycle dependent association and dissociation of LSD1 with chromatin mediates short-time scale gene expression changes during ES cell cycle progression.
