TITLE
Neonatal antibotic prophylaxis modulates intestinal immunity and prevents necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were fed 3 d of parenteral nutrition followed by 2 d of enteral formula feeding. Antibiotics (n=11) or control saline (n=13) were given twice daily from birth to tissue collection at d 5. NEC-lesions and intestinal structure, function, microbiology and immunity markers were recorded. We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression in intestinal tissues of preterm piglets treated with antibiotics or control saline.

DESIGN
Twenty-four preterm piglets were delivered by caesarean section on day 105 of gestation from two healthy sows. All piglets were initially provided with parenteral nutrition via a vascular catheter, combined with small amounts of minimal enteral nutrition. On day three, all parenteral nutrition was stopped and total enteral nutrition was given through an oro-gastric feeding tube. Piglets were allocated into controls ( n=13) and an intervention group receiving oral and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics ( n=11). To assure high systemic and intra luminal MIC values antibiotics were given both orally and intramuscularly. All antibiotics were given directly after feeding with an oral bolus and control pigs were given corresponding amounts of saline. On day five, all piglets were euthanized, and small intestinal tissue collected.
