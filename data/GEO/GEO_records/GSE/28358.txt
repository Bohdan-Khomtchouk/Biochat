TITLE
Gene expression changes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 3 diet interventions, TMD enriched with olive oil, TMD enriched with nuts and Low fat diet.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the benefits associated with healthy diets, data on the mechanisms by which these benefits are promoted are scarce. Our aim was to explore the global transcriptomic response of biological pathways related to cardiovascular disease associated with traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) intervention. The PREDIMED study is a large on-going, parallel, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial aimed at assessing the TMD effect on primary cardiovascular prevention. High cardiovascular risk participants were recruited and assigned to one of the following interventions: 1) TMD plus virgin olive oil (VOO); 2) TMD plus mixed nuts; or 3) low-fat diet (control group). In a sub sample of 30 volunteers of the PREDIMED- Barcelona Sur Centre, gene expression changes in peripheral mononuclear cells, after 3 months of intervention, were assessed by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
A parallel study comparing three diet interventions: We analyzed 65 arrays which belonged to 34 patients, 31 microarrays at baseline (11 baseline group 1; 11 baseline group 2; 9 baseline group 3) and 34 microarrays after the 3 month intervention (11 for group 1; 11 for group 2; and 12 for group 3). The three interventions were: Group 1: 3-month Traditional Mediterranean Diet enriched with virgin olive oil; Group 2: 3-month Traditional Mediterranean Diet enriched with nuts; and Group 3: 3-month Low Fat Diet.
