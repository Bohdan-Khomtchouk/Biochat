TITLE
Role of Hopx in myogenesis and commitment [HopxKO]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progenitor cells require coordinated expression of lineage-specific genes to regulate differentiation into daughter cell types. Hopx labels cardiac progenitors that are commited to the cardiac myocyte lineage. Hopx-deficiency leads to thin myocardium in approximately mid-gestation lethality in approximately 50% of embryos (secondary to thin myocardium and presumed cardiac rupture). Hopx-/- EBs display impaired myogenesis during cardiac differentiation. ChIP-seq and RNA expression analysis suggests that Hopx down regulates Wnt signaling by directly occupying and repressing wnt ligand genes. Analysis of embryoid bodies on day 8 of cardiac differentiation. RNA was made of from 1. Hopx +/- embryoid bodies, 2. Hopx -/- embryoid bodies, Embryonic stem cell lines were derived from littermate mouse blastocysts.  Results provide insight into gene programs regulated by Hopx in cardiac development.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of Hopx-/- vs 3 biological replicates of Hopx+/- embryoid bodies, day 8 of cardiac differentiation.
