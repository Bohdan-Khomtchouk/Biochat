TITLE
The effects of depleting mtDNA by using 2'-3' dideoxycytidine (ddC) for 30 days on chromosome stability of Holstein fibroblast cells.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We have used a Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) microarray to determine the effects of mtDNA depletion using ddC on chromosome stability of Holstein cells that were used as the donor cells for embryo production by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. The results showed that there is no duplications or deletions on chromosomes of mtDNA depleted cells when compared with that of non-depleted cells. In conclusion, depleting mtDNA by using ddC had no negative effect on chromosome stability in the donor cells.

DESIGN
Depleted cells vs non-depleted cells, Biological replicates: 3
