TITLE
Transcriptome comparison between Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 cells with and without iron starvation

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987

SUMMARY
In this study we compared the transcriptomic profiles of cells grown in BHI, BHI supplemented with FeCl3, BHI supplemented with iron scavenger Bipyridine and both iron and the scavenger.

DESIGN
Liquid cultures grown in above mentioned four conditions with different iron availability were sampled at 5 h (Exponential growth) and 12 h (stationary phase start) of growth

PLATFORM
GPL7681 Bacillus cereus Bc10987 - 1st design (1X22K)
