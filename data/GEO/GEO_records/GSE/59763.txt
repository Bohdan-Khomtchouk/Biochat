TITLE
Analyses of genes regulated by the N-terminal photolyase homology region (CNT1/PHR) of CRY1 by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from samples including 35S::CNT1-NLS-YFP;cry1 and 35S::CNT1-G283E-NLS-YFP;cry1 seedlings grown in continuous blue light and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Previous studies reported that the C-terminal domain of CRY1 regulates hypocotyl elongation and blue light-regulated genes. This study reveals that CNT1 overexpression also regulates blue light-regulated genes, supporting the role of CNT1 in hypocotyl elongation at transcriptomic level.

DESIGN
mRNA from blue light-grown CNT1 or CNT1 variant (G283E) overexpressors was sequenced to analyze the genes regulated by CNT1.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
