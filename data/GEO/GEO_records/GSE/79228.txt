TITLE
Gene expression profiling of NCI-H292 cells after treatment of TFAP2C-specific siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and thus, new molecular targets need to be identified to improve treatment efficacy. Enhanced TFAP2C expression was found in lung cancer patient tissues and lung cancer cell lines, and its overexpression promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. We conducted microarrays to find the possible downstream effectors regulated by TFAP2C which could play key roles in lung tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Two total RNA samples, extracted from NCI-H292 cells treated with or without TFAP2C siRNA, were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray.
