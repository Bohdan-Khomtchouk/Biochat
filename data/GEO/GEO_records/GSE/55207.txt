TITLE
Expression data from 1,25(OH)2D treated human testicular cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human testicular cells were isolated mechanically and enzymatically from testis of braindead donors and from urological samples. The expression of genes was studied at baseline and 1,25(OH)2D treated conditions. We used microarrays to analyze the gene expression underlying vitamin D metabolism in human testis cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Testicular primary cells were treated with 100nM 1,25(OH)2D for 24h and gene expression studied by microarray on transcript level.
