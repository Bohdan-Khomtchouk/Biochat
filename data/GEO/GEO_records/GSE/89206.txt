TITLE
ZEB1-regulated inflammatory phenotype in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Zinc finger E-box binding protein 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression. However, little is known about global picture of transcriptional regulation by ZEB1 and ZEB2. Here we identified an inflammatory phenotype regulated by ZEB1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in basal type breast cancer cells, followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of ZEB1-bound genes.
