TITLE
microRNAs and isomiRs repertoire in poricne endometrium revealed by Illumina sequencing

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), known to modulate gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms, were implied in regulation of early pregnancy events including maternal recognition of pregnancy and implantation. To characterize complex transcriptomic changes in expression of miRNAs in pregnant and cyclic endometria collected on days 12, 16 and 20 was analyzed using Illumina deep sequencing. This research showed repertoire of pregnancy-related miRNAs in porcine endometrium during initial stages of conceptus implantation and during the estrous cycle and sheds light on miRNA-mediated gene expression regulation mechanism at the maternal-conceptus interface.

DESIGN
miRNAs and isomiRs expression profiles were analyzed in samples collected from porcine endometrium on Days 12, 16 and 20 of pregnancy and estrous cycle. Each group was represented by 4 to 6 samples. Generated libraries were run in multiplex using specific barcodes to differentiate samples. Illumina sequencing was performed in duplicate (two runs) and after demultiplexing, the same samples from two independent runs were concatenated.
