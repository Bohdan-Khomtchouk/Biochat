TITLE
DUO1 ectopic expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The experiment is designed to examine changes in gene expression upon ectopic expression of the germ line transcription factor DUO1 in Arabidopsis. Plants were transformed with the vector pMDC7DUO1, allowing induction of DUO1 by treatment with estradiol. T2 seedlings were selected on agar plates containing hygromycin for 12 days before seedlings were transferred to plates containing either 2 ÂµM 17beta-estradiol (induced), or control plates containing DMSO (non-induced). Plants were grown for 6, 12 or 24 hours before harvesting. RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit from Qiagen. Each sample consists of 20 seedlings combined and all treatments have been conducted in triplicate.

DESIGN
18 samples were used in this experiment.
