TITLE
Cerebellum Illumina Inf 450 DNA methylation samples from HIV+ and HIV- human subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of cerebellum from HIV positive and HIV negative human subjects. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 486,000 CpGs. Dataset included 20 subjects from the USA.  The epigenetic clock software (Horvath 2013) was used to measure epigenetic age acceleration effects and to relate them to HIV status.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 20 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. 8 HIV+ subjects were compared to 12 HIV- subjects.
