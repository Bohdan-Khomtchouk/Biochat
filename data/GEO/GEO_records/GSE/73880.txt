TITLE
Microarray analysis of Salmonella-infected or uninfected in vitro M cells and Caco-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate what genes are differently expressed between in vitro M cells and Caco-2 cells, and how S. Typhimurium and speG aﬀect gene expression of both cells.

DESIGN
We established an in vitro M cell model using transwell co-culture of Caco-2 cells and Raji B lymphocytes and infected in vitro M cells and Caco-2 cells with S. Typhimurium wild-type (WT), its ΔspeG mutant (MOI 25), or uninfected for 1 hour for RNA microarrays. Transcriptomes among the 6 pools (uninfected, WT-infected or ΔspeG -infected Caco-2 cells and M cells) were pairwise compared.
