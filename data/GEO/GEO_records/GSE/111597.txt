TITLE
Gene-expression analysis of human embryonic stem cell (HESC-)- derived rosette-forming neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of our study on the effect of LPA on HESC-derived NPCs, we have employed whole genome microarray analysis to identify genes which were up- and downregulated in the presence of LPA compared to non-LPA-treated control-NPCs and which might be involved in the expansion of the apical domain of NPCs and large rosette formation that we observe after LPA-treatment.

DESIGN
Gene-expression of NPCs at rosette passaging number 2 (RP2) that were cultured in plastic 24-well plates and exposed for 2 h, 10 h and 24 h to 0.5 ml N2B27 + FGF2/EGF medium which was initially supplemented with 15 ÂµM was performed. Experiments were performed in triplicates.
