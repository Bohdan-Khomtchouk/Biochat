TITLE
Differential accumulation of small RNAs and microRNAs during ovule and fiber development in allotetraploid cotton

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
To examine expression of miRNAs in cotton fiber development, we employed miRNA microarrays and compared miRNA accumulation level in cotton fibers, cotton leaves and mutant fibers.

DESIGN
A total of 9 hybridization intensities in three biological replicates per miRNA were obtained.

PLATFORM
GPL8814 Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA 0.35K microarray
