TITLE
Tobacco mosaic virus infection alters phloem associated translatomes in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study we used vascular specific promoters and a translating ribosome affinity purification strategy to identify phloem-associated translatome responses to infection by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in the systemic host Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Shahdara. Three different promoter:FLAG-RPL18 lines were used. These included two phloem specific promoters (pSUC2 and pSULTR2;2) as well as the more ubiquitously expressed cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (p35S). Immunopurification of ribosome-mRNA complexes was accomplished by the method described in Reynoso et al. (Plant Functional Genomics: Methods and Protocols, 185-207; 2015).  The dataset includes samples from the leaves of 5-week-old plants inoculated with TMV (1 mg/mL) or mock inoculated with sterile water.

DESIGN
12 samples, 2 conditions (TMV or mock infected), 3 promoter lines, 2 biological replicates
