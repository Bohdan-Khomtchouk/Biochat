TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on young adult zebrafish exposed to benzene, toluene, formaldehyde and a BTF mix

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to three chemicals (benzene (B), toluene (T), formaldehyde (F)) individually and as a BTF mix  on zebrafish. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
We used synchronized zebrafish populations exposed to B, T, F or a BTF mix, and whole genome microarrays to screen for global changes in zebrafish transcription profiles. Young adults of zebrafish were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
