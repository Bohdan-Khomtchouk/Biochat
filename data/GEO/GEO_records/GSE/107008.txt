TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines IV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (T24, A498, A549 and TE8) were treated with miRNAs (miR-223-5p, 223-3p, 145-5p and 145-3p), siRNAs (si-PMM2).
