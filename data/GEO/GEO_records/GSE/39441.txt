TITLE
Molecular fingerprint of the podocyte reveals novel gene  regulatory networks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The thorough characterization of the transcriptome of endogenous podocytes   has been hampered by low yields of cell isolation procedures.   Here we introduce a double fluorescent reporter mouse model combined   with an optimized bead perfusion protocol and efficient single cell   dissociation yielding more than 500,000 podocytes per mouse allowing for   global, unbiased downstream applications.   Combining mRNA  transcriptional profiling revealed programs of highly   specific gene regulation tightly controlling cytoskeleton,   cell differentiation, endosomal transport and peroxisome function in podocytes.   Strikingly, the analyses further predict that these podocyte-specific gene   regulatory networks are accompanied by alternative splicing of respective genes.   In summary, the presented ‘omics’ approach will facilitate the discovery   and integration of novel gene, protein and organelle regulatory   networks that deepen our systematic understanding of podocyte biology.

DESIGN
To compare gene expression of glomerulus podocytes versus non-podocytes  5 replicates of 4 pooled mice were used. Data were normalized by robust multi-chip analysis. Exon expression values were summarised to the core meta probesets, as defined by Affymetrix, using the oligo library from R.
