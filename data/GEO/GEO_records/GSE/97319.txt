TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis to analyze gene expression of bacteria corroding iron

ORGANISM
Clostridium carboxidivorans

SUMMARY
To identify the mechanism of Microbial Influenced Corrosion (MIC) and the bacterial response toward corrosion, we conducted whole genome microarray expression profile. At log phase, the cell of Clostridium carboxidivorans using iron granule as an electron donor (corroding iron) was collected as a sample, and that of using syngas as an electron donor was collected as a control.

DESIGN
Two sets of gene expression, which were C. carboxidivorans extracting  iron from iron granule and syngas was measeured.  Four independent experiments were performed  using different cultures.
