TITLE
Changes in ovarian gene expression profiles in maturing European eel (Anguilla anguilla)

ORGANISM
Anguilla anguilla

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the genetic background of gonadal maturation of the European eel and to use gene expression profiles to identify predictive markers for broodstock selection that can be measured in blood samples. To find leads for maturation markers we performed a pilot deep-sequencing transcriptome analysis of ovarian tissue derived from a yellow eel, a prepubertal silver eel and a post-spawning matured eel. Among the best leads were two key players in steroidogenesis, namely pP450c17 and liver receptor homolog-1.
