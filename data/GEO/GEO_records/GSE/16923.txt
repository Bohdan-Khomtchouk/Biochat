TITLE
Expression data from wild-type, Dgcr8 knockout and Dicer knockout ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dgcr8 and Dicer are both important components of the microRNA biogenesis pathway while Dicer is also implicated in biogenesis of other types of small RNAs such as siRNAs and mirtrons. Here we performed microarray analysis of WT, Dgcr8 and Dicer knockout ES cells to identify mRNAs differentially regulated upon loss of Dgcr8 and Dicer.

DESIGN
Wild-type, dgcr8 knockout, and dicer1 knockout ES cells were plated on 60-mm plates in triplicate.
