TITLE
Gene Re-expression in Calu6 Tumors Following Epigenetic Therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transciptional profiling of Calu6 tumors comparing 4 pooled untreated tumors to 5-azacytodine or 5-azacytodine + MS-275 (combined therapy) treated tumors

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, untreated vs. 5-Azacytodine tumors, and untreated vs. 5-azacytodine + MS-275 tumors: 4 pooled untreated tumors; 4 5-Azacytodine treated, 4 5-Azacytodine + MS-275 treated.  Study used a loop design with dye-swap.
