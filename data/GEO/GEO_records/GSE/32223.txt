TITLE
Transcriptional profile of ER71 EYFP positive/negative cells in ER71 WT and MT embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ER71 mutant embryos are nonviable and lack hematopoietic and endothelial lineages.   To further define the functional role for ER71 in cell lineage decisions, we generated genetically modified mouse models.  We engineered an ER71-EYFP transgenic mouse model by fusing the 3.9 kb ER71 promoter to the EYFP reporter gene.  Using FACS and transcriptional profiling, we examined the EYFP+ populations of cells in ER71 mutant and wildtype littermates.  In the absence of ER71, we observed an increase in the number of EYFP expressing cells, increased expression of the cardiac molecular program and decreased expression of the hemato-endothelial program compared to the wildtype littermate controls.  We have also generated a novel ER71-Cre transgenic mouse model using the same 3.9 kb ER71 promoter.  Genetic fate mapping studies revealed that the ER71 expressing cells daughter hematopoietic and endothelial lineages in the wildtype background.  In the absence of ER71, these cell populations contributed to alternative mesodermal lineages including the cardiac lineage.  To extend these analyses, we used an inducible ES/EB system and observed that ER71 overexpression repressed cardiogenesis.  Together, these studies identify ER71 as a critical regulator of mesodermal fate decisions, acting to specify the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages at the expense of cardiac lineages.  This enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that govern mesodermal fate decisions early during embryogenesis.

DESIGN
12samples were analyzed, including triplicates of WT; EYFP positive, WT EYFP negative, ER71 MT; EYFP positive and ER71 MT; EYFP negative cells
