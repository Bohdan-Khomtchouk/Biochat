TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis of the impact of electron radiation on Daltons lymphoma ascites cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression changes induced upon electron radiation in cancer cells is largely unexplored. We investigated the effect of electron radiation generated from 8 MeV Microtron in Daltons lymphoma ascites (DLA) cells bearing mice model. Mice implanted with DLA cells in their peritoneal cavity were exposed to 2 Gy dose of electron radiation. 48 Hours after irradiation, tumor cells were harvested from peritoneal cavity of both treatment-naive and total body irradiated mice. Microarray based genome-wide mRNA profiling approach was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between control and treated groups. 249 genes were found altered in DLA cells upon electron irradiation, of which 176 genes were upregulated and 73 genes were downregulated. The microarray results from this study were validated using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for selected candidate genes. In summary, total body irradiation with 8 MeV electrons has potential to inhibit the tumor cell proliferationin in vivo lymphoma model with the changes in specific signaling pathways and gene expression.

DESIGN
Mice implanted with DLA cells in their peritoneal cavity were exposed to 2 Gy dose of electron radiation. Total RNA was isolated from DLA cells retrieved from  control (treatment-naive) and irradiated mice (2 Gy) at 48 hours after radiation exposure.
