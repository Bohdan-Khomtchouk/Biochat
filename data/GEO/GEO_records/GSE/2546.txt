TITLE
MtIFS1-expressing alfalfa

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We used an M. truncatula 16K oligonucleotide array to profile gene expression in the leaves of transgenic alfalfa plants expressing Medicago truncatula isoflavone synthase 1 (MtIFS1).  RNA purified from leaves of MtIFS1-expressing lines C22 and B20 and vector control line VC11 was used to generate Cy5-labeled cDNA.  RNA purified from a second vector control line, VB2, was used to generate Cy3-labeled reference cDNA.  Three independently propagated cuttings of each line were used and a total of nine hybridizations were performed.  Our results indicated that MtIFS1-expression does not significantly alter global gene expression in the leaves. Keywords = Medicago Keywords = isoflavone synthase Keywords = alfalfa Keywords: other
