TITLE
Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants (TPS3130 and TPS3190) vs. parent strains (JKD6009 and JKD6004)

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
WalKR is an essential two component regulatory system in S. aureus, thought to control cell wall metabolism. Using genome sequencing of 5 paired clinical isolates of vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus we found frequent, but unique, mutations in this locus. To investigate the contribution of these mutations to vancomycin resistance allelic replacement WalK (G223D) and WalR (K208R) mutants were generated and compared to the parent strains. Mutations in walk and walR led to increased vancomycin resistance, reduced biofilms formation and attenuation of virulence, demonstrating that minor genetic changes in this locus can lead to significant changes in bacterial resistance and virulence. Microarray transcriptional comparisons were performed to investigate the regulatory effects of the WalK (G223D) and WalR (K208R) mutations, and demonstrated that while changes in genes affecting cell wall metabolism were detected, more dramatic changes were found in regulation of cellular metabolism.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of laboratory derived S. aureus walKR mutants compared to the parent isolates. TPS3130 has a single point mutation in walK, and TPS3190 has a single point mutation in walR. Two condition experiment TPS3130 vs JKD6009 and TPS3190 vs JKD6004. 3 biological replicates per isolate pair, one replicate per slide.

PLATFORM
GPL10592 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 16K v9 array designed primarily based on strain N315
