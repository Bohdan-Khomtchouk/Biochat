TITLE
Temporal transcriptional response of endothelial cells to aqueous cigarette smoke extract exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to cigarette smoke extract for 3, 7, and 24 hours.  Total RNA was isolated and used for hybridisation to dual channel oligonucleotide genome-wide microarrays using untreated HUVEC as a control. The objective was to find out what genes are regulated by exposure to cigarette smoke extract, and the time dependency of their regulation Keywords: time course, stress response

DESIGN
Two biological replicates are included at each time point. Dye swapping was used to exclude effect solely due to the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes used.
