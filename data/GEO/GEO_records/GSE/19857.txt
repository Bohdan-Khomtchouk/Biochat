TITLE
Functional characterization of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in cytosolic APX1 and peroxisomal CAT2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of WT, cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (Apx1) and peroxisomal catalase 2 (Cat2) single mutants and apx1/cat2 double mutant plants, subjected to 0h and 1h of high light irradiation in order to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the observed growth retardation and stress resistance of apx1/cat2 double mutant plants.

DESIGN
4 genotypes x 2 conditions experiment including WT, apx1, cat2, and apx1/cat2 plants treated with 0h and 1h of high light irradiation. Two biological replicates. In total, 16 samples hybridized on 8 Arabidopsis Gene Expression microarrays V3 (Agilent, two-color array) including color swap of replicate samples.
