TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of serum starved prelamin A-accumulating hMSCs gene expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of serum starved prelamin A-accumulating hMSCs at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that prelamin A accumulation induces the dysregulation of genes that are essensial for cell survival under a stress condition such as serum starvation. The results provide important information about these genes and the functional categories that are dysregulated due to prelamin A accumulation in serum starved hMSCs.

DESIGN
Two samples are analyzed in this microarray experiment: human mesenchymal stem cell cultured under serum starvation conditions (during 24 hours) which accumulate prelamin A (pre-hMSCs) and control mesenchymal stem cells (ctrl-hMSCs). 2 biological replicates (hMSCs derived from 2 different bone marrow donors) and 1 technical replicate are included in this analysis.
