TITLE
Mouse P0 cerebellum: Smarca5 conditional KO mice (cKO) versus wild type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of mouse cerebellum in which the experimental strain conditionally lack the Smarca5 gene that encodes for the catalytic subunit of multiple chromatin remodeling complexes. Deletion of Smarca5 was restricted to those cells expressing Cre-recombinase driven by the Nestin promoter.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in P0 cerebella of Smarca5 cKO mice versus wild type controls. Three samples of each strain were used in a total of 4 replicates.
