TITLE
microRNA expression profile of MCF7 cells with retroviral inducible expression of ΔNp63α [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 is a breast adenocarcinoma cell line which exhibits properties of differentiated luminal epithelial cells. ΔNp63α, an N-terminally truncated isoform of p51/p63 protein, plays a critical role in mammary gland development. Here, we inducibly express ΔNp63α in MCF7 cells and studied its role in stemness of breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Expression of ΔNp63α was induced in MCF7 cells with Doxycycline (Dox) for 48 hours. Total RNA containing microRNAs was isolated. microRNA microarray analysis was performed in Dox- (MCF7-PTO-ΔNp63α-Dox-) and Dox+ (MCF7-PTO-ΔNp63α-Dox+) samples.
