TITLE
Karyotype analysis of polyploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell lines

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The polyploid S. cerevisiae karyotypes were analyzed by array-CGH to identify the deletion or duplication of gene or chromosome during the strain construction and after experimental evolution.

DESIGN
Polyploid vs. haploid cells. Biological replicates, independently grown and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL18498 IMB yeast 7K operon oligo array for gene expression
