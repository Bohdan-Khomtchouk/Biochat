TITLE
Karyotype analysis of polyploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell lines

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The polyploid S. cerevisiae karyotypes were analyzed by array-CGH to identify the deletion or duplication of gene or chromosome during the strain construction and after experimental evolution.

DESIGN
Polyploid vs. haploid cells. Biological replicates, independently grown and harvested.
