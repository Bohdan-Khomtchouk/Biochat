TITLE
Associations between gene expression variations and ovarian cancer risk alleles identified from genome wide association studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in lymphoblastoid cell lines of familial ovarian cancer patients and controls

DESIGN
Comparing the mRNA expression data of 74 ovarian cancer cases with  47 healthy controls. Genotype information of the 7 risk alleles is linked to the bottom of the Series record.
