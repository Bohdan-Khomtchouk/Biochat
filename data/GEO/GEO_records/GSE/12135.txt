TITLE
Expression data from Emx2 wildtype and knockout olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Emx2 is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in development. Olfactory sensory neuron axons from Emx2 knockout mice fail to innervate their target tissue, the olfactory bulb. Homeobox transcription factors may also play an important role in olfactory receptor expression. We used microarrays to analyze differences in mRNA abundance in the olfactory epithelium of Emx2 wildtype and knockout embryonic day 18.5 mice. Keywords: Knockout-Wildtype comparision

DESIGN
Total RNA from 9 Emx2 wildtype and 9 Emx2 knockout mice was analyzed. Equal amounts of RNA from 3 animals was pooled to create one biological sample, 3 pools per genotype, 6 chips total. RNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST array.
