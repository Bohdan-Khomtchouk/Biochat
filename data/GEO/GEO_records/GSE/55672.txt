TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of live and hybridized iPSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpressing the Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, and then grown in standard 2i/serum media conditions. Hybridized iPSCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde; permeabilized in 70% ethanol for over 12 hours; incubated for 12 hours at 30C in an RNA preserving hybridization buffer (300 mM Sodium chloride, 30mM Sodium citrate, 2.1M Ammonium sulfate, 25% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml E. Coli tRNA, 500 μg/ml BSA); and reverse cross-linked for 1 hour at 50C with Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Proteinase K (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 500 μg/ml Proteinase K).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and compared for live and hybridized iPSCs (1 sample each).
