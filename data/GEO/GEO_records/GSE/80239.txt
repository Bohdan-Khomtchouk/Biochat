TITLE
EZH2 inhibitor-mediated transcriptional profiling in prostate cancer cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported here the gene expression profiles that were mediated upon the treatment of EZH2 inhibitor in two hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines: the sensitive, AR-positive abl cells and the insensitive, AR-null DU145 cells.

DESIGN
We treated both types of prostate cancer cells with two different EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126 or EPZ-6438) at final concentrations of 5 uM for 60-72 hrs, and then collected RNAs for gene expression profiling.
