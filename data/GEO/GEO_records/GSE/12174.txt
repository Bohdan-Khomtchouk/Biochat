TITLE
Identification of Plasmodium vivax genes whose expression is spleen-dependent

ORGANISM
Plasmodium vivax

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify P. vivax genes whose expression is dependent on the intact spleen in experimental infections in Aotus monkeys.

DESIGN
These studies were carried-out at the facilities of the “Fundación Centro de Primates de la Universidad del Valle”, Cali, Colombia and in the “Barcelona Centre for International Health Resarch” - CRESIB, Barcelona, Spain.  This protocol was approved from the Ethical Committees of both Centres. A total of 4 Aotus lemurinus griseimembra naive animals were used in these experiments.  Three animals were splenectomized whereas another had an intact spleen. A donor monkey was infected with P. vivax Sal-I strain and after peak parasitemias appeared a time-series infections into Sp-1, Sp-2, Sp-3, and Sp+2 animals were performed. Parasites from each infection were obtained from peripheral blood, monkey leukocytes were removed by MidMacs and only purified schizont stages were used for RNA extractions. Dual-hybridizations Cy3/Cy5 comparing the global expression of parasites obtained from different infections (Cy5) with a reference pool PvSp-1 obtained from splenectomized monkeys from CDC (PvSp-1) were perfomed using an Agilent's 60-mer platform representing the complete coding genome of P. vivax (1 oligonucleotide/2 kb coding sequences) GPL6667

PLATFORM
GPL6667 P. vivax exon array v1.0 using oligos designed by Z. Bozdech and  G. Hu
