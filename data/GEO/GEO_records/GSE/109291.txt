TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of a C. albicans rim101-/- disrupted strain, a strain overexpressing RIM101 and a reference strain at both alkaline (7.6) and acidic (4) pH

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to compare the RNA-SEQ profiles of a wild type C. albicans strain (SC5314), a rim101-/- mutant strain (DAY25) and a strain overexpressing RIM101 (CGY1) at both alkaline (7.6) and acidic (4) pH, in order to identify Rim-dependent genes involved in tolerance to antifungals

DESIGN
Samples were collected after growth at pH 4 (Rim pathway inactivated) and pH 7.6 (Rim pathway activated), in triplicates. RNAs were extracted, prepared, and sequenced using standard RNA-Seq methods and Illumina technology.

PLATFORM
GPL19036 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Candida albicans)
