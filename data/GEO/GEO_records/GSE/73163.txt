TITLE
Identification of miRNA signature associated with HCV infection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of SMART strategy, we aimed to characterize changes in miRNA expression associated with HCV infection.

DESIGN
Huh7.5 hepatoma cells were infected with a cell culture adapted JFH1 strain (JFH-1T; MOI = 0.1).  Mock infection was performed as control.  72 hours-post transfection, RNA isolations were performed.
