TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression to identify the probably functionally relevant pathways in cervical cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes and pathways relevant to Cervical cancer pathogenesis. The study also aimed at identifying  probable mechanistic differences in the low and high HOTAIR expressing cervical cancers patients .

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HPV negative histologically normal controls, HPV16 positive non-malignants and HPV16 positive cervical cancers having either low or high HOTAIR expression levels were compared to identify transcriptome level differences.
