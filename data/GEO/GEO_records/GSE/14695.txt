TITLE
Computational and Analytical Framework for Small RNA Profiling by High-Throughput Sequencing (standards)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The purpose of this work was to describe a computational and analytical methodology for profiling small RNA by high-throughput sequencing.  The datasets here were used to develop synthetic oligoribonucleotides as spike-in standards.

DESIGN
We assessed the use of synthetic oligoribonucleotide standards as spike-in controls.  These standards can be used to set an objective standard against which to compare samples.  Standards were added to the total RNA (100 ug) in the following amounts: Std2 (TATATGCAAGTCCGGCCATAC) 0.01 pmol, Std3 (TAGCTAACGCATATCCGCATC) 0.1 pmol, Std6 (TGAAGCTGACATCGGTCATCC) 1.0 pmol.
