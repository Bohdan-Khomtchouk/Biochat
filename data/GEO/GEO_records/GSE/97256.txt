TITLE
FANS-assisted ATAC-Seq to identify developmentally active endothelial enhancers [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
This work sought to identify endothelial-specific enhancer elements by applying ATAC-Seq to nuclei isolated from Tg(fli1a:egfp) transgenic zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
for comparison of cell type specific gene expression and ATAC-Seq datasets, we performed parallel RNAseq in duplicate on GFPplus and minus cells isolated from Tg(fli1a:egfp) zebrafish embryos

PLATFORM
GPL21930 Illumina MiSeq (Danio rerio)
