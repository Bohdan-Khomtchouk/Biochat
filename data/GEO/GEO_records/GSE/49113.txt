TITLE
Epigenetic reprogramming in pancreatic acinar cell in the absence of MIST1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic profile of tissues is reprogrammed under diseased conditions. H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3 represent active and repressive epigenetic marks, respectively. ChIP-seq is an effective tool to study global protein-DNA interactions. To study global epigenetic differences, we used H3K4Me3 antibody to evaluate its enrichment in pancreatic acinar cells of WT and Mist1-/-  mice followed by next generation sequencing. We found specific hotspots that showed differential enrichment for H3K4Me3 both in WT and Mist1-/-  mice. The data show that pancreatic acinar cells are epigenetically reprogrammed under stressed cellular conditions.

DESIGN
Global H3K4Me3 profiling of WT and Mist1-/- pancreatic acinar cells using ChIP-seq.
