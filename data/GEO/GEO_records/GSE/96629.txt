TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Present material was analyzed for activation of intracellular pathways in neuroblastoma compared to normal tissues (neural crest cells, healthy adrenal gland).

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma samples were obtained from pediatric patients who had undergone surgery. Samples were formain fixed and embedded in paraffin. Tumors were evaluated by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the tumor cell numbers. All tumor samples used in this study contained at least 80% of tumor cells.
