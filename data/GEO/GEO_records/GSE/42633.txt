TITLE
microRNA expression profile of dermal MSCs derived from psoriasis patients and normal control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several studies have suggested that MSCs have pleiotropic immuno-modulatory effects,  including inhibition of T cell proliferation, suppression of NK cells proliferation, modulation of cytokine production, and inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) maturation etc. But the exactly mechanism are still largely unclear. We proposed to investigate the microRNA expression profile of psoriatic MSCs.
