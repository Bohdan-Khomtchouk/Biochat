TITLE
miRNA Expression Profiling in Ovarian Cell Lines compared to pooled commercial RNA samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated whether levels of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) could discriminate women with high-grade serous ovarian epithelial cancer (SEOC) from age matched healthy volunteers. miRNA expression profiling was performed on 4 SEOC cell lines and normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSE). miR-182, miR-200a, b and c were highly overexpressed in the SEOC cell lines.  miR-103, miR-92a and miR-638 displayed relatively invariant expression and with RNU48, were assessed, as putative serum miRNA normalizers. The 7 miRNA and RNU48 were assessed in serum from SEOC patients (n = 30) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 32) by qRT-PCR following pre-amplification. No correlation between age and miRNA or RNU48 levels was observed (age range 30-79 years). miR-103 demonstrated the least variance and was chosen to normalize serum volume adjusted results. miR-200a, b and c were significantly elevated in SEOC serum (P = 0.002; 0.003; 0.0003 respectively) and a multivariate model was the best predictive classifier of SEOC (ROC-AUC = 0.806). A correlation between high miR-200b levels and residual macroscopic disease following cytoreductive surgery was identified (P = 0.006). Our results suggest that serum miR-200a, b and c may have utility as diagnostic biomarkers for SEOC.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was arrayed in 1 human surface epithelial cells (HOSE) and 4 ovarian cancer cell lines (OV167, OV202, OVCAR-3, PE01). HOSE cells were run in triplicate (including 1 dye-swap). Ovarian cancer cell lines were run in duplicate (including 1 dye-swap).
