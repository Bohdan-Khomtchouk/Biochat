TITLE
X-chromosome inactivation in monkey embryos and pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
In this study, we explored x-inactivation in monkey embryos (ICM and TE separately) and pluripotent stem cells (IVF derived ES, SCNT-derived ES and monkey iPS) To elucidate x-inactivation in experimentally reprogrammed pluripotent cells, we derived pluripotent stem cells by both SCNT and iPS approaches from same parental skin fibroblasts. We also compared gene patterns of those cells to IVF-derived counterpart.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of rhesus monkey embryonic stem cell lines derived by both SCNT (CRES) and iPS (RiPS) from same monkey skin fibroblasts were compared each other. Both experimentally reprogrammed cells were also compared with IVF-derived counterpart (ORMES23). Finally, the adult somatic skin fibroblasts were analyzed. Three biological replicates of each cell line (A, B, C) were analyzed.
