TITLE
The host transcriptome remains unaltered during the establishment of coral-algal symbioses

ORGANISM
Acropora palmata ; Orbicella faveolata

SUMMARY
Coral reefs are based on the symbiotic relationship between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. We followed gene expression of coral larvae of Acropora palmata and Montastraea faveolata after exposure to Symbiodinium strains that differed in their ability to establish symbioses. We show that the coral host transcriptome remains almost unchanged during infection by competent symbionts, but is massively altered by symbionts that fail to establish symbioses. Our data suggest that successful coral-algal symbioses depend mainly on the symbionts' ability to enter the host in a stealth manner rather than a more active response from the coral host.

DESIGN
Acropora palmata Samples: Three biological replicates of pooled larvae from each species and condition (i.e. untreated control, inoculated with competent Symbiodinium strain, inoculated with incompetent Symbiodinium strain) for both time points were hybridized against a pooled reference. Pooled references were constructed by combining equal amounts of aRNA from all control samples from A. palmata. References were labeled with Cy3, samples with Cy5. Montastraea faveolata Samples: Three biological replicates of pooled larvae from each species and condition (i.e. untreated control, inoculated with competent Symbiodinium strain, inoculated with incompetent Symbiodinium strain) for both time points were hybridized against a pooled reference. Pooled references were constructed by combining equal amounts of aRNA from all control samples from M. faveolata. References were labeled with Cy3, samples with Cy5. Symbiodinium sp. CassKB8: competent strain Symbiodinium sp. EL1: incompetent strain Symbiodinium sp. Mf1.05b: competent strain
