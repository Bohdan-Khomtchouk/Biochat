TITLE
Identification of chromatin regulatory sites in conditions of basal and increased SF-1 dosage in the H295R adrenocortical tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify chromatin regulatory sites by FAIRE-seq under conditions of basal and increased dosage of transcription factor SF-1 in the H295R human adrenocortical tumor cell line.

DESIGN
4 samples: input DNA in basal SF-1 expression conditions - FAIRE-seq in basal SF-1 expression conditions - input DNA in SF-1 overexpression conditions - FAIRE-seq in SF-1 overexpression conditions

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
