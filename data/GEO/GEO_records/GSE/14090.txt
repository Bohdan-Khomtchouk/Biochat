TITLE
Interspecies hybridization between Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Hybrid matings between A. thaliana and A. arenosa result in post zygotic seed lethality resulting in hybridization barrier between the two species. This barrier can be overcome to a large degree by increasing the genome dosage of the maternal genome (i.e. A. thaliana) in a cross between the two species. In this experiment we assayed the transcriptome of an incompatible cross (2x At x 2x Aa) with high seed lethality and a compatible cross (4x At x 2x Aa) using silique tissue at 5 days after pollination. We used microarrays to identify dosage responsive gene in interspecies hybridization Keywords: differential expression
