TITLE
Alterations in total and in polysomal mRNA fraction in response to expression of RNA binding motif protein 35A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene coding for RNA binding motif protein 35A (RBM35A) is inactivated by frameshift mutations in an LS180 colon carcinoma cell line and in approximately in 50% of colon tumors with microsatellite instability. To get insight into the mechanism of action of these putative tumor suppressor gene we expressed functional copy of the RBM35A cDNA in the LS180 cells. We analyzed alterations in mRNA profiles in total and in polysomal fraction of mRNA in LS180 cells in response to expressing RBM35A gene under Tet off tetracycline inducible promoter.
