TITLE
RNA-seq following enhancer repression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq to identify genes regulated by dCas9-KRAB mediated enhancer repression in NCI-H2009 lung adenocarcinoma cells

DESIGN
NCI-H2009 cells were first transfected with dCas9-KRAB fusion and subsequently transfected with no guide RNA (Empty), a guide RNA that has no target in the human genome (Dummy), and two separate guide RNAs (e3 #1 and e3 #2) recognizing the enhancer region of our study.
