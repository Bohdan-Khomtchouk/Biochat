TITLE
Identification of ARR1 targets in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based microarray experiment (ChIP chip) in order to identify ARR1 direct target genes

DESIGN
ARR1 ChIP was performed with a GFP antibody for two independent biological replicates for each genotype (pARR1::ARR1:GFP (ARR1)  and Col-wt (control)). On each array ARR1 and control samples were hybridized in different colors. Moreover, a dye swap was perfomed. In total this resulted in 4 arrays (2 biological samples in 2 dye-swapped hybridizations).
