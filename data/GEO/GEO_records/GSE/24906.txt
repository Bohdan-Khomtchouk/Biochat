TITLE
Gene expression of metamorphosis in fire ants

ORGANISM
Solenopsis invicta

SUMMARY
Ants are among the most successful animals on earth, with societies of a complexity that rivals our own. These societies are characterized by reproductive division of labor between female queens that can live several years and lay thousands of eggs per day, workers that live only a few months and are sterile, and males that live only a few weeks and do not participate in colony tasks. These striking differences in lifespan and roles are echoed by extensive morphological and physiological divergence. Using the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, we conduct the first genome-wide survey of developmental gene expression levels over 20 time-points from larval to adult stages in workers, queens and males

DESIGN
Three castes: Worker, queen & male; four colonies used for each caste (12 colonies total). Timepoints: 0h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 18h, 24h, 36h and 48h (hour timepoints) and once every 24hours until eclosion (day timepoints). Eclosion occured after 15 days for male (21 timepoints), 14 days for queen (20 timepoints) and 12 days for worker larvae (19 timepoints). We used a loop design with direct comparisons of consecutive samples within each cast: two loops in one Dye-direction, two loops in the other for balance. Additionally, 3-5 hybridizations against an unrelated Reference RNA were performed within each replicate loop. Microarray batch is indicated in the description column
