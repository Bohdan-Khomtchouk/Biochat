TITLE
Expression data from WT and TREM2 deficient microglia in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the role of TREM2 on microglia responses to amyloid-beta deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

DESIGN
Microglia were FACS-purified from 8.5 month old WT, Trem2-/-, 5XFAD, and Trem2-/- 5XFAD mice

PLATFORM
