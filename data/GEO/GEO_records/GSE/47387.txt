TITLE
Acetylated histone H3K56 interacts with Oct4 to promote mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The presence of acetylated histone H3K56 in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) correlates positively with the binding of Nanog, Sox2 and Oct4 (NSO) transcription factors at their target gene promoters. However, the function of H3K56ac there has been unclear. We now report that Oct4 interacts with K56ac and it is functionally important since K56ac combines with NSO factors in ChIP-Seq to mark the regions associated with pluripotency better than NSO alone. Therefore, our data suggest that K56ac plays a critical role in binding to Oct4 to promote the pluripotency of ESCs.

DESIGN
Genome wide location analysis ChIP-Seq was performed in mouse embryonic stem cell lines (E14Tg2a) for histone H3K56ac.
