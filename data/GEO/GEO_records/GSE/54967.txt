TITLE
Expression data from U87MG subclones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U87MG is a glioblastoma cell line that shows substantial heterogeneity despite long-term passaging. We used microarrays to identify variations in gene expression that are associated with phenotypic differences among subclones derived from U87MG.

DESIGN
U87MG was plated dilutely such that individual colonies arising from single cells could be readily isolated and propagated as subclones.
