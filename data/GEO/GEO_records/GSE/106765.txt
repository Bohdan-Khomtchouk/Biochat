TITLE
Increased expression of Ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) associates with the resistance mechanism of osimertinib resistant non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) induce a dramastic response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the EGFR mutation.However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer cells

DESIGN
We established EGFR-TKI-resistant cells (PC-9-afatinib;PC-9-AR, PC-9-osimertinib; PC-9-OR, HCC827-afatinib; HCC827-AR, HCC827-osimertinib; HCC827-OR) to discover a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and a strategy to conquer EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer.
