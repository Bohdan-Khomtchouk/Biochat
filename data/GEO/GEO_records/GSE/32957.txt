TITLE
Integrative Transcriptomic Profiling reveals Hepatic Stem-like Phenotype and Interplay of EMT and miR-200c in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared transcriptomic profiles of ICC tumor specimens to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens using Affymetrix mRNA array and the miRNA array platforms to search for unique gene signatures linked to patient prognosis. ICC and HCC share common stem-like molecular characteristics and stem-like tumor features associated with poor prognosis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 16 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), 7 mixed type of combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (CHC), 2 Hepatic adenoma, 3 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), 5 non-tumor liver tissues, and 2 CCA cell lines were performed.
