TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of B19 Virus Nonstructure Protein (NS1) transduced CD36+ Erythoid Progenitor Cells (EPCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B19V NS1 is known to be cytotoxic and involved in the pathogenesis of B19V infection. Our previous data demonstrated that NS1 impaired the cell-cycle progression of the CD36+ EPCs by inducing a stable G2 arrest. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes whose expressions were associated with the NS1-induced G2 arrest. A total of 1045 genes displayed a  more than 1.5-fold differential expression in the NS1-transduced cells. Out of 1045 differentially expressed genes, 177 were involved in cell-cycle regulation and 51 were involved in the regulation of cell differentiation. Keywords: RNA

DESIGN
CD36+ EPCs were generated from CD34+ stem cells, and transduced with B19V NS1 or control-lentivirus for 12, 24,and 48 hours. Each sample has triplicates. There are 18 samples analyzed.
