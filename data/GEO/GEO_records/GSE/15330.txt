TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse hematopoietic cells, Ikaros wt and null mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of lineage potential and transcriptional priming by Ikaros. New insight is provided into a bivalent regulation of lineage priming in the HSC and its lympho-myeloid restricted progeny the LMPP by the lymphoid lineage-determining factor Ikaros Whereas Ikaros is responsible for the activation of a cascade of lymphoid expression programs and for the establishment of lymphoid potential from the HSC to the LMPP it is also responsible for the repression of stem cell and erythroid genetic programs that are incompatible with further lineage restrictions emanating from the LMPP Keywords: Ikaros null versus wt

DESIGN
Ikaros null versus wt
