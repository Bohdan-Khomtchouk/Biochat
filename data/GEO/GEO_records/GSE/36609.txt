TITLE
Gene expression profile of human embryonic stem cells growth in low concentrations of nitric oxide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes regulated in human embryonic stem cells by the effect of low concentrations of nitric oxide. The transcriptome of cells treated with NO were compared with that of cells cultured in abscense of LIF, and undifferentiated ES cells cultured in presence of LIF. The H181 hES cell line was used for the experiments. These data complement a previous study realized in mES cells under the same NO conditions . The aim of the work is to know how NO modify transcriptome of ES cells and how participate in the modulation of self renewal and differentiation.

DESIGN
Passages between 72 and 74 of the H181 cell line were cultured on Matrigel-coated tissue culture plates in presence of 8ng/ml of bFGF for maintain them undifferentiated (control). For treatments, cells were cultured in the absence of bFGF to induce differentiation and treat cells with 2uM of DETA/NO. Cells were grown for 6 days mantaining the conditions of the treatment each 19 hours. Dietilentriamine-NO (DETA-NO) (Sigma) was used as donor of nitric oxide.  Expression data of cells treated with NO in absence of bFGF were compared with cells cultured in absence of this, in order to observe how the treatment affects the transcriptome, and if there is some similarity with undifferentiated condition in presence of bFGF.
