TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the Magnaporthe oryzae TRA1-deleted mutant and its parental strain

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
In order to understand the function of the Tra1p transcription factor we identified potentially Tra1p-regulated genes by comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the tra1- mutant and the parental strain 70-15.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type vs. TRA1-deleted mutant. 4 biological replicates with dye-swaps. Each microarry slide had 2 arrays with 44k spots (22k spots printed twice). Thus, rep1 and rep2 are technical replicates of the same biological sample (derived from one raw data file).

PLATFORM
GPL9203 Agilent-015060 Magnaporthe grisea 2.0 4 X 44K (Probe name version)
