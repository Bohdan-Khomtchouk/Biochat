TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the Magnaporthe oryzae TRA1-deleted mutant and its parental strain

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
In order to understand the function of the Tra1p transcription factor we identified potentially Tra1p-regulated genes by comparison of transcript abundance in aerial mycelium of the tra1- mutant and the parental strain 70-15.
