TITLE
A SIRT1-centered Circuitry Regulates Breast Cancer Stemness and Metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deficiency of deacetylase SIRT1 or its downstream target PRRX1 promotes breast cancer stemness and metastasis. To explore the mechnisms of SIRT1 and its downstream target PRRX1 in breast cancer, we analysed the gene expressions in breast cancer BT549 cells with SIRT1 knockout or PRRX1 knockout or not.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of breast cancer BT549 cells with SIRT1 knockout or PRRX1 knocknout or not were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq x ten

PLATFORM
GPL20795 HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens)
