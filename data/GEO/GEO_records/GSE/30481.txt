TITLE
A Map of Copy Number Variations in Chinese Populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been shown that the human genome contains extensive copy number variations (CNVs). Investigating the medical and evolutionary impacts of CNVs requires the knowledge of locations, sizes and frequency distribution of CNVs within and between populations. However, CNV study of Chinese populations has been underrepresented considering the same efforts in other populations. Here we constructed a Chinese CNV map by using Affymetrix SNP 6 array. We did population analysis with other HapMap populations and identified population specific CNVs as well as candidate CNV regions under selection. Our results serve as a useful resource in further evolutionary and medical studies.

DESIGN
There are 155 samples included in the analysis
