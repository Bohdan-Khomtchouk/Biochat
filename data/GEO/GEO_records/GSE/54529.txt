TITLE
ChIP-seq mapping of Drosophila TFIIIC (dTFIIIC220; CG7099) and SMC containing complexes in Kc167 cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We map the genome-wide binding profiles for dTFIIIC220, as well as the Drosophila cohesin and condensin complexes in the late-stage embryonic cell line Kc167

DESIGN
Examination of several proteins in the Kc167 cell line
