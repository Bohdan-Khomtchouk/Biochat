TITLE
Acute depletion redefines the division of labor among DNA methyltransferases in methylating the human genome [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global patterns of DNA methylation, mediated by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), are disrupted in all cancers by mechanisms that remain largely unknown, hampering their development as therapeutic targets. Combinatorial acute depletion of all DNMTs in a pluripotent human tumor cell line, followed by epigenome and transcriptome analysis, revealed DNMT functions in unprecedented detail. DNMT3B occupancy regulates methylation during differentiation, while an unexpected interplay was discovered in which DNMT1 and DNMT3B antithetically regulate methylation and hydroxymethylation in gene bodies, a finding confirmed in other cell types. DNMT3B mediated nonCpG methylation, while DNMT3L influenced the activity of DNMT3B toward nonCpG versus CpG site methylation. Taken together, these data reveal new functional targets of each DNMT suggesting that isoform selective inhibition would be therapeutically advantageous.

DESIGN
Overall, 27 samples were analyzed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. 19 samples include NCCIT cells treated with various siRNAs targeting specific DNA methyltransferases. For the samples labeled biological replicate 1, NTC-1 serves as the control. Two additional biological replicates were analyzed for the siDNMT1, siDNMT3B, and si3B+3L condition; NTC-2 serves as the control for these samples. Six samples include HCT116 WT and various derivatives with alternative expression of DNMT1 and/or DNMT3B; WT serves as the control. Two samples include the undifferentiated (UD) and 7-day differentiated (DF) NCCIT cells; UD serves as the control.
