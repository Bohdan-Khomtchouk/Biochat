TITLE
Comprehensive miRNA profiling of skeletal muscle and serum in induced and normal mouse muscle atrophy during aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report comprehensive miRNA expression profiles by miRNA-seq analysis in tibialis anterior muscle and serum of a disuse-induced atrophy model, compared with young (6 months) and old (24 months) mice.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of young muscle (n=5), old muscle (n=5), disuse muscle (n=5), young serum (n=5), old serum (n=4) and disuse serum (n=5).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
