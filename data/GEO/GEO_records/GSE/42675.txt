TITLE
Structural systems biology evaluation of metabolic thermotolerance in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level in E. coli K-12 MG1655 in glucose M9 minimal media with/without heatshock

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from E. coli K-12 MG1655 grown up to OD600nm 0.6 (mid-exponential phase) in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose with/without heatshock in 42oC. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 371,034 oligonucleotide probes with 50-bp length that are spaced 25 bp apart across the E. coli genome (NimbleGen). Experiments were performed with three biological replicates.
