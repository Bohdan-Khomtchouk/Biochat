TITLE
Transciptome analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UK1 delta-raoN at oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Salmonella has various mechanisms of small RNA-mediated gene regulation. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a novel intergenic transcript RaoN is involved in oxidative stress response which functions as one of the powerful antimicrobials in macrophage innate immunity. We note that the âˆ†raoN mutant is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (5.0 mM). This finding provides insights into the function of RaoN as a regulator of oxidative stress response.
