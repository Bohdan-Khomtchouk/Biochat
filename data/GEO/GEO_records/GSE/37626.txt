TITLE
Transciptome analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UK1 delta-raoN at oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. UK-1

SUMMARY
Salmonella has various mechanisms of small RNA-mediated gene regulation. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a novel intergenic transcript RaoN is involved in oxidative stress response which functions as one of the powerful antimicrobials in macrophage innate immunity. We note that the ∆raoN mutant is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (5.0 mM). This finding provides insights into the function of RaoN as a regulator of oxidative stress response.

DESIGN
UK1 wild-type and ∆raoN strains were grown in LB medium at 37℃ to an OD600 of 0.6, and then subjected to oxidative stress (5.0 mM hydroperoxide) for 30 min. Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates of wild-type and ∆raoN mutant.
