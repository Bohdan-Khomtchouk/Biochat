TITLE
Expression data from rhesus macaque colon, jejunum, and lung

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The mucosa that lines the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts is an important portal of entry for pathogens and provides the frontline of immune defense against HIV infection. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) rhesus macaque model, we have performed a comparative analysis of host gene expression in the lung and GI mucosa in response to SIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the colonic, jejunal, and pulmonary (lung) mucosa that occur during chronic SIV infection in the presence or absence of antiretroviral therapy.

DESIGN
Colon, jejunum, and lung tissues from healthy uninfected macaques and macaques with chronic stage SIV infection (+/- therapy) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
