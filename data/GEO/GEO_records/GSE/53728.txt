TITLE
Geriatric muscle stem cells switch reversible quiescence into senescence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regeneration of skeletal muscle depends on a population of adult stem cells (satellite cells) that remain quiescent throughout life. Satellite cell regenerative functions decline with aging and in progeric conditions. Here we show that geriatric satellite cells, compared to old cells, are incapable of maintaining their normal quiescent state in muscle homeostatic conditions, and this irreversibly affects their intrinsic regenerative and self-renewal capacities.
