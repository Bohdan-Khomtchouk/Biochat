TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis - Comparison of amtR deletion strain YL1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
In this approach, total transcript of a Mycobacterium smegmatis amtR deletion strain was compared under nitrogen surplus and starvation. This is a control experiment to the comparison of wild type and amtR deletion strain, resulting nitrogen-related genes which are not AmtR-controlled. Two biological replicates were analyzed.
