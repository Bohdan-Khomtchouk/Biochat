TITLE
Mthfd1 is a modifier of intestinal carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The metabolic pathways that underlie the association between folate deficiency and increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. We have studied the effect of C1THF synthase (encoded by the Mthfd1 gene) and dietary folate and choline on intestinal tumor development in Apcmin/+ mice and azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer in mice. Mthfd1 deficiency did not alter tumor number or load in Apcmin/+ mice, but did result in a decreased incidence of colon tumors. Conversely, Mthfd1 deficiency increased tumor number 3.5-fold and tumor load 2-fold in AOM-treated mice. Here we tested colons isolated from wildtype and Mthfd1-deficient animals for alterations in gene expression. Keywords: genetic modification
