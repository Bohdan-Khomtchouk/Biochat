TITLE
Human fetal penile smooth muscle cells (hfPSCM): Control vs PCB mixtures treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects exerted by three mixtures of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB), one featuring dioxin-like (DL) and two featuring non dioxin-like (NDL) congeners, on human fetal corpora cavernosa cells representative of a major male endocrine-sensitive organ, have been evaluated by gene expression profiling. PCB congeners concentrations used were derived from human internal exposure data to explore the impact of the adult body burden on a fetal tissue. Cell exposure were performed for 72h mimicking a chronic exposure.

DESIGN
Experiment conditions: control, three treatments with PCB-Mix1, PCB-Mix2 or PCB-Mix3. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 replicates per treatment. Technical replica: 2 (dye swap) per biological replica. Direct comparison design (control vs treated samples) in 12/16 arrays (biological replicates 1 and 2); Loop design in 4/16 arrays (biological replicate 3).
