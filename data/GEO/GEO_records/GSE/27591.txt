TITLE
Gene expression analysis in T cells from spleens of mice that provide a model for systemic lupus erythematosus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the interactions of murine CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with CD4+CD25- T cells, both from a fundamental biological point of view, and in the context of a murine model of lupus.

DESIGN
This study characterized the surface glycans expressed by CD25 and CD25- CD4 T cells selected from lupus-prone (systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE) mouse strains MRL/Mp and NZB/W F1 and two control strains, CBA/Ca (haplotype-matched with the MRL/Mp; H-2k) and BALB/c. A transcriptomic survey of freshly isolated and bead-activated CD25 and CD25- CD4 T cells selected from mouse spleens was conducted using these four strains. Three replicate samples of each condition were hybridized to the GLYCOv2 array, for a total of 48 samples.
