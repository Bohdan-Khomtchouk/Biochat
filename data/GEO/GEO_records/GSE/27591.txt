TITLE
Gene expression analysis in T cells from spleens of mice that provide a model for systemic lupus erythematosus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the interactions of murine CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with CD4+CD25- T cells, both from a fundamental biological point of view, and in the context of a murine model of lupus.
