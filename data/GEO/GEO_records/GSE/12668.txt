SUMMARY
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct clinicobiological entity defined as a B-cell neoplasm characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the bone marrow and immunoglobulin M paraprotein production.  Cytogenetic analysis is limited by the difficulty in obtaining tumor metaphases and the genetic basis of the disease remains poorly defined.  We performed a comprehensive analysis in 42 WM patients by using high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization with the Human Genome 244A microarray.  Overall, 83% of samples have chromosomal abnormalities, with a median of three abnormalities per patient (range 0 to 27).  The most common abnormality was 6q deletion (40%) and four non-overlapped minimal deleted regions (MDR) were identified.  Gain of 6p was the second most common abnormality (17%) and its presence was always concomitant with 6q loss.  An interstitial MDR was delineated at 13q14 including MIRN15A and MIRN16-1 in 10% of patients.  Other recurrent deletions were 7q22, 8p, 11q22-q23, 11q23-q24 and 17p11-p13 (7% each).  Copy gains were identified in chromosomes 18 (17%), 4 (12%), 3 (10%), 8q (10%) and Xq27.1-q28 (10%).  To note, we reported biallelic deletions and/or inactivating mutations with uniparental disomy in TRAF3 and TNFAIP3, two negative regulators of the NF-kB signaling pathway.  Furthermore, we confirmed the association between TRAF3 inactivation and increased transcriptional activity of NF-kB target genes.  Mutational activation of the NF-kB pathway, which is normally activated by ligand-receptor interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment, highlight its biologic importance, and suggest a therapeutic role for inhibitors of NF-KB pathway activation in the treatment of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.
