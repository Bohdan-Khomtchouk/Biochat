TITLE
Chromatin Analysis of Wilms Tumor Highlights Stem Cell Properties and a Renal Developmental Network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wilms tumors are pediatric cancers thought to arise from kidney-specific stem cells. In order to identify transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that drive these malignant cells, we compared genomewide chromatin profiles of Wilms tumors to embryonic stem (ES) cells and normal kidney.

DESIGN
Data represent examination of genome-wide chromatin modifications in primary Wilms tumors, fetal and mature kidney.
