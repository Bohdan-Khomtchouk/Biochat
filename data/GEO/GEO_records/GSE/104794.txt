TITLE
Hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) overexpression effect on primary mouse articular chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary mouse articular chondrocyte infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) protein. In this study, we have attempted to explore the effects of HIF-2α overexpression on mouse transcriptome and have identified numerous genes which are involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary mouse articular chondrocytes were isolated from mouse femoral condyles and tibial plateaus cartilage tissue (WT ICR 5-day-old mice) and were infected with null (control) or recombinant adenovirus expressing hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α, Ad-Epas1) for 24 hours. At 24 hours post-infection, total RNA was extracted from infected with null (control) adenovirus (4 biological replicates) or infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (4 biological replicates) on primary mouse articular chondrocytes and subjected to microarray analysis.
