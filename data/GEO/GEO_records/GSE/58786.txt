TITLE
RNAseq Analysis of Transcriptomic Response to Zn Resupply in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Zn-limited cells accumulate Cu in intracellular structures in a reversable manner.  We used RNAseq analysis to monitor gene expression in Zn-limited cells, and during a time course (0 - 24 h) after Zn resupply.

DESIGN
Comparison of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii gene expression when Zn deficient cells are resupplied with 2.5 ÂµM Zn. Time points 0 (before resupply), 1.5, 3, 4.5, 12, and 24 hours after resupply.  Four biological replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
