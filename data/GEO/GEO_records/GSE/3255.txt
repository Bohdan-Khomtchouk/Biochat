TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles with Common Translocations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using SAGE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SAGE was used to profile gene expression in leukemic myeloid progenitor cells of AML patients with t(8;21), t(15;17), t(9;11) and inv(16). Keywords: SAGE analysis of gene expression in leukemic myeloid progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from 4 patients with de novo t(9;11), 3 with treatment-related t(9;11), and 5 each with inv(16), t(15;17), t(8;21) were used for the study. Each sample contained at least 75% affected  cells with no other chromosome abnormalities at cytogenetic level. Mononuclear cells were purified from bone marrow cells for each sample, and CD15+ myeloid progenitor cells were isolated from these mononuclear cells. Poly A+ RNA were isolated from CD15+ myeloid progenitor cells of each sample for SAGE tag collection.
