TITLE
CD4+T cells activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aanlysis of human resting CD4+T cells and cells activated by two different methods: CD4+ T cells unstimulated (be susceptible but not support to HIV-1) and stimulated either by CD3/CD28 costimulation (reversed susceptibility and resisted to HIV-1) or by PHA/IL-2 for six days (be susceptible and support to HIV-1) to investigate potential mechanism of reversing susceptible to HIV-1.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression in resting human CD4+T cells and cells activated by two methods for six days which could induce different effects to HIV-1. Three independent experiments were performed at each treatments using different donors for each experiment.
