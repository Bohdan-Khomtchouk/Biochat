TITLE
Small RNAs in four Argonaute complexes in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The core components of RNA silencing effector complexes include small RNAs and members of the Argonaute (AGO) protein family. Arabidopsis encodes ten AGOs and complex population of small RNAs. It remains largely unknown how these small RNAs are recognized and recruited by each AGO complex. Here we purified four AGO complexes and identified small RNAs in each complex by deep sequencing. Keywords: Small RNA sorting
