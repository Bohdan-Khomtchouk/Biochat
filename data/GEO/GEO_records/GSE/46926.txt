TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effects of the novel mithramycin analogue DIG-MSK on human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of demycarosyl-3D-Î²-D-digitoxosyl-mithramycin SK (DIG-MSK; EC-8042), a novel analogue of the antitumor antibiotic mithramycin A, on gene transcription were examined in human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. DIG-MSK down-regulated a different set of genes depending on the drug concentration. Moreover, several genes were significantly up-regulated. These results are rationalized in terms of DIG-MSK competition with Sp1 transcription factor for binding to consensus C/G-rich tracts encompassed in gene promoters.

DESIGN
Human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells were treated with either 8 nM or 80 nM DIG-MSK for 24 h, and RNA was extracted from treated cells as well as from untreated (control) cells.
