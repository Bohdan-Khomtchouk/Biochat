TITLE
Murine livers: Control vs. Liver Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the possible roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating liver fiboris (LF) and the potential of lncRNAs as molecular markers for LF, we globally detected hepatic lncRNA expression proﬁle along with mRNA expression proﬁle of ICR mouse LF models which were induced by intraperitoneal injection of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) dissolved in corn oil and controls which were only injected with corn oil using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The lncRNA expression profile along with mRNA expression profile of 7 control and 7 LF livers were analyzed by Arraystar Mouse LncRNA Microarray V3.0. One liver per array.
