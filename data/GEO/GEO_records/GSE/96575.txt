TITLE
Differential gene expression in MZudu v. WT zebrafish gastrulae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report RNA-sequencing data from zebrafish embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic expression of udu (which encodes Gon4l) (MZudu) at tailbud (TB) stage. Transcripts were compared to stage-matched wild-type (WT) embryos to identify differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Sequencing of polyadenylated mRNAs from MZudu mutant and control WT embryos with 2 biological and 2 technical replicates per genotype - each with 3 lanes per sample.

PLATFORM
GPL18413 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Danio rerio)
