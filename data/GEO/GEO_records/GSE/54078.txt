TITLE
The effect of BrdU on gene expression profiles of B6C3F1 mice treated with furan

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Furan is a mouse and rat hepatocarcinogen. We sought to determine the dose-dependent changes in gene expression upon exposure of B6C3F1 mice to furan in order to better understand furanâ€™s mode of action.

DESIGN
In this study we examined the transcriptional response in liver tissue of female B6C3F1 mice to BrdU treatment (in drinking water for 5 days before sacrifice). This was a toxicogenomic study in which mice were also exposed to 0, 1 or 8 mg/kg bw furan (by oral gavage) for 3 weeks. Mice were sacrificed four hours after the final furan exposure.  Each dose group had 4-5 biological replicates. We used a two-colour reference design and SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K microarrays (Agilent). Please note that data for all non-BrdU treated animals was previously reported in GEO [GSE48644]. All samples (with or without BrdU) were part of the same randomized block design for the microarrays.
