TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans cells defective in glucan assembly and undergoing the Yeast to Hyphal transition

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Wild type (CAI10) and phr1 null mutant (CAS10) were analyzed at 0, 1, 3 and 5 hours after the shift of blastospores to Hyphae inducing conditions

DESIGN
For each strain, the transcriptional profiles at 3 and 5 h was obtained with respect to its own time zero.
