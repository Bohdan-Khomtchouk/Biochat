TITLE
Gene array analysis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) transduced with lentivirus containing cDNA of NKX2,5 or GATA4 or GFP.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to induce cardiomyogenic conversion of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC ) by triggering ectopic expression of the cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5 and GATA4. Cells were cultured without cell myocardial co-culture system and transduced  with lentivirus containing coding sequence of Nkx2.5, GATA4 or GFP as control. Cells were cultured in the EBM-2/ EGM-2 medium, 12 days before microarray analysis.   We report in this study that over-expression of NKX2.5 and GATA4 in HUVECs stimulates the expression of some specific genes important in the cardiomyogenic differentiation process, leading to partial switch of these cells from the endothelial to the myocardial course.

DESIGN
12 arrays were analysed. Three competitive hybridizations to the arrays were performed in duplicate using each time, two dye-swap following this experimental design:     AWA065 : CY5 (HUVEC+NKX2,5) / CY3 (HUVEC)    AWA067 : CY5 (HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+NKX2,5)    AWA075 :  CY5 (HUVEC+NKX2,5) / CY3 (HUVEC)    AWA076 : CY5 (HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+NKX2,5)    AWA068 : CY5 ((HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+GATA4)    AWA070 : CY5 (HUVEC+GATA4) / CY3 ((HUVEC)    AWA073 : CY5 (HUVEC+GATA4) / CY3 ((HUVEC)    AWA002 : CY5 ((HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+GATA4)    AWA066 : CY5 (HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+NKX2.5+GATA4)    AWA069 : CY5 (HUVEC+NKX2.5+GATA4) / CY3 (HUVEC)    AWA071 :  CY5 (HUVEC+NKX2.5+GATA4) / CY3 (HUVEC)    AWA074 ; CY5 (HUVEC) / CY3 (HUVEC+NKX2.5+GATA4)
