TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of Blimp1 in day 2 differentiated mouse trophoblast stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to survey genomic binding of Blimp1 in differentiating trophoblast giant cells in order to identify direct transcriptional target genes.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed using a mouse anti-Blimp1 ascites fluid on 4x10^7 of each of two wild type differentiated TS cell clones, and one differentiated mutant clone as a negative control.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
