TITLE
Expression data from normal and Malignant hematopoietic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data was used to determine levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in primary human leukemia samples.  Samples were determined to be high BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 or low BRCA1 and/or BRAC2. This data was used to determine levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in primary human leukemia samples.  Samples were determined to be high BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 or low BRCA1 and/or BRAC2.

DESIGN
AML cell lines and patient samples, B ALL cell lines and Patient samplest, T ALL cell lines and patient samples, norma B cells, normal granulocytes, normal monocytes, normal T cells and normal CD34+ cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All the AML, B ALL, T ALL cell lines were cultured in vitro under appropriate culture conditons and harvested in their log phase growth for RNA extraction. AML, B ALL, and T ALL patient samples were collected...(I assume these are the PBMCs from eitehr peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients, please confirm). Normal B cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and T cells were purified from human peripheral blood of normal healthy donors.
