TITLE
Targeting Csnk1a1 induces selective p53-dependant killing of leukemia stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found found that casein kinase 1 alpha (Csnk1a1), a serine threonine kinase and negative regulator of beta catenin, is essential for leukemia cells in vivo.

DESIGN
We examined the effect of Csnk1a1 knowckdown by gene expression profiling in primary leukemia cells.
