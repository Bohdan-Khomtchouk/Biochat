TITLE
Identification of testis-relevant genes using in silico analysis from testes ESTs and cDNA microarray in the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
Comparisons of gene expression profiles between testis and ovary of juvenile and wild brooders were made through a cDNA microarray in the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon).   Differentially expressed genes were identified through the microarray analysis, and the microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR.  Selected genes were further characterized.

DESIGN
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the EST libraries of P. monodon, consisting of 5,568 features. RNA samples were extracted from both testes and ovaries of pooled juveniles (4 month-old, pooled from n=114 ), individual juvenile and broodstocks from West sides of Thailand. The RNA from ovaries were labeled with Cy3 dye as a reference and those of testes were labeled with Cy5 dye.
