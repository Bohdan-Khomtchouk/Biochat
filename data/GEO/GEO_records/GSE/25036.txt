TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) CD24-CD44+ and non-CD24-CD44+ cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of p53 in regulating stem cell population (CD24-CD44+) and stemness-associated miRNAs, we first compared miRNA expression profiles between human mammary epithelical cells knocked-down p53 and control cells. We then cross-referenced p53-regulated miRNAs with stemness-associated miRNAs analyzed from expression profiling of sorted CD24-CD44+ and non-CD24-CD44+ cell populations. Further biological experiments were performed with the miRNAs that are altered in CD24-CD44+ stem cell populations and also regulated by p53.
