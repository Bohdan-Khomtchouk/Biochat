TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) CD24-CD44+ and non-CD24-CD44+ cell populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of p53 in regulating stem cell population (CD24-CD44+) and stemness-associated miRNAs, we first compared miRNA expression profiles between human mammary epithelical cells knocked-down p53 and control cells. We then cross-referenced p53-regulated miRNAs with stemness-associated miRNAs analyzed from expression profiling of sorted CD24-CD44+ and non-CD24-CD44+ cell populations. Further biological experiments were performed with the miRNAs that are altered in CD24-CD44+ stem cell populations and also regulated by p53.

DESIGN
Total RNAs, including miRNAs, extracted from CD24-CD44+ cells (labeled in Hy3) and non-CD24-CD44+ cells (labeled in Hy5) were hybridized on Exiqon miRCURY LNA arrays according to the manufacturer's protocol.
