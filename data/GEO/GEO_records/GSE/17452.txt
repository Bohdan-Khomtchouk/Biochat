SUMMARY
To explore the aberrant expression patterns between hybrid sexes, we compare the global gene expression of 7-day-old whole body adults of hybrids by sex in recently diverged  Drosophia pseudoobscura group

DESIGN
7-day-old virgin hybrid flies were assayed by sex. Reciprocal F1 hybrids were produced for D. pseudoobscura/D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura/D. p. bogotana crosses by mass mating virgin flies. At least three isofemale inbred lines were used for each species (D. pseudoobscura; D. persimilis; D. pseudoobscura bogotana).Two separate labeling reactions per sample were pooled and hybridized to the Agilent single color (Cyanine 3-CTP dye) arrays. Three different replicates were hybridized for each hybrid and sex. Pure species data (collected the same time and deposited as GSE17192 ) and hybrid data were analyzed together to determine the misexpression differences between hybrid males and females.
