TITLE
Low chronic exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to Caesium-137

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana plants are grown for one week in a hydroponic growth system and transferred to new plant medium containing low levels of Caesium-137 (control is transferred to new medium with no radioactivity) and left for further two weeks. Levels of Caesium-137 are chosen according to research and are reflecting occurring levels found in radioactive contaminated soil. The plants are then harvested and the samples divided into shoot and root samples.
