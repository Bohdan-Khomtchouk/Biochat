TITLE
Uterine Transcriptional Profile Following Treatment with Estradiol or Synthetic Estrogens Diethylstilbestrol and Propyl Pyrazole Triol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional responses in ovariectomized mouse uterine tissue to estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), known long-acting estrogens, and propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), an ER-alpha selective estrogen, were profiled. Profiles were used together with those from other estrogens to derive a biomarker panel.

DESIGN
2 mice each: WT saline, WT E2 2h, WT E2 24h, WT DES 2h, WT DES 24h, WT PPT 2h, WT PPT 24h.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
