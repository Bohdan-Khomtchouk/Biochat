TITLE
Med1 is Necessary for Cardiac Function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventricular derived mRNA from Med1fl/fl and Med1fl/fl cardiac knockout mice.  Results provide insight into the molecual rmechanisms underlying dilated cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN
Methods: Ventricular samples (4 per group) from 21-day-old Med1fl/fl and Med1 cardiac knockout mice were used to generate polyA enriched stranded RNA libraries followed by RNAseq using the Illumina HiSeq platform.  Raw sequence reads were analyzed with BaseSpace (www.illumina.com) by aligning reads to the mus musculus mm10 genome using the TopHat Alignment app.  Transcripts were assembled and significant differentially expressed genes were determined with the Cufflinks Assembly and DE app using a false discovery rate < 0.05. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays
