TITLE
Gene expression profiling of rat endometrial cancer

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rat EAC - comparison of non-/pre-malignant endometrium with endometrial tumors Endometrial cancer develops from the endometrium of the uterus and is the most common pelvic malignancy diagnosed in women in the western countries. Similar to all cancer diseases, endometrial cancer is a genetic disorder that results from complex patterns of genetic and epigenetic alterations involved in the malignant transformation. The genetic heterogeneity inherent in the human population, differences in the environment and life styles poses enormous difficulties when analyzing the complex patterns of genetic alterations contributing to cancer etiology. Inbred animal models constitute unique experimental genetic tools as the genetic heterogeneity and the influence of environmental factors can be readily reduced. The BDII/Han rat model is unique for spontaneous hormonal carcinogenesis since more than 90% of the female virgins spontaneously develop endometrial cancer during their life span. The possibility to perform global gene expression profiling of tumor cells would likely provide important information of the genes and pathways that are involved in EAC susceptibility and carcinogenesis. Keywords: Endometrial tumors developed in crosses with the BDII inbred rat strain (from backcrosses, NUT, and intercrosses, RUT) and Sprague Dawley curley-3 and Brown Norway
