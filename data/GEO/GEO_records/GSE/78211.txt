TITLE
Expression analysis of gastric cancer cells treated with periplocin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further analyze the change of differential gene expression between SGC-7901 cells treated with 100ng/ml periplocin and untreated cells, respectively. We employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in SGC-7901 cells treated with 100ng/ml periplocin for 24h at 37 ÂºC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
