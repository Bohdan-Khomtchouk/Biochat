TITLE
Genome-wide map of RNA polymerase II, NELF, and DSIF in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most metazoan promoters have RNA polymerase II (Pol II) paused slightly downstream of the transcription start site by NELF and DSIF. This pausing keeps these promoters available for rapid induction by P-TEFb, whose activity causes NELF to dissociate and Pol II and DSIF to elongate on the gene. ChIP-Seq data was generated for Pol II, NELF, and DSIF in HeLa cells and used to look at pausing downstream of unannotated promoters.
