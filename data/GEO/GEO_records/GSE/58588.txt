TITLE
Expression profiling of proliferative T-HEp3 and dormant D-HEp3 HNSCC cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to obtain expression profiles of proliferative T-HEp3-GFP and dormant D-HEp3-GFP cells after one week in vivo. The second objective was find tumor cells quiescence associated genes in dormant D-HEp3 cells that are only quiescent when injected in vivo. In this case we compared cells one week growing vs. dormant for the indicated cells in chick embryo CAMs. After one week 5 embryos per cell line carrying the indicated cells were isolated, tumors collagenased as described below and sorted for GFP-high cells usig a MoFlo machine. The sorted cells > 5x10^4 were used to extract RNA and the pure RNA was used to perform expression profiling using the Affymetrix HG-u133plus2 arrays. Because of the low amount of D-HEp3 (dormant) cells recovered all tumor cells from the dormant nodules were pooled. The same was done for proliferative-sorted T-HEp3-GFP cells to allow comparisons. Arrays were performed in triplicate.

DESIGN
5 T-HEp3-GFP tumors and 5 D-HEp3-GFP nodules were processed for preparation of single cells suspensions, RNA extracted and then pools of  T-HEp3-GFP and D-HEp3-GFP sorted cells were analyzed in triplicate arrays
