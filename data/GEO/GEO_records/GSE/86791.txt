TITLE
RNA binding protein CPEB1 remodels host and viral RNA landscapes [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we report that HCMV infection results in widespread alternative splicing (AS), shorter 3′-untranslated regions (3′UTRs) and polyA tail lengthening in host genes and CPEB1 depletion reverses infection-related post-transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq for Mock (Non-targeting siRNA), human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with non-targeting siRNA, and CPEB1 siRNA treated human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). We also performed RNA-seq for lentivirus mediated GFP overexpression (OE) and CPEB1 overexpression human foreskin fibroblasts. Lastly, we performed TAIL-seq for Mock (Non-targeting siRNA), human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with non-targeting siRNA, and CPEB1 siRNA treated HFFs.
