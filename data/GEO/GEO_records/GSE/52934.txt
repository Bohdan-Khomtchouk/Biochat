TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Jurkat T cells expressing MALT1 or its mutants MALT1-R149A and MALT1-C464A or the MALT1-R149A-C464A double mutant.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: study the role of MALT1 auto-proteolysis in T cell receptor mediated activation of NF-kB. Methods: Jurkat cells were generated that express wild type MALT1, the auto-cleavage deficient MALT1-R149A mutant, the catalytic inactive MALT1-C464A mutant or the R149A-C464A double mutant (RACA). Expression of endogenous MALT1 was inactivated using TALEN technology for the Jurkat cells expressing MALT1-R149A (JDM-RA) and MALT1-C464A (JDM-CA). Illumina HISeq 2000 deep sequencing was performed to determine the mRNA profiles for MALT1, JDM-RA, JDM-CA and RACA cells in unstimulated conditions or after treatment with 75ng/ml PMA and 150 ng/ml ionomycin for 3 or 18 hrs. Results: PMA ionomycin stimulation of the MALT1 auto-cleavage defective JDM-RA cells fails to activate NF-kB-dependent transcription like for the MALT1 catalytic inactive JDM-CA cells and the double RACA mutant cells. Conclusion: MALT1 autoproteolysis is essential for transcription of NF-kB target genes

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Jurkat expressing MALT1, MALT1-R149A, MALT1-C464A and MALT1-R149A-C464A after 0, 3 and 18 hours of stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using  Illumina HISeq 2000
