TITLE
Gene expression profile mediated by independent E-cadherin repressors

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of MDCK epithelial cells expressing different repressors (MDCK-Snail, MDCK-Slug and MDCK-E47 cells) versus control MDCK cells. Keywords: Genetic Modification (overexpression of E-cadherin repressors)

DESIGN
The Oncochip microarray platform v1.1 contains 9,726 clones corresponding to 6,386 different genes, and it includes 2,489 duplicate clones. Duplicate samples from each of the MDCK transfectants (E47, SNAIL, SLUG) were labeled with dUTP-Cy5 and hybridized against the dUTP-Cy3-labeled MDCK-CMV controls. Two additional hybridizations using reciprocal fluorochrome labeling were performed (dye-swap). Thus, a total of four hybridizations were performed for each condition.
