TITLE
miRNA profiling in camptothecin-treated or untreated hepatoma-derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Totally 1,308 miRNAs were examined. Three miRNAs (hsa-miR-1976, 4728-3p, and 877-3p) were upregulated with fold change excess 0.8 and six miRNAs (hsa-miR-4497, -204-3p, -6126, -5787, -1273e, and -1908-3p) were downregulated in the exosome released from camptothecin-treated hepatoma.

DESIGN
Comparing between results of these two samples revealed novel miRNA regulation upon anti-cancer drug treatments exosomal miRNAs from CPT-treated hepatoma and unrteated
