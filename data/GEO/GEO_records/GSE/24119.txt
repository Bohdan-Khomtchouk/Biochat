TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Chlamydia trachomatis Serovar D genes under different in-vitro hormonal conditions

ORGANISM
Chlamydia trachomatis

SUMMARY
In this project we examined in-vitro effect of female sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone at average physiological concentration level on Chlamydia trachomatis gene expression level.

DESIGN
Regulation of chlamydial gene expression by the female sex hormones oestradiol and progesterone was examined. A total of 16 chlamydial arrays were analysed with the 4 culture conditions (no hormone, E, P, E+P) x four replicates. Bacterial samples were grown in non-hormone treated culture were used as control
