TITLE
Clinically Relevant Subsets Identified by Gene Expression Patterns Support a Revised Ontogenic Model of Wilms Tumor: A Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Favorable Histology WTs (FHWT) are genetically heterogeneous and the pathogenesis for the majority is not known; therefore,  we sought to identify and characterize distinctive subsets within FHWT and to place each subset within their clinical and developmental context.

DESIGN
Classification by microarray analysis : Global gene expression analysis was performed on 224 FHWT tumors using  Affymetrix U133A arrays and subsets were identified and characterized using gene set enrichment analysis, WT1, WTX, and CTNNB1 mutation status, 11p15 methylation, and 11p15 copy number.
