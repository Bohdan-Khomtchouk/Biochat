TITLE
Expression data from rice embryo and endosperm development

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The receptor-like kinases (RLKs) plays critical roles in signal transduction through sensing the extracellular signals and activating the downstream signal transduction by phosphorylating their targets. Up to now, there are only a few RLKs have been functionally identified. In this study, we systemically analyzed the expression pattern of rice genes, especially the RLK coding genes during embryo and endosperm development.

DESIGN
Rice Ovary and three development stages of embryo and endosperm (embryo 3, 9, 12 DAF; Endosperm 3, 9, 16 DAF) were analyzed, all of them were biologically repeated two times.
