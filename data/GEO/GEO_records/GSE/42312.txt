TITLE
Grapevine cell cultures transcriptomic response to methyl jasmonate and cyclodextrin elicitors

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The specificity and synergisms of methyl jasmonate and cyclodextrin elicitor effects in grapevine were analysed at the transcrptomic level. To this end, 12-14 day old cell cultures established from Vitis vinifera L. cv Monastrell calli were elicited with 50 mM cyclodextrin (CD), 100 ÂµM methyl jasmonate (MJ) or the combination of both elicitros (MJ+CD). The experiment was carried out in triplicate and untreated cell cultures were followed in parallel as a control. Cells of each culture were isolated just prior and 24h after the treatment to obtain RNA. GrapeGen GeneChip microarray hybridization was performed from each sample.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.
