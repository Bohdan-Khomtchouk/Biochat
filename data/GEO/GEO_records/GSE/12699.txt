TITLE
Murine bone-marrow derived macrophages: Wild type Control vs. DICER1 (Dcr1) hypomorphic cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify miRNA molecules that are involved in inflammatory response in macrophages. A miRNA expression profiling of mouse macrophages comparing control wild type cells with DICER hypomorphic cells were conducted after these were subjected to treatment with LPS. Keywords: miRNA; DICER hypomorphic macrophages, microarray

DESIGN
Pairwise comparison of Control versus DICER1 (Dcr1) hypomorphic cells. Two biological replicates were performed with three technical replicates for each biological replicate: 1 Control, 1 DICER1 (Dcr1) hypomorph, 2 treatment conditions. Exposed to LPS, harvested at 2hr and 4hr post treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL7257 BTI oligonucleotide microarray using Ambion miRNA probesets (#1564v1)
