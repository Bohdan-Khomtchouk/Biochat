TITLE
Murine bone-marrow derived macrophages: Wild type Control vs. DICER1 (Dcr1) hypomorphic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify miRNA molecules that are involved in inflammatory response in macrophages. A miRNA expression profiling of mouse macrophages comparing control wild type cells with DICER hypomorphic cells were conducted after these were subjected to treatment with LPS. Keywords: miRNA; DICER hypomorphic macrophages, microarray
