TITLE
Pyrrole-imidazole polyamide targeted to the REL/ELK1 overlapping sequences in the EVI1 minimal promoter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) have been shown to inhibit gene expression by interrupting the DNA-protein interface. Human Ectopic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) is an oncogenic transcription factor which plays a key role in many aggressive forms of cancer. We have developed a novel pyrroleâ€“imidazole polyamide, PIP1 targeting the REL/ELK1 binding site in the EVI1 minimal promoter that can significantly repress the expression of EVI1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that a fraction of EVI1-driven genes were modulated by PIP1.

DESIGN
Global expression changes in MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated after treating the cells with PIP1 and DMSO for 48 hours. The vehicle DMSO is used as a negative control. Each condition is performed in technical replicates.
