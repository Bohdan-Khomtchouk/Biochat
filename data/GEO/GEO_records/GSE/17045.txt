TITLE
Expression data from kidney transplantations in a Fisher-Lewis rat model: placebo and 13cisRA treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Most kidney allograft losses are caused by chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). The aim of the study was to correlate changes in gene expression over time during the development of chronic damage in contrast to13cisRA Treated animal that demonstrated morphologically healthy kidneys by the end of teh study. Renal allografts were harvested from placebo and13cisRA Treatment groups for time points 0d, 7d, 14d and 56d (n=3-5) and examined for steady state mRNA expression using Affymetrix microarray RG-U34A. The effect of the13cisRA Treatment on dysregulated pathways was examined. In order to verify the microarray analysis, qPCR has been performed. Microarray data was used to obtain transcriptomic changes reflecting signaltransduction pathway dysregulation

DESIGN
Progression of rejection was observed in untreated animals at timepoints 7d, 14d and 56d after transplantation that could be prevented by 13cisRA treatment
