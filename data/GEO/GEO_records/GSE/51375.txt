TITLE
Assesing an improved protocol for plasma microRNA extraction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The first step in biomarkers discovery is to identify the best protocols for their purification and analysis. We have identified an optimal RNA extraction method of microRNAs from human plasma samples. We also report that the addition of low doses of carrier RNA before starting RNA extraction improves microRNA extraction and quantification.

DESIGN
Human plasma and matched biopsies were obtained from healthy donors and patients attended at the Hospital Universitari i Polit√®cnic La Fe (Valencia, Spain). RNA was extracted by different preanalytal conditions and reagents, testing the suitable of carrier addition at differnt doses. The best protocol was followed up by hybridation on Affymetrix microarrays.
