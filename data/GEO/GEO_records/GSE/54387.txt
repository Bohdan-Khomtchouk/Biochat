TITLE
Expression data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells from healthy and diet-induced obesity mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Little is known about the function of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) generated from diabetics, as this could potentially limit subsequent therapeutic use in this patient population. Here, we demonstrate that iPSC-ECs derived from diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice exhibit evidence of endothelial dysfunction. We also observed that mice receiving intramuscular (IM) injections of DIO iPSC-ECs had significantly decreased reperfusion following hindlimb ischemia compared to mice administered with iPSC-ECs from control mice. Hindlimb sections revealed increased muscle atrophy and presence of inflammatory cells in mice receiving iPSC-ECs from DIO mice. When pravastatin was administered to mice receiving DIO iPSC-ECs, a significant increase in reperfusion was observed, which was blunted by co-administration of L-NAME. This study is the first to provide evidence that iPSC-ECs from pre-diabetic mice exhibit signs of endothelial function, and suggest that pravastatin administration may be needed for diabetic patients receiving autologous iPSC-ECs therapy in the clinic.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed, two from the healthy (control) group and two from the diet-induced obesity group
