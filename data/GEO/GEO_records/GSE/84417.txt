TITLE
Expression data from uterus tissue of sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Embryo implantation is an essential step for the establishment of pregnancy and is crucial for the successful embryo transplantation of in vitro fertilization embryos. The successful implantation of an embryo depends upon cellular and molecular dialog between the uterus and the embryo. We used microarrays to detail the key regulated genes underlying embryo implantation process in sheep.

DESIGN
In this study, all ewes were assigned to two experimental groups randomly as follows: in vivo embryo (IVV) group (n = 12) and in vitro embryo (IVT) group (n = 9). The ewes of IVV group were mated with fertile rams of the same strain to induce pregnancy respectively. In addition, the ewes of IVT group were transplanted 3 in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos at 4 ~ 8 cell stage respectively after synchronization of estrus. Uterus tissue at implantation and inter-implantation sites of both groups were collected at successive stages of implantation period and used for microarray analysis.
