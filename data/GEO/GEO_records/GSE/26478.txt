Mouse lymphocyte study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Paulson's group investigates the roles of carbohydrate-binding proteins involved in immune regulation and human disease, through their interaction with carbohydrate groups expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates. This laboratory is currently focused on how sialoside ligands modulate Siglec functions and on understanding the molecular basis of glycosylation changes following differentiation and activation of leukocytes.
