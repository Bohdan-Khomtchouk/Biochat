TITLE
small RNA-seq of Physcomitrella patens small RNA mutants

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of dcl3,dcl4,mDCL,rdr2,rdr6,nrpd1b, and nrpd1c mutations upon small RNAs in Physcomitrella patens , small RNA-seq was performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were obtained from the indicated mutants and subject to small RNA-seq using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA protocol, and analyzed on a HiSeq2500 instrument

PLATFORM
