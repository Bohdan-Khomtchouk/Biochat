TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived  from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and corresponding normal lung tissue (NLT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The stromal microenvironment plays a vital role in cancer initiation and progression. We performed a comparative expression profiling of pulmonary MSC derived from NSCLC and corresponding normal lung tissue of 5 newly diagnosed patients. The analysis indicated variable expression of genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, proliferation or angiogenesis between NSCLC-MSC and NLT-MSC.

DESIGN
MSC were derived from NSCLC and corresponding normal lung tissue of 5 patients. Paired SAM test was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes between NSCLC-MSC and NLT-MSC.
