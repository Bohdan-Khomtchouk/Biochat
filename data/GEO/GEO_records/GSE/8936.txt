TITLE
Overexpression of the HRD gene in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Freshwater is a limited and dwindling global resource; therefore, efficient water use is required for food crops that have high water demands, such as rice, or for the production of sustainable energy biomass. We show here that expression of the Arabidopsis HARDY (HRD) gene in rice improves water use efficiency, the ratio of biomass produced to the water used, by enhancing photosynthetic assimilation and reducing transpiration. These drought tolerant low-water-consuming rice plants exhibit increased shoot biomass under well irrigated conditions and an adaptive increase in root biomass under drought stress. The HRD gene, an AP2/ERF-like transcription factor, identified by a gain-of-function Arabidopsis mutant hrd-D having roots with enhanced strength, branching, and cortical cells, exhibits drought resistance and salt tolerance, accompanied by an enhancement in the expression of abiotic stress associated genes. Although HRD overexpression in Arabidopsis produces thicker leaves with more chloroplast-bearing mesophyll cells, in rice there is an increase in leaf biomass and bundle sheath cells that probably contribute to the enhanced photosynthesis assimilation and efficiency. HRD overexpression was also studied for clues of molecular mechanisms involved using microarrays. The results exemplify application of a gene identified from the model plant Arabidopsis for the improvement of water use efficiency coincident with drought resistance in the crop plant rice. Keywords: Genetic modification transcription factor overexpression mutant

DESIGN
Design includes the use of RNA from the hrd-D mutant overexpressing the HRD gene compared against that from WT Ws (control), both under well watered conditions, in two biological replications.
