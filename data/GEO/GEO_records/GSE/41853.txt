TITLE
Protein interactions within PLEIOHOMEOTIC-repressive complex are critical for its recruitment to Polycomb target genes (Human)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PcG proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of development. Here we have determined genomic distributions of H3K27me3, BMI1, MEL18, EZH2 and YY1 proteins on chromosomes 8, 11,12 of cultured human NTERA-2 cl.D1 cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.
