TITLE
Epigenome study of normal human epithelial tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human epithelial tissues of breast colon lung and endometrial origin, WBC and sperm to identify breast-specific methylated gene promoter loci. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Breast tissues were pre-enriched for organoids and other epithelial tissues were carefully selected by the pathologist.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 23 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2. Two arrays of 12 and samples each were run separately. Each array included a control of human sperm DNA treated with SssI CpG methylase and human sperm DNA not treated (one sample did not pass QC and was dicarded ) .
