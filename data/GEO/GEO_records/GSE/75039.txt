TITLE
LSD1 Corepressor Rcor2 Orchestrates Neurogenesis in the Developing Mouse Brain [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis using Flag M2, LSD1 and H3K4me2 antibodies respectively in Rcor2Flag embryonic brain.

DESIGN
we constructed Rcor2Flag mice by knockin 3X Flag sequences using CRISPR/Cas9 system, and performed ChIP-seq using Flag M2 antibody, LSD1 antibody and H3K4me1 antibody respectively.

PLATFORM
