TITLE
RNA-Seq profiling of brain in Mucopolysaccharidosis type II mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a group of about 50 metabolic disorders, sharing the inability to degrade specific endolysosomal substrates. This results in failure of cellular functions in many organ systems including brain in most patients, which show a progressive neurodegeneration. In this study we performed an RNA-Seq analysis of two brain areas (cerebral cortex and midbrain/diencephalon/hippocampus) of the mouse model for Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, a neurodegenerative LSD.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 9 month old wild type (WT) and Ids-ko (H) mice were generated by RNA-seq using AB SOLiD 3 Plus System
