TITLE
Temporal mapping of C/EBPα and –β binding during liver regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal mapping of C/EBPα and –β binding during liver regeneration reveals dynamic occupancy and specific regulatory codes for homeostatic and cell cycle gene batteries.

DESIGN
Timeseries ChIP-seq of transcription factors C/EBPα and –β, and Pol II in time points 0, 3, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 168 hours after partial hepatectomy. Additionally, an IgG mock to 0h was sequenced, as well as the transcription factor Egr1.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
