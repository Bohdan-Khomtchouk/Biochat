TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of human prostate cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced the small RNA transcriptome of prostate cancer at different stages and generated a quantified catalogue of 3927 small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) detected in normal and malignant prostate tissue. From these sncRNAs less than half are microRNAs. The remaining sncRNAs represent stable sncRNAs species that originate from snoRNA, tRNA and other sncRNAs.

DESIGN
Small RNA seq of different grades (Gleason score) prostate tumors

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
