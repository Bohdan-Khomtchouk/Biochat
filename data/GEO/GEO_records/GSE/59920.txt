TITLE
Macrophages from newly hatched chicks [set2]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To identify markers associated with inherent cellular sex-identity, we analysed macrophages from newly-hatched chicks. We found that male and female macrophages respond differently to stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and that female macrophages constitutively express higher levels of interferon target genes than male macrophages.

DESIGN
Macrophages were collected from leg-bones of chickens between 1 and 3 days after hatch. Three pools of macrophage cells were made for male and female cultures. Cells were cultured in either standard medium or in medium containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate the macrophages. Macrophages were harvested and RNA collected for microarray analysis.
