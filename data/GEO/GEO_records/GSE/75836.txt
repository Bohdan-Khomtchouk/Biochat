TITLE
Identification of endothelial genes co-regulated upon endothelial Evi/Wls and Rspo3 deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inducible endothelial Rspo3 deletion resulted in perturbed developmental and tumor vascular remodeling. Rspo3-iECKO mice strikingly phenocopied the non-canonical WNT signaling-induced vascular defects of mice deleted for the WNT secretion factor Evi/Wls. An endothelial screen for RSPO3 and EVI/WLS co-regulated genes identified novel target genes, which could be linked to WNT/Ca2+/NFAT signaling. In summary, the study identifies endothelial RSPO3-driven non canonical WNT/Ca2+/NFAT signaling as critical maintenance pathway of the remodeling vasculature.
