TITLE
Runx1 (Aml1) knockdown in AMkL Meg-01 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the effect of shRNA silencing of Runx1 in human AMkL Meg-01 cells.  RNA samples obtained from two independent colonies were compared to RNAs from negative control transductions in a two-color design. A total of four microarrays were completed, with a dye-swapped pair performed for each colony.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Runx1 knockdown vs. negative transduction controls. Biological replicates: 2 knockdown replicates, 2 control replicates.
