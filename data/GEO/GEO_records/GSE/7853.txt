TITLE
Effects of hypothermia on gene expression in zebrafish gills

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Ectothermic vertebrates are different from mammals that are sensitive to hypothermia and they have to maintain core temperature for survival. Why and how ectothermic animals can survive, grow and reproduce in low temperature have been for a long time a scientifically challenging and important inquiry to biologists. We used a microarray to profile the gill transcriptome in zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to low temperature. Adult zebrafish were acclimated to a low temperature of 12 Â°C for 1 (1-d) and 30 d (30-d), and the gill transcriptome was compared to wild types by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. Results showed 11 and 22 transcripts were found to be upregulated by low-temperature treatment for 1-d and 30-d respectively, while 56 and 70 transcrips were downregulated. The gill transcriptome profiles revealed that ionoregulation-related gene was highly upregulated in cold-acclimated zebrafish. This observation encouraged us to investigate the role of ionoregulatory genes in zebrafish gills during cold acclimation. Cold acclimation caused upregulation of genes that are essential for ionocyte specification, differentiation, ionoregulation, and acid/base balance, and also increased the numbers of cells expressing these genes. mRNA expression of epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC), one of these genes, was increased in parallel with the level of Ca2+ influx, revealing a functional compensation after long-term acclimation to cold. Phospho-histone H3 and TUNEL staining showed that the cell turnover rate was retarded in cold-acclimated gills. These results suggest that gills may sustain their functions by yielding mature ionocytes from preexisting undifferentiated progenitors in low-temperature environments.
