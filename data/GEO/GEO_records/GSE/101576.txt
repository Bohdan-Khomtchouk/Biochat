TITLE
Identification of quiescence and early activation genes in satellite cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptional changes that occur during the isolation procedure of adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We have developed a protocol that is based on the in situ fixation of MuSCs before isolation. The transcriptome of the in situ fixed cells was compared to that of MuSCs isolated using the standard mechanical/enzymatic isolation protocol. The differentially expressed transcripts represent early-response genes, involved in quiescence and activation of MuSCs, but also isolation-induced artefacts.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of muscle stem cells that were either: fixed in situ (T0), isolated with the traditional protocols (T3) or isolated with the traditional protocols + incubated at 37C for additional 2h (T5).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
