TITLE
Transcriptome comparison between CHOPS syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHOPS syndrome is caused by germline gain-of-function mutations of AFF4.  Cornelia de Lange syndrome is caused by germline mutations of cohesin loading factors or cohesin complex genes such as NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3 and HDAC8.  There are many overlapping clinical features exist between CHOPS syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. To identified commonly dysregulated genes in CHOPS syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, we perfomred side-by-side transcriptome comparison between CHOPS syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome.

DESIGN
In this transcriptome analysis, patient derived skin fibroblasts from two CHOPS syndrome probands, two Cornelia de Lange syndrome probands, and four age-gender-ethnicity matched healthy control subjects were used.The samples used for Human Gene 2.0 arrays are two CHOPs syndrome samples (CDL160 and CDL444), two Cornelia de Lange syndrome samples (CdL006: 7 year-old Caucasian female  NIPBL 742_743delCT ;L248TfsX6 and CdL015: 10 year-old Caucasian male NIPBL 2969delG;G990DfsX2), and four age gender matched control samples (GM01652, GM01864, GM02036 and GM03348).
