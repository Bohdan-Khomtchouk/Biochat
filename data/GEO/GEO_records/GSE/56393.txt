TITLE
Transcriptional landscape of Rag2 -/- thymocytes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-Seq for hallmark TFs (Ets1, Runx1), histone modification marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3), total RNA Pol II, short RNA-Seq as well as nucleosome mapping mainly in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes. We also performed ChIP-Seq for E47 as well as nucleosome mapping, gene expression microarray analysis in CD4+ CD8+ DP thymocytes. Overall, we find a key role for the transcription factor Ets1, contributing towards alpha beta T cell lineage commitment via differential transactivation of stage-specific genes orchestrated by dynamic, co-association -mediated chromatin remodeling, as well as transcription dependent generation of a specialized chromatin structure at the TCR beta locus.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis via ChIP-Seq for Ets1, Runx1, total RNA Pol II binding,  H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, short RNA-Seq, Mnase-Seq in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes, ChIP-Seq for E47, Mnase-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis in DP thymocytes This Series represents ChIP-Seq data.
