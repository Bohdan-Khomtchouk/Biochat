TITLE
Thrombospondin 1 in a model of colorectal carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By using a model of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis the effects of TSP-1 in induced tumors were analyzed. Mice received a single injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and multiple cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for inducing chronic inflammation-related cancers. Proliferation and angiogenesis status were analyzed as well as their transcript profile by using a gene microarray approach. We used Affymetrix GeneChips to determine the changes in the genetic profile between WT and TSP-1 deficient tumors in a model of colorectal carcinogenesis. We identified differentially expressed genes between WT and TSP-1 deficient tumors.

DESIGN
WT and TSP-1 deficient mice were with a single injection of AOM and were drinking 1.5%DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) to induce colitis in four cycles. Wt mice drinking water only was used as reference. Mice were sacrificed and tumors excised for these studies and morphological analyses
