TITLE
Microarray expression profiles of mammary tumors developed in Wap-Cre;Etv6-NTRK3 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a mouse model that recapitulates expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation characteristic of human secretory breast carcinoma. Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency. We provide genetic evidence that committed bipotent or CD61+ luminal alveolar progenitors, are targets of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, EN transforms these otherwise transient progenitors through activation of the AP1 complex. Given increasing relevance of chromosomal translocations in epithelial cancers, such mice serve as a paradigm for the study of their genetic pathogenesis and cellular origins, and generation of novel preclinical models. In this study, we generated microarray expression profiling data from both genetically marked, FACS-sorted tumor epithelial cells and from unfractionated mammary tumors and normal mammary glands. By using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on these data, we have identified the AP1 transcriptional complex as the major downstream effector of the ETV6-NTRK3 signaling. Keywords: genetic modification, cell type comparison
