TITLE
High-resolution genome-wide transcriptomics analysis of O. dioica development

ORGANISM
Oikopleura dioica

SUMMARY
The developmental transcriptomics of every significant developmental stage of O. dioica at ultra-high resolution.

DESIGN
18 samples were included, each in technical triplicate (and one with 4 replicates). These samples included 12 developmental time-point providing high-resolution interrogation of the complete animal life cycle. A further 3 samples specifically interrogated adult ovary, testis and somatic tissues. Finally, 3 samples were included that covered animal transcriptomics response under restrictive conditions that induce developmental growth arrest.
