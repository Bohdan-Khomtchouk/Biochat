TITLE
topA mutant of P. aeruginosa PA14

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

SUMMARY
We have tested the effect of deletion of Topoisomerase I on genes transcription of the bacteria Pseudomonas. aeruginosa. Topoisomerase I is a conserved protein that modulate the topology state of the DNA from super-coiled to relaxed. To this end we have compared the transcription profile of a topA::GentR mutant to that of the wild-type strain. The topA mutant contains in topA gene a Mariner transposon with a gentamicin resistance cassette. It is part of the non-redundant mutant library of P. aeruginosa PA14 strains.

DESIGN
WT and mutant cells were grown to OD 2.0 in LB 200rpm shaking at 37C.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
