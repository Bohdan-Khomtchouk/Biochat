TITLE
Expression data from multiple mouse adipose depots

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing gene expression profiles of murine subcutaneous vs. visceral adipose tissue. Gene expression was analyzed in two subcutaneous depots (inguinal and axillary) and two visceral depots (epididymal and mesenteric) from male C57Bl/6 mice.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed as two groups: inguinal and axillary (subcutaneous) and epididymal and mesenteric (visceral). Each sample was derived by pooling RNA from the relevant fat depot from 3 age-matched, male C57Bl6 mice.
