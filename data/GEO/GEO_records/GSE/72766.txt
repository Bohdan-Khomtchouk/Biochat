TITLE
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol  (Δ9-THC) promotes neuroimmune-modulatory microRNA profile in striatum of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Cannabinoid administration before and after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-inoculation ameliorated disease progression and decreased inflammation in male rhesus macaques. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) did not increase viral load in brain tissue or produce additive neuropsychological impairment in SIV-infected macaques. To determine if the neuroimmunomodulation of Δ9-THC involved differential microRNA (miR) expression, miR expression in the striatum of uninfected macaques receiving vehicle (VEH) or Δ9-THC (THC) and SIV-infected macaques administered either vehicle (VEH/SIV) or Δ9-THC (THC/SIV) was profiled using next generation deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Brains were removed, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Norgen RNA extraction kit. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit was used with 500 ng of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.
