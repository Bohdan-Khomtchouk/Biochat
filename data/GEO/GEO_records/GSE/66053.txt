TITLE
Single mammalian cells compensate for differences in cellular volume and DNA copy number through independent global transcriptional mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed single-cell and bulk transcriptome profiling in two different human cell lines. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in live and fixed cells.

DESIGN
Single cell RNA sequencing of live and fixed cells, bulk RNA sequencing in two cell lines.
