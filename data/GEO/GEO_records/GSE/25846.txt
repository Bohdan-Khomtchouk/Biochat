TITLE
Expression data from IL-10+ and IL-10- CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to be produced by antigen-specific CD8 T cells at the peak of viral encephalitis. We found that IL-10+CD8 T cells are more activated and cytolytic than IL-10-CD8 T cells. We used microarrays to detect gene expression changes in directly ex vivo sorted CNS IL-10+ and IL-10- CD8 T cells from a neurotropic J2.2-V-1-infected mouse.

DESIGN
C57Bl/6 Vert-X (IL-10-eGFP) mice were infected intracranially with 500 PFU J2.2-V-1 virus and seven days later their brain lymphocytes from three mice were pooled and then isolated and negatively selected for CD8 T cells. The CD8 pooled brain lymphocytes were then sorted for IL-10+ and IL-10- CD8 T lymphocytes using GFP as a marker from the same samples. This was performed three times to obtain six samples total. RNA was extracted and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse GENE 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix).
