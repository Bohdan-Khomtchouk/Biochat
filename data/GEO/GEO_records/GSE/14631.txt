TITLE
Paramecium tetraurelia reciliation (stationary phase)

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
Paramecium cells in stationary phase were treated for deciliation and total mRNA extracted at two time points (45 and 130 minutes) after deciliation. Keywords: Time course analysis of expression during reciliation

DESIGN
Experimental design has two biological replications for the 45 and 130 minutes time points and only one sample for the reference (T0) time point.
