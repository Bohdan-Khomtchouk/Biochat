TITLE
Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a sporadic Alzheimer disease donor as a model for investigating disease mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of control fibroblasts (NFH2), one AD-derived fibroblasts (NFH-46), NFH2-derived control-iPS cells (OiPS3, OiPS6), NFH46-derived AD-iPS cells (iPS5 and iPS 26B),  hESCs (H1 and H9).

DESIGN
Total mRNA obtained from AD fibroblasts (NFH-46) and control fibroblasts (NFH-2), from pluripotent stem cells AD-iPS cells (iPS5 and iPS 26B), control-iPS cells (OiPS3, OiPS6), and hESCs (H1 and H9).
