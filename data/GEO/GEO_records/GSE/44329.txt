TITLE
Gene expression analysis in Drosophila introgression hybrids

ORGANISM
Drosophila mauritiana ; Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
RNA was extracted from adult male and adult female Drosophila simulans carrying small genomic segments introgressed from Drosophila mauritiana

DESIGN
Seven introgression genotypes were profiled, as well as the parental D. simulans and D. mauritiana strains.  Each sex-by-genotype was assayed on four replicate arrays incorporating a dye swap
