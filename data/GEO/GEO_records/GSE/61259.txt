TITLE
Human muscle Illumina Inf 450 DNA methylation data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of human muscle tissue. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Dataset includes 26 samples from Germany. The goal of the study was to evalute the relationship between body mass index and DNA methylation levels.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 26 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
