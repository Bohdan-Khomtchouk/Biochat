TITLE
Gene expression profiling of liver metastases from colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
At present, medical treatments of synchronous and metachronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer are not differentiated. The aim of the study was to analyze the gene expression profiling of synchronous and metachronous lesions in order to identify molecular signatures as possible basis for choice of systemic therapies. Fresh tissues specimens from metastases of 18 patients undergone liver surgery were collected (10 synchronous and 8 metachronous lesions). Gene expression profiling was studied using Affymetrix platform. Two different profiles were identified. Pathway related to the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFr) was upregulated in metachronous lesions whereas pathways mainly related to inflammation in synchronous lesions. Real Time-PCR, Western Blotting and ELISA confirmed that the metachronous lesions had the overexpression of EGFr, but the synchronous ones had the overexpression of Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2). These results suggest that synchronous or metachronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer could be differently treated on the basis of  different molecular pathways. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
