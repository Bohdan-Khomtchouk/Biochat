TITLE
Leukemia associated mutant Wilms' tumour gene 1 protein promotes expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels in hematopoietic progenitor cells retrovirally transduced with full-length WT1(+/-) or a WT1-mutant lacking zinc-finger, WT1(delZ) cultured in vitro for 14 days. The hypothesis tested in this study was that the WT1-mutant confers an increased proliferation rate after 14 days in culture and an erythroid phenotype. Results provide information of upregulation of some genes associated with cellcycle progression, upregulated genes connected with erythropoiesis and downmodulation of some genes associated with myeloid differentiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CD34+ progenitor cells in suspension cultures for 14 days.
