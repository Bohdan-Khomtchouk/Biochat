TITLE
Translation Profiling +/- miR-124

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribosome Occupancy Experiments: for these experiments Channel 1 is amplified RNA (aRNA) from mRNA unbound to any ribosomes. Channel 2 is aRNA from mRNA associated with ribosomes. Ribosome Density Experiments: for these experiments Channel 1 is amplified RNA (aRNA) from mRNA present in the light fractions of the polysome. Channel 2 is aRNA from mRNA associated with ribosomes deep in  the polysome.

DESIGN
Experiments are biological replicates of ribosome occupancy and density 12 hours post mock transfection or miR-124 transfection.
