TITLE
E. faecalis transcriptional responses to zinc stress

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Enterococcus faecalis V583 comparing the transcriptome of cells grown in M17 + glucose 0.5% (GM17) with the transcriptome of cells grown in M17 + glucose 0.5% + 4 mM ZnSO4

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: V583 grown in GM17 vs. V583 grown in GM17 + 4mM ZnSO4. Two biological replicates and a dye-swap. Three replicates per array.

PLATFORM
