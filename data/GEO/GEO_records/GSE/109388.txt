TITLE
Genome-wide identification of starvation responsive genes controlled by SnRK1s and group S1 bZIPs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
3 weeks old aseptically grown WT and loss-of-function lines of SnRK1s (transgenic SnRK1α1 T-DNA insertion mutant line crossed with an estradiol inducible amiRNA construct targeting SnRK1α2) and group S1 bZIPs (bZIP1/bZIP53 T-DNA insertion mutant line crossed with an estradiol inducible amiRNA construct simultaneously targeting bZIP2, bZIP11 and bZIP44) were cultivated for 6h under extended night. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for RNAseq library preparation.

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional changes in WT as well as SnRK1 and S1-bZIP knockdown lines in response to short-term dark cultivation.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
