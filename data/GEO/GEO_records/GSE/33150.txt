TITLE
Substrate selectivity for semisynthetic CK2 proteins with Pin1

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Protein Ser/Thr kinase CK2 is involved in a myriad of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating hundreds of substrates, yet the regulation process of CK2 function is poorly understood.  The CK2 catalytic subunit, CK2α, is phosphorylated at Thr344 and phosphorylation on the C-terminal tail of CK2α is required for interaction with Pin1 protein.  The substrate selectivity for protein kinase CK2α was examined by performing kinase assays on protein microarrays spotted with 17,000 human proteins.  Semisynthetic CK2α proteins were prepared to contain an unmodified C-terminal tail or phospho-Thr (pThr) at T344.  These semisynthetic proteins were used to determine if the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of CK2α with Pin1 can modulate the substrate selectivity for CK2. The different semisynthetic CK2α proteins (unmodified and pThr344) were tested alone and in the presence of the recombinant Pin1 protein.  Pin1 has been shown to interaction with CK2α only when CK2α is phoshorylated on its C-terminal site (including Thr344).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, kinase assays were performed using two different semisynthetic CK2α proteins: unmodified C-terminal tail and phospho-Thr (pThr) at 344.     The semisynthetic proteins were each tested alone and in the presence of the recombinant Pin1 protein.  There were four different kinase conditions and each condition was performed in duplicate.
