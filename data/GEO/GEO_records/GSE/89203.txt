TITLE
ZEB1 binding sites in TGF-beta-stimulated MDA-231-D and Hs578T basal type breast cancer cell lines [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We searched for roles of ZEB1 during EMT through genome-wide analysis of its binding sites in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
ZEB1 binding sites in TGF-beta-stimulated MDA-231-D and Hs578T cells were determined by ChIP-seq.
