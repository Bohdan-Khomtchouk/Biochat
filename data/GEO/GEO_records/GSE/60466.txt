TITLE
RIP-Chip of BRAT and PUM from 0-3 hour Drosophila melanogaster embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
BRAT-associated mRNAs and PUM-associated mRNAs were identified in early Drosophila embryos by RNA co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins using synthetic antibodies, followed by microarray analysis (RIP-Chip).

DESIGN
Nine RNA co-immunoprecipitations were performed. This includes 3 biological replicates each of 1) anti-BRAT RNA co-immunoprecipitations from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos, 2) anti-PUM RNA co-immunoprecipitations from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos, and 3) control antibody RNA co-immunoprecipitations from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos. BRAT samples and PUM samples were each normalized separately with the control samples, for a total of 12 processed samples (3 BRAT with 3 control normalized together, and 3 PUM with 3 control normalized together) from the 9 RNA co-immunoprecipitations.
