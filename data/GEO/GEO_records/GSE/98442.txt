TITLE
The soluble guanylate cyclase CYG12 is required for the acclimation to hypoxia and trophic regimes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
We studied the role of the soluble guanylate cyclase CYG12 in the response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to anoxia and darkness. To gain insights into potentially disturbed signaling pathways resulting in different responses of the transcriptome, we performed an RNA-sequencing study to obtain transcriptome profiles of the C. reinhardtii wild-type and a CYG12 knockdown strain in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis in darkness compared to normoxia in the light

DESIGN
The C. reinhardtii wild-type (strain CC-124) as well as a transformant in which the CYG12 gene was post-transcriptionally down-regulated by an artificial microRNA were grown under standard growth conditions (in TAP medium in the light, aerated = 0h RNA-samples) and then incubated for 6h in darkness either in sealed flasks, where the cell suspensions become anoxic (RNA-samples 6h-O2), or in open beakers (aerated; RNA-samples 6h+O2). Each strain was analyzed in biological duplicate, i.e., the project generated 12 RNA-samples that were sequenced.
