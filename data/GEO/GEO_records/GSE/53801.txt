TITLE
Genome-wide promoter methylation analysis of human melanocytes and melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of human melanocytes and melanoma cell lines. Goal was to identify hypermethylated gene promoters in melanoma

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 4 human melanoma cell lines and normal human epidermal melanocytes was subjected to methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and hybridized to Agilent's G4489A Human Promoter ChIP-on-Chip Set 244K
