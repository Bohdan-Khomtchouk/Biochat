TITLE
Functional genome analysis of Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 reveals a major conserved host-colonization factor

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

SUMMARY
Development of the human gut microbiota commences at birth with bifidobacteria being among the first colonizers of the sterile newborn gastrointestinal tract. To date the genetic basis of bifidobacterial colonization and persistence remains poorly understood. Transcriptomic analysis of the 2,422,684 bp genome of Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003, a strain isolated from a nursling stool, during colonization of a mouse model revealed the differential expression of a type IVb or so-called Tad pilus-encoding cluster. Mutational analysis coupled with colonization experiments demonstrated that the UCC2003 tad gene cluster is essential for colonization. Immunogold transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of the Tad pili at the cell poles of B. breve UCC2003. Conservation of the Tad pilus-encoding locus among sequenced bifidobacterial genomes supports the notion of a ubiquitous and novel host colonization and persistence mechanism for bifidobacteria.
