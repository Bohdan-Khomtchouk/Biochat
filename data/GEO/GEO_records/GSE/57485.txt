TITLE
Comparing Reference-Based RNA-Seq Mapping Methods for Non-Human Primate Data

ORGANISM
Papio cynocephalus

SUMMARY
We present a comparison of four reference-based mapping methods for mapping non-human primate data to a human reference sequence. We utilize TopHat2 and GSNAP for mapping to the human genome, and Bowtie2 and Stampy for mapping to the human genome and transcriptome for a total of six mapping approaches

DESIGN
Comparison of reference-based mapping methods for 12 yellow baboons

PLATFORM
GPL18669 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Papio cynocephalus)
