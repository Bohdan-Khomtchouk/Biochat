TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of LPS induced RIPK1 kinase dependent gene expression changes in  CD11b+ myeloid bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq as a method of next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify RIPK1 dependent inflammatory mediators and pathways in LPS injected mice.

DESIGN
Mice were divided intro 3 groups - control (n=2), LPS (n=2) and LPS/Nec-1 (n=2). BM cells were isolated by FACS as described for qPCR analysis. Total RNAs were isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
