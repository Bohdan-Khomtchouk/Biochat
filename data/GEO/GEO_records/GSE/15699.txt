TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis ago1-25 and hyl1-2 mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis ago1-25 and hyl1-2 mutants.

DESIGN
Fifteen-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown on the agar plates were . The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants (wild type (WT), ago1-25 and hyl1-2) and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
