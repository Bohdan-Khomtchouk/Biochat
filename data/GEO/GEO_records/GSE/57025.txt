TITLE
Systems Biology Analysis of Tenofovir 1% Gel in a Phase I Rectal Microbicide Trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In MTN-007, a phase 1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies taken at baseline, after one application or after seven daily applications (15 subjects/arm).  Experiments were repeated using primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women.

DESIGN
192 Arrays (8 donors per treatment group, 2 biopsy sites per donor (9cm and 15 cm), biopsies taken at baseline, after a single application, and after 7 daily applications)

PLATFORM
