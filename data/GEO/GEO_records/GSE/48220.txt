TITLE
Differential expression of genes in adipose derived stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) are an attractive multipotent stem cell source with therapeutic applicability in diverse fields for the repair and regeneration of acute and chronically damaged tissues. In the last few years there has been increased interest in hADSCs for tissue engineering applications; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hADSCs proliferation and differentiation are not fully understood. In an effort to reveal the functions essential for this process, we performed microarray (Agilent 4x44K Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit) to profile the global gene expression in the hADSCs by including human endothelial and fibroblast cells as controls.

DESIGN
To identify the genes significantly expressed in human adipose derived stem cells, eight samples were analyzed using Agilent whole human genome microarray including six hADSCs samples and human endothelial and fibroblast cells as controls.
