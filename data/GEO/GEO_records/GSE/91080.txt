TITLE
Analysis of gene expression along the Hoxa cluster at five time-points during motor neuron differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To dissect the significance underlying the delay between Hox transcription and translation, we  profiled global Hox gene expression using an in vitro ESC-derived motor neuron differentiation system

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from WT ES derived motor neurons. Subsequently, ES cell derived motor neuron transcriptome was analyzed by Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Agilent-G4858A-028005).
