TITLE
RNASeq identified human transcriptome alterations in Chinese Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study is the first transcriptome profiling of Chinese NPC patients. These results provide both molecular basis and therapeutic opportunities for Chinese NPC patients.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 42 Chinese Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma patients and 4 non-NPC tissues by Illumina Hiseq 2000.
