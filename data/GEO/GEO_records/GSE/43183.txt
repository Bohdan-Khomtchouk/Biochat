TITLE
Rapid and efficient transdifferentiation into functional myocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HiPSCs and human myoblast cells were differentiated into myocytes, and the global gene expression profile were analyzed.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expressions among 8 experiments, 3 were derived from hiPSCs(cell line; 253G1), 1 was derived from hiPSCs(cell line; 253G4), 1 was derived from hiPSCs(cell line; 201B7), 2 were from human myoblast cell line (Hu5/E18) and 1 was undifferentiated hiPSCs.
