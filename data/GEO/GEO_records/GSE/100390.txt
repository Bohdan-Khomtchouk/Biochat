TITLE
Esophageal tissue and serum microRNAs changed in the progression of Barrett’s esophagus in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for the early detection of cancers. This assay aimed to address potential circulating miRNAs to monitor the progression from Barrett’s esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

DESIGN
We comprehensively analyzed tissue and serum miRNA expression profiles of BE mice model (L2-IL-1β mice) using microarray analysis. We identified 20 upregulated miRNAs and 44 downregulated miRNAs both in tissues and in sera of 46-week-old mice compared to in 28-week-old mice.
