TITLE
Lamin A/C is required for SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell differentiation and its expression is linked to a less malignant phenotype.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main scientific objective of the project was to investigate whether Lamin A/C could be involved in neuroblastoma differentiation. Moreover, taking into account the significance of differentiation stage in the neuroblastoma tumor progression we have also studied a possible role of Lamin A/C in the tumorigenesis of this neuronal cancer. As differentiating stimulus we used the all-trans retinoic acid (RA), the most effective compound which has been shown to induce differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. To get insight into the impairment of cell differentiation produced by the LMNA  (Lamin A/C) silencing in SHSY5Y cells, we compared the gene expression profile of control and silenced cells both in Retinoic Acid treated and untreated samples, using the one-color Agilent microarray platform.

DESIGN
Four condition experiment: cells infected with a mock vector (Mock cells), treated and untreated with retinoic acid (RA); cells infected with a silencing vector for LMNA (LMNA-KD cells), treated and untreated with retinoic acid.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
