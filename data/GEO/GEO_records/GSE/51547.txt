TITLE
DNA methylation in melanoma is connected to gene expression phenotypes and MITF pathway expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We subjected 50 stage III/IV tumors and 9 melanoma cell lines to genome-wide methylation analysis using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip. Furthermore, we used two technical replicates of light, medium, dark melanocyte, dermal epidermis and fibroblasts (Science Cell Research, USA), and one sample of peripheral blood leukocytes (Promega).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 50 stage III/IV tumors, 9 melanoma cell lines as well as normal cells were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
