TITLE
Gene expression profile of Foxp3 expressing naturally ocurring regulatory macrophages from mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Define the genetic profile of naturally occurring regulatory macrophages that express Foxp3 (MacRegs) compared to Foxp3 neg macrophages, to determine candidate genes responsible for their regulatory function. Compare this new cellular population with T regulatory cells.

DESIGN
Two conditions were compared: Fresh CD11b+ F4/80+ FOXP3+ cells (3 independent isolates) and CD11b+ F4/80+ FOXP3- cells (3 independent isolates). MacRegs were also compared to CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs .
