TITLE
Comparison of WAT CD34+ vs LAF CD34+

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A catalytic role has been proposed in neoplastic angiogenesis and cancer progression for bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, in preclinical and clinical studies the quantitative role of marrow-derived EPCs in cancer vascularization was found to be extremely variable. Adipose tissue represents an attractive source of autologous adult stem cells due to its abundance and surgical accessibility. CD34+cells from Lipotransfer aspirates (LAs) of patients undergoing breast reconstruction after breast cancer surgery were compared with CD34+ cells from Leucapheresis of normal subjects.
