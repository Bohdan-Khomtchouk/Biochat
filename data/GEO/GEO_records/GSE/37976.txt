TITLE
Transcriptomics of coping strategies in free-swimming Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Copepoda)

ORGANISM
Lepeophtheirus salmonis

SUMMARY
To understand the sensitivity of larval lice to changing environmental parameters we applied a 38K oligo microarray and characterized transcriptome responses after 24 hour exposures to reduced salinity (30-10 parts per thousand (ppt)) or varied temperature (16-4ºC). To further characterize the effects of salinity, we profiled expression changes over a range of seawater with single increment differences (30-25 ppt).

DESIGN
Three separate projects. Low resolution salinity (aka wide range or LR_SAL) contains 2 duplicate experiments, each with pools of lice (~500 copepodid lice per beaker; n=3 beakers per condition), incubated for 24 hr at 10ºC diluted to 30, 25, 20, or 10 parts per thousand (ppt). Temperature study conducted as above, but with a constant salinity of 30 ppt and changed temperature of 4, 10, or 16ºC. High resolution salinity conducted as above, but with no experiment replication, but with biological repication of n=6 beakers per condition, and with a range of 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 ppt salinity. Please note that each experiment was normalized separately.
