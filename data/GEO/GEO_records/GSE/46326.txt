TITLE
Preimplantation Factor Effect on Endometrial and Decidual Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embryos secrete preimplantation factor (PIF), a peptide present in maternal circulation during viable pregnancy.  We compared downstream synthetic PIF effect on gene expression in non-pregnant Human Endometrial Stromal Cell (HESC) and First Trimester Decidual cell (FTDC) culture to mimic the maternal intrauterine environment during embryo implantation and trophoblast invasion.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in triplicate with and without synthetic PIF for 24 hours. Cultured cells were then pooled for chip analysis. Altered gene expression relative to controls was assessed by Affymetrix microarray
