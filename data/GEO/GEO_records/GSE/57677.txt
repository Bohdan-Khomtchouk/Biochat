TITLE
Targeting IL13Ralpha2 activates STAT6-TP63 pathway to suppress breast cancer lung metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL13Rα2 overexpression promotes metastasis of basal-like breast cancers IL13Rα2 depletion in highly metastatic breast cancer cells suppresses lung metastases formation by upregulating TP63 and decreasing their migratory potential

DESIGN
MCF10CA1a (MIV) cells expressing the luciferase gene (MIV-Luc), were stably transduced with lentiviral constructs expressing either scrambled shRNA or shRNA against IL13Rα2. The two cell lines were then either mock treated  or treated with 20ng/ml IL13 for 16h followed by RNA isolation. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool.
