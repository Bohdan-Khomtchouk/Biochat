TITLE
Gene expression in the different stages of endometrial cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the dysregulated genes involved in tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC). Materials and methods: Surgical specimens of endometrial tissues were obtained from 20 patients with normal endometrium (NEM), 20 patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and 169 patients with EEC. The expression profiles of NEM, AEH, and EEC were compared by using GeneChip Array. The expression of dysregulated genes was first validated by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (SQ RT-PCR). The gene expression levels were determined by real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RTQ RT-PCR) in 85 EEC patients as the training test and 84 EEC patients as the testing test. The protein expressions were then examined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlations between the expression of dysregualted genes and clinico-pathologic parameters such as tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis of EEC were finally evaluated. Results: Seven dysregulated genes were identified by SQ RT-PCR after microarray analysis. Conclusions: uPA is a dysregulated gene in the tumorigenesis of endometrial carcinomas.

DESIGN
The gene expression between tissues from NEM, AEH, and EEC were analyzed by microarray. The samples were grouped according to clinical stages but selected at random from our list of banked, frozen tissues. Ten NEM, 10 AEH, and 20 EEC of early and advanced stages were used for microarray experiments (Group 1: early-staged (stages I and II) EEC (n=10), Group 2: advanced-staged EEC (stages III and IV) (n=10)). Samples were pooled in equimolar amounts (10 samples / pool) for microarray analysis.
