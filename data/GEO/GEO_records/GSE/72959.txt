TITLE
To identify genes responsive to treatment with the HIF2a inhibitor PT2399

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIF2a function is both necessary and sufficient for the growth of VHL-null clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). Targeting HIF2a function can therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy. We used microarray analysis to characterize a novel pharmacological inhibitor of HIF2a named PT2399. By comparing genes that are responsive to PT2399 in parental cells vs cells lacking HIF2a, by virtue of CRISPR-mediated genetic editing, we characterized gene signatures that are regulated by PT2399 in a HIF2a dependent manner.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with either DMSO (control) or 2uM PT2399 for indicated time periods, total RNA was extracted and analyzed. Please note that the experiments with 786O Parental and HIF2a null cells were conducted independently.
