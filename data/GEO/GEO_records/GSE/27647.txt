TITLE
Transcriptome of short RNA fraction in Rickettsia conorii

ORGANISM
Rickettsia conorii str. Malish 7

SUMMARY
We constructed a small RNA cDNA library, using small RNA fraction with a length of 19-29 bases, and we performed deep sequencing of the cDNA library.

DESIGN
R. conorii subsp. conorii strain Malish 7 was cultivated on XTC cells for 3 days at 28Â°C. RNA enriched with small RNA fractions was further extracted and cDNA was synthesized.

PLATFORM
