TITLE
Expression data from Glioma-Initiating Cells (GICs) cultured under hypoxia and normoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma initiating cells (GICs) implicated to be critical for tumor progression and resistance to therapy. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been shown to play an important role to maintain the GICs; however, the mechanisms regulating responses of GICs to hypoxia remain poorly understood. We used microarray to  to detail the global change of gene expression in GICs cultured under hypoxia compared to normoxia and identified de-regulated genes during hypoxia.

DESIGN
CD133+ D456MG GICs were cultured under 1% O2 or 20% O2 for 12 hours. Then RNA was extracted and gene expression was profiled by microarray.
