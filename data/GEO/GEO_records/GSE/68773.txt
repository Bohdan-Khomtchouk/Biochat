TITLE
Global gene expression comparation among testes, ovaries, Smad4flox/floxMerCreMer Stra8+/− ovaries and Smad4flox/floxMerCreMer Stra8−/− ovaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To confirm that female-to-male sexual fate reversal in Smad4flox/floxMerCreMer Stra8−/− ovaries occurs independently of somatic environment. We analyzed transcriptome of samples using RNA from control testes, ovaries, Smad4flox/floxMerCreMer Stra8+/− and Smad4flox/floxMerCreMer Stra8−/− ovaries.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates were examined at each situation. For each situation, RNA was extracted from one pair of gonads.
