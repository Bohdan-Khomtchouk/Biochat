TITLE
Pax6 links H3K4 methylase activity to transcriptional regulation of Plekha1 through its distal enhancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq on mouse lens epithelial cells (αTN4) and mouse newborn lens. Genome-wide binding sites of Pax6, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and RNA polymerase II were generated. We also performed RNA-seq on αTN4 cells treated with Pax6 and control shRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of correlation between Pax6 binding and histone H3K4 methylation distribution.
