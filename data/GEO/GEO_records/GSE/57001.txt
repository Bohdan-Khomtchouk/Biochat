TITLE
Generation of CNS neural stem cells and PNS derivatives from neural crest derived peripheral stem cells [Dataset 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural crest-derived neural stem cells (NCSCs) from the embryonic PNS can be reprogrammed in neurosphere culture (NS) to rNCSCs that produce CNS progeny, including myelinating oligodendrocytes. Using global gene expression analysis we now demonstrate that rNCSCs completely lose their previous PNS characteristics and acquire the identity of neural stem cells derived from embryonic spinal cord (SCSCs). Reprogramming proceeds rapidly and results in a homogenous population of Olig2-, Sox3- and Lex-positive CNS stem cells. Low-level expression of pluripotency inducing genes Oct4, Nanog and Klf4 argues against a transient pluripotent state during reprogramming. The acquisition of CNS properties is prevented in the presence of BMP4 (BMP NCSCs) as shown by marker gene expression and the potential to produce PNS neurons and glia. In addition, genes characteristic for mesenchymal and perivascular progenitors are expressed, which suggests that BMP NCSCs are directed towards a pericyte progenitor/mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate. Adult NCSCs from mouse palate, an easily accessible source of adult NCSCs, display strikingly similar properties. They do not generate cells with CNS characteristics but lose the neural crest markers Sox10 and p75 and produce MSCs. These findings show that embryonic NCSCs acquire a full CNS identity in neurosphere culture. In contrast, MSCs are generated from adult pNCSCs and BMP NCSCs, which reveals that postmigratory NCSCs are a source for MSCs up to the adult stage.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Mouse 430_2 arrays were used to compare the gene expression profiles of embryonic DRG-derived reprogrammed NCSCs and adult NCSCs from mouse palate.
