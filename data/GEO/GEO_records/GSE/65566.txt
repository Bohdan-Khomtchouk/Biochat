TITLE
Multiple hierarchies of Polycomb targeting to Drosophila genome (Part 1)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of development. Here we compared genomic distribution of E(z) protein in cultured Drosophila cells lacking Psc/Su(z)2 proteins to that of the wild type.

DESIGN
ChIP of E(z) protein coupled to next-generation sequencing from wild-type and Psc/Su(z)2 - null cultured cells. Done in two replicates, with DNA from corresponding chromatin inputs sequenced as a control.

PLATFORM
GPL16479 Illumina MiSeq (Drosophila melanogaster)
