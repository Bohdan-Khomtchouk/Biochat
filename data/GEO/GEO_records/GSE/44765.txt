TITLE
Global profiling of human hair follicle scalp dermal papilla cells using Affymetrix microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dermal papilla cells isolated from the human hair follicle are capable of inducing hair growth in recipient epithelia.  However, demonstrating disparity from rodent dermal papilla, human cells lose this inductive competance immediately upon growth in culture under normal growth conditions.  We grew dermal papilla cells in hanging drop cultures that are morphologically akin to intact dermal papilla, and found that by enhancing the environment for aggregation, we could restore the inductive capacity of human dermal papilla cells in culture.  The underlying genes that regulate the inductive potential of dermal papilla cells is not well understood, and we sought to use global profiling to identify key genes and pathways related to inductive competance within dermal papilla cells. We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile human dermal papilla cells in both hair inducing, and non-hair inducing states.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarrays were used to to perform profiling of human dermal papilla cells, both as intact tissues (freshly isolated from scalp), and at several stages in subsequent two dimensional culture; cell explant outgrowths (p0), cells at passage 1 (p1), passage 3 (p3) and passage 5 (p5).  RNA was isolated from cultured cells 72 hours after feeding.  Cells at passage 3 were also grown in hanging drops to form dermal spheroids, that were used for RNA collection 48 hours after establishment.  All experiments were performed using tissue from three biological replicates (#D5, D6, D7),
