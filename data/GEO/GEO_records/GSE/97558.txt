TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the toxic effect of Bortezomib on human esophageal carcinoma epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective was to investigate the toxic effect of Bortezomib on human esophageal carcinoma epithelial cells at gene expression level. Gene expression profilings between Bortezomib and vehicle treated cells were compared.

DESIGN
TE-1 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and treated with 150 nM Bortezomib and equivalent volume of vehicle in triplicate. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were harvested. Total RNA were extracted and subjected to gene expression profiling assays.
