TITLE
Expression data from hsa-mir-125 transfected MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation has long been associated with various cancers. Among an expanding list of cancer related miRNAs, deregulation of miR-125b has been well documented in various cancers including breast. Based on current knowledge, miR-125b is considered to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancers.  While important mRNA targets have been defined for miR-125b, here, we aimed to further investigate direct/indirect consequences of miR-125b expression in breast cancer cells by using a transcriptome approach. Upon miR-125b expression, a total of 140 cancer related genes were found to be differentially expressed in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were stably transfected with pSUPER-mir-125b and pSUPER empty vector controls. Polyclones were selected by G418, molecular confirmation of mir-125b expression was completed by TaqMan RT-qPCR assays.
