TITLE
Maize gene expression during infection with Ustilago maydis

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host plant maize. Hallmarks of the disease are large plant tumors in which fungal proliferation occurs. Plants have developed various defense pathways to cope with pathogens. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during the infection process of Ustilago maydis in its host plant to get insights into the defense programs and the metabolic reprogramming needed to supply the fungus with nutrients. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
In three independent experiments plants were infected with the solopathogenic U. maydis  strain SG200. Samples from infected leaves were taken at 12 and 24 hours post infection, as well as 2, 4 and 8 days post infection. Samples from uninfected control plants were taken at the same time points.
