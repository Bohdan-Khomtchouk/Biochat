TITLE
Study of poplar shoot apex transcriptomic response to variations in soil water avaialbility

ORGANISM
Populus x canadensis

SUMMARY
In a context of climate changes, water availability is expected to become a limiting factor for plant growth and to have an impact on forest health. In order to identify genes involved in shoot phenotypic plasticity in response to variations in water availability in trees, gene expression patterns were investigated in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Populus deltoides × P. nigra hybrid cuttings submitted to a moderate water deficit followed by a rewatering step. Methylome response was also studied and is another GEO submission. Several gene clusters with expression patterns specific to SAM drought response as well as specific to the rewatering condition could be identified. Among them, genes involved in phytohormone pathways like brassinosteroids were found.

DESIGN
Populus deltoides × P. nigra 'Carpaccio' hybrid cuttings were submitted to 3 water conditions: non-limiting, water deficit and water deficit/rewatering cycle (14 days treatment). At the end of the experiment, buds were collected and SAM maually isolated for 6 individuals per condition. Total RNA were independently extracted from 3 individuals per condition and used for microarray analyses.
