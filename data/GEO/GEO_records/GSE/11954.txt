TITLE
Expression analysis of growing and senescent activated hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferative arrest and can be triggered in many cell types in response to diverse forms of cellular damage or stress. We used microarrays to compare gene expression profile between growing and senescent human activated hepatic stellate cells. Keywords: cell type comparison
