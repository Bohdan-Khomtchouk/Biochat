TITLE
Expression analysis of growing and senescent activated hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferative arrest and can be triggered in many cell types in response to diverse forms of cellular damage or stress. We used microarrays to compare gene expression profile between growing and senescent human activated hepatic stellate cells. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Two separate preparation of activated hepatic stellate cells were treated with DNA damaging agent to induce senescence or vechicle to remain growing. RNA was extracted from both replications and used for hybridization on Affymetrix arrays to determine expression differences.
