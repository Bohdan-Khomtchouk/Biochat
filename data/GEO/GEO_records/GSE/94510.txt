TITLE
CD4 T-cells from pSS patients and human healthy volunteers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands, and it is often accompanied by systemic manifestations. The transcriptome alterations in CD4 T-cells remain largely unknown. We used microarrays to elucidate the transcriptional profiles of CD4 T-cells in pSS patients and healthy controls.

DESIGN
The peripheral CD4 T-cell subsets in four major differentiation stages, naive CD4 T-cells (TN), central memory CD4 T-cells (TCM), effector memory CD4 T-cells (TEM), from six pSS patients and six healthy controls were subjected to genome-wide transcriptome arrays.
