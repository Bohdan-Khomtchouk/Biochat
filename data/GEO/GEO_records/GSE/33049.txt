TITLE
GlcNAcylation of histone H2B facilitates its monoubiquitination [Illumina Genome Analyzer data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that histone GlcNAcylation of H2B S112 is a vital histone modification which facilitates histone monoubiquitination (ub). In a genome-wide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were observed widely distributed over entire chromosomes including transcribed gene loci, together with co-localization of H2B S112 GlcNAcylation and K120 ub.

DESIGN
Examination of H2B S112 GlcNAc and H2B K120 ub in HeLa S3 cells
