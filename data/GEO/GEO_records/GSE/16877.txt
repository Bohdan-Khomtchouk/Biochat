TITLE
HEK293 stably expressing Autoimmune regulator protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Auto Immune REgulator (AIRE) protein expression in HEK293 cells

DESIGN
Three cell-lines where used in the study: HEK293-NC; control cell-line expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) HEK-AIRE1, HEK-AIRE2; two different clone-derived Autoimmune regulator protein expressing cell-lines HEK-AIRE-D312A; cell line expressing Autoimmune regulator protein with D312A mutation in the first PHD finger With all cell-lines three independent experiments were performed.
