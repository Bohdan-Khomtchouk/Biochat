TITLE
Topoisomerase I cleavage complexes preferentially down-regulate ubiquitin- and RNA degradation-related transcripts in relationship to gene length, exon-intron junctions and p53-dependent up-regulation of miR-142-3p [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is required for transcription as it relaxes positive and negative supercoils by forming transient Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc) up- and down-stream of transcription complexes. However, Top1cc can also be trapped by endogenous DNA lesions and by camptothecin (CPT) and its anticancer derivatives, which results in transcription blocks. Here, we undertook a genome-wide analysis of the effects of CPT on gene expression at exon resolution.

DESIGN
We tested the impact of Top1 inhibition on miRNA expression at the genome-wide level in human colon carcinoma HCT116. The miRNA of cells treated with camptothecin (CPT) for were measured at several timepoints with Agilent Human miRNA Microarray  V3 (8x15K).
