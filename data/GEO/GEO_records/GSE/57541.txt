TITLE
Expression data from roots and first two leaves of tomato seedlings growing on regular MS medium or MS medium supplemented with multi-wall carbon nanohorns (25 ug/ml)

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) om total expression profile of tomato seeds and plants we introduced SWCNHs in MS agar medium in concentration of 25 ug/ml Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in tomato seeds and seedlings in response to SWCNHs

DESIGN
Seeds (1 day on medium) and 11-days old seedlings of  wild type tomato seedlings (cv. Micro-Tom) growing on regular MS agar medium or MS medium supplemented with carbon nanohorns (25 ug/ml) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Keywords: stress responses

PLATFORM
GPL4741 [Tomato] Affymetrix Tomato Genome Array
