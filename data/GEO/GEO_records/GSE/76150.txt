TITLE
Genome-wide responses to extracellular actin in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptional changes in Drosophila after administration of Actin or buffer control

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptional responses to actin versus buffer injected flies at 3,6 and 24 hours post injection (each time point includes triplicate samples)
