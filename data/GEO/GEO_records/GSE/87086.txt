TITLE
Genes under positive selection and their recruitment order during C4 emergence in Grass

ORGANISM
Bothriochloa ischaemum ; Arundinella nepalensis ; Arundinella hirta ; Capillipedium parviflorum ; Imperata cylindrica ; Arundinella anomala ; Arundinella fluviatilis ; Arundinella pubescens

SUMMARY
The C4 CO2 concentrating mechanism (C4-CCM) requires the coordinated function of multiple enzymes and transporters, which were gradually recruited during evolution. However, critical genes involved and their recruitment order remains elusive. Here we address this question with molecular evolution approaches, we identified all the positive selected genes in C4 species from grass.

DESIGN
eight C4 species, RNA-seq from leaves
