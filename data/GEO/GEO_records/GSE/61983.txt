TITLE
A combined omics approach to generate the surface protein atlas of human naive CD4+ T cells during early TCR activaion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To increase the dataset of our proteomic naive CD4+ T cell surface atlas, we applied whole genome microarray expression analysis. The NCBI RefSeq accession number of all transcripts which were detected in naive and stimulated CD4+ T cells (aCD3/aCD28 for 3h) of four different donors, was mapped to the corresponding UniProtKB accession number. For these UniProtKB ACs, we extracted the subcellular localization (UniProt_SL) annotation from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database or if not available the subcellular localization was predicted unsing LocTree3 and PolyPhobius. This led to the identification of 908 genes coding for proteins located on the surface of human naive and/or activated CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human naive T cells and naive T cells which were stimulated with aCD3/aCD28 for 3h was measured. Naive T cells from four different human blood donors were analyzed.
