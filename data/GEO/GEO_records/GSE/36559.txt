TITLE
Investigating gene expression differences in two chicken lines with variable propensity to feather pecking

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Feather pecking is a major welfare problem in egg production. It may be caused by genetic, physiological and environmental factors. The main aim of this study was to uncover variability in gene expression between individuals from high (HFP) and for low feather pecking (LFP) line using Chicken Gene Expression Microarrays (Agilent Technologies).

DESIGN
Samples were assorted to two groups, each containing 9 biological replicates from high feather pecking (HFP) and low feather pecking (LFP) line.
