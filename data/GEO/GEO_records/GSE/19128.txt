TITLE
Regulation of Inflammatory Gene Expression by Immunostimulatory Botanicals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using herbogenomics, this study provides novel insight into putative genes which may be involved in physiological responses.

DESIGN
PBMCs were treated with 5uL herbal extract for indicated times, followed by RNA isolation with Rneasy kit (Qiagen). Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
