TITLE
gene expression analysis in Pbx1; Emx1-cre mutant cortex at embryonic day 12.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
the goal of the study was to compare gene expression between control and Pbx1; Emx1-cre mutant corteces at e12.5

DESIGN
E12.5 whole cortex was dissected for the analysis. Control embryo genotype was Pbx1F/+. Mutant embryo genotype was Pbx1F/-; Emx1-cre. 4 corteces of each genotype were used for the analysis: 4 controls and 4 mutants, 8 samples total.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
