TITLE
Infarcted rats teated with rhNRG-1(recombinant human NRG-1)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The ErbB famliy of erceptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, neuregulins(NRGs), are crtical involved not only in cardiac development but also in the maintenace of structural and functional integrity of the adult heart. rhNRG-1(recombinant human NRG-1) Improves cardiac function and sruvival in models of ischemic, dilated, and viral cardiomyopathy with the ErbB-activation. But the mechanism is still unknown Keywords: Genechips
