TITLE
Infarcted rats teated with rhNRG-1(recombinant human NRG-1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The ErbB famliy of erceptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, neuregulins(NRGs), are crtical involved not only in cardiac development but also in the maintenace of structural and functional integrity of the adult heart. rhNRG-1(recombinant human NRG-1) Improves cardiac function and sruvival in models of ischemic, dilated, and viral cardiomyopathy with the ErbB-activation. But the mechanism is still unknown Keywords: Genechips

DESIGN
Three individual samples in each group (vehicle, rhNRG-1 treated or sham operated rats) were hybridized with 9 GeneChipÂ® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) separately.A total of 1950 genes (at least a 1.5-fold change in expression level compared with any another groups, all p < 0.05),were selected and used as input for hierarchical clustering, a computational method that groups experimental samples according to similarity in patterns of gene expression across a large number of genes.
