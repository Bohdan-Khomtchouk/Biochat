TITLE
Array CGH reveals genetic homogeneity and frequent copy number increases encompassing CCNE1 in Fallopian tube carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) is a rare, poorly studied and aggressive cancer, associated with poor survival.  Since tumorigenesis is related to acquisition of genetic changes, we used genome-wide array CGH to analyze copy number aberrations occurring in FTC in order to obtain a better understanding of FTC carcinogenesis and to identify prognostic events and targets for therapy.  We used arrays of 2464 genomic clones, providing ~1.4 Mb resolution across the genome to quantitatively map genomic DNA copy number aberrations from fourteen FTC onto the human genome sequence.  All tumors showed a high frequency of copy number aberrations with recurrent gains on 3q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 12p, 17q, 19 and 20q, and losses involving chromosomes 4, 5q, 8p, 16q, 17p, 18q and X.  Recurrent regions of amplification included 1p34, 8p11-q11, 8q24, 12p, 17p13, 17q12-q21, 19p13, 19q12-q13 and 19q13.  Candidate, known oncogenes mapping to these amplicons included CMYC (8q24), CCNE1 (19q12-q21) and AKT2 (19q13), whereas PIK3CA and KRAS, previously suggested to be candidate driver genes for amplification mapped outside copy number maxima on 3q and 12p, respectively.  The FTC were remarkably homogeneous, with some recurrent aberrations occurring in more than 70% of samples, which suggests a stereotyped pattern of tumor evolution.
