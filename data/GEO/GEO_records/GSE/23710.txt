TITLE
P19 neuronal cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We comprehensively investigated the neural-splicing using P19 cells, set up nine filtering conditions, and obtained 262 candidate exons (236 genes). Results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR in randomly selected 30 candidates suggested that 87% of the candidates were actually changed more than double compared with the undifferentiated and differentiated cells. GO analysis and pathway analysis also showed that these 236 candidate genes were highly involved in the neural events. These results suggested that our extraction of alternative exons was quite reasonable and successful.

DESIGN
We have biological duplicates in this project. We essentially compared Day 7 (neural-differentiated) against Day0 (Undifferentiated)
