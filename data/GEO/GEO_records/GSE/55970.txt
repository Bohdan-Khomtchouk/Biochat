TITLE
Evaluation of global methylation profile in recipient BMMSCs of MRL/lpr mice after cell therapy (MeDip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has been widely used to treat a variety of human diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying its success are not fully understood. Here we show that MSCT rescues recipient bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC) function in Fas-deficient-MRL/lpr systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mice via rescuing their hypomethylated DNA profile. Using the methylation microarray, we found the global hypomethylation pattern in the recipient BMMSCs of MRL/lpr mice could be rescued by MSCT.

DESIGN
In the present study, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) was used to treat MRL/lpr mice. One week after the treatment, normal control MSCs from C3H/HeJ mice (C3H), recipient MSCs from untreated MRL/lpr mice (LPR) and recipient MSCs from MSCT-treated MRL/lpr mice (MSC) were used for total DNA extraction and DNA methylation microarray for analysis of global genome methylation patterns.
