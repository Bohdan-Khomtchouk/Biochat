TITLE
Gene expression data from AP-2γ silenced MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of the AP-2γ  transcription factor in breast tumours has been identified as an independent predictor of poor outcome and failure of hormone therapy, even in ER positive, ErbB2 negative tumours; markers of a more favourable prognosis. To understand further the role of AP-2γ in breast carcinoma, we have used an RNA interference and gene expression profiling strategy using the MCF-7 cell line as a model for ER positive, ErbB2 negative tumours with AP-2γ overexpression. Gene expression changes between control and silenced cells implicate AP-2γ  in the control of cell cycle progression and developmental signalling. Keywords: RNA interference

DESIGN
We compared the expression profiles of MCF-7 cells separately transfected with three independent AP-2γ targeting sequences with those from control cells treated with transfection reagent alone or a non-silencing control siRNA on Affymetrix arrays; each condition was examined in triplicate.
