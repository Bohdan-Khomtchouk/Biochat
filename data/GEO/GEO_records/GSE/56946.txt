TITLE
Human endometrial cancer cell gene expression profiles of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) hinge region mutants (H1 and H2NES)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERa negative Ishikawa cells were stably infected with Era: Wild type ERa, H1 ERa, H2NES ERa the design was to determine if rapid action non-genomic mediated signals would lead to gene expression changs.

DESIGN
Four stable cell lines, vector, WT, H1 and H2NES ERa were treated for 4hr or 24 hr with 10nM Estradiol or vehicle, n=3 for each treatment group

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
