TITLE
Target mRNAs induce tailing and trimming of Ago2-loaded miRNAs in neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We show that target mRNAs trigger the non-templated addition of nucleotides (mainly adenosines and uridines) and shortening of their cognate miRNAs in primary hippocampal neurons. The induced effect is observable both in total RNA and in Ago2-associated RNA, demonstrating that the process is initiated in Ago2 bound miRNAs.

DESIGN
Illumina Small RNA sequencing was performed on rat hippocampal neurons infected with different target mRNAs in different conditions. The data includes 3 independent experiments: 1. Hippocampal neurons (DIV15) 6 days after transducing them with target mRNAs (driven by the Synapsin promoter) against different miRNAs. Samples are titled " Syn-Target " . Samples transduced with targets containing extensive complementarity are labeled " Ext " and those with Seed complementarity are labeled " Seed " . 2. Hippocampal neurons (DIV16) 7 days after transducing them with an inducible target mRNA against miR-132, and inducing for different times with Doxycycline. Samples are titled " Time-course " 3. Hippocampal neurons (DIV16) 7 days after co-transducing them with FLAG/HA-Ago2 plus an inducible target mRNA against miR-132, and inducing them for different times with Doxycycline. Samples are titled " Time-course_Ago2 "
