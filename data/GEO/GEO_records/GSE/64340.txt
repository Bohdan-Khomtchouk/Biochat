TITLE
Genome-wide maps of m6dA bases in drosophila ovary genomic DNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the m6dA modification on the Drosophila genome. We collected ovary genomic DNA from 2-day wild-type and DMAD mutant files and performed DNA-immunoprecipitation(DNA-IP)experiments using anti-m6dA antibody. The generated DNA library was subjected to a high-throughput deep sequencing analysis. In this assay, the IgG-immunoprecipited DNA from the same amount of wild-type ovaries was used as the control, and the high-throughput sequencing resulted in a range of approximately 3 to 4.6 million reads. In sum, we identified 50 and 195 peaks from wild-type and DMAD mutant samples. Importantly, m6dA is mainly utilized to modify the transposon sequence on the chromosomes.
