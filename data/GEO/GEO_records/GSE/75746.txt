TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of HeLa cells infected with Shigella flexneri

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the transcriptome changes induced by infection of Hela 229 cells with Shigella flexneri. The sample set consists of a control (mock), total population of infected sample and infected sample sorted into Shigella positive and Shigella negative population.

DESIGN
Transcriptmic profiles of HeLa cells infected with Shigella were generated by high throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000.
