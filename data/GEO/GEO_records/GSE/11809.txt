TITLE
Lung transcriptome from M. avium infected WT, IFNg-/- and IRF1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium avium infection in mice induces granuloma necrosis in the lung which is dependent on IFNg. IRF1 is a transcription factor activated by IFNg signaling. The effect of IFNg and IRF1 on immunopathology and transcriptional changes in the lung were analysed using gene-deficient mice. The data from the Ifng-/- experiment have been described (Aly et al. 2007. J Pathol 212:295). Keywords: Infection, Genotype comparison

DESIGN
In two independent blocks of experiments, Ifng-/- and Irf1-/- mice on a C57Bl/6 background and their respective controls were infected with Mycobacterium avium via aerosol. After 14 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lung RNA prepared using TriFast FL (Peqlab). Total RNA (1µg) was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse MOE430A 2.0 GeneChips according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For each condition three biological replicates (except Ifng-/-, no infection) were used. Total of 23 Samples.
