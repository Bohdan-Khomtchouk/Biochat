TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of IMR-90 human fibroblasts following oncogene-induced and replicative senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By transcriptome analysis of IMR-90 human fibroblasts following oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and replicative senescence (RS), we identified commonly regulated genes in both conditions.

DESIGN
Growing, OIS and RS cells were prepared for microarray analysis.
