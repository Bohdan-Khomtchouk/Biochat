TITLE
Expression of oxysterol pathway genes in estrogen positive breast carcinomas-first phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metabolism of anticancer drugs markedly affects their antitumor effects. The major goal of our study was to investigate associations of gene expression of enzymes metabolizing taxanes and/or anthracyclines with therapy response and survival of breast carcinoma patients The present study investigated differences in transcript levels of key modulators of oxysterol signaling pathway, including oxysterol receptors, metabolic enzymes and transporters in the groups of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast carcinomas in comparison to estrogen receptor negative (ER-) ones, and to control non-tumor tissues.

DESIGN
Transcript levels of seventy-five selected human genes (oxysterol signaling pathway, oxysterol receptors, metabolic enzymes and transporters) were determined by qPCR in 17 ER+ tumor tissue samples, in 12 ER- samples, and 10 non-tumor tissues. EIF2B1, ELF1, and UBB were used as reference genes for data normalization.
