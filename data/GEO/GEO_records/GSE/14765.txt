TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis gapcp mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Glycolytic Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phospate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by coupling with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Both cytosolic and plastidial isoforms of GAPDH has been described but the in vivo functions of the plastidial isoforms is unresolved. We generated mutants of the Arabidopsis plastidial GAPDH isoforms (At1g79530, At1g16300; GAPCp1, GAPCp2) and performed a microarray analysis comparing gapcp double (gapcp1 gapcp2) mutant and wild type seedlings

DESIGN
15-day old Arabidopsis seedlings (Col 0)  and gapcp1gapcp2 double mutants were used  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
