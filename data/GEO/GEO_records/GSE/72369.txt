TITLE
Gene expression profiling of control cohesin knockdown LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-sequencing in LSK cells (Lin(neg)/c-Kit(+)/Sca-1(+)) from shRNA mice carrying an shRNA for Renilla, Smc1a or Stag2.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing control (Renilla) and cohesin (Smc1a and Stag2) knockdown cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
