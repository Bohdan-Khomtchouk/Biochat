TITLE
Geminin regulates self-renewal and fate commitment decisions in fetal hematopoietic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional deletion of Geminin from the entire hematopoietic compartment using Vav1:iCre mice led to defective hematopoiesis/dyserythropoiesis in E15.5 mouse embryos. The present data set includes data from lineage-negative cells isolated from homogenized livers that were dissected from E15.5.dpc embryos. The two conditions compared were  wild-type versus Geminin-KO Lin- cells. The cells were collected from littermates.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed: three samples from each wild-type and Geminin-KO Lin- cells. For our analyses, we set cutoff values FC > 1.5 and p-value < 0.05. The analysis was carried out using the genotype criterion, but non-averaged for the three biological replicates.
