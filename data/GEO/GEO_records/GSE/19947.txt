TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in the Ovarian Surface Epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult Ovarian Surface Epithelium (OSE) retains the ability to undergo Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). We established a cell culture of murine adult OSE in their epithelial state, and we induced EMT by modifying their culture conditions. In this experiment we compare the transcriptional profile of the OSE before and after EMT.

DESIGN
Each of three different cultures of mouse OSE in their epithelial phenotype is split in two: one half is kept epithelial, the other half is cultured under conditions that induce the cells to undergo EMT. After one week the EMT process is complete (as assessed morphologically and biochemically) and the transcriptional profiles of the cells in their respective phenotypes are compared.
