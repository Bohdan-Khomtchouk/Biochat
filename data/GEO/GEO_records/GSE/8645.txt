TITLE
7.5uM CG-1521 and 5uM TSA treatment of LNCaP Prostate Cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression changes following treatment with the HDACs (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor) CG-1521 (7.5uM) or TSA (Trichostatin A) were investigated to determine regulatory targets and patterns of the HDAC Inhibitors. Keywords: Expression response to treatment, data was used for a comparison of gene expression and regulation between CG-1521 and TSA in LNCaP Cells
