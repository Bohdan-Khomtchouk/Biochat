TITLE
7.5uM CG-1521 and 5uM TSA treatment of LNCaP Prostate Cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression changes following treatment with the HDACs (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor) CG-1521 (7.5uM) or TSA (Trichostatin A) were investigated to determine regulatory targets and patterns of the HDAC Inhibitors. Keywords: Expression response to treatment, data was used for a comparison of gene expression and regulation between CG-1521 and TSA in LNCaP Cells

DESIGN
LNCaP Prostate Cancer cells were treated for a period of 24h with either CG-1521 (7.5uM) or TSA (5uM) following a 24h seeding period. At the selected time point, total RNA was harvested from the cells for hybridization and analysis by Nimblgen Systems Inc using the homo sapiens gene expression array.
