TITLE
Cell-type based analysis of microRNA profiles in the mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are implicated in brain development and function but the underlying mechanisms have been difficult to study in part due to cellular heterogeneity in neural circuits. To systematically analyze miRNA expression in neurons, we have established a miRNA tagging and affinity purification (miRAP) method that is targeted to cell types through the Cre-loxP binary system in mice. Our studies of the neocortex and cerebellum reveal the expression of a large fraction of known miRNAs with distinct profiles in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and subtypes of GABAergic neurons.  We further detected putative novel miRNAs, tissue or cell type-specific strand selection of miRNAs, and miRNA editing.  Our method thus will facilitate a systematic analysis of miRNA expression and regulation in specific neuron types in the context of neuronal development, physiology, plasticity, pathology and disease models, and is generally applicable to other cell types and tissues.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from miRNA tagging samples(Ago2 IP or Myc IP), processed and sequenced on Illumina genome analyzer
