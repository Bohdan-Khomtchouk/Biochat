TITLE
Gene expression changes of sulfone bis(p-chlorophenyl)-induced in renal cortex of rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study is to develop a short term and highly accurate prediction method of renal carcinogenicity based on gene expression profile of rats administrated by carcinogens. We conducted 28 days-repeated dose experiments in male SD rats with sulfone bis(p-chlorophenyl), and the gene expression profiles of renal cortex were analyzed using custom microarrays.

DESIGN
Experimental design is the two group (control group vs. sulfone bis(p-chlorophenyl) treated group). Three biological replicates were performed for each group.
