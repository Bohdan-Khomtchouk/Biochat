TITLE
WT (Fis+) strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Fis is a nucleoid-associated protein in E. coli that is abundant during early logarithmic growth in rich medium but is in short supply during stationary phase.  Its role as a transcriptional regulator has been demonstrated for an increasing number of genes.  In order to gain insight into the global effects of Fis on E. coli gene expression during different stages of growth in rich medium, DNA microarray analyses were conducted in fis and wild type strains during early log, mid log, late log, and stationary growth phases. We used microarrays to detail the global impact of Fis on gene expression in Escherichia coli Keywords: time course

DESIGN
E.coli cells were were grown and samples were  taken at different times during growth: 90 min (early logarithmic phase), 150 min (mid-logarithmic phase), 240 min (late logarithmic phase), and 360 min (early stationary phase) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  This was done in triplicate and the raw data was analyzed using Microarray Analysis Suite version 5.0 (Affymetrix).
