TITLE
Expression analysis of Aspergillus nidulans OE::rsmA

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Aspergillus nidulans OE::rsmA compared to wild-type RDIT9.32 (veA).

DESIGN
A twelve array study using total RNA recovered from six separate cultures of Aspergillus nidulans wild-type RDIT9.32 (veA) and six separate cultures of Aspergillus nidulans overexpressing rsmA (restorer of secondary metabolism A), using custom-designed, four-plex arrays.  The experiment was divided into two runs.  In the first run, three biological replicates each of Aspergillus nidulans wild-type RDIT9.32 (veA) and Aspergillus nidulans carrying a plasmid overexpressing rsmA under the control of the gpdA promoter were assayed.  In the second run, three biological replicates each of Aspergillus nidulans wild-type RDIT9.32 (veA) and Aspergillus nidulans overexpressing rsmA at the native locus under the control of the gpdA promoter were assayed.
