TITLE
Development of patient-specific neurons in schizophrenia using induced pluripotent stem cells: proof of principle and preliminary findings

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has the potential to address the inaccessibility of the human brain by providing investigators with patient-specific neurons that can potentially be used to carry out molecular, electrophysiological and pharmacological studies {{855 Takahashi,K. 2006}}. Although iPSC technology was primarily conceived and developed as a means to bypass the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for regenerative medicine, its potential for disease modeling may prove to be equally valuable, especially for neuropsychiatric disorders. A total of 1207 genes were found to be differentially expressed using LIMMA ( > 2-fold, p-value < 0.05), and these genes were hierarchically clustered to form 5 groups based on their expression in day 0, 10 and 32. These were subjected to bioinformatics analysis by Gene Ontogoly (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine enrichment profiles and associated disease processes. The largest cluster (cluster III), which showed increasing expression in both day 10 and day 32 neurons, was found to be enriched with genes involved in a number of neuronal pathways including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, axon guidance and adhesion, among others.

DESIGN
At a p-value of 0.05, we detected 645 and 383 genes up- and down-regulated between day 0 and day 10, respectively, and 146 and 280 genes up- and down-regulated between day 10 and day 32. In total, 1207 genes were found to be differentially expressed using LIMMA, and these genes were hierarchically clustered to form 5 groups.
