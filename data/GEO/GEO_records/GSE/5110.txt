TITLE
48h Immobilization in human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our results suggest that 48h of immobilization increases expression of mRNA for components of the UPP and MT function while decreasing mRNA and protein for components involved in ECM integrity. We hypothesized that 48h of immobilization would increase gene expression and respective protein products for components of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Keywords: stimulus or stress design

DESIGN
To identify novel pathways involved in the atrophy program activated in response to 48h of limb immobilization in humans.
