TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing based on the DNA fragment pulled down by p53 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-126) from MCF7 wile type and MCF7 MDMX-C463A/WT cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypothesis: Based on gene chip results and further investigation, MDMX C463A/WT cells shows large portion of transcripts change at p53 dependent manner. As transcriptional factor, p53 regulates those genes could be related to DNA binding status change. ChIP-seq was used to test this hypothesis and figure out global map of p53 binding in MCF7 C463A/WT MCF7 cells by using MCF7 parental cells as reference.

DESIGN
Examination of p53 genomic DNA binding affinity change in MCF7 C463A/WT cells comparing to parental cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
