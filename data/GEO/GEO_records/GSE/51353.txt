TITLE
The role of the Hog1 and Slt2 MAP Kinases in the regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression upon stress by sulfuric acid

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In our previous work, we had found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae needs of the Hog1 and Slt2 proteins to growth in a low pH environment caused by sulfuric acid, one of the stress factors during the process of ethanol production. Then was performed the gene-wide expression analysis in the hog1∆ and slt2∆ mutants in order to reveal the function of the Hog1p and Slt2p MAP Kinases in the regulation of S. cerevisiae global gene expression upon stress by sulfuric acid.

DESIGN
BY4741 strain (Reference) and their derivate mutants hog1∆ and slt2∆ were grown for 1 h in YPD medium pH 2.5 adjusted with concentrated sulfuric acid

PLATFORM
GPL16244 Agilent-016322 Yeast (V2) Gene Expression 8x15K Microarray (Probe Name version)
