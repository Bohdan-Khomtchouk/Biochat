TITLE
Effects of dexamethasone for primary trabecular meshwork cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effects of dexamethasone treatment for primary trabecular meshwork cell gene expression, which may relates to the pathophysiology of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma

DESIGN
Three lots (lot #2584, 3423 and 4973) of primary culture human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA). The TM cells were treated with and  without 100nM dexamethasone (DEX) for 14 days. Genomewide gene expression analysis was carried out using Agilent 8X60K array.
