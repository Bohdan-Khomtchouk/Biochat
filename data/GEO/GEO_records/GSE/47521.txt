TITLE
Gene expression microarray during Human NK cell development; 1-, 7- and 14-day cultured cells after differentiation induction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes during human NK cell development, we performed mRNA arrays analysis by using total RNA isolated from 1-, 7- or 14-day cultured cells after the addition of medium supplemented with IL-15 in HSCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood (UCB).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 1-day(control) vs. 7-day  and 1-day(control) vs 14-day cultured cells .

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
