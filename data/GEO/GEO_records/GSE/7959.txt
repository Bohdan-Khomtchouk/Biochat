TITLE
Inhibition of MYCN by a PNA anti-gene in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective was to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for in vitro and in vivo efficacy of an anti-MYCN peptide nucleic acid on a preclinical model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Cells treated with a anti-MYCN PNA exhibit growth arrest and apoptosis, and in vivo tumor growth is blocked. Keywords: oncogene inhibition

DESIGN
RH30 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line was treated with a 10uM concentration of anti-MYCN PNA or a mutated PNA devoid of any activity. After 12 hours RNA was extracted from untreated and treated cells and gene expression was analyzed by Affymetrix Gene Chips.
