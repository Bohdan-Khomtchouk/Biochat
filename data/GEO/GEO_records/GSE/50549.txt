TITLE
Histone Deacetylase Inhibition Promotes Osteoblast Maturation by Altering the Histone 4 (H4) Epigenome (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly increased the expression levels of 127 transcripts and suppressed expression of 130 genes by more than 2-fold within 3 standard deviations of the mean in differentiating MC3T3 sc4 osteoblasts

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from differentiating MC3T3 sc4 cells treated with SAHA or vehicle (DMSO).
