TITLE
Comparative analysis of Corynebacterium glutamicum transcriptome in response to expression of Egfp under the change of dissolved oxygen in bioreactor

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
Purpose:dissolved oxygen (DO) level is an important factor that could significantly influence microorganismsâ€™ growth, maintenance, metabolism and product yield.The goals of this study are to comparative analysis on Corynebacterium glutamicum transcriptome in response to expression of eGFP under the change of dissolved oxygen in bioreactor,find the critical pathways and genes.

DESIGN
Method:three batches of fermentation were conducted with different DO level separately (50%, 30%, 0%),and sampled on 20h of fermentation,the transcriptome of Corynebacterium glutamicum generated using Illumina hiseq 2500.
