TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis of Nascent Transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We combined the nuclear run-on (NRO) assay which labels and captures nascent transcripts with high throughput DNA sequencing to examine transcriptional activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

DESIGN
Examination of nascent transcripts and steady-state transcripts in exponentially growing and heat-shock treated yeast.

PLATFORM
GPL9377 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
