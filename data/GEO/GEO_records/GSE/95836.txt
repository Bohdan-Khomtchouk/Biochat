TITLE
Simultaneous mapping of active DNA demethylation and sister chromatid exchange in single cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MAB-seq and BS-seq were performed for mouse embryonic stem cells, zygotic paternal pronuclei and 2-cell and 4-cell stage embryos.

DESIGN
Regular MAB-seq and BS-seq were performed using purified genomic DNA. Low-input MAB-seq and BS-seq were performed using around 100 diploid cells. Single-cell MAB-seq was performed using single cells from mouth pipetting.
