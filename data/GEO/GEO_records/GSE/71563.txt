TITLE
Differentially expressed small RNAs in Arabidopsis galls formed by Meloidogyne javanica

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Root-knot nematodes (RKNs) induce inside the vascular cylinder the giant cells (GCs) imbibed into a gall. Gene-repression in early developing GCs could be facilitated by small RNAs (sRNA) as miRNAs. 24nt-sRNAs, rasiRNAs and 21-22nt-sRNAs can also mediate epigenetic mechanisms. Three sRNA libraries from 3dpi galls and three from uninfected root segments were sequenced following Illumina-Solexa technology.
