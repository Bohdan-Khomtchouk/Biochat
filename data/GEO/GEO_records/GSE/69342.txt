TITLE
Expression profiling of long non-coding and coding gene expression of gastric cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The high throghput lncRNA and mRNA microarray data showed a total of 27,883 lncRNAs and 19,644 mRNAs expressed in gastric cancer cell line, SGC7901 and two multidrug-resistance sublines, SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR

DESIGN
Expression profiling of long non-coding and coding gene expression of gastric cancer cell line, SGC7901 and two multidrug-resistance subllines of SGC7901, SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR GC cell line, SGC7901, and two MDR sublines, SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR were subjected to an lncRNA microarray analysis. Bioinformatics and verification experiments were performed to investigate the potential lncRNAs involved in the development of MDR.
