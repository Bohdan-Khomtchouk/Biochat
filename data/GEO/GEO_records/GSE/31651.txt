TITLE
Mobile 24 nt small RNAs direct transcriptional gene silencing in the root meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We grafted Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS)-inducing wild type Arabidopsis and a mutant that is compromised in 24 nucleotide (nt) small RNA (sRNA) production onto a wild type reporter line. We observed that 21-24 nt sRNAs were transmitted across a graft union yet only the 24 nt sRNAs directed RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) and TGS of a transgene promoter in meristematic cells.

DESIGN
Analysis of sRNAs associated with mobile TGS by deep sequencing, biological replicates. 10 unique samples, 5 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
