TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Meis1, Hoxa9 and Pbx binding sites in murine myeloid leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have searched genome-wide binding sites of homeodomain proteins important for leukemogenesis in Hoxa9- and Meis1- induced myeloid leukemia cells. Thousands of binding sites of these three family proteins have been identified and many of them are co-localized with those of each others. Hoxa9 and Pbx binding sites were compared between the presence and absence of Meis1 by its knockout in the same cells. In combination of the results with gene expression profiles of the same cells, important downstream target genes of Meis1 in leukemogenesis have been identified.

DESIGN
Examination of binding sites of 3 transcription factors in a single cell with 2 different conditions
