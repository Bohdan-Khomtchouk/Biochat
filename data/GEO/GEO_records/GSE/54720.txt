TITLE
DNA methylation changes at CpG and non-CpG sites are associated with development and clinical behavior in neuroblastoma [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation changes in neuroblastoma, a clinically-heterogeneous pediatric tumor, have been described essentially in promoter regions. We analyzed the DNA methylome of neuroblastoma using high-density microarrays and observed differential methylation not only in promoters but also in intragenic and intergenic regions at both CpG and non-CpG sites. These epigenetic changes showed a non-random distribution relative functional chromatin domains, and targeted development and cancer-related genes, relevant for neuroblastoma pathogenesis. CCND1, a gene overexpressed in neuroblastoma, showed hypomethylation of gene-body and upstream regulatory regions. Furthermore, tumors with diverse clinical-risk showed clear differences affecting CpG and, remarkably, non-CpG sites. Non-CpG methylation was present in clinically-favorable tumors and affected genes such as ALK, where non-CpG methylation correlated with low gene expression. Finally, we identified CpG and non-CpG methylation signatures which correlated with patientâ€™s age at time-points relevant for neuroblastoma clinical behavior, and targeted genes related to neural development and neural crest regulatory network We report on the first DNA methylomes of neuroblastoma tumors using high-density microarrays. DNA methylation changes in this pediatric tumor affected both CpG and non-CpG sites associated with developmental and cancer-related genes such as CCND1 and ALK. Our study also provides new insights into the molecular basis of the heterogeneous clinical behavior of neuroblastoma.

DESIGN
RNA from 20 neuroblastoma tumor and 4 non patological tissues (2 fetal brain and 2 adrenal gland) samples  were hybridised to the Affymetrix Human Genome U219- 24array plate.
