TITLE
Gene expression data of proliferative cells isolated from the adult human peripheral retina, cultured and differentiated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proliferative cells isolated from the adult human peripheral retina only transiently upregulate key retinal markers upon induced differentiation. We used microarray to identify gene expression before and after differentiation to evaluate the in vitro retinal differentiation potential of the cells isolated from the adult human peripheral retina using the current cell culture and differentiation protocol.

DESIGN
We isolated proliferating cells from the adult human peripheral retina, cultured and differentiated the cells to examine the cells in vitro differentiation potential towards a retinal phenotype.
