TITLE
Ileal expression data of mice fed with diet containing protein from various sources

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to address key questions concerning the use of alternative protein sources for animal feeds and addresses aspects such as their nutrient composition and impact on gut function, the immune system and systemic physiology. We used casein (CAS), partially delactosed whey powder (DWP), spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP), soybean meal (SBM), wheat gluten meal (WGM) and yellow meal worm (YMW) as protein sources. We investigated the effects of feeding mice during a period of four weeks on semi-synthetic diets containing 30% of six different protein sources. Microarrays were used to detail the global gene expression in the ileal mucosae of mice.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6J mice were stratified according to bodyweight and litter of origin into six dietary treatment groups. These mice were fed for four weeks with semi-synthetic diets containing one of the following protein sources. At the end of four weeks, mice were sacrificed by euthenesia and ileal tissue samples (scrapings) were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Soybean meal (SBM) diet group served as reference to make comparisons with other experimental diets.
