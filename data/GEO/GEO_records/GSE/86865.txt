TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptonal profiling in E13.5 fetal liver erythroid cells from Tfam WT and KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The developing erythroid cells require highly coordinated gene expression and metabolism. By comparing the proteomic and transcriptomic changes in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and lineage-committed erythroid progenitors (ProEs), and uncover pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis enhanced through post-transcriptional regulation. Two principal mitochondrial factors TFAM and PHB2 are tightly regulated at the protein level and indispensable for mitochondria and erythropoiesis. To determine the role of TFAM in mitochondrial function during erythroid development, we generated Tfam conditional knockout (KO) mice by an erythroid-specific EpoR-Cre allele. We isolated the CD71+Ter119+ embryonic day (E)13.5 fetal liver erythroid cells by FACS sorting, and performed RNA-seq transcriptional profiling analysis.

DESIGN
CD71+Ter119+ embryonic day (E)13.5 fetal liver erythroid cells were isolated by FACS sorting. Total RNA were extracted and processed for RNA-seq transcriptional profiling analysis.
