TITLE
Transcriptomics and metabolomics assisted molecular characterization of novel ERF transcription factors involved in the regulation of specialized metabolism in Ophiorrhiza pumila

ORGANISM
Ophiorrhiza pumila

SUMMARY
In this study, the genes that encode AP2/ERF transcription factors, namely OpERF1 to OpERF5, were isolated from HR of O. pumila. Phylogenetic analysis of AP2/ERF protein sequences suggested the close evolutionary relationship of OpERF1 with stress-responsive ERF factors in Arabidopsis and of OpERF2 with ERF factors reported to regulate alkaloid production, such as ORCA3 in Catharanthus roseus, NIC2-locus ERFs in tobacco, and JRE4 in tomato. We generated the HR lines of O. pumila, ERF1i and ERF2i, in which the expression of OpERF1 and OpERF2, respectively, was suppressed using RNA interference technique. The transcriptome and metabolome of these suppressed HR were analyzed for functional characterization of OpERF1 and OpERF2.

DESIGN
De novo transcriptome assembly used in this study for transcriptome expression analysis was based on previously published  and characterization O. pumila transcriptome assembly by Rohanin et al., 2016 (doi: 10.5511/plantbiotechnology.15.1117a). Illumina based paired-end RNA-seq profiling for transgenic lines were created, and differential expression analysis was performed to identify contigs affected in response to the down-regulation of OpERF1 and OpERF2
