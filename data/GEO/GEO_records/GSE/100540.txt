TITLE
The transcriptional response to unilateral nephrectomy with and without ischemia-reperfusion injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was done after warm renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in a rat model. Earlier studies have shown a protective effect of prior unilateral nephrectomy (UNx) against IRI in the remaining, contralateral kidney compared to a non-neprectomized control group. We aimed at identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms. We used the Affymetrix Clariom D array (formerly known as RTA 1.0 st.) Array data was processed in the Affymetrix Console Software.

DESIGN
We analysed kidney tissue (left) from male Wistar rats. Number of animals from each group, n = 3. Wistar rats were randomized to either UNx or sham UNx immediately prior to 37 minutes of unilateral renal artery clamping or sham operation under sevoflurane anesthesia. Groups: sham (2 normal kidneys), UNx (1 remaining kidney), IR (1 ischemic kidney, 1 normal kidney), IR+UNx (1 ischemic kidney). MRI was performed 24 hours after reperfusion. Blood and renal tissue were harvested. RNA was isolated for microarray analysis.
