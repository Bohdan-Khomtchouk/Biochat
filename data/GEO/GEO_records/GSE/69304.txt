TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of ATF4 binding in histidinol-treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor induced by the integrated stress response (ISR). This experiment is a genome-wide occupancy profiling of ATF4 in human HAP1 cells. HAP1 is a near-haploid human cell line that was derived from KBM-7 cells isolated from a patient with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. We induced ATF4 expression by mimicking amino acid starvation with the drug histidinol. We identified peaks of ATF4 binding using three independent antibodies.

DESIGN
Examination of ATF4 binding in HAP1 cells treated with 2 mM histidinol for 24 hours.
