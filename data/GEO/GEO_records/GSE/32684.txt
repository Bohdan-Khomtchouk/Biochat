TITLE
Small RNA profiling in Drosophila wild-type and nbr[f02257] mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
nbr/CG9247 gene regulates 3'end heterogeneity of a subset of miRNAs. It is not clear how broad this effect is on small RNA population. To address this, we compared small RNA population in wild-type and tmr[f02257]  mutants. This approach identified more miRNAs whose 3'end heterogeneity was affected in nbr[f02257] mutants.

DESIGN
2-3 day old control (w homogeneous strain Bloomington stock center 5905) and nbr[f02257] null mutant flies were collected. nbr[f02257] line was in the homogenous (Bloomington stock center stock 5905) background through a minimum of 5 backcrosses. Total RNA from whole flies was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 40ug of total RNA from each genotype was used for small RNA library preparation with Small RNA Sample Prep kit (v1.5) (Illumina).
