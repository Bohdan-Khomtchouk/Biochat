TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes during Larval Development of Rapana Venosa by Digital Gene Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Rapana venosa

SUMMARY
In present study, digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed to obtain a general picture of the transcriptomic implicated in the early development of R. venosa. Eighteen DGE libraries at six developmental stages of R. venosa were constructed, sequenced by IIIumina HiSeq 2500 platform.

DESIGN
RNA from six developmental stages of R. venosa  was sequenced using Illumina Hi-seq 2500. Each stage have three replicates

PLATFORM
GPL20664 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Rapana venosa)
