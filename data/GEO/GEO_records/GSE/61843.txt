TITLE
Inhibition of AK4 expression increases drug sensitivity and elevates mitochondrial ATP synthesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, and is believed to be involved in stress, drug resistance, the malignant transformation of cancer, and ATP regulation. We produced AK4 knockdown HeLa cells by using shRNA and used these to analyze resistance, and found that sensitivity to hypoxia and drugs increased.

DESIGN
3 samples of HeLa cells haboring AK4 shRNA plasmids and 4 samples of HeLa cells haboring control shRNA plasmid.
