TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human liver progenitor-like cells in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the global expression profiles among primary human hepatocytes and liver progenitor-like cells with or without in vitro differentiation.

DESIGN
Human liver progenitor-like cells were derived from 3 donor and cultured in the transition and expansion medium for 4 days, 10 days, passage 5 and passage 10 or in the differentiation medium for 8 days. Primary hepatocytes were isolated using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique.
