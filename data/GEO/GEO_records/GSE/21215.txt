TITLE
Peroxisomes are signaling patforms for antiviral innate immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional response of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to reovirus infection.  The hypothesis tested was that both peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS is capable of inducing the expression of antiviral genes.

DESIGN
mRNA isolated from MAVS-expressing cells after infection for various times with reovirus
