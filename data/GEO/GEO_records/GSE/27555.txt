TITLE
Preactivation of the interferon signaling in liver is correlated with non-response to interferon alpha therapy in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus

SUMMARY
To screen the differentially expressed genes between responders(Rs) and nonresponders(NRs) in CHB patients treated with IFN-α, and to explore the molecular basis for treatment failure.Expression profiling was performed on percutaneous needle liver biopsy specimens taken before therapy.Gene expression levels were compared between 7 NRs and 6 Rs,Gene Ontology category and KEGG pathway were analyzed for differentially expressed genes, and the selected differentially expressed genes were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction.NRs and Rs have different liver gene expression profiles before IFN-α treatment. Preactivation of the IFN signaling pathway leading to the increased expression of inhibitory ISGs and inhibition of immune response in the pretreatment livers were associated with NRs.
