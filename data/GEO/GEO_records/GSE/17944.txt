TITLE
Hypoxia regulates microRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined hypoxia responsing miRNAs in HUVEC and MA148cells.  Microarray studies revealed hypoxia can change microRNA expression in HUVEC and MA148 cells.

DESIGN
8 HUVEC samples (4 controls and 4 experimentals) and 4 MA148 samples (2 controls and 2 experimentals)

PLATFORM
GPL9142 Multispecies miRNA 1K
