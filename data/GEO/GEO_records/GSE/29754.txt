TITLE
Differential regulation of Twist1-responsive genes in 4T1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Twist1 variants including wildtype Twist1, a non-phosphorylatable mutant Twist1/S42A and a phospho-mimicking mutant Twist1/S42D were expressed in 4T1 cells in which the endogenous Twist1 was depleted. We wanted to use microarray analysis to evaluate those genes that are differentially regulated by Twist1 variants.

DESIGN
All cell lines were grown to 70% confluency and total RNA was isolated with Qiagen kit. Each sample was prepared as triplicates. Parental 4T1 cells were used as control.
