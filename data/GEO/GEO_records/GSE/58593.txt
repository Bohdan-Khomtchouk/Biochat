Dynamics of tolerant potato-potato virus Y interaction

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Time series response of potato cv. Désirée, which is tolerant to PVY infection, was analysed in both inoculated as well as upper non-inoculated leaves. Additionally, transgenic plants deficient in accumulation of salicylic acid (NahG- Désirée) were studied in the same setting.
