TITLE
Expression data from hybrid female Xenopus sex reversal experiment

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis x Xenopus muelleri

SUMMARY
Gene expression was examined in genetic males that were sex-reversed to be phenotypically female compared to normal hybrid females We used microarrays to test expression in the gonad of sex-reversed females (ZZ) compared to normal females (ZW) Keywords: treatment

DESIGN
RNA from the ovary of sexually mature individuals was extracted and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.
