TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv transcriptional response to antibacterial agents

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Bacteria commonly adapt to stresses by altering gene expression.  To understand the response of M. tuberculosis (MTB) to various antibacterial agents, we performed transcriptomics on MTB bacilli exposed to several test compounds as well as known drugs (capreomycin, cycloserine, ethionamide, isoniazid, kanamycin, moxifloxacin, PA-824, rifampicin, streptomycin).

DESIGN
Bacteria were exposed for 16 hrs to various concentrations of each drug (different multiples of the compound's MIC), as noted in the title of each sample. RNA was isolated and applied to arrays provided by TIGR under the NIAID contract N01-AI-15447

PLATFORM
GPL5774 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium tuberculosis 22K v4 array designed primarily based on strain H37Rv
