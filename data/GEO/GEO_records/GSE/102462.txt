TITLE
ZIC2 ChIP-Seq in KSHV latent and lytic reactivated BCBL-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
ZIC2 is required for the maintenance of KSHV latency in human host cells. To understand the molecular action of ZIC2, we map ZIC2 binding sites across the KSHV genome in BCBL-1 cells using ChIP-Seq analysis.

DESIGN
Examination of ZIC2 binding in KSHV latent and lytic reactivated cells
