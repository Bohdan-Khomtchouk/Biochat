TITLE
MicroRNAs in Amoebozoa: Deep sequencing of the small RNA population in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum reveals developmentally regulated microRNAs

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We found 16 miRNAs in D. discoideum. Several were differentially expressed during growth and multicellular development.

DESIGN
HTS of small RNAs was analyzed to identify miRNAs. Some of the miRNAs were then further verified using different experimental approaches.
