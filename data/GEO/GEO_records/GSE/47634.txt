TITLE
Genes induced by Oxi-beta overexpression in dopaminergic neuronal cell SN4741

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by Oxi-beta, differential gene chip analysis was perfomed. And the greatest upregulation (about 25-fold) of FBXW5 mRNA was observed in response to Oxi-beta overexpression in SN4741 dopaminergic neuronal cells

DESIGN
Total RNAs obtained from subjected to overexpression of Oxi-beta for 12 hours compared to control SN4741 cells at 0 hr.
