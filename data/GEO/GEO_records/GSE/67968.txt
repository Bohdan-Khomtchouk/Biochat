TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) response in bovine cumulus cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Study the effect of forskolin, dipyridamol and IBMX (here called FID) supplementation in the in vitro maturation medium for an incubation of 6 hrs on the transcriptomics of bovine cumulus cells.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of cumulus cells derived from cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) supplemented with FID (CC-FID) vs. cumulus cells without FID (Ct-6H, REFERENCE) were contrasted. Each replicate was subjected to a dye-swap procedure.
