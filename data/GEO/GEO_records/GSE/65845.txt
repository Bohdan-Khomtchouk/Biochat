TITLE
Transcriptional Response to C1 and methylated compounds in Pelagibacter HTCC1062

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that Pelagibacter oxidize a wide range of one carbon (C1) and methylated compounds that are ubiquitous in the oceans. However, the metabolic pathways used to oxidize and assimilate these compounds are complex and have been only partly described. To understand the metabolism of these compounds in Pelagibacter and to identify candidate genes involved in these pathways, we used microarray to study changes in gene expression in response to five different compounds (trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), methylamine, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), methanol, and glycine betaine (GBT)) in Pelagibacter strain HTCC1062.

DESIGN
This project will examine the transcriptional response of the marine microorganism Pelagibacter HTCC1062 to five methylated compounds. To do this, 18 flasks were innoculated with cells - 3 flasks without any methylated compounds and rest of 15 treated with different methylated compounds respectively (TMAO (trtmA), methylamine (trtmB), DMSP (trtmC), methanol (trtmD) and glycine betaine (trtmE)). Cells were all harvested at the same timepoint in the exponential phase.
