TITLE
The metabolic response to a high-fat diet reveals obesity-prone and -resistant phenotypes in mice with distinct mRNA-seq transcriptome profiles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated phenotypic differences underpinning obesity susceptibility or resistance based on metabolic and transcriptional profiling in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD)

DESIGN
Total RNA of epididymal adipose tissues and liver was obtained from normal diet, high-fat diet-fed mice and mRNA expression-associated with lipid, and glucose metabolism was measured.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
