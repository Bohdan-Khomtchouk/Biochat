TITLE
Gene expression data from Wild Type and  Nlrp10 deficient dendritic cells treated with or without LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nlrp10-deficient mice have a profound defect in helper T cell-driven immune responses. T cell priming is impaired due to a defect in the emigration of a dendritic cells from inflamed tissue and antigen transport to draining lymph nodes. DC chemotaxis to CCR7-dependent and independent ligands is intact in the absence of Nlrp10. Therefore to identify novel molecules potentially involved in Nlrp10-dependent DC function we used an unbiased gene array approach on Nlrp10-deficient BMDCs treated with or without LPS.

DESIGN
8 samples were analysed. BMDCs were independantly generated from 2 WT and 2 Nlrp10 deficient mice. Samples were treated with or without LPS
