TITLE
Gene Expression in Human Vastus Lateralis after PrimaVie Shilajit Supplementation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in Gene exporession after 8 weeks of PrimaVie Shilajit Supplementation were measured in vastus lateralis GeneChipÂ® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0  was used to study the gene expression in human vastus lateralis after supplementation of PrimaVie Shilajit and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Gene expression was studied in 3 subjects prior to and post-supplementation of PrimaVie Shilajit for 8 weeks; so total 6 samples
