TITLE
Integrative genomics identifies novel associations with APOL1 risk genotype in African American NEPTUNE subjects [tubulointerstitium]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tubulointersitial expression data from human kidney biopsy in African American subjects with glomerulopathies We used microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of African American subjects with glomerulopathies and the association of expression with APOL1 risk alleles (G1 and G2)

DESIGN
RNA from tubulointerstitial compartment was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
