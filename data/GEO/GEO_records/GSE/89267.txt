TITLE
Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris str. 8004 (Xcc 8004; Indian Isolate): Wild type vs xibR mutant, under the both iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions.

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas campestris

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of low-iron stimulon and XibR influenced regulon using wild-type Xcc 8004 and xibR mutant grown under iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions. Trancriptional analysis under iron-deplete condition, mimicking in planta environment, provides greater insights into expression pattern of several virulence-associated functions under low-iron. A genetic screen sggested the involvement of XibR (Xanthomonas iron binding regulator) in iron-uptake and metabolism. Present transcriptional analysis suggested the co-regulation of virulence associated functions including siderophore biosynthesis, motility, chemotaxis and typeIII effectors by a novel transcriptional regulator of NtrC family protein XibR and iron avability.
