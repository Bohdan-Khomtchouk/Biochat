TITLE
Comparison of translational profiles in Motor Neurons (CHAT), to all neurons (Snap25) in the spinal cord.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) was performed on spinal cord dissections pooled from 3-4 mice 21 days post birth that were positive for the eGFP-L10A fusion ribosomal marker protein under the expression of either the Chat promoter (Tg(Chat-EGFP/Rpl10a)DW167Htz) or the Snap25 promoter (Tg(Snap25-EGFP/Rpl10a)JD362Jdd). RNA-sequencing was performed on both TRAP and pre-immunoprecipitation (PreIP) control RNA samples.

DESIGN
Three replicates of PreIP and TRAP for two transgenic lines.
