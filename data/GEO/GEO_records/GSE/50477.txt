TITLE
Effect of L-Proline on mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that the non-essential amino acid L-proline (L-Pro) acts as a signaling molecule that promotes the conversion of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into mesenchymal-like, spindle-shaped, highly motile, invasive pluripotent stem cells.This embryonic stem cell-to-mesenchymal-like transition (esMT) is accompanied by a genome-wide remodeling of the H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 histone marks.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in untreated ESCs and L-Pro treated ESCs
