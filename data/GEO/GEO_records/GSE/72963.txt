TITLE
Expression profiling of centroacinar cells from adult zebrafish pancreas

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from two preparations of isolated Notch-responsive ductal pancreas cells and compared transcript expression to all other non-Notch-responsive cells from each sample to charactarize zebrafish centroacinar cells.

DESIGN
Determination of gene expression levels in centroacinar cells and non-centroacinar cells from adult pancreas.

PLATFORM
