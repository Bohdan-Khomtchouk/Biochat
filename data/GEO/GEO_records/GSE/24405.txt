TITLE
Microarray analysis of V. cholerae genes differentially expressed in 8 h rabbit ileal loop mucus

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
The mucus and cell-associated bacteria were isolated as a single fraction from ileal loops eight hours post inoculation by scraping the epithelial surface of the intestine with a disposable plastic cell scraper after the loops had been cut open and gently rinsed in PBS buffer to wash away remaining luminal fluid. The mucus gel/cell associated fraction was suspended in Trizol and frozen on dry ice. Total RNA, which includes RNA from the infecting bacteria and from the host (see below), was isolated from the thawed Trizol suspension, treated with DNaseI (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) and cleaned by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

DESIGN
Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc.
