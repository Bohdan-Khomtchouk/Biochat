TITLE
Comparison of hatched blastocyst derived from IVV, PA,and CT

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptomic analyses among in vivo (IVV) HB, parthenogenetic activation (PA) HB, and chromatin transfer (CT) HB were performed following a reference design.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples extracted from pools of 5 embryos were amplified, labelled with Cy5 dye and hybridized with Cy3 dye labelled reference RNA pool on EMPV1 [GPL14925] microarray following a reference design. Three biological replicates from each group were included in the comparative microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL14925 Agilent-031068 EmbryoGene Porcine Array Version 1 (EMPV1)
