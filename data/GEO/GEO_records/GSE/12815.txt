TITLE
PI3K pathway activity in the normal airway of smokers with lung cancer, and in smokers with airway dysplasia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cytologically normal airway epithelial samples were collected during bronchoscopy of current and former smokers. Subjects enrolled in this study were either under suspicion of having lung cancer, had dysplasia in their airway, or were a healthy current, former or never smoker. We supplemented existing GEO series (GSE4115 and GSE7895) with the samples in this study to explore PI3K pathway activity in the these cohorts.

DESIGN
This study contains: 2 arrays from smokers with COPD (no lung cancer), 1 array from smoker without COPD (no lung cancer); 2 samples from patients with lung cancer, 2 samples from patients without lung cancer; 20 samples from 10 matched individuals with airway dysplasia before and after treatment with myo-inositol, 6 additional samples from individuals with airway dysplasia; 27 samples from mammary epithelial cells used in oncogenic pathway analysis that have either the PI3K pathway activated, the Np63 pathway activated, or are a GFP control.
