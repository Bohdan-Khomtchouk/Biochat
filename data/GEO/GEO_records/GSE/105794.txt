TITLE
miRNA expression data from adult mouse Prefrontal Cortex following high fat diet exposure (8 weeks, starting on PND28)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High-fat diet (HFD) feeding during adolescence induces robust impairments in prefrontal-dependent cognition. Moreover, it also provokes multiple changes at the cellular and synaptic scales within the mPFC, suggesting that major transcriptional events are elicited by HFD during this maturational period. While it has been speculated that the nature of this transcriptional reprogramming may involve epigenetic effects, such as microRNA expression, this question to date remains unanswered. Here, we addressed this issue by performing unbiased genome-wide transcriptional profiling of miRNAs in the mouse mPFC following adolescent HFD. We performed unbiased genome-wide transcriptional profiling of miRNAs in the mouse mPFC following adolescent HFD

DESIGN
C57BL/6N male where exposed to HFD or Low fat diet (LFD) for 8 weeks starting from PND28. (HFD:consisting of 60% of calories from fat; LFD 10% of calories from fat ). We then performed genome wide miRNA expression analyses, validations, behavioral analyses.
