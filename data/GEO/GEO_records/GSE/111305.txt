TITLE
GSF1243: RNA-seq data of adipocytes treated with DNMT1 inhibitor, guadecitabine (100nM), for 3 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer (OC) cells frequently metastasize to the omentum and adipocytes play a significant role in ovarian tumor progression. Therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant DNA methylation in ovarian tumors have shown promise in the clinic but the effects of epigenetic therapy on the tumor microenvironment are understudied. Here, we examined the effect of adipocytes on OC cell behavior in culture and impact of targeting DNA methylation in adipocytes on OC metastasis. The presence of adipocytes increased OC cell migration and invasion and proximal and direct co-culture of adipocytes .increased OC proliferation alone or after treatment with carboplatin. Treatment of adipocytes with hypomethylating agent guadecitabine decreased migration and invasion of OC cells towards adipocytes. Due to this result, we performed RNA-seq of adipocytes treated with DNMT1 inhibitor to analyze differential gene expression changes that occur in the adipocyte that may explain the above observation that hypomethylating agent treatment of adipocytes decrease migration and invasion.

DESIGN
In duplicate, subcutaneous, human, primary adipocytes (ATCC) were treated with DMSO control or guadecitabine (100nM, 3X daily) and on day 4, RNA was harvested from the adipocytes using the RNAEasy kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina #RS-122-2101) according to manufacter's protocol.
