TITLE
RNASeq to identify the in vitro molecular signature of Ox40 signaling in conjunction with TCR signaling in CD4 T cells from NZB/W F1 Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We've recently shown that we can accelerate disease in a model of SLE (the NZB/W F1 model) using an anti-Ox40 mAb treatment regimen. The disease acceleration is rapid (within 2 weeks) but its unclear, mechanistically, how Ox40 promotes disease. To that end we performed RNASeq on in vitro cultured CD4 T cells during Ox40 and TCR stimulation (in a reductionist setting) to understand how Ox40 signaling impacts cellular phenotype and function, including with and without TCR stimulation

DESIGN
RNASeq was performed on in vitro cultured CD4 T cells from the spleen of NZB/W F1 lupus prone mice, following anti-Ox40 mAb and anti-CD3/CD28 bead stimulation
