TITLE
Identification of conserved and species-specific microRNAs in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Camellia sinensis

SUMMARY
In this study, it is noticeable that 32 tea-specific miRNAs were confirmed on the base of genome survey, using deep sequencing and microarray hybridization, and many miRNAs might associate with secondary metabolites synthesis.

DESIGN
Leaves, buds and roots were collected

PLATFORM
GPL20107 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Camellia sinensis)
