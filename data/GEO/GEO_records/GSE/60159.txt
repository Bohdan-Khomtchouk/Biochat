TITLE
Expression data from primary human hepatic stellate cells treated with coated and uncoated ZnO nanoparticles, or ZnSO4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZnO nanoparticles can elicit a range of perturbed cell responses in vitro. The liver is a target for ZnO nanoparticle-, or Zn2+ released from ZnO nanoparticles-induced accumulation and/or impact in vitro and in vivo. The response of human hepatic stellate cells to ZnO nanoparticles has not yet been assessed. We aimed to determine whether the presence of surface coatings could protect human hepatic stellate cells from ZnO nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity.

DESIGN
Primary human hepatic stellate cells were treated with one of two types of uncoated ZnO nanoparticles (Z-COTE or Nanosun), two types of coated ZnO nanoparticles (HP1, MAX), a mass equivalent of ZnSO4, or were left untreated. After 24 h, RNA was isolated and processed for whole genome transcriptional profiling, comparing the expresson profiles of treated cells to the untreated controls. Each treatment was prepared in duplicate.
