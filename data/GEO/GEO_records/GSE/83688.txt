TITLE
Determination of key transcriptional changes in VhlF/FPbrm1F/FKsp-Cre kidney tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate whether transcriptional aberrations might be responsible for the formation of kidney tumors in VhlF/FPbrm1F/FKsp-Cre animals, RNA-Seq was performed on kidney tumors and age-matched WT renal cortices.

DESIGN
VhlF/FPbrm1F/FKsp-Cre kidney tumors were compared with the normal kidneys to determine the transcriptional outputs that may be important to cause tumors

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
