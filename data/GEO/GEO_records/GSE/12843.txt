TITLE
Comparative profiling of mRNA expression in human mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult adipose and lipoma tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from adult adipose tissues, and were shown to have ability to differentiate into multiple mesodermal lineages as well as non-mesodermal lineages. MSC had also been isolated from lipoma, and the lipoma-derived MSCs (LM6) showed very similar stem cell characteristics to adipose-derived MSCs (AM3). However, LM6 cells exhibited a higher cumulative population doubling levels as compared with AM3 cells. The expression profiles of both mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) from AM3 and LM6 cells were compared to find considerable similarities except that miRNAs miR-99a and miR-152 were abundantly expressed in AM3, but absent in LM6 cells. The abundantly differentially expressed genes HAS2, VNN1, SLC16A6 and COL11A1 in LM6 cells were shown to be targets of miRNAs miR-99a and/or miR-152. Several additional genes were also found to be targets of miRNAs miR-99a and miR-152, as well as let-7g, let-7i, miR-199a, mir-134 and miR-374. The highly up-regulated expression of miRNA target genes such as SLC16A6, COL11A1 and TRHDE, as well as several other genes such as sushi domain containing 2, keratin associated proteins and tumor necrosis factor family, may explain the higher proliferation potential in LM6 cells compared with AM3 cells.
