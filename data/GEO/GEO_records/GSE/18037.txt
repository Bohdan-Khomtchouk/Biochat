TITLE
Expression data from early response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the antimalarial drug quinine

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we used the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae to better understand quinineâ€™s mode of action and the mechanisms underlying the cell response to the drug. We performed a transcriptional profiling of the yeast response to a quinine concentration that exerted a very slight effect over cellular growth.

DESIGN
Four arrays, corresponding to two replicates of each condition under study, were analysed.
