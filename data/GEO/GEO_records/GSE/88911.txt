TITLE
Aberrant overexpression of TGF-β2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in adenomyosis with β-catenin activation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aberrant activation of TGF-β2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. We used microarrays to detail the machanism underlying aberrant activation of TGF-β2 in adenomyosis

DESIGN
Uteri of control and Mutant (Pgr cre/+ Ctnnb1f(ex3)/+) mice were selected at 4 weeks of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
