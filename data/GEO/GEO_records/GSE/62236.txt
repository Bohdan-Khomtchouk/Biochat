TITLE
Expression data from TAp73+/+ and TAp73-/- MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to analyse the gene expression differences between MEFs containing TAp73 or without TAp73, at basal levels in normal culture conditions, and upon treatment with hypoxia (by incubation in 1% oxygen) for 4 or 8 hrs. The analysis indicate that absence of TAp73 leads to changes in multiple cellular and biological processes.

DESIGN
TAp73-/- and Tap73+/+ MEFs that were untreated, or treated with hypoxia (in 1% oxygen)  for 4 and 8 hours were used for gene expression analysis
