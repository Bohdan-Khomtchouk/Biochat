TITLE
Diverse and specific gene expression responses to stresses in cultured human cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TT3 and TN are cell cycle time courses and should be centered or transformed before clustering or computing fourier scores.  The preferred method is SVD centering preceded by KNNImpute missing-value estimation, although mean-centering is a viable alternative.     Hela Heat 42 degrees time course has 2 zeroes (the second is labeled " Cold 25 degrees 0h " ).  Normalization is by centering or zero transformation (average 2 zeroes)  WI38 Crowding (1-3 days) was by plating cells at ~50%? confluence and allowing to age.  The zeroes are the same as for WI38 Heat Shock (there are 2)  Other time courses should be self-explanatory.  They have 1-4 zeroes each and can be treated either by centering or zero-transforming. WI38 Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
