TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infected mouse macrophage cells at 4, 24 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on mouse macrophage cells infected with HRSV

DESIGN
The HRSV infected mouse macrophage cells were harvested at 4 and 24 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host cell response to HRSV infection.
