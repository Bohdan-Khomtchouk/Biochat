TITLE
mRNA expression in parotid acinar cells during terminal differentiation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Terminal differentiation in parotid acini relies on sustained changes in gene expression during the first few postnatal weeks. Little is known about what drives these changes. Expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation. We used expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation.

DESIGN
laser capture microdissection was used to isolate acinar cells from the parotid at nine timepoints in triplicate (E18, E20, P0, P2, P5, P9, P15, P20, and P25). RNA was isolated, and applied to the affymetrix rat genome array 230.
