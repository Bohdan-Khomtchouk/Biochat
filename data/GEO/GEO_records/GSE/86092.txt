TITLE
Transcription factors enriched in tumor-associated enhancers in VHL-deficient ccRCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC. We profiled histone modifications from VHL-deficient ccRCC primary tumors and cell lines. We show that ccRCCs exhibit a pervasive gain of enhancers around hypoxic and metabolic transcriptional targets. Motif analysis using HOMER revealed significant enrichment of AP-1, ETS, NFĸB and HIFα in tumor enhancers. We generated ChIP-seq binding data for c-Jun, ETS1, NFĸB, and P300, a histone acetyltransferase, in 786-O cells. ChIP-seq profiles of HIF2α and HIF1β in 786-O were already generated previously (GSE34871)
