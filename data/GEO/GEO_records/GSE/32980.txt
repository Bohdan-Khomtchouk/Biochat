TITLE
Using tiling arrays to precisely detect DNA targets of THO in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Crosslinked DNA from wild type cells or from mutant of the THO complex was analyzed by tiling arrays to precisely detect DNA targets of THO in yeast.

DESIGN
DNA coming from SDS-washed DCF pellet and the supernatant SN2k of 2 strains were compared in the study, WT (W303) and mft1 delta (DLY224). The DNA of each condition (Pellet or Supernatant) was labeled either with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes and competitively hybridized on 244k agilent arrays. For each strain, the experiment was performed on 2 biological replicates, with dye swap.
