TITLE
VALIDATION STUDY TO VERIFY DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS FOR LUNG CANCER IN ENDOBRONCHIAL LINING FLUID

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated whether biomarker analysis in endobronchial epithelial lining fluid (ELF) collected by bronchoscopic microsampling may be useful for a definitive preoperative diagnosis. Therefore we compared ELF samples close to nodule and from the contralateral site from patients with malignant or benign diagnosis.

DESIGN
ELF samples have been derived from early stage NSCLC patients and controls. Wilcox Test was performed to identify differentially expressed genes associated to a malignant diagnosis. key words: disease subtype analysis
