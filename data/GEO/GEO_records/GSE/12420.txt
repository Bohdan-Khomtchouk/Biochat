TITLE
Gene profiling of heart atria in PI3K and Mst1 mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail genome-wide gene expression underlying cardiac myocyte pathologies and identified candidate genes and specific pathways affecting cardiac myopathies Keywords: transgenics, cardiac disease analysis

DESIGN
Mouse heart atria were dissected for RNA extraction and hybridisation on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to profile gene expression from the transgenic mouse models for non-transgenics (Ntg), dnPI3K (dominant negative for phosphoinositide 3-kinase), Mst1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) and dnPI3K-Mst1 (double mutant) mouse models with a combined background of C57BL/6/FVB/N inbred strains. Pathological insults on cardiac myocytes are investigated
