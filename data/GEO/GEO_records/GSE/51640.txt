TITLE
Recurrent inactivation of STAG2 in bladder cancer is not associated with aneuploidy [GPL6983]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAG2 is a novel UBC tumor suppressor acting through mechanisms that are different from its role to prevent aneuploidy

DESIGN
Gene copy number analyses of STAG2 in urinary bladder tumors. R values were extracted from beadstudio and normalised using the pounds method. Log R Ratios were calculated using an average value of R from 200 cases and controls from the Epicuro study. WaviCGH was used to generate copy number calls and log R ratios in the region of STAG2 on the X chromosome were also visualised manually to determine STAG2 loss.
