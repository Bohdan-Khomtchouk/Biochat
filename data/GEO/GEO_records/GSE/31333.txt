TITLE
Elucidation and validation of new targets of the global regulator PdhR in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
The pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator protein (PdhR) of Escherichia coli acts as a transcriptional regulator in a pyruvate dependent manner to control central metabolic fluxes. However, the complete PdhR regulon has not yet been uncovered. To achieve an extended understanding of its gene regulation network, we combined large-scale network inference and experimental verification of results obtained by a systems biology approach.
