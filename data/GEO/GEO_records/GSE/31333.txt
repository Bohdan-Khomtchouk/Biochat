TITLE
Elucidation and validation of new targets of the global regulator PdhR in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator protein (PdhR) of Escherichia coli acts as a transcriptional regulator in a pyruvate dependent manner to control central metabolic fluxes. However, the complete PdhR regulon has not yet been uncovered. To achieve an extended understanding of its gene regulation network, we combined large-scale network inference and experimental verification of results obtained by a systems biology approach.

DESIGN
We determined the gene expression of four different strains of E. coli on three different media. The four strains corresponded to the wild-type E. coli (LJ110), a PdhR knockout mutant (LJ110deltapdhR), a  strain carrying an empty plasmid (LJ110/pTM30) and a PdhR overexpression strain (LJ110/pTM30PdhRhis). These strains were cultivated on Luria-Bertani broth (LBo), standard phosphate minimal medium supplemented with acetate and standard phosphate minimal medium supplemented with pyruvate. We obtained an overall 24 microarray experiments from two replicates of each of these cultivations.
