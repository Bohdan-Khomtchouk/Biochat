TITLE
Gene expression profiling to identify uterine chicken proteins associated with the supply of minerals and potentially actives on the biomineralisation process during eggshell formation

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used a transcriptomic approach based on the comparison of the expression in the uterine tissue when an hard-shelled egg was in calcification (normal) versus uterine tissue collected after premature expulsion of the egg before mineralization has begun (expelled) to better appreciate which uterine chicken proteins are associated with the supply of minerals and potentially actives on the biomineralisation process during eggshell formation.

DESIGN
A total of 16 microarray slides were used for hybridization of the 8 uterine tissues collected when an hard-shelled egg was in calcification (normal), and mixed to the 8 uterine tissues collected after premature expulsion of the egg before mineralization has begun (expelled) were analysed, with an experimental design in dye swap (all the slides labeled with fluorophore Alexa 555 and with Alexa 647 for each condition).
