TITLE
C. elegans gene expression in response to Salmonella enterica infection and recovery by Tetracycline treatment

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
(Part 1) Gene expression profiles of C. elegans in response to a 120 hour S. enterica infection. Synchronized larval stage 1 (L1) animals were exposed to S. enterica SL1344 for 36, 72, 96, or 120 hours. As an uninfected control, synchronized L1 animals were exposed to E. coli OP50 for 36 hours. (Part 2) Gene expression profiles of C. elegans in response to Tetracycline-mediated recovery from 72 hour and 96 hour S. enterica infections. Synchronized L1 animals were exposed to S. enterica SL1344 for 72 hours and then shifted to E. coli HT115 plus Tetracycline plates for 24 hours to resolve the infection. Synchronized L1 animals were exposed to S. enterica SL1344 for 96 hours and then shifted to E. coli HT115 plus Tetracycline plates for 24 hours to resolve the infection.

DESIGN
Samples include 36 hours on OP50 (36hOP), 36 hours on SL1344 (36hSL), 72 hours on SL1344 (72hSL), 96 hours on SL1344 (96hSL), 120 hours on SL1344 (120hSL), 72 hours on SL1344 plus 24 hours on HT115-Tet (96hHT), 96 hours on SL1344 plus 24 hours on HT115-Tet (120hHT). Duplicate biological samples were included for each timepoint. 14 total samples. Agilent C. elegans expression microarray (GPL14144).
