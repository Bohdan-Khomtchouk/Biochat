TITLE
Expression data from undifferentiated human ES cell line, khES3 grown using complete, leucine or lysine deprived media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In undifferentiated human ES cells, 48hr Leucine deprivation (delta Leu) or Lysine deprivation (delta Lys) led to apoptosis. We used microarrays to detail the mollecular mechanism of cell-death caused by Leu, Lys deprivation in undifferentiated ES cells.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested at undifferentiated stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed gene expression profiles of undifferentiated khES3 cells cultured in complete (comple),Leu or Lys deprivation for 5 hr.
