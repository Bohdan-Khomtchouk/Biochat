TITLE
A genome-wide CRISPR screen in primary immune cells to dissect regulatory networks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We introduced genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 libraries into primary mouse dendritic cells (DCs) to identify genes that control the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key process in the host response to pathogens, mediated by the TLR4 pathway. We found many of the known regulators of TLR4 signaling, as well as dozens of previously unknown candidates that we validated.

DESIGN
We used stain base phenotype (staining for TNF) in order to search for negative and positive regulators of LPS response in differentiated BMDCs

PLATFORM
