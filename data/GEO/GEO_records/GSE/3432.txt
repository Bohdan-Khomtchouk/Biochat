TITLE
Murine ES Cells: Control vs. Triple-Fusion Transfected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells comparing control untreated ES cells with ES cells transfected with a pUb-fluc-mrfp-ttk triple fusion reporter gene. The latter makes ES visualization possible by FACS and single cell microscopy, high throughput bioluminescence imaging, and PET. Goal was to determine the effects of triple-fusion (TF) gene transfection on global ES gene expression. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, ES vs. TF-ES cells. Biological replicates: 4 control, 3 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
