TITLE
Genome-wide maps of c-Myc binding sites in myoblasts and myotubes

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
By applying ChIP-seq, we generated genome-wide maps of c-Myc in skeletal myoblasts and myotubes. We found that c-Myc binds to 19354 confident target with a large portion residing in the intergenic regions. In addition, c-Myc was found to regulate many loci. Further detailed study revealed that c-Myc can regulate some genes, miRNAs, and lincRNAs which are fucntional in skeletal myogenesis. In this study, we identified a c-Myc induced regulatory pathway in myogensis.

DESIGN
Examination of c-MYC targets in myoblasts versus myotubes
