TITLE
Splicing of polyA transcripts in Hep3B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in identifying novel splice junctions in Hep3B cells, especially in genes involved in cholesterol metabolism like HMGCR, so we sequenced polyA-tailed RNA from Hep3B cells.

DESIGN
1 polyA-selected RNA sample was sequenced from Hep3B cells

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
