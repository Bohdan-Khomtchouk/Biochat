TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Brucella abortus-infected mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of wild-type and STING knock-out mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) infected with Brucella abortus or transfected with Brucella abortus DNA. Genes whose expression are affected by Brucella abortus in a STING-dependent manner will be identified and signaling pathways regulated by STING will be elucidated.

DESIGN
Mouse BMDMs were infected with Brucella abortus or transfected with Brucella abortus DNA for 17 hours. Total RNA was extracted for array analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
