TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells overexpressing AK125393

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of RAD51, a crucial player in homologous recombination (HR) and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is dysregulated in human tumors, and can contribute to genomic instability and tumor progression. To further understand RAD51 regulation we functionally characterized a long non-coding (lnc) RNA, AK125393, dubbed TODRA (Transcribed in the Opposite Direction of RAD51), transcribed 69bp upstream to RAD51, in the opposite direction. TODRA overexpression in HeLa cells induced expression of TPIP, a member of the TPTE family which includes PTEN. Similar to PTEN, we found that TPIP co-activates E2F1 induction of RAD51.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transfected with either an empty vector or an AK1253893 minigene. RNA was extracted from duplicates of each experiment and hybridized to affymetrix microarray.
