TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in developing seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and C24

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to identify differentially expressed genes in developing seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana three different stages of seed development were analysed (9-10, 10-11 and 12-13 days after flower opening) for two Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, Col-0 and C24. For each stage and accession three biological replicates were analysed.

DESIGN
Expression data for the two accessions were compared for developing seeds of the same stage. For each of the accessions gene expression at the different developmental stages was also compared.
