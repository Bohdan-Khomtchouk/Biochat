TITLE
Investigating global transcript dynamics in mitotically arrested budding yeast cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcript dynamics in mitotic exit mutants in the S. cerevisiae BF264-15D strain background. We examined the extent to which periodic cell-cycle transcription persisted in cells arrested in anaphase with intermediate level of B-cyclins.

DESIGN
Early G1 cells were obtained by α-factor arrest at 25°C and then released at 37°C for time-series microarray. This study includes new samples and re-analyzed samples from GSE8799, GSE32974 and GSE49650.
