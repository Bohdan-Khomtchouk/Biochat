TITLE
Investigating global transcript dynamics in mitotically arrested budding yeast cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Transcript dynamics in mitotic exit mutants in the S. cerevisiae BF264-15D strain background. We examined the extent to which periodic cell-cycle transcription persisted in cells arrested in anaphase with intermediate level of B-cyclins.
