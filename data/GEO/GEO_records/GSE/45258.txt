TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of HT-29, MCF10A, and MDA-MB-436 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq data from HT-29 cells treated with IFN-Î³ for 24 hr, MCF10A cells, and MDA-MB-436 cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HT-29, MCF10A, and MDA-MB-436 were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000. All RNA sequencing data was generated by the Genomics Services Lab at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).
