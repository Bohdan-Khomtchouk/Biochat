TITLE
RNA helicase DDX21 coordinates transcription and noncoding RNA processing of the ribosomal pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DEAD-box RNA helicases are vital for the regulation of various aspects of the RNA life cycle, but the molecular underpinnings of their involvement, particularly in mammalian cells, remain poorly understood. Here we show that the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 can sense transcriptional status of both RNA Pol I and Pol II to control transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. We demonstrate that DDX21 widely associates with Pol I- and Pol II-transcribed genes and with diverse species of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs. Although broad, these molecular interactions, both at the chromatin and at the RNA level, exhibit a remarkable specificity for the ribosomal pathway. In the nucleolus, DDX21 occupies the transcribed rDNA locus, directly contacts both rRNA and snoRNAs and, as a functional component of the snoRNA ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, promotes modification of rRNA. In the nucleoplasm, DDX21 is incorporated into the 7SK snRNP complex, which facilitates DDX21 association with promoters of Pol II-transcribed genes encoding ribosomal proteins and snoRNAs. Promoter-bound DDX21 facilitates the release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP, enhancing productive Pol II elongation. Altogether, we present a unifying mechanism for the coordinated regulation of ribosomal genes across nuclear compartments, and provide first evidence implicating a mammalian RNA helicase in RNA modification and Pol II elongation control.
