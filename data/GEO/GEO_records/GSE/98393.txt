TITLE
Selective expression of long non-coding RNAs in a breast cancer cell progression model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs are emerging as key regulators of cancer cell activities. In this study, our goal was to perform a stringent profiling of breast cancer cell lines that represented a progression series. We used the MCF-10 series, which includes the normal-like MCF-10A, HRAS-transformed MCF-10AT1 (early-stage), and MCF-10CA1a (malignant). We have identified expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs within each cell type. From our analysis, we identified a lncRNA of interest, IGFL2-AS1, which was knocked down in the MCF-10AT1 for validation of function.
