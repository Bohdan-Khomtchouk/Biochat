TITLE
Transcriptome analysis  in primary fibroblasts from HOIL-1-deficient patients upon TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOIL-1 deficient disease is a new early onset fatal autosomal recessive human disorder charaterized by chronic auto-inflammation, recurrent invasive bacterial infections and progressive muscular amylopectinosis. We studied the effect of TNF-α  and IL-1β on transcriptional changes of primary fibroblasts from HOIL-1-, MYD88- and NEMO-deficient patients.

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts were obtained from HOIL-1, MYD88- and NEMO-deficient patients and healthy donors and stimulated with TNF-α  or IL-1β for 2 and 6 hours. RNA were extracted and globin reduced. Labeled cRNA were hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 Beadchips.
