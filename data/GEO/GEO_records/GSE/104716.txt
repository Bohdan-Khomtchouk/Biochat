TITLE
RNAseq of Burkholderia pseudomallei TctR mutant, a regulator of type VI secretion

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome of Burkholderia pseudomallei type VI secretion regulator TctR mutant grown in rich media compared to wild type.  The RNA-seq studies confirmed the role of TctR as a negative regulator of T6SS-2, a positive regulator of T6SS-6 and suggest a potential role in regulation of the T6SS-3 and T6SS-4 gene clusters.

DESIGN
To identify genes regulated by TctR, wild type and tctR mutant cells were grown in LB to log phase and the transcriptomes were compared between strains.
