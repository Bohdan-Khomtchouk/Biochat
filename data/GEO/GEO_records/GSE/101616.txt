TITLE
MicroRNAs clustered within the 14q32 locus are associated with endothelial damage and microparticle secretion in bicuspid aortic valve disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the miRNAs associated with endothelial microparticles in plasma, we have employed SurePrint G3 Human v16 miRNA 8x60K Microarray to determine miRNAs in plasma from healthy donors and bicuspid aortic valve patients. Expression of 7 miRNAs (let-7d, let-7g, miR-130a, miR-337, miR-409, miR-494 and miR-718) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming microarray results.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profile was measured in plasma of healthy individuals and BAV patients (n=36)
