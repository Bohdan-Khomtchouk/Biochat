TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of IL-10 treatment of wildtype and Ptpn1-/- knockout peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report here the deep sequencing of the mRNA from peritoneal exudate cells (macrophages) purified from wildtype or Ptpn1 (PTP1B) knockout mice, either treated or untreated with IL-10. In periotenal macrophages IL-10 activates the transcription factor STAT3 to execute and anti-inflammatory gene expression programme. The tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1 targets STAT3 for dephosphorylation and leads to the deactivation of STAT3. In this study we examined the role of PTP1B in controlling the normal homeostatic level phosphorylation of STAT3 by comparing the IL-10/STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory gene expression programme. We find that loss of PTP1B leads to an up-regulation of the activity of STAT3, both at the level of phosphorylation and also in enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory gene products.
