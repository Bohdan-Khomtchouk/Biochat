TITLE
Transcriptome profile of a murine renal bilateral ischemia reperfusion model 2 hours to 12 months post injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). To extend our understanding of renal repair, and its limits, we performed a detailed molecular characterization of a murine ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model for 12 months post injury. RNA-seq analysis highlights a cascade of temporal specific gene expression patterns related to tubular injury/repair, fibrosis, innate and adaptive immunity.

DESIGN
Murine renal bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) was performed on 10- to 12-week-old (25- 28g) C57Bl/6NCrl male mice (Charles River). The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mix (105 mg ketamine/kg; 10 mg xylazine/kg). The body temperature was maintained at 36.5~ 37Â°C throughout the procedure. Kidneys were exposed by a midline abdominal incision and both renal pedicles were clamped for 21 min using non-traumatic microaneurysm clips. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure except for clamping of the pedicles.  Cohorts of 3 to 4 biological replicates for injured, sham and uninjured kidneys were collected for RNA-seq at 10 different time points following IRI: 2, 4 hours; 1, 2, 3 days; 1, 2, 4 weeks; and 6, 12 months.
