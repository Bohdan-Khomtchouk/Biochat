TITLE
Adult epidermal Notch activity induces dermal accumulation of stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
K14NICDER transgenic and wildtype littermate mice were treated with 4OHT for 14 days to activate the transgene Epidermis and dermis preparations from Transgenic and Wild type mice plus whole skin

DESIGN
We sought to compare gene expression patterns in K14NICDER transgenic epidermis and dermis to wild type controls
