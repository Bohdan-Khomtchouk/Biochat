TITLE
Expression profiling in Williams-Beuren Syndrome patient fibroblast cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by aa 1.5 Mb microdeletion on human chromosome 7. Although the molecular cause of the disorder is well-established, little is known about the global impact of the deletion on gene expression. Here we profiled the transcriptomes of fibroblast cell lines from 8 young girls with WBS, and 9 sex- and age-matched control individuals Keywords: disease state analysis, gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Skin fibroblast of 8 WBS and 9 control individuals were obtained from the cell culture collections of the “Centre de Biotechnologie Cellulaire, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Debrousse”, Lyon, France. Appropriate informed consent was obtained for each sample by the physicians in charge. Human skin fibroblasts were grown in HAM F-10, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen). Total RNA was prepared using TriZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy Mini Columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
