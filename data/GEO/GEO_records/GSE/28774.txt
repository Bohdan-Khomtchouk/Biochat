ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis of elements that specify nucleosome positioning and occupancy, control domains of gene expression, induce repression of the X chromosome, guide mitotic segregation and genome duplication, govern homolog pairing and recombination during meiosis, and organize chromosome positioning within the nucleus.
