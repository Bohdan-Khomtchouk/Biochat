TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing Analysis Reveals the Regulation of the Hypopharyngeal Glands in the Honey Bee, Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptome sequencing has become the main methodology for analyzing the relationship between genes and characteristics of interests, particularly those associated with diseases and economic traits. Because of its functional superiority, commercial royal jelly (RJ) and its production are major areas of focus in the field of apiculture. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that many factors affect RJ output by activating or inhibiting various target genes and signaling pathways to augment their efficient replication. The coding sequences made available by the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium have permitted a pathway-based approach for investigating the development of the hypopharyngeal glands (HGs). In the present study, 3573941, 3562730, 3551541, 3524453, and 3615558 clean reads were obtained from the HGs of five full-sister honey bee samples using Solexa RNA sequencing technology. These reads were then assembled into 18378, 17785, 17065, 17105, and 17995 unigenes, respectively, and aligned to the DFCI Honey Bee Gene Index database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) data were also correlated with detailed morphological data for HGs acini. The results identify areas that warrant further study, including those that can be used to improve honey bee breeding techniques and help ensure stable yields of RJ with high quality traits.

DESIGN
The 5 samples at given time (d3, d6, d9, d12, d16 after adult worker bees emergence from the comb) are in the critical stage of the RJ secretion and HGs developments indicated (triggered) the further caste differentiation (worker bees and queen) and task switch (nurse bees and foragers). 30 pooled heads of each samples were
