TITLE
Expression data comparing chemoresistant (cisplatin and doxorubicin) hepatospheres and differentiated HCC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify candidate genes that are up-regulated in chemoresistant (cisplatin and doxorubicin) hepatospheres as compared with their differentiated counterparts Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus GeneChip 2.0

DESIGN
PLC/PRF/5 HCC cells were grown as spheroids and treated with cisplatin and doxorubicin combination. Differentiated counterparts were generated by addition of FBS in the spheroids and allowed to attach.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
