TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CD4+ T cells reveals imprint of BACH2 and IFNγ regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to profile over 70 transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells, a cell type crucial for Coeliac Disease CD pathogenesis, in both stimulated and resting samples from individuals with CD and unaffected controls The data gave us the opportunity to (i) compare gene expression between cases and controls; (ii) specifically assess whether genes that have been genetically associated with the disease were being DE; (iii) and also look for known and novel aspects of pathogenesis in the transcriptome of this specific cellular compartment.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on mRNA  extracted from the CD4+ T cells of 15 Coeliac patients and 11 Controls that had been stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, PMA and left unstimulated. In total we sequenced 74 transcriptome samples using 50bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq™ 2000.
