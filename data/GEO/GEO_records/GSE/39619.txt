SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Philip Cayting ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). The tracks show enrichment of RNA sequence tags mapped to the mouse genome generated by high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from enriched RNA that was obtained after depletion of ribosomal RNA. Pieces of cDNA, 300-350 nucleotides in length, were PCR amplified, adapter ligated, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
