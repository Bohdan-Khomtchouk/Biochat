TITLE
ChIP-chip of H3K9Ac in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: H3K9Ac at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM386138..GSM386146]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM386148..GSM386156]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila L1 larvae [GSM386158..GSM386166]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila L2 larvae [GSM386168..GSM386176]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Adult female Drosophila [GSM418290..GSM418298]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Adult male Drosophila [GSM442311..GSM442316]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM442317..GSM442325]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Adult male Drosophila - Set2 [GSM442326..GSM442334]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Pupae [GSM442335..GSM442343]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in L3 [GSM442344..GSM442352]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM442353..GSM442361]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM442362..GSM442370]: ChIP-chip of H3K9AC in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
