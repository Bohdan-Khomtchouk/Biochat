TITLE
HIV gp120 modulates the vaginal transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During sexual transmission of HIV-1 from male to female partners, the vagina is the initial site of contact with HIV infected semen. The mechanism of HIV traversing the CD4 negative multi-layered stratified squamous epithelial barrier of the vagina to infect sub-epithelial susceptible immune cells, is hitherto unknown. HIV gp120 binds to several host proteins on vaginal epithelial cells. To gain an insight into the physiologic changes that may occur in vaginal epithelial cells in response to interactions with HIV gp120, and obtain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which HIV breaches the vaginal epithelium, a global snap shot of gene expression profiles in the vaginal epithelial cell line Vk2/E6E7, treated with HIV gp120 was determined. The vaginal epithelial cell line Vk2/E6E7 was treated with HIV gp120 (83nM) for 24 hr, and Agilent one colour, microarrays were performed.
