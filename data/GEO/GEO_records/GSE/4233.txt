TITLE
Expression Profile of Signal Transduction Components in a Sugarcane Population Segregated for Sugar Content

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Sucrose is the major product of photosynthesis in many higher plants. It is transported from the source tissue through the phloem to various sink tissues to support plant growth, development and reproduction. Knowledge of the signal transduction pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism is limited. Genes involved in the regulation of sucrose synthesis and accumulation could be used as tools in the development of genetically manipulated plants with higher sucrose content or aid in breeding programs as molecular markers. Using the SUCEST (Sugarcane EST) database information and a microarray approach, the expression profiles of 1920 sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) genes encoding signal transduction elements, transcription factors and stress-related proteins were analyzed. In order to assess their involvement in sucrose metabolism, the expression profiles of individuals from a sugarcane population segregated for sugar content were compared. From a population of 500 F1 individuals, the seven with the highest and the seven with the lowest sugar contents were selected, pooled and profiled using cDNA microarrays. Twenty-four genes were identified as differentially expressed. Five of them were more expressed in the plants with the highest sugar contents and 19 in the plants with the lowest sugar contents. RNA-blot hybridization was used to validate the expression profiles obtained for individuals in each group. These genes were shown to have differential expression throughout the growing season and in the different tissues. Our data supports the view that sugar levels modulate a complex signal transduction network that seems to involve responses related to stress. Keywords: Segregated population
