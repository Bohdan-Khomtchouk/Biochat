TITLE
H9 hES cells vs. universal RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of human embryonic stem cell transcriptome with universal RNA pool (10 human cell lines) to reveal hES cell-specific gene expression. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from three replicate exponentially growing cultures of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (feeder-free, in MEF-conditioned medium). Human universal RNA was purchased from Stratagene.
