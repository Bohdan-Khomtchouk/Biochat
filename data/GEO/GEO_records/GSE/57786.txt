TITLE
Expression profiling of SMMC-7721 cells: stably expressing lncRNA-hPVT1 vs LV-Control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our present study, we found that lncRNA-hPVT1 could promote HCC cell proliferation. We want to know what were the target genes of   lncRNA-hPVT1. So we constructed the hPVT1-overexpressed SMMC-771 cells and observed the mRNA profile in hPVT1-overexpressed and control SMMC-771 cells.

DESIGN
lncRNA-hPVT1 induced transcriptional changes in SMMC-7721. Two-condition experiment, control (LV-Control) vs lncRNA-hPVT1 expression (LV-hPVT1 Clone2 ). Each has 3 biological repeats.
