TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy in yeast BY4741and a strain lacking MSN2 and MSN4 responding to 20 min treatment with 0.4mM H2O2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
Numerous factors have been implicated in regulating gene expression changes, including changes to nucleosome occupancy.  Here we followed dynamic changes to nucleosome occupancy, gene expression and DNA binding of the transcription factor Msn2p genome-wide in yeast cells responding to hydrogen peroxide and reveal new relationships between regulators of stress-dependent gene expression in yeast.

DESIGN
Nucleosome occupancy was measured in the S288c derivative BY4741 and a strain lacking MSN2 and MSN4. Nucleosomes were isolated from unstressed yeast and yeast treated for 20 min with 0.4mM H2O2.  Nucleosomal samples were compared in a 2-color, competitive hybridization to sheared genomic DNA.
