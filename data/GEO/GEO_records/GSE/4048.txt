TITLE
Pseudomonas putida expression profiles at different stress conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida

SUMMARY
The metabolically versatile Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 is the first Gram-negative soil bacterium certified as a biosafety strain and is being used for applications in agriculture, biotechnology and bioremediation. P. putida has to cope in its niche with numerous abiotic stresses. The stress response to 4Â°C, pH 4.5, 0.8 M urea or 45 mM sodium benzoate, respectively, was analyzed by the global mRNA expression profile and screening for stress-intolerant Tn5 transposon mutants. In total we identified 49 gene regions to be differentially expressed and 32 genes in 22 operons to be indispensable for growth during exposure to one or the other abiotic stresses. We propose that stress is sensed by the outer membrane proteins OmlA and FepA and the inner membrane constituents PtsP, PhoPQ and CbrAB. The metabolic response is regulated by the cyo operon, the RelA/SpoT modulon, PcnB and VacB that control mRNA stability and BipA that exerts transcript-specific translational control. The adaptation of the membrane barrier, the uptake of phosphate, the maintenance of intracellular pH and redox status and the translational control of metabolism are the indispensable key mechanisms of the P. putida stress response.
