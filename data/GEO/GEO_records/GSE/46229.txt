TITLE
Mouse spleen: wild type vs leukemic

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of mouse spleens comparing wild type spleens vs. spleens from mice having deletion of RBP-J in cells of the renin lineage which results in B-cell leukemia We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in wild type and the leukemic spleens which revealed upregulation of genes for cell cycle progression and B cell identity in the leukemic spleens.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: wild type vs leukemic; biological replicates: individual mice - 2 wild type, 2 mutant. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
