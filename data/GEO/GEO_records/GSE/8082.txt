TITLE
Rhodobacter sphaeroides salt stress response

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Two excessive NaCl concentrations (0.25%  and 1.5%) and two periods of treatment (7 min and 45 min) were used as moderate- and high-salt sress conditions at early and later stages of response, respectively. As a baseline, samples from cells grown on a standard SIS medium in the same growing system and same illumination were used. Keywords: time course and dose response

DESIGN
Cells were grown photosynthetically (10W/m2 illumination) in 60-ml tubes bubbled with 2% CO2, 98% N2. NaCl (dissolved in anoxic buffer) was added at OD600=0.4
