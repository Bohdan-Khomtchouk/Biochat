TITLE
Identification of Sox9/Pdx1-coregulated Genes During Pancreas Organogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox9/Pdx1 co-regulated target genes were identified by comparing gene expression in Sox9/Pdx1-double heterozygates versus Sox9- or Pdx1-  heterozygates pancreata using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Pdx1LacZko (herein designated Pdx1-/+) (Offield et al. 1996) and one Sox9 allele was conditionally deleted in the developing pancreas via recombination of a Sox9-flox allele (Kist et al., 2002) using the Foxa3-Cre transgene (Lee et al., 2005). Total RNA was isolated and pooled from dorsal pancreatic epithelia of e12.5 Sox9fl/+; Foxa3-Cre (Sox9 het),  Pdx1-/+ (Pdx1 het) versus Sox9fl/+; Foxa3-Cre; Pdx1-/+ (Sox9/Pdx1 double hets) littermates for three biological replicates
