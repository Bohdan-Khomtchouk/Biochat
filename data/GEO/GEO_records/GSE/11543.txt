TITLE
Microsatellite stable (n=38) and instable-high (n=13) human colorectal tumors assayed with Affymetrix HuGeneFL arrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA assays were performed on 51 samples of human colorectal tumors using Affymetrix HuGeneFL arrays containing 7129 probe-sets.  We compared 38 microsatelite stable (MSS) tumors with 13 microsatellite instable-high (MSI) tumors to form a list of genes differing between the two types.  In order to identify molecular signatures characterizing MSI tumors, we examined only MSI-high cancers and not MSI-low ones. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Human samples of 38 microsatellie stable and 13 microsatellite instable-high colorectal tumors, each from a separate patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HuGeneFL arrays, with 7129 probe-sets. A supplementary Excel file (Colon_HuFL_logs.xls) is attached below that gives the log-transformed probe-set values.  It also gives the p-values from T-tests comparing these values between MSS and MSI samples, as well as an estimated average fold-difference, for which the mathematical functions are explicitly given.
