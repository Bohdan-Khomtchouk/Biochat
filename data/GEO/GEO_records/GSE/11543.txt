TITLE
Microsatellite stable (n=38) and instable-high (n=13) human colorectal tumors assayed with Affymetrix HuGeneFL arrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA assays were performed on 51 samples of human colorectal tumors using Affymetrix HuGeneFL arrays containing 7129 probe-sets.  We compared 38 microsatelite stable (MSS) tumors with 13 microsatellite instable-high (MSI) tumors to form a list of genes differing between the two types.  In order to identify molecular signatures characterizing MSI tumors, we examined only MSI-high cancers and not MSI-low ones. Keywords: disease state analysis
