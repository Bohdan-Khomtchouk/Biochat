TITLE
Mild vs advanced liver fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to compare mild and advanced liver fibrosis gene expression profiling and to identify novel markers of fibrosis progression. By transcriptome analysis with a cDNA array virtually covering every transcript in liver, we compared transcript levels in mild (F1 Metavir score) and advanced (F4 Metavir score) fibrosis. A stringent selection identified a list of 16 transcripts which completely separated the 2 groups of patients (8 F1 and 8 F4). We report that dysregulations at the transcriptional level do exist between mild fibrosis (F1) and advanced fibrosis (F4). Keywords: fibrosis stage-dependent analysis

DESIGN
Fibrosis samples were analyzed for 16 patients : 8 mild fibrosis (F1-1 to F1-8) and 8 advanced fibrosis (F4-1 to F4-8). All data in the current study were obtained from 3 separate hybridizations per RNA sample.
