TITLE
microRNA data from mice hearts of 21 days post myocardial infarction versus sham control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNAs control cardiac remodeling post myocardial infarction, though the cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in mice hearts 21 days after ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) versus sham control.

DESIGN
Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Mice hearts 21 days after LAD (n=4) versus sham control were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA 4.0.
