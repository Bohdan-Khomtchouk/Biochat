TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow macrophages from a strain intercross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow macrophages were cultured from 16 week old apoE-deficient F2 mice from an AKRxDBA/2 intercross Gene expression profiling was performed using Affy 430v2 arrays, and 1967 informative SNP markers were genotyped for each mouse Supplementary file of SNP data attached below from ParAllele 5K mouse linkage panel Keywords: Genetic-genomic

DESIGN
Expression QTLs and sex effects on gene expression and eQTLs were determined
