TITLE
Expression data from adult Arabidopsis roots under 200uM cadmium (Cd) treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To massively identify genes that are up-regulated by Cd and in particular transporter genes which might transport peptides or oligopeptides.

DESIGN
Four week old  hydroponically-grown Col-0 plants were treated with/without 200uM Cd for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted from roots and subjected to hybridization with Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
