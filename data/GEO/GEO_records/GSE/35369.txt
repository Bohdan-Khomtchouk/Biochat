TITLE
Gene expression data and CDX1-binding sites in gastric epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the transcriptional targets of CDX1 underlying the metaplastic change, we explored genes affected by ectopic expression of CDX1 in gastric epithelial cells by combining expression microarray and ChIP-chip analyses.

DESIGN
CDX1-inducible MKN28 cells, which inducibly express Flag-tagged CDX1 with the use of a tetracycline-regulated Tet-Off System (Clontech), were established from MKN28 human gastric epithelial cells. CDX1-inducible MKN28 cells were cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of doxycycline (Clontech), a tetracycline analog. We then performed expression microarray and ChIP-chip analyses.
