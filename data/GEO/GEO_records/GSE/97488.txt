TITLE
Genome wide gene expression profile of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells after knock down of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our experiments, we showed that FAK regulates PDAC clonogenicity and selfrenewal. In order to evaluate the impact of FAK knockdown on the  transcriptomes of PDAC , we knocked down FAK in two PDAC cell lines and compared the gene expression signatures with the cancer stem cell (CSC)associated gene signatures by GSEA analysis. CCS related gene profile was inversely related with FAK-knockdown gene signature.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression pattern in two human PDAC cell lines after knock down of FAK by two distinct shRNAs. Each sample was duplicated. Scrambled hairpin expressing PDAC cells were used as control. Two distinct hairpins against FAK were used to down regulate FAK expression.
