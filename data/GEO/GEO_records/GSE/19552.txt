TITLE
Genes Differentially Expressed as a result of Candida albicans SC5314 exposure to 10b

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Azole resistance and varying degrees of cross-resistance to other members of the azole family in clinical isolates have been documented, which has necessitated additional and prolonged use of the antifungal agents available. 2-Amino-Nonyl-6-Methoxyl-Tetralin Muriate (10b), a novel chemical structural aminotetralin derivate, is synthesized as an antifungal agent and exibited strong antifungal activity. To further investigated the action mechanism, we used microarray analysis to investigate the genes expression profiles of C. albicans cells treated or untreated with 10b and found 957 genes were differentially expressed. Of them,457 showed a decrease in expression and 500 showed an increase in expression. 33 down-regulated genes were involved in glycolysis (e.g., PFK1, CDC19 and HXK2), fermentation (e.g., PDC11, ALD5 and ADH1) and respiratory electron transport chain (e.g., CBP3, COR1 and QCR8). 30 differentially expressed genes were found to relate to biofilm formation, filamentous or hyphal growth. It was noticed that striking up-regulation of SFL1 and marked down-regulation of YWP1 directly related to prevent C. albicans from changing its morphology from the yeast form to the hyphal. Two genes related to specifically hydrolyzing beta-1, 3 glucan (e.g., XOG1) and chitin (e.g., CHT1) were significantly increased. 40 overexpressed genes and 15 down-regulated genes were related to the lipid metabolic process. Of them, Eight were directly linked to ergosterol biosynthesis, including ERG2, ERG6 and ERG11. 99 genes related to translation were down-regulated following exposure to 10b, which account for 21.66% in down-regulated genes. This suggested that translation might be lower in SC5314 cells exposed to 10b than in control.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the control SC5314 cells and 10b-treated SC5314 cells were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 8k Candida albicans Genome Array Genechips, representing about 7925 characterized Candida albicans genes. Two independent experiments were conducted. Reference strain was control SC5314 cells and test strain was SC5314 cells treated with 10b.
