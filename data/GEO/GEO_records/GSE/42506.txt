TITLE
Morphine induced sepsis is mediated by abrogation of endotoxin tolerance through modulation of miR-146a, but not miR-155.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endotoxin/LPS tolerance is a tightly regulated phenomenon, which, during infection, prevents systemic hyper-inflammation. Here we report for the first time that morphine reversal of endotoxin tolerance resulting in persistent inflammation thus contributing to septicemia and septic shock. We further report that this regulation is mediated by LPS-induced down-regulation of microRNAs 146a and 155. However, only over-expression of miR-146a, but not miR-155 abrogates morphine mediated hyper-inflammation, while antagonizing miR-146a (but not miR-155) augments morphine mediated hyper-inflammation. Hence, miR-146a could be the potential therapeutic target for morphine-mediated abrogation of endotoxin tolerance.

DESIGN
All treatments done in vivo. Morphine implanted subcuteniously, LPS administered as intraperitoneal injection.
