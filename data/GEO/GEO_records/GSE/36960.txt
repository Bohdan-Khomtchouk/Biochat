TITLE
Streptococcus mutans UA159 vs. fabT mutant strain, pH5 vs. pH7

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the regulator FabT in S. mutans

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 4 replicate samples of S. mutans UA159 and MU1591 (âˆ†fabT) grown in continuous culture to steady-state pH values of 7 and 5.  RNA was labeled with Cy3.  For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cultures grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
GPL4339 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 10K v1 array designed primarily based on strain UA159
