TITLE
Expression profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer metastases of the lymph node and autopsy tissues [DASL HumanRef-v3 samples]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed an expression profiling study of 168 primary breast tumors, lymph node metastases, and autopsy samples of primary breast tumours and metastases to liver, chest wall, lymph node, lung, and spleen, as well as positive and negative RNA controls, with technical replicates, to assess quality control methodology and probe-level reproducibility of the Illumina DASL microarray assay.  The experiment included both Illumina DASL HumanRef-v3 and DASL HT-12; this series includes only the 120 HumanRef-v3 samples .

DESIGN
This series includes 120 samples in total: 19 autopsy tissues of the chest wall, liver, lymph nodes, lung, spleen, liver, and breast, 5 negative controls, 6 positive controls, and 90 lymph node metastases.
