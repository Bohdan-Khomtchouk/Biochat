TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing   Analysis of Wild Type and 53BP1-/- Transcriptomes in B lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Absence of 53BP1 influences the profile of DNA rearrangements in B lymphocytes.To determine whether the differences in translocation partner choice were due to differences in transcription, we compared the transcriptome of 53BP1 deficient and wild-type B cells by RNA-Seq and Polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

DESIGN
Analysis of total mRNA and PolII loading in the presence or absence of 53BP1 in activated B lymphocytes

PLATFORM
