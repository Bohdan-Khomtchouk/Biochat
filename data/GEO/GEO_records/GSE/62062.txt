TITLE
An RNAi screen probing signalling control of human embryonic stem cells establishes the cell cycle-regulated restriction of the exit from pluripotency (DNA damage checkpoint)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of S-phase arrest and replication checkpoint activation on differentiating hESCs at the gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that replication checkpoint activation prevents the exit from pluripotency in hESCs. Results provide important information of the response of hESCs to replication arrest, such as upregulation of genes involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and subsequent maintenance of pluripotency marker expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hESCs incubated in medium without bFGF and TGF-beta supplemented with either DMSO, Aphidicolin or Aphidicolin+AZD7762 for 0, 48 and 96 hours.

PLATFORM
