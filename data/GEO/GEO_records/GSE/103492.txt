TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Wnt3a-treated Wild Type, Lrp5KO , Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6KO osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling is a major regulator of osteoblast differentiation and function. To investigate how Wnt3a signaling regulates osteoblastic gene expression and to identify the role of Lrp5 and Lrp6 in mediating Wnt3a signaling in osteoblasts, neonatal calvarial osteoblasts isolated from C57Bl6 (WT) and osteoblasts lacking Lrp5 (Lrp5KO), Lrp6 (Lrp6KO) and, both Lrp5 and 6 (Lrp5/6KO) were treated with Wnt3a for 24 hours and gene expression changes were quantified by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis to identify Wnt3a regulated genes in Wild Type, Lrp5KO , Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6KO osteoblasts
