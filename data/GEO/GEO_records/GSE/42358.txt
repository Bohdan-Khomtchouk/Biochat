TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CD16/CD62L neutrophil subsets during human experimental endotoxemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During systemic inflammation, different neutrophil subsets are mobilized to the blood circulation. These neutrophil subsets can be distinguished from normal circulating neutrophils (CD16bright/CD62Lbright) based on either an immature CD16dim/CD62Lbright or a CD16bright/CD62Ldim phenotype. Interestingly, the latter neutrophil subset is known to suppress lymphocyte proliferation ex vivo, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We performed transcriptome analysis on the different neutrophil subsets to identify changes that are relevant for their functions. Neutrophil subsets were isolated by FACS sorting from the blood of healthy volunteers who were administered a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The transcriptome was determined by microarray. The mobilized neutrophil subsets were characterized by specific transcriptome profiles reflecting their phase in neutrophil lifespan. Interestingly, the CD16bright/CD62Ldim suppressive neutrophils showed an interferon-induced transcriptome profile. This was confirmed by stimulation of peripheral neutrophils with IFNgamma. These cells acquired the capacity to suppress lymphocyte proliferation through the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). These data demonstrate that the suppressive phenotype of the neutrophil subset is induced by IFNgamma. Specific stimulation of neutrophils might have a pivotal role in regulating lymphocyte-mediated inflammation and autoimmune disease.

DESIGN
After LPS infusion, blood was taken at t=0 and t=4 hours. Neutrophils were FACS sorted based on CD16 and CD62L expression. Gene expression of neutrophil subsets was assessed relative to t=0 as control.
