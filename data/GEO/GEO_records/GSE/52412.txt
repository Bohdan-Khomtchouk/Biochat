TITLE
TE-Array-- A high throughput tool to study transposon transcription

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TE-Array is a custom Agilent microarray that probes for transposable elements in both sense and antisense orientations in humans and mice. TE-Array was used to study expression levels of transposable elements (TE) in a panel of normal mouse tissues.

DESIGN
TE-Array comprises of 4 different custom Agilent 4X44K designs. These 4 different designs have probes for human sense orientation, human antisense orientation, mouse sense orientation and mouse antisense orientation transposable elements. These array designs were used to study the transposon abundance profile in 7 different mouse tissue samples, 2 mouse cell lines and 1 transposon transfected versus untransfected human cell line.
