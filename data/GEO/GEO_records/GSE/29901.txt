TITLE
Retinal whole genome microarray analysis after irradiated injury of intraorbital nerve in the monkey

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To obtain and analyze early retinal changes at molecular level at 24h after ipsilateral intraorbital nerve radiation injury by gamma knife surgery

DESIGN
Unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of three Rhesus Macaques were treated by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with irradiated doses of 15Gy, while the contralateral optic nerves and retinas served as the control. Gene expression profiles of control and affected retinas were analyzed with Affymetrix Rhesus Macaque Genome arrays at 24h after treatment
