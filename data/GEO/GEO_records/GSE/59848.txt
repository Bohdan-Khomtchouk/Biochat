TITLE
Expression data from Dicer WT and Dicer KO mouse CD4 T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptionnal level. To gain further insight into this process, we analysed by Affymetrix microarray, the transcriptome of Dicer WT or Dicer deleted mouse CD4 T cells.

DESIGN
Mouse CD4 T cells were sorted by flow cytometry from control CD4Cre neg Dicer lox/lox or CD4Cre pos Dicer lox/lox animals, total RNA was extracted using RNA bee and amplified before hybridization onto Mouse Gene arrays. Three biological replicate were analysed for each condition (3 Dicer WT control and 3 Dicer KO).
