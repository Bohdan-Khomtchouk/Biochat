TITLE
Efect of neonatal nutrition on adipose tissue remodeling genes during early development and in adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the phenomenon linking the early nutritional environment to disease susceptibility exists in many mammalian species, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that nutritional programming is a variable quantitative state of gene expression, fixed by the state of energy balance in the neonate, that waxes and wanes in the adult animal in response to changes in energy balance. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment, based upon global gene expression, to identify networks of genes in which expression patterns in inguinal fat of mice have been altered by the nutritional environment during early post-natal development. Gene expression patterns in inguinal fat was assessed at 5, 10, 21 days of age and as adults fed chow (56 days of age) followed by high fat diet for 8 weeks (112 days of age) for C57BL/6J mice reared by lactating dams fed either a control diet (CONT), lactating dams fed a diet in which food intake was restricted to cause under-nourishment (lactation under-nutrition; LUN); and, lactating dams fed a high fat diet in where the number of progeny was limited to four (lactation over-nutrition; LON) .

DESIGN
15 samples with 3 technical replicates of each sample. Each of the 15 samples consisted of pooled total RNA from 12 male mice. Dietary control samples are included for each time period.
