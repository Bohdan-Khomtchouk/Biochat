TITLE
Array CGH of Drosophila translocations on heterochromatin custom array-eu_het boundary.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
CGH analysis of translocations with breakpoints at the euchromatin/heterochromatin boundary.

DESIGN
Three translocations with breakpoint at the euchromatin/heterochromatin boundary of 2L, 3L and X, respectively, were analyzed by CGH to distinguish heterochromatic sequences from euchromatic sequences. X: 101042(T(1;Y)B91); 2L: 130186 (T(Y;2)R146); and 3L: 102004(T(2;3)H31). To obtain embryos lacking the euchromatin portion of the chromosome arms, translocation males bearing breakpoint at the euchromatin/heterochromatin boundary of 2L, 3L and X were crossed to C(2)EN, C(3)EN or attached X females, respectively. All embryos were collected at room temperature.
