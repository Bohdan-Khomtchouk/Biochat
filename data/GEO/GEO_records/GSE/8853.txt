TITLE
IL-13 involvement in eosinophilic esophagitis: transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
3 eosinophilic esophagitis biopsies, cultured and stimulated with IL-13 : each of them was either left unstimulated or stimulated (100ng for 48h) We used microarray to uncover the IL-13-induced genes in esophageal epithelial cells of the esophagus Keywords: treated vs non treated
