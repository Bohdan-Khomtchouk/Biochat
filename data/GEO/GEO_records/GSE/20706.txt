TITLE
Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 cytokines effect on epidermal keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured epidermal keratinocytes treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). IL-4 and IL-13 are up-regulated in atopic dermatitis. Results provide insight into the role of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  Analysis of epidermal keratinocytes transfected with dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) siRNA knockdown before treatment with IL-4 and IL-13. DUOX1 is one of the NOX family members of NADPH oxidases whose primary function is ROS generation. Results provide insight into the role of the incraesed expression of DUOX1 in IL-4/IL-13-treated NHEK for IL4/IL13 signaling.

DESIGN
IL-4 and IL-13 induced gene expression in human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) was measured at 48 hours. Gene expression in NHEK tranfected with 10 nM DUOX1 siRNA followed by treatment with 100 ng/ml IL-4 and 100 ng/ml IL-13 was measured at 48 hours. Three independent experiments were performed using different strains for each experiment.
