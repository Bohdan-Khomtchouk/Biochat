TITLE
WT and ENT3 KO MTA_2.0 Array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of liver from 6 Wildtype and 6 ENT3 knockout liver samples We utilised microarrays to understand the global gene expression in Wildtype and ENT3 knockout mice liver

DESIGN
We utilised age and gender matched mice (6 per group) for harvesting liver. Liver samples were utilised for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL20775 [MTA-1_0] Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0 [transcript (gene) CSV version]
