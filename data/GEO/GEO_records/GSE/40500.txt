TITLE
Expression data from endthelial cells in ductus arteriosus and aorta in rat fetuses or neonates

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Endothelial cells (Ecs) lining the blood vessels have been known to have a variety of functions and play a central role in homeostasis of the circulatory system. Since ductus arteriosus (DA) has unique characteristics comparing other vessels, we hypothesized that ECs were the primary target to investigate the molecular mechanisms of DA-specific vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling.

DESIGN
Using fluorescence activated cell sorter, we isolated ECs from pooled tissues from the DA or the aorta of Wistar rat fetuses on the 21st day of gestation (e21) or 30 minutes after birth (day0). We prepared 3 sets of ECs in each tissues and time points. We aimed to compare the gene profiles of DA and the aorta at each developmental stage.
