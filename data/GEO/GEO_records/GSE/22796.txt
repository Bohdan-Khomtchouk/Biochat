TITLE
Specific kinesin expression profiles associated with taxane resistance in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Breast cancer is a genetically heterogenous disease with subtypes differing in prognosis and chemosensitivity. The basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) molecular subtype is associated with poorer outcomes, but is more responsive to taxane-based chemotherapy. We evaluated the role of kinesins, motor proteins interacting with microtubules, in influencing taxane resistance. Experimental Design: Kinesin (KIF) expression was studied in one local dataset comprising all taxane resistant breast cancers in relation to taxane resistance. Data in the NCI-60 cell line dataset (GSE5846) nd the MDACC dataset (GSE20194) is separately detailed. Results: In the local dataset, the kinesin KIF26B is overexpressed in taxane-resistant residual breast cancers post-chemotherapy. Conclusions: We show that kinesin overexpression correlates with taxane resistance in BLBC cell lines and tissue. Our results suggest a potential approach to overcoming taxane resistance through concurrent or sequential use of kinesin inhibitors, highlighting the ATP-binding domain as a drug development target.
