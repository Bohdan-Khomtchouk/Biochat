TITLE
Identification of potential ABBV-075 responsive markers in human PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are modulated by BET inhibitors in blood, we determined global gene expression changes in ABBV-075-treated human PBMC samples

DESIGN
Freshly isolated human PBMC cells from 5 donors were treated with DMSO or 0.2 uM ABBV-75 (triplicates for each treatment).  Samples were collected 6 hours post treatment and subjected to total RNA extraction and miroarray analysis.
