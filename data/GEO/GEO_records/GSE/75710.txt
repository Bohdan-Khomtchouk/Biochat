TITLE
Gene microarray of human adipocytes exposed to medium conditioned by inflamed adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Omental adipose tissue explants were cultured for 24h in serum-free medium in the presence of vehicle (control medium) or macrophage (LPS) and T-cell (anti-CD3/28) stimulants (active medium). SGBS human preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes and then exposed to 25% v/v control or active medium.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from SGBS adipocytes that had been cultured for 24 hours or 48 hours in the presence of 25%v/v. Each active sample (Om) and control sample (StimOm) are from three repeat expreiments.
