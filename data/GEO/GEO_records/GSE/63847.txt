TITLE
AKT network of genes and impaired myocardial contractility during murine acute chagasic myocarditis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rationale: Chagasic disease is associated with high morbidity in Latin America. Acute Chagasic myocarditis is consistently found in acute infections but little is known about its contribution to chronic cardiomyopathy. The aim of the study was to phenotypically characterize two strains of mice with differential Chagas infection susceptibility and correlate strain myocarditis phenotypes with heart tissue gene expression. Methods: C57BL/6J and Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0 or 150-200 tissue-derived trypomastigotes (Tulahuen strain). Echocardiograms, brain natriuretic peptide and troponin were measured. Heart tissue was harvested for histopathological analysis and gene expression profiling on microarrays. Genes differently expressed between infected Balb/c and C57BL/6J were identified Results: Echocardiograms demonstrated differences in heart rate in Balb/c vs. C57BL/6J infected mice: 413 vs. 476 bpm, (p=0.0001), stroke volume: 31.9 ± 9.3 vs. 39.2 ± 5.5 µl (p=0.03); and cardiac output: 13.1 ± 3.5 vs. 18.7 ± 3.2 µl/min (p=0.002). Gene expression at 4 weeks analysis demonstrated 32 statistically significant (q-value < 0.05) differentially expressed genes between infected Balb/c and C57BL/6J which were enriched for genes related to protein kinase B (AKT) pathway

DESIGN
8 Balb/c mice and 8 C57BL/6J mice were infected and 8 Balb/c and 8 C57BL/6J were used as controls. 6 mice per group were used for gene expression analysis.
