TITLE
Candidate genes correlated with progression to androgen-resistant stage in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinomas are responsible for about 6% of overall cancer deaths in men. We used DNA microarrays to identify genes related to the transition between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent stages in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model of prostate adenocarcinoma. Keywords: Prostate cancer, cDNA array
