TITLE
Candidate genes correlated with progression to androgen-resistant stage in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinomas are responsible for about 6% of overall cancer deaths in men. We used DNA microarrays to identify genes related to the transition between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent stages in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model of prostate adenocarcinoma. Keywords: Prostate cancer, cDNA array

DESIGN
We used DNA microarrays to compare the mRNA expression profiles of ~1.000 selected genes between primary, HS, and HR tumors in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model of prostate carcinoma. RNA extracts were pooled according to the three distinct stages of tumor progression in the LuCaP 23.1 model (4 samples / tumor stage). DNA microarray hybridizations were done as previously described (14, 15) on home-made nylon DNA microarrays (TAGC, Marseille-Luminy, France), which contained spotted PCR products from 945 human cDNA clones. Most genes were selected for a proven or putative implication in cancer and/or in immune reactions (the list is available on the web site: http:/tagc.univ-mrs.fr/pub/Cancer/).
