TITLE
Caloric restriction suppresses apoptotic cell death in the mammalian cochlea and leads to prevention of presbycusis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Presbycusis is characterized by an age-related progressive decline of auditory function, and arises mainly from the degeneration of hair cells or spiral ganglion (SG) cells in the cochlea. Here we show that caloric restriction suppresses apoptotic cell death in the mouse cochlea and prevents late onset of presbycusis. Caloric restricted mice, which maintained body weight at the same level as that of young control (YC) mice, retained normal hearing and showed no cochlear degeneration. CR mice also showed significantly fewer TUNEL-positive staining cells and fewer cleaved caspase-3-positive staining cells relative to middle-age control (MC) mice. Microarray analysis revealed that CR down-regulated the expression of 28 proapoptotic genes, including Bak and Bim. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of critical cells through apoptosis is an important mechanism of presbycusis in mammals, and that CR or staying lean can retard this process by suppressing apoptosis in the inner ear tissue. Keywords: Effect of aging, effect of caloric restriction, time course, disease state analysis

DESIGN
To examine the effects of aging, a comparison of cochlea tissues from YC (3 samples) and MC (3 samples) mice was conducted. To examine the effects of calorie restriction (CR), a comparison of cochleae from MC (3 samples) and CR (3 samples) mice was conducted. We examined age-related changes in gene expression in the cochlea and calorie restriction-induced changes in gene expression in the cochlea. We pooled four cochleae from two mice for one sample and used three samples per group (n = 3). Quality control measures were not used. No replicates were done. Dye swap was not used.
