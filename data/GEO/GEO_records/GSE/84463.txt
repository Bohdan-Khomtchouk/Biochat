TITLE
Expression microarray analysis of RHOXF1 and RHOXF2 transfected HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The X-linked reproductive homeobox (RHOX) gene cluster encodes transcription factors displaying preferential expression in reproductive tissues. They have important roles in human male fertility based on phenotypic defects of Rhox-mutant mice and the finding that aberrant RHOX promoter methylation is strongly associated with abnormal human sperm parameters. The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanism of RHOX action in humans. Using genome-wide analysis, we investigated the identity of genes regulated by the known human RHOX transcription factors: RHOXF1 and RHOXF2/2B. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either RHOX expression (RHOXF1; RHOXF2) or an empty control vector. Afterwards, differently expressed genes were identified by microarray analysis after 24h and 48h of transfection. Thereby we could identify genes that are differently regulated in response to RHOX overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from RHOX (RHOXF1; RHOXF2) and control transfected HEK293 cells after 24h and 48h of transfection. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays were used to evaluate changes in mRNA expression in RHOX transfected samples compared to control transfected samples (analyzed in biological triplicates). Data were processed and analyzed using Affymetrix Gene Expression Console and Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console.
