TITLE
DNA topoisomerase IIbeta (topo IIbeta) regulates  gene expression in developing cerebellar granule cells (CGC)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression regulated by topo IIbeta.

DESIGN
We categorized the genes expressed in differentiating cerebellar neurons by analyzing the expression data on the basis of combination of two factors: induction during differentiation in vitro and susceptibility to a topo II-specific inhibitor, ICRF-193. The inhibitor not only inhibits the activity but also depletes the enzyme by selective degradation, practically knocking it down at the protein level. In addition, topo ΙΙbeta is the only target of topo II-specific inhibitors since these cells do not express topo IIalpha. raw data is missing
