TITLE
Xenopus egg small RNA associated with Y12 antibody

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
We examined in Xenopus tropicalis eggs piRNAs that are associated with Y12 antibody, which binds symmetrically methylated arginines that are present on diverse Piwi proteins. The goal of this experiment is to more deeply characterize the piRNA pool from adult Xenopus extracts, using the Illumina platform.

DESIGN
Sequencing of a cDNA library from small RNAs from the Y12 immunoprecipitate

PLATFORM
GPL9320 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis)
