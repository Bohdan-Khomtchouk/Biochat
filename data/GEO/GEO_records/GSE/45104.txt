TITLE
RNA Pol II (abcam).D.mel 3rd Instar Larvae Nuclei HP1b mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5616 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-chip. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: HP1b mutant(official name : Hp1b^16 genotype : Hp1b^16/Hp1b^16 outcross : n/a transgene : n/a tags : Transposon tag : GFP description : Allele of HP1b generated by imprecise excision of CB02849.  The 539bp deletion removes the Start codon and a large part of the Hp1b coding region. made_by : Nicole Riddle ); Developmental Stage: 3rd Instar Larvae; Genotype: Hp1b^16/Hp1b^16; Transgene: n/a;  NUMBER OF REPLICATES: 4;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Strain HP1b mutant(official name : Hp1b^16 genotype : Hp1b^16/Hp1b^16 outcross : n/a transgene : n/a tags : Transposon tag : GFP description : Allele of HP1b generated by imprecise excision of CB02849.  The 539bp deletion removes the Start codon and a large part of the Hp1b coding region. made_by : Nicole Riddle ); Antibody RNA Pol II (abcam) (target is PolII); Developmental Stage 3rd Instar Larvae
