TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in nine HMECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of nine breast HMECs samples (184AA3, 184AA2, 184AA4, 184A1, 184D, 184BE1, 184B5, 184B5ME, 184FMY2). The Illumina Infinium 850k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs in nine breast HMECs samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the nine samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 850k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
