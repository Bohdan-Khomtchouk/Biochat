TITLE
Small-RNA transcriptome sequencing of individual cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Several classes of small RNAs have been described, however to molecularly profile them require large numbers of cells. Here, we developed a method for single-cell small-RNA sequencing that we applied to na√Øve and primed human embryonic stem cells and to cancer cells. Single-cell profiling of microRNAs and fragments of tRNAs and snoRNAs revealed that, in particular, microRNAs have unrecognized potential to separate cell types and states.

DESIGN
Small-RNA transcriptome sequencing (Small-seq) is a method designed to capture all small RNAs at single cells
