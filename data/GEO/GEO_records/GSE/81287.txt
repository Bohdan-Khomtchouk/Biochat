TITLE
Small-RNA transcriptome sequencing of individual cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several classes of small RNAs have been described, however to molecularly profile them require large numbers of cells. Here, we developed a method for single-cell small-RNA sequencing that we applied to na√Øve and primed human embryonic stem cells and to cancer cells. Single-cell profiling of microRNAs and fragments of tRNAs and snoRNAs revealed that, in particular, microRNAs have unrecognized potential to separate cell types and states.

DESIGN
Small-RNA transcriptome sequencing (Small-seq) is a method designed to capture all small RNAs at single cells
