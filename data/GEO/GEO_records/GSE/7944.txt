TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus treated with berberine chloride

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an important human and animal pathogen, multiply resistant strains are increasingly widespread, new agents are needed for the treatment of S. aureus. Berberine chloride (BBR), a natural plant product, has potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. We employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChipsTM arrays to investigate the global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 treated with berberine chloride. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed for 45 minutes to berberine chloride at concentration of 64 µg/ml (1/2× MIC), 6 samples including 3 control samples are analyzed.
