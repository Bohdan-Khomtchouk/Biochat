TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of eight thousand epithelium cells from the mammary glands of adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial cells were isolated by FACS from the mammary glands of adult (10 week old) female mice. A basal subpopulation of the epithelial cells was also isolated. Freshly sorted cells were submitted to a 10X Genomics Chromium System for single cell capture. cDNA synthesis and library preparation was done according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer to achieve 75 bp paired-end reads.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling was completed for 4771 basal cells and 3302 total epithelial cells from 8 mice.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
