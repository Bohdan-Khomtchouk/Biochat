TITLE
aCGH for bile duct cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assays in bile duct cancer patients showed 984 CNVs in 306 CNV regions (CNVR) distributed throughout all 22 chromosomes. Bile duct cancer patients had a mean of 21.8 gains and 19.2 losses of genes, with an average of 35.9 CNVRs per patient. Frequent sites of gains were at chromosomes 22q11.22, 2p11.2-p.11.1, 14q32.33 and 17q12, whereas frequent sites of losses were at 19q12-q13.43.

DESIGN
Investigation of CNV in 24 bile duct cancer tissue samples
