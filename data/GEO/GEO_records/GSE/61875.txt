TITLE
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and c-Myc cooperate to promote hepatocarcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Double transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific expression of AEG-1 and c-Myc show aggressive HCC compared to single transgenics. Gene expression was analyzed to understand the molecular mechanism by which AEG-1 and c-Myc cooperate to promote hepatocarcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Livers were collected from na√Øve adult mice (3 mice/group). Total RNA was extrancted and subjected to RNA-Seq.
