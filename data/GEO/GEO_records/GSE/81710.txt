TITLE
HDAC6 overexpression effect on mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse ESCs overexpressing HDAC6. Histone deacetylase 6 (Hdac6) was discovered as a deacetylase of Î±-tubulin and functions in cell migration, immunity and resistance to virus infection in vitro. HDAC6 overexpression ESCs and control ESCs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays. Results provide insight into the role of HDAC6 in the mouse ESCs.

DESIGN
ESCs vs HDAC6-OE ESCs with 2 biological replicates
