TITLE
Expression data from untreated and DSS-treated Adamts12 WT and KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adamts12-deficient mice undergo more severe colitis than WT mice after induction with DSS. We used microarrays to determine the gene expression differences between Adamts12-deficient and WT mice during ulcerative colitis induced with DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)

DESIGN
Fragments of distal colon from DSS-treated (2% DSS during 7 days and 1 day of recovery) and untreated Adamts12-deficient and WT mice were obtained for RNA extraction and hybridiztion with Affymetrix microarrays
