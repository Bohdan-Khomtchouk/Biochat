TITLE
MicroRNA miR-92a-2 targets TFPI2 to ameliorate oxidative stress of the hypoxia neuron [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the differential expression mRNA profiles from the brain cortex of hypoxia and normaixa rats by silica microarray chip

DESIGN
The array consists of 9 samples. Samples 1-3 consist of total RNA from the brain cortex of hypoxia rats in simulation 7km altitude; Samples 4-6: total RNA from the brain cortex of hypoxia rats in simulation 3km altitude; samples7-9: total RNA from the brain cortex of normaixa rats in simulation sea level altitude

PLATFORM
GPL6101 Illumina ratRef-12 v1.0 expression beadchip
