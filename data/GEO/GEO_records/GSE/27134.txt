TITLE
DNA methylation data from human iPS cells, ES cells, cord blood, and keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation was studied to determine whether iPS cells retain epigenetic memory at loci associated with its tissue of origin. We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation in human iPS cells, ES cells, and somatic cells

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from human stem cells  and somatic cells and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
