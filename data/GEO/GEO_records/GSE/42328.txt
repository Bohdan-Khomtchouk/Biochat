TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of 53 human T-ALL samples collected in human clinical trial E2993 (Marks et al., 2009)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the prognostic relevance of transcriptional profiling in adult T-ALL, we analyzed a clinical series of 53 primary leukemia samples uniformly treated according to the ECOG E2993 protocol using gene expression oligonucleotide microarrays. Unsupervised analysis and consensus clustering of microarray gene expression data in this series revealed the presence of 2 stable gene expression clusters corresponding to early immature (n = 28) and cortical/mature (n = 25) adult T-ALLs respectively. Early immature T-ALLs show a gene expression signature related to hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors that was recently linked to a group of childhood T-ALLs with poor prognosis. Notably, univariate analysis in our patient series confirmed that early immature adult T-ALL is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival compared with cortical/mature adult T-ALL (P = 0.0197)
