TITLE
Transcriptome perturbation analysis from 16 hours APF Drosophila notum.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of genetic pertubations induced in Drosophila notum by the over-expression of the transcription factors Achaete, Asense, E(spl)m3-HLH and Senseless.

DESIGN
Transient over-expression of GFP (control), Achaete (Ac), Senseless (Sens), Asense (Ase) and E(spl)m3-HLH transcription factors in Drosophila notum using sca-Gal4, tub-Gal80ts. Transcription factorshave been over-expressed alone or in combinations. Three biological replicates were performed for each conditions.
