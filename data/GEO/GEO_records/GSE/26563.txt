TITLE
Gene expression profile of SYT-SSX2-expressing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignancy characterized by the presence of a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18) that results in the formation of a fusion protein SYT-SSX. Because it is believed that synovial sarcoma arises from mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells, we used human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to determine the changes in gene expression caused by this oncogene in untransformed MSCs.
