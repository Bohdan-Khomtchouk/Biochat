TITLE
Expression array analysis of the effects of vitamin D3 and mutp53

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wanted to examine the effect of vitamin D3 and endogenous mutant p53 expressed in SKBR3 cells on gene expression paterns. Expression microarray analysis was performed on SKBR3 cells without or with endogenous mutp53 knockdown, with or without 1a25-vitamin D3 treatment.

DESIGN
SKBR3 cells expressing p53R175H, transfected either with siRNA for p53 (p53i) or with control LacZ siRNA, 48h after transfection, three samples of each transfection were treated with 1a25(OH)2D3 (D3;100nM) for different time points; 8 houres, 20 hours and 50 hours. Cells were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
