TITLE
Expression data from Tet2-hypomorph (knockdown) and/or Ezh2-null Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PcG proteins form the polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) 1 and 2, functioning as transcriptional repressors through histone modifications. They have been implicated in the maintenance of self-renewing somatic and cancer stem cells. PcG genes have been characterized as tumor suppressor genes as exemplified by somatic inactivating mutations of EZH2, a gene encoding histone methyltransferase in PRC2, in myeloid malignancy. Mice deficient for Tet2 have been reported to recapitulate some aspects of myeloid malignancies. We evaluated the Ezh2-deficient mice and also tested the impact of concurrent depletion of Ezh2 and Tet2 on hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Purified LSK cells and GMPs from BM of recipient mice repopulated with wild-type, Tet2KD/KD, Ezh2-/- and Tet2KD/KDEzh2-/- fetal liver cells were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.
