TITLE
Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Identifies Type 1 Interferon Response Pathways in Active Tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome expression profiling on a cohort of TB patients. Tuberculosis patients above 15 years of age were recruited from an outpatient tuberculosis clinic in central Jakarta (Indonesia). Randomly selected control subjects with the same sex and age (+/-10%) were recruited from neighboring households, with first degree relatives excluded.

DESIGN
