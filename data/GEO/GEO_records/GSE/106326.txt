TITLE
Altered microRNA expression in sciatic nerve following injury in rat model (0d-14d)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to distinguish the miRNA expression differences among different time points in sciatic nerve after injury.

DESIGN
We generated proximal sciatic nerve (SN) tissues (0.5cm) at 0d, 1d, 4d, 7d and 14d after sciatic nerve resection.
