TITLE
Cancer cell lines as genetic models of their parent histology: analyses based on array comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor-derived cell lines are used as in vitro cancer models, but their ability to accurately reflect the phenotype and genotype of the parental histology remains questionable, given the prevalence of documented cell lineâ€“specific cytogenetic changes. We have addressed the issue of whether copy number alterations seen in tumor-derived cell lines reflect those observed in studies of fresh tissue by carrying out a meta-analysis of array-based comparative genomic hybridization data that considers both copy number alteration frequencies and the occurrence of cancer gene amplifications and homozygous deletions. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
