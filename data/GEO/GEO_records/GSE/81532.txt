TITLE
Diurnal transcriptome rhythms in mice with genetically ablated clock function in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male KO (Syt10-Cre/Cre x Bmal1-flox/-) and CON (Syt10-Cre/Cre x Bmal1-+/-) mice were entrained to 12h:12h light:dark conditions for two weeks and sacrificed at 4 different time points (CT1, 7, 13, 19) on the second day after release into constant darkness conditions. Total RNA was isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue biopsies and subjected to microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
3 mice were used at each time point, for both CON and MUT groups
