TITLE
LPS-induced and E. coli-induced gene expression in wildtype and MyD88-/- mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in wildtype and MyD88-/- C57BL/6J mouse macrophages treated with 10 ng/mL LPS for 2 hours versus media treated control macrophages, and, wildtype and MyD88-/- C57BL/6J mouse macrophages treated with live E. coli bacteria (log phase; 1 bact per 1 macrophage) for 2 hours versus media treated control macrophages. Cells from 4 mice of each geneotype were used and each individual provided its own control. Hybridizations of treated and control samples from each mouse were dye swap replicated. Wildtype macrophages treated with LPS vs control (GSM22617-GSM22623,GSM22625), MyD88-/- macrophages treated with LPS vs control (GSM22626-GSM22632), wldtype macrophages treated with E. coli vs control (GSM22633-GSM22640, and MyD88-/- macrophages treated with E. coli vs control (GSM22641-GSM22648).
