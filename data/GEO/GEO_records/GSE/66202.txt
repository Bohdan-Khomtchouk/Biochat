TITLE
Intrinsic age-dependent changes and cell-cell contacts regulate nephron progenitor lifespan

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To use single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of nephron progenitors in order to determine transcrptional differences as nephron progenitors age. Methods: Using a combination of FACS sorting and a Fluidigm Single-cell auto-prep system, we generated high-throughput RNA-SEQ data of nephron progenitors during development Results: Single cells transcriptome profiling of nephron progenitors  revealed  progressive age-dependent changes with heterogeneity increasing in older populations.

DESIGN
96-single cell transcriptomes were determined from nephron progenitors of e14.5, e18.5 and P0 using Cited1GFP transgenic animals
