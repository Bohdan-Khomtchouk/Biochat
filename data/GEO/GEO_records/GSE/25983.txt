Gene expression-based analysis of neural tube closure for the posterior neuropore

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Spina bifida is one of the most common and life threatening human congenital defects. Despite considerable effort and investigations, the causes and mechanisms underlying this malformation remain poorly characterized. In order to better understand pathogenesis of this abnormality, we conducted a microarray study to compare gene expression profiles between two mouse models, CLX-Splotch and Fkbp8Gt(neo),  that both have spina bifida. Results: To compare the gene expression profiles in these two mouse models we performed microarray analysis using Mouse Whole Genome CodeLink Bioarray. We compared the level of gene expression between wildtype and homozygous mutant embryos in Fkbp8Gt(neo) and CXL-Splotch separately. A total of 54 genes were determined to be differentially expressed (25 down, 29 up) in the posterior neural tube of Fkbp8Gt(neo) mice embryos; while 73 genes were differentially expressed (56 down, 17 up) in the CXL-Splotch mouse. The only two genes that showed decreased expression in both mutants were v-ski sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Ski) and Zic1, a transcription factor member of the zinc finger family. Interestingly, when Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed on all of the differentially expressed genes, there was a striking enrichment of genes associated with mesoderm development and central nervous system development in CLX-Splotch, whereas in Fkbp8Gt(neo) genes involved in dorsal/ventral pattern formation, cell fate specification, and positive regulation of cell differentiation were distinguished.
