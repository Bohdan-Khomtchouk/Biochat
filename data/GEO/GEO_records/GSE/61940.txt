TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridizaions of 3D7∆PfSir2a and NF54 compared to reference strain 3D7

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum ; Plasmodium falciparum NF54 ; Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum is achieved by transcriptional switching amongst polymorphic var genes, enforced by epigenetic modification of chromatin. Histone-modifying ‘sirtuin’ enzymes PfSir2a and PfSir2b have been implicated in this process. We examined the effect of genetic disruption of sirtuins on var gene expression. Comparative Genomic Hybridization profile indicate that loss of PfSir2a in 3D7 resulted in strikingly rearranged chromosomes.
