TITLE
Gene expression of RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS, IFG, 2MA, LPS PLUS IFG, and LPS PLUS 2MA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LPS plus IFG and LPS plus 2MA had non-additive effects on gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells Keywords: time course

DESIGN
total RNA from RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Interferon-gamma (IFG), 2-Methyl-thio-ATP (2MA), LPS PLUS IFG, and LPS PLUS 2MA vs total RNA from time_matched_control RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) cultured in media, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h time course with triplicates, with dyeSwap measurements on custom Ailgent Oligo arrays

PLATFORM
