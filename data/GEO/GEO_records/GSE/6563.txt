TITLE
Analysis of expression of genes regulated by DAF-19

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
By screening for genes possessing canonical X-box sequences in promoters of three Caenorhabditis species, namely C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei, we identified 93 genes (including known X-box regulated genes) that encode putative components of ciliated neurons in C. elegans and are subject to the same regulatory control. For many of these genes, restricted anatomical expression in ciliated cells was confirmed, and control of transcription by the ciliogenic DAF-19 RFX transcription factor was demonstrated by comparative transcriptional profiling of daf-19(+) and daf-19(-) animals. Keywords: Microarry analysis; DAF-19; X-box motif; C. elegans; transcription; comparative genomics
