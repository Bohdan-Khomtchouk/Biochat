TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in TGF-β1-knock down mice CT26 colorectal cancer cell lines vs controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TGF-β1-regulated miRNAs in the progression of colorectal cancer,we performed comprehensive miRMA microarray analysis on RNA derived from CT26 cell lines and TGF-β1 knock-down  CT26 cell lines. We identified a novel set of TGF-β1-related miRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from TGF-β1-knock down CT26 cell lines and controls.Three-condition experiment: Locked nucleic acid microarray analyses to obtain miRNA expression profiles independently in TGFβ1-knocked down CT26 and control cell line at three different time (24hours, 48hours and 72hours).Biological replicates: 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo for 24hours, 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo for 48hours, 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo for 72hours, 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo for 24hours, 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA- Control- pSUPER gfp-neo for 48hours, 1 CT26 cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo for 72hours, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
