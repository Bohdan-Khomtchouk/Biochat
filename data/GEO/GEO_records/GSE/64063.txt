TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of WT1-controlled gene expression in podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified binding sites of the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1 in the mouse podocyte genome in vivo by ChIP-seq. Furthermore, we provide a podocyte transcriptome derived from primary podocytes that were isolated by FACS on mouse glomeruli. In short, we show that WT1 activates a highly specific podocyte transcriptome by binding to putative podocyte-specific enhancers and TSS of target genes. Genes bound by WT1 in podocytes include the majority of genes mutated in hereditary podocytopathies as well as components of the slit diaphragm, actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and within endocytosis pathways. Furthermore, we infer a podocyte TF network from DNA-binding motifs enriched at WT1-bound loci that includes Tead, Lmx1b, Mafb, Tcf21, and Fox-class transcription factors.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factor binding sites for WT1 by ChIP-seq. Transcriptome analysis of podocytes by RNA-seq.
