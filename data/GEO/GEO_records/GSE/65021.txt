TITLE
Gene expression profile in relapsed or metastatic HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab and platinum therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
First line chemotherapy with  platinum and cetuximab is usually offered to RM-HNSCC pts. In the Extreme trial a median progression free survival (PFS) time of 5.6 months was reported. However, a small fraction of pts achieves a prolonged PFS ( > than 12 months). Till now, no recognized predictive biological factor has been identified.

DESIGN
A group of 14 cases treated with a first line platinum and cetuximab with a PFS exceeding 12 months (long PFS) and a group of 26 pts with a PFS less than 5.6 months (short PFS) were selected. The 2 groups were well balanced in regard to recognized prognostic factors (performance status, weight loss, prior radiotherapy, tumor grade, site of primary tumor, residual disease at primary tumor site).  Tumor specimens of the recurrence or, if not available, of the primary tumor were collected. In order to identify molecular profiles deregulated between the 2 groups, a gene expression microarray analysis was performed using the Whole-Genome DASL assay and HumanHT-12_v4 BeadArray chips (lllumina). Gender: male=0; female=1. Age: years at diagnosis Site of primary: oral cavity=0; oropharynx=1; hypopharynx=2; larynx=3. Stage of T at first diagnosis according to AJCC 8th edition Grading  according to WHO: well differentiated=1; moderately differentiated=2; scarcely differentiated=3. Radiotherapy (RT) prior to recurrence: No=0; Yes=1. Progression Free Survival (PFS): Long ( > 12 months); Short( < 5 months).
