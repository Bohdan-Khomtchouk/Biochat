TITLE
Expression analysis of phenol degradation in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Ferroglobus placidus

ORGANISM
Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Ferroglobus placidus grown on phenol versus acetate as electron donors, with ferric citrate as electron acceptor.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown with 0.5 mM phenol and three separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown on 10 mM acetate.  Each chip measures the expression level of 2613 genes from Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 with nine 45-60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
