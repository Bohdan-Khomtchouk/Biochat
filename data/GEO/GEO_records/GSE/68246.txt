TITLE
miRNA transcriptome profiling of spheroid-enriched cells with cancer stem cell properties in human breast MCF-7 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intro: Spheroid culture especially on MCF-7 cell has been used as in vitro CSC model for anti-CSC drug discovery. The role of miRNAs in the regulation of mRNA specifically looking at the self-renewal capacity and the drug resistance of the spheroid-enriched CSCs models has not been evaluated. Therefore, a comprehensive profiling of the miRNAs will provide an insight into the regulatory mechanisms associated with breast cancer and CSCs. Methods: Tumour spheroid of MCF-7 was generated and characterised for the biological features and CSCs characteristic comparing to the monolayer parental MCF-7 cells. Differential expression of miRNA between the spheroid and parental cells was evaluated using next generation sequencing (NGS). The differentially expressed miRNAs were then subjected to target genes predictions, followed pathway analyses to better understand the mechanism associated with spheroid-enriched CSCs. Results: Spheroids generated from MCF-7 cell line under serum-free condition were found to be enriched with CSCs characteristics. miRNA-NGS analysis revealed 119 differentially expressed miRNAs between the spheroids and parental, with 24 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated. The gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the predicted genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in various biological processes. Pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes were associated with a variety of KEGG pathways, which could explain the self-renewal capability, and the higher drug resistance in spheroids when compared to parental.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of MCF-7 enriched CSCs spheroids and monolayer cultures were generated in triplicates by deep sequencing using TruSeq small RNA illumina
