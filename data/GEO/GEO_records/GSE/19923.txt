TITLE
Expression data from E protein deficient double-positive (DP) thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to test the role of mammalian E proteins E2A and HEB in the development of T cells. Using a conditional deletion system in which these proteins are deleted at the DP stage of T cell development, we compared DP thymocytes deficient for E2A, HEB or both to wild-type thymocytes

DESIGN
We sorted DP thymocytes from wild-type, E2A-deficient, HEB-deficient or E2A/HEB-deficient mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Cells we sorted using fluorescent activated cell sorting and purity was verified as greater that 98%. Approximately 1000000 cells were sorted per sample.
