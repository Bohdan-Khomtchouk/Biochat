TITLE
SaOS-2 transfected with CD99 in differentiation medium for 14 days [total RNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the transcriptional modification induced by CD99 transfection in the osteosarcoma cell lines SaOS-2 after 0, 7 and 14 days in differentiation medium.

DESIGN
SaOS-2 cell lines transfected with CD99 molecule (Sa/CD99) were compared with parental SaOS-2. Cell lines were maintained in differentiation medium for 14 days. RNA was extracted at days 0, 7 and 14.
