TITLE
Expression data from knockdown of UGT8 in MDA-MB231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UGT8 is the first key enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of galactose to ceramide for the synthesis of galactosylceramide.  We used microarray analysis to identify the genes that are regulated by UGT8 in MDA-MB231 cells.

DESIGN
UGT8 expression was stably knocked-down in MDA-MB231 cells. RNA from this clone and parental (control) cells were purified for microarray analysis.
