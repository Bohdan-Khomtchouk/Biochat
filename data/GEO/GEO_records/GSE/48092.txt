Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A fundamental question in developmental biology is whether there are mechanisms to detect stem cells with mutations that although do not adversely affect their viability, would compromise their ability to contribute to further development. Here we show that cell competition is a novel mechanism regulating the fitness of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that ESCs displaying defective BMP signalling, defective autophagy or are tetraploid are eliminated at the onset of differentiation by wild-type cells. This elimination occurs in an apoptotic dependent manner and is mediated by secreted factors. Furthermore, during this process we find that establishment of differential cMyc levels is critical and that cMyc over-expression is sufficient to induce competitive behaviour in ESCs. Cell competition is therefore a process that allows recognition and elimination of defective cells during the early stages of development and is likely to play important roles in tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of Bmpr1a-/- and control embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the ESC state and after differentiation in N2B27
