TITLE
Integrated analyses of high throughput sequencing on the regulatory mechanism of abscisic acid in strawberry fruit ripening

ORGANISM
Fragaria x ananassa

SUMMARY
By employing the high-throughput sequencing technology, we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptomic and miRNA expression profiles simultaneously in ABA- and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, an ABA biosynthesis blocker)-treated strawberry fruits with a temporal resolution. The miRNAs target genes were validated by degradome sequencing.

DESIGN
Sample 1: CK0.1, CK0.2 (Strawberry fruit two weeks after athesis treated with distilled water, set as day 0); Sample 2: CK5.1, CK5.2 (fruit treated with water, samples collected 5 days later after the treatment); Sample 3: CK8.1, CK8.2 (fruit treated with water, samples collected 8 days later after the treatment); Sample 4: ABA5.1, ABA5.2 (fruit treated with ABA, samples collected 5 days later after the treatment); Sample 5: ABA8.1, ABA8.2 (fruit treated with ABA, samples collected 8 days later after the treatment); Sample 6: NDGA5.1, NDGA5.2 (fruit treated with NDGA, samples collected 5 days later after the treatment); Sample 7: NDGA8.1, NDGA8.2 (fruit treated with NDGA, samples collected 8 days later after the treatment).
