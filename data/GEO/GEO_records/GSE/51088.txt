TITLE
Ovarian Tumor Samples: mixed reference of 106 pooled ovarian samples vs.  individual patient ovarian sample

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify molecular subgroups that might predict clinical outcomes in serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients.  A second objective was to identify potential therapeutic targets for serous EOC based on improved understanding of the molecular diversity of the disease.  Ovarian tissues and matched peripheral blood samples were prospectively obtained from sequential patients undergoing planned gynecologic surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between 1989 and 2005. All patients underwent surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy with a contemporaneous standard-of-care regimen.

DESIGN
Ovarian tissue samples (n=172) were compared to a reference pool of 106 ovarian samples. Mixed reference includes normal, benign, borderline, and malignant samples.
