TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of microRNA expression profiles in mouse primary CFU-E late erythroid progenitors and Ter119+ mature erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq technology, we quantitatively determined the expression profile of microRNAs during mouse terminal erythroid differentiation. CFU-E erythroid progenitors were isolated from E14.5 fetal liver as the Ter119, B220, Mac-1, CD3 and Gr-1 negative, C-Kit positive and 20% high CD71 population. Mature Ter119+ erythroblasts were isolated from E14.5 fetal liver as C-Kit negative and Ter119 positive population. Consistent with nuclear condensation and global gene expression shut down during terminal erythroid differentiation, we found that the majority of microRNAs are downregulated in more mature Ter119+ erythroblasts compared with CFU-E erythroid progenitors.
