TITLE
Expression data from early zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In the early zebrafish embryo, the developing genome profile can be interfered with by exposure to pentachlorophenol, and some specific sets of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were selected at successive stages of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected embryos exposed to 20 ug/L pentachlorophenol (C1), 50 ug/L pentachlorophenol (C2),  and deionized water control (C3) at the gastrula stage (about 8hpf).
