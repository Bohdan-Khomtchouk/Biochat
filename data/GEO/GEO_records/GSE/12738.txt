TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to a low concentration of Azithromycin

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Low-dose macrolides are effective therapy in patients with chronic lung infections, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. We compared global gene expression profiles between P.aeruginosa with and without low-dose Azithromycin (AZM) to study why the low-dose macrolide therapy is effective for cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Keywords: dose-response

DESIGN
Overnight culture of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was inoculated at 1:100 into fresh LB medium. Various concentrations of AZM (0, 0.5, 2 ug/ml) were added to th culture media. Cells were collected 9 hours after the addition of AZM, and total RNA was isolated for DNA microarray experiments.
