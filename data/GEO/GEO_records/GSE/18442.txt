TITLE
Aortic arch profiling of Ldlr knockout mice with human CETP transgene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aortic arch profiling of Ldlr-/- huCETP transgenic mice fed a low fat, cholesterol-containing western diet (LFWD, 9% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) starting at 8 weeks of age for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks.

DESIGN
Ldlr-/- huCETP transgenic mice were fed a low fat, cholesterol-containing western diet (LFWD, 9% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) starting at 8 weeks of age for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks (Supplementary Figure 1). At each time point, 10 mice were studied. Mice were euthanized at each time point and the aortic arch of each mouse was immediately collected and flash-frozen in liquid N2.   Mice were fasted overnight prior to euthanasia.  the aortic arches of 10 mice in the same study group were pooled for profiling, resulting in one pool per study group. Tissues were homogenized and total RNA was extracted. The control RNA pool was composed of equal aliquots of RNA derived from the 4 pools (40 samples) from the LFWD 4-, 8-, 12- and 16-week time points.
