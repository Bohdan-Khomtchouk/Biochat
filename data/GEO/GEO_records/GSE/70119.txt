TITLE
Hepatic gene expression profiling in AHNAK KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify molecular mechanism underlying the protection from diet-induced hepatic steatosis in AHNAK deficiency mice, we examined microarray analysis with liver sample from HFD-fed AHNAK KO and WT mice.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, regular chow (CD) -fed WT vs. CD-fed AHNAK KO and High fat diet(HFD)-fed WT vs. HFD-fed AHNAK KO mice.  Biological replicates: 3 control,  One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
