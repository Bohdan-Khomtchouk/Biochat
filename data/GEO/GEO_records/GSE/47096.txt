TITLE
The effect on gene expression by p53 family members and the knockdown of AKR1B10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect on gene expression by p53 family members and AKR1B10, we overexpressed p53 family members in H1299 cells or knocked down AKR1B10 in HCT116 cells and evaluated the gene expression by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in H1299 cells infected with adenovirus expressing p53, p63g and p73b, and in HCT116 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting AKR1B10 and then treated with adriamycin.
