TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profiling of rice Indica cultivar Zhongxian 3037 and mutant phoenix (pho) panicle

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
phoenix (pho) is a naturally occurring rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant that exhibits stable inflorescence reversion. Genetic analysis showed that it was not a simple mendelian mutant. In order to find the major genes contributed to the formation of pho, microarray experiments were carried out to analyze and compare the transcriptional profiles between pho and wild-type panicles.

DESIGN
We generated gene expression profiles of rice Indica cultivar Zhongxian 3037 and mutant phoenix (pho) by using 57K Affymetrix rice whole genome array.
