TITLE
Assessing age-dependent effects of vhp-1 knock-down on gene expression

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Different strains of C.elegans exposed to control or vhp-1 RNAi during development or adulthood

DESIGN
12 conditions:  C. elegans, N2, kgb-1(km21), or daf-16(mu86);pmk-1(km25) exposed to control or vhp-1 RNAi during development (egg) or adulthood (L4) 2-color arrrays, each sample co-hybridized with the same reference RNA sample from mixed stage C.elegans cultures Each condition includes 3 biological replicates with the exception of all daf-16(mu86);pmk-1(km25) conditions (2 biologial replicates) and kgb-1(km21) control RNAi_L4 which includes 4 biological replicates
