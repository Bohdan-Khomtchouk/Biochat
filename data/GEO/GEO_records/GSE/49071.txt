TITLE
The role of Dichaete in transcriptional regulation the of Drosophila midline [prosGal4]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dichaete is a developmentally important transcription factor, known to be involved in basic biological processes including segmentation and nervous system development among others. The aim of this experiment was to gain further insight into the role of Dichaete during early embryogenesis, specifically looking at targets in the midline using dominant negative constructs expressed via the UAS/Gal4 system, using prosGal4 to drive expression in developing neuroblasts.

DESIGN
4 independent biological replicates. 3.5-4.5h old embryos were collected, and the RNA was extracted using Trizol. The UAS-dominant negative construct expressing embryos were compared to UAS-GFP expressing controls. Construct expression was driven using prosGal4.
