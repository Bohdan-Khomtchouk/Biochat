TITLE
Gene expression profile of Candida albicans in response to murine IL17A

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional profiling revealed that IL-17A induced artificial nutrient starvation conditions in Candida albicans, resulting in a downregulated target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway and in increased autophagic responses and intracellular cAMP.

DESIGN
We used microarray to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying IL17A sensing by Candida albicans at different time points (T0_0h T1_4h, T2_24h) and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down regulated genes.
