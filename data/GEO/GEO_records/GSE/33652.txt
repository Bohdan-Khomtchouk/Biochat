TITLE
Analysing of Chromosome VIII of EC9-7 after experimental evolution (S. cerevisiae)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The genomic DNA of wild-type chromosome VIII of evolved EC9-7 cells was extracted from the gel of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and analyzed by array-CGH to identify its  chromosomal composition

DESIGN
Yeast genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 100/G kit. After PFGE, The ChrVIII DNA was purified from agarose gel and purified by column. Then the DNA was amplified by GenomePlex Whole Genome Amplification Kit.
