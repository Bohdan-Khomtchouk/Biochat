TITLE
RNA polymerase binding sites revealed by ChIP-chip in S. Typhimurium wild-type, ΔrelAΔspoT (ppGpp0), and ΔdksA strains at early stationary phase (ESP) and late stationary phase (LSP)

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
S. Typhimurium parent, ppGpp0 and dksA strains were grown to OD's of 2.3 (ESP) and 4.2 (LSP) and subjected to ChIP-chip analysis at 60 nt resolution.

DESIGN
38 samples (parent strain, ΔrelAΔspoT, ΔdksA grown to ESP or LSP, protein-DNA crosslinked and fragments immunoprecipitated with Ab against E.coli RNAP beta subunit (Neoclone, cat # WP023), or minus Ab as control. DNA fragments purified & labelled with dCTP-Cy5 and hybridised against Cy3-dCTP labelled gDNA on OGT 4 x 44K 60 mer S. Typhimurium SL1344 array).

PLATFORM
GPL19472 Oxford Gene Technology 4x44K S. Typhimurium SL1344 60-mer oligonucleotide array
