TITLE
Expression profiles of prognostic 32-gene liver signature in surgically resected Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cirrhosis is a milieu that develops hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the second most lethal cancer worldwide. HCC prediction and prevention in cirrhosis are key unmet medical needs. Here we have established an HCC risk gene signature applicable to all major HCC etiologies: hepatitis B/C, alcohol, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. A transcriptome meta-analysis of > 500 human cirrhotics revealed global regulatory gene modules driving HCC risk and lysophosphatidic acid pathway as a central chemoprevention target. Pharmacological inhibition of the pathway in vivo reduced tumors and reversed the gene signature, which was verified in organotypic ex vivo culture of patient-derived fibrotic liver tissues. These results demonstrate the utility of clinical organ transcriptome to enable a new strategy, reverse-engineering precision cancer prevention.

DESIGN
Tumor-adjacent liver tissues from 263 Japanese patients who underwent curative surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma.
