TITLE
Identification of shared TCR sequences from T cells in human breast cancer using emulsion RT-PCR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the discovery of T cell receptors that are present and shared in multiple HLA-matched breast cancer patient tumors using a single cell emulsion based RT-PCR technique that pairs the alpha and beta TCR chains for high throughput analysis

DESIGN
Analysis of TCR sequences from 20 breast cancer patient tumors and blood, as well as 6 control HLA matched individuals

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
