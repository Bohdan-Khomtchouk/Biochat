TITLE
Insights into Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension revealed

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The results of this study identified a number of pathways potentially important for the amelioration of hypertension and renal injury in SS-13BN/Mcw rats, and these results generated a series of testable hypotheses related to the role of the renal medulla in the complex mechanism of salt-sensitive hypertension. Keywords: time course, microarray; 11ÃŸ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; glucagon receptor; extracellular matrix; apoptosis

DESIGN
Rats were paired for microarray hybridization, and the results were analyzed. Each of the four between-group comparisons comprised three pairs of rats examined by six microarrays with dye switching for each pair. Dye switching was not necessary for within-group comparisons, because the two rats of each pair were equivalent in terms of their treatment status. The expression data from the present study were combined with those from 24 microarrays hybridized in our previous study and used to identify genes exhibiting the most distinct temporal patterns of expression between SS and SS-13BN/Mcw over the time course studied.
