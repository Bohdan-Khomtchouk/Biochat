TITLE
Profiling livers from LPS-treated rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This program addresses the gene signature associated with LPS-treated liver in rat. Specifically, which genes are differentially expressed in livers of the Sprague Dawley rats treated with LPS?

DESIGN
The LPS-treated liver profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in livers of the Sprague Dawley rats treated with LPS compared to the corresponding non-treated controls.
