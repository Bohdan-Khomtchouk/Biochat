TITLE
The heat shock response of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus): candidate gene and heterologous microarray approaches.

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
Subspecies of the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, differ in their maximum thermal tolerance.  To determine whether there is a link between the heat shock response (HSR) and maximum thermal tolerance, we exposed 20ºC acclimated killifish from these subspecies to a 2hr heat shock at 34ºC and examined gene expression during heat shock and recovery using real time quantitative PCR and a heterologous cDNA microarray designed for salmonid fishes. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
