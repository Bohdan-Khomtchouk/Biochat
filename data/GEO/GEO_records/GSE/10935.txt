TITLE
Immune Dysregulation/Tumor-Associated Gene Changes in Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis: A Paired Microarray Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the differential expression of specific genes within the papilloma tissues themselves and to characterize the array of host genes that might be important in the pathophysiology of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Keywords: papilloma vs normal adjacent autologous larynx
