TITLE
Epigenome analysis of  primary uveal melanoma cells, normal uveal melanocytes, neural crest stem cells, embryonic stem cells and uveal melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of  primary uveal melanoma cells, normal uveal melanocytes, neural crest stem cells, embryonic stem cells and uveal melanoma cell lines. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip Rev B was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in the samples. Samples included 58 primary UM, 3 NUM and NCSC controls and 2 cell lines.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 63 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip Rev B
