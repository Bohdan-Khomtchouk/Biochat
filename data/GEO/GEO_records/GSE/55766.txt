TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of C. albicans in the presence of mucin versus absence of mucin

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans, causing a variety of diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to deep-seated systemic infections. Mucus, the gel that coats all wet epithelial surfaces, accommodates Candida albicans as part of the regular microbiome where C. albicans resides asymptomatically in healthy humans. Through a series of in vitro experiments combined with genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we show that mucin biopolymers, the main gel-forming constituents of mucus, induce a new oval-shaped morphology in C. albicans in which a range of genes related to adhesion, filamentation, and biofilm formation are down-regulated. We also show that corresponding phenotypes are suppressed, rendering Candida incapable of forming biofilms on a range of different synthetic surfaces and human epithelial cells. Our data suggests that mucins can manipulate Candida physiology and we hypothesize that they are key regulators for retaining Candida in the host-compatible, commensal state.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates grown in log phase in the presence and absence of mucin for 8 hours. Experiments were performed using RPMI 1640 (Gibco 31800-089) buffered with 165mM MOPS and supplemented with 0.2% NaHCO3 and 2% glucose with and without 0.5% mucin.

PLATFORM
GPL13830 Agilent-020166 Ca21_GE_plus_tiling_2.0 [ORF-centered version]
