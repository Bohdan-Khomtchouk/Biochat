TITLE
Estrogen receptors in breast cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer stem cells are considered estrogen receptor negative and estrogen insensitive. However, estrogens potentiate growth of the vast majority of breast tumors. In this study, we characterize the expression of estrogen receptors in breast cancer stem cells. We used microarrays to characterize the global gene expression underlying estrogen receptor activation versus inhibition in breast cancer cells from invasive breast cancers.

DESIGN
Cancer cells from invasive breast carcinomas are treated with D (DPN), T (4OHT) or untreated (vehicle control).
