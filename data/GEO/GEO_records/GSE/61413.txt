TITLE
Modified Stat1 Confers Enhanced Interferon Responsiveness and Improved Baseline Antiviral Host Defense

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U3A cells stably expressing wild-type STAT1 or STAT1-CC were treated with interferon beta (10U/ml) or control for 24 hours to assess effects of stat1 modifications, interferon, and the interaction on gene expression. Keywords: interferon, STAT1, STAT1-CC, STAT1CC, STAT-1C, antiviral

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from stable U3A-STAT1 lines stably expressing wild-type STAT1 or STAT1CC, after 24 hour treatment with interferon beta (10U/ml) or control.
