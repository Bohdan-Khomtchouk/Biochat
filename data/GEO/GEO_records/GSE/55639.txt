TITLE
Expression profiling of papillary carcinoma of the breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of papillary carcinoma of the breast and grade- and ER-matched cases of invasive ductal breast cancer To identify differential expression between papillary carcinomas of the breast and grade- and ER-matched invasive ductal breast cancers, we performed expression profiling of 16 cases of papillary carcinomas of the breast and 16 cases of grade- and ER-matched invasive ducatal carcinoma of no special subtype. We further reviewed the papillary carcinomas of the breast and classified them into 3 subtypes, namely, invasive papillary carcinoma, encapsulated papillary carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma. We also performed a hypothesis-generating comparison of differential expression between the 3 subtypes of papillary carcinoma of the breast.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of 16 cases of papillary carcinioma of the brest and 16 cases of invasive ducal carcinomas using the Illumina HT-12 v4 arrays

PLATFORM
