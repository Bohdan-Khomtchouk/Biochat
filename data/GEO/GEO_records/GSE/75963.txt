TITLE
Methylation profile generated by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of H2O2-treated and untreated HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is an important regulatory mechanism that contributes to transcriptional repression. To examine whether DNA methylation affects the transcriptional changes of DNA repair genes under H2O2-induced oxidative stress, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) in H2O2-treated and untreated HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (MspI,~40-220bp size fraction) data for HCT116 cell line with or without H2O2 treatement were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Illumina HiSeq 2000.
