TITLE
Expression profiling individual DrosDel flies heterozygous for deletions of chromosome 2L in a hybrid background

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to understand the effect of genetic background on the response to gene dose perturbation, we performed mRNA transcriptional profiling on 99 hemizygotic lines (Df/+) from the DrosDel project, which have hybrid genetic background of OregonR/w1118.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-Seq analysis of 417 single adult flies in duplicate or triplicate.  Flies are from 73 different genotypes. Differential gene expression was analyzed separately for each sex, gene expression from each genotype was compared to normalized mean of gene expression remaining 72 genotypes.
