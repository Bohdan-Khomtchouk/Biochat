TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the M1/M2 polarized Kupffer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To reveal the transcriptomes associated with M1 or M2-polarized Kupffer cells, the primary Kupffer cells isolated from mouse liver were treated with lipopolysaccharides or IL-4 and the gene expression patterns were analyzed by microarray. To study the role of RORα in Kupffer cell polarization, Kupffer cells were treated with RORα ligands and transcriptions were compared with those of the M1/M2 polarized Kupffer cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were obtained from lipopolysaccharide-treated (M1), IL-4-treated (M2), SR3335 (RORα inverse agonist), and SR1078 (ROR agonist) and compared.
