TITLE
Global accessibility of mitotic chromosomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test if mitotic chromosomes have decreased accessibility, we utilized Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis where the integration of sequencing-compatible adaptors by the Tn5 transposase is directly correlated with the accessibility of genomic regions

DESIGN
We performed ATAC-seq in 50,000 asynchronous cells as well as 50,000 Nocodazole-synchronized mitotic cells in two biological replicates each.
