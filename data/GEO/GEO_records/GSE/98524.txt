TITLE
Genome wide Mms1-binding sites in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis of endogenous tagged Mms1-Myc13

DESIGN
Mms1 was endogenously tagged with Myc13. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of performed using anti-Myc antibody, we generated genome-wide Mms1 binding profile in S. cerevisiae. The goal of this study was to identify where Mms1 binds in the genome and correlate this to replication fork pausing sites. Our results show that Mms1 binds to  specific G-rich  motifs which cause replication pausing.
