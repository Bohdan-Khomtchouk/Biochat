TITLE
Effect of histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) deficiency in second heart field on embryonic heart development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole heart samples from Hdac3-Isl1KO embryos at embryonic day E9.5. Results provide insights into the role of Hdac3 in second heart field-derived cardiac cells. We used microarray to investigate the gene expression program affected by Hdac3 during cardiac development and identified patterns of differentially-expressed genes and pathways during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic hearts were dissected from E9.5 embryos and pooled for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chips. We utilized three samples for each Hdac3-flox/flox and Hdac3-Isl1KO genotypes.
