TITLE
Methylation profiling of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
According to epidemiological studies, a vast majority, approximately 80%~90% of male OSCC patients in Taiwan habitually drink alcohol (A), and chew betel quid (B), and use cigarette (C). To assess the impact of these dietary factors on the epigenome, we conduct a high-throughput screen survey in an oral cancer cohort with exposure of A, B, and C. Results indicate aberrent methylation patterns are prevalent in OSCC patients with ABC risk factors.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was collected from tumor and non-tumor pair-wise samples. These biopsies were obtained from 40 male OSCC patients who regularly drink alcohol, chew areca nut and smoking.
