TITLE
Position-specific chemical modification of siRNAs reduces " off-target " transcript silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transfected siRNAs regulate numerous transcripts sharing limited complementarity to the RNA duplex.  This unintended (“off-target”) silencing can hinder the use of RNAi to define gene function.  Here we describe position-specific, sequence-independent chemical modifications that reduced silencing of partially-complementary transcripts by all siRNAs tested.  Silencing of perfectly-matched targets was unaffected by these modifications.  The chemical modification also reduced off-target phenotypes in growth inhibition studies.  Key to the modification was 2’-O-methyl ribosyl substitution at position 2 in the guide strand, which reduced silencing of most off-target transcripts with complementarity to the seed region of the siRNA guide strand.  The sharp position-dependence of 2’-O-methyl ribosyl modification contrasts with the broader position dependence of base pair substitutions within the seed region, suggesting a role for position 2 of the guide strand distinct from its effects on pairing to target transcripts.
