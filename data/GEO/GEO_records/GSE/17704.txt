TITLE
The Submergence Tolerance Regulator Sub1A Mediates Stress-responsive Expression of AP2/ERF Transcription Factors

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice NSF45K microarray experiment to dissect submergence tolerance response in submergence tolerant rice plant, M202(Sub1): We previously characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L.) Sub1 locus encoding three Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators.  Genotypes carrying the Sub1A-1 allele are tolerant of prolonged submergence. To elucidate the mechanism of Sub1A-1 mediated tolerance, we performed transcriptome analyses comparing the temporal submergence response of Sub1A-1 containing tolerant M202(Sub1) with the intolerant isoline M202 lacking this gene at three duration of submergence (0d, 1d, and 6d) with two biological replicates and one or two dye-swaps. We identified 898 genes displaying Sub1A-1-dependent regulation. Keywords: Abiotic stress tolerance response

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, M202(Sub1) vs wild type control (M202) at three durations of submergence (0d, 1d and 6d). Biological replicates: 2,  independently grown and harvested. Technical replicates replicates: 1-2 control.
