TITLE
Gene expression in S1 panicles of Ubi1:AtJMT transgenic plants and drought-treated nontransgenic rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are regulated by MeJA and drought, global expression profilings were performed on panicles from Ubi1:AtJMT, drought-treated NT, and untreated NT plants. The underlying assumption of this approach was that high levels of MeJA produced either by overexpression of AtJMT in the transgenic panicles or by drought treatment in the NT panicles regulates genes that are involved in spikelet and/or panicle development. Profiling was conducted using the Rice 3â€™-Tiling Microarray (GreenGene Biotech, Yongin, Korea). RNA samples from S1 panicles of Ubi1:AtJMT, drought-treated NT and untreated NT plants were used to generate cyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) probes, which were then hybridized to the microarray. Each data set was obtained from three biological repeats.
