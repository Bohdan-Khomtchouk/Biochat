TITLE
Sequencing random oligonucleotides using standard GA II protocol

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Study on sequencing biases introduced by library preparation step, namely by ligases. Comparison between standard Illumina protocol and improved High Definition (HD) protocol.

DESIGN
Four replicates for N21 (21 random nucleotides), one replicate for N9 (9 random nucleotides), using either standard Illumina protocol or HD protocol
