TITLE
Tcf7 biology in mouse beta-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We set out to identify differences in the transcriptome influenced by knockout of the transcription factor T-cell factor 7 (Tcf7) in mouse islets. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if metabolic stress (age,diet) influences these changes. Therefore, we compared the islet transcriptome from WT and Tcf7-/- mice both at a young age (8 weeks old) fed a low fat (10%) diet, versus WT and Tcf7-/- mice at an old age (20 weeks old) on a high-fat (45%) diet.

DESIGN
Tcf7-/- mice and littermate wildtype mice were compared. Mice were placed on either a low-fat (10%) or high-fat (45%) diet at weeks of age. For the low fat group, islets from 8 week old mice were isolated and total RNA was extracted with Trizol. For the high fat group, islets from 20 week old mice were isolated and total RNA was extracted with Trizol.
