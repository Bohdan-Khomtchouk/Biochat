TITLE
Comparative gene profiling study: Pak1 deficient human breast cancer cells vs Pak1 wt breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially regulated genes between wild-type and Pak1 deficient human breast cancer cells, we performed a comparative gene profiling study by using human whole genome arrays.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of MCF10A.B2 cells (MCF10A cells expressing a chemically activatable form of Her2) stably expressing a Tet inducible shRNA directed against Pak1 gene. All the experiments were performed in duplicate using tumor derived cells from two different tumors per group.
