TITLE
ChIP-on-Chip data from Rh30 cells +/- rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p73 is a p53 family transcription factor that plays critical roles during development and tumor suppression.  We analyzed p73 activity using a combination of ChIP-on-Chip and gene expression profiling, both at baseline and after treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. We report the first comprehensive analysis of p73 binding across the genome.  Furthermore, we re-analyzed this p73 cistrome after perturbation with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR and inducer of p73.  Multiple determinants of p73 binding, activity, and function were evident, and were modulated by mTOR.

DESIGN
Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells were treated with vehicle or 40 nM rapamycin for 24 h, then cross-linked and harvested.
