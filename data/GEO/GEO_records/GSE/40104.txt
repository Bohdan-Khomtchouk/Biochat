TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of Brf1 (Zfp36l1) and Brf2 (Zfp36l2) targets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conducted RNA/RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by high throughput sequencing to identify mRNA targets of Brf1 (Zfp36l1) and Brf2 (Zfp36l2) in mouse embryonic stem cells. We collected over 190 million sequencing reads and identified many highly enriched protein coding mRNAs. Gene ontology analysis of enriched genes reveals that transcription factors and intercellular signaling proteins account for a large fraction of the targets, many of which are important for pluripotency and differentiation.
