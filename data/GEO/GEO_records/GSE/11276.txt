TITLE
Comparison of adult intact naive C57Bl/6 Nogo-A KO versus WT spinal cord

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nogo-A localized on myelin adaxonal membrane in the adult CNS is well known for its role as neurite outgrowth inhibitor following a lesion. Nogo-A KO mice show enhanced regenerative/compensatory fiber growth following CNS lesion. However, changes undergoing in their intact CNS have not been studied. Moreover, Nogo-A in the intact adult CNS in also expressed in some neuronal subpopulations, e.g. in the hippocampus, olfactory bulbs and dorsal root ganglia. We compared the intact adult CNS (spinal cord) of Nogo-A KO mice in order to identify: potential compensating molecules which could be interesting new inhibitory neurite outgrowth candidates, possible molecules involved in the up to now not yet clarified downstream signalling pathway of Nogo-A, additional new functions for myelin or neuronal Nogo-A in the intact adult CNS. Keywords: gene expression, Nogo-A KO, spinal cord, adult, naive, unlesioned
