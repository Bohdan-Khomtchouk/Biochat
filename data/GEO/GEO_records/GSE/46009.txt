TITLE
A genome-wide RNAi screen draws a genetic framework for transposon control and primary piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A large fraction of our genome consists of mobile genetic elements. Governing transposons in germ cells is critically important, and failure to do so compromises genome integrity, leading to sterility. In animals, the piRNA pathway is the key to transposon constraint, yet the precise molecular details of how piRNAs are formed and how the pathway represses mobile elements remain poorly understood. In an effort to identify general requirements for transposon control and novel components of the piRNA pathway, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheet cells. We identified and validated 87 genes necessary for transposon silencing. Among these were several novel piRNA biogenesis factors. We also found CG3893 (asterix) to be essential for transposon silencing, most likely by contributing to the effector step of transcriptional repression. Asterix loss leads to decreases in H3K9me3 marks on certain transposons but has no effect on piRNA levels.

DESIGN
We sequenced small RNAs, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq from either tj-Gal4 driven hpRNA knockdown flies or P-element insertion flies
