ML-DmBG3-c2 Replication Origins

modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_711 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: Early origins of replication were identified by treating cells with hydroxyurea (HU), a potent inhibitor of nucleotide synthesis, in the presence of the nucleotide analogue BrdU. Treatment of synchronized ML-DmBG3-c2 cells with HU stalls replication forks and activates the intra S-phase checkpoint, thereby limiting BrdU incorporation to those sequences mmediately adjacent to early activating replication origins. BrdU enriched sequences surrounding early origins of replication are then enriched by immunoprecipitation with an anti-BrdU antibody. Early origins are then detected by hybridization to Agilent genomic tiling arrays. Peaks are called using MA2C ( ) Keywords: CHIP-chip For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
