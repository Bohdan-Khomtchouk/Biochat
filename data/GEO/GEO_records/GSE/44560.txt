TITLE
Identification of genes involved in cell differentiation of rat oral epithelial cell line ROE2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The use of in vitro cell culture systems has been of central importance for research of physiology, pharmacology, and toxicology, and functions at the cellular and molecular levels. We have developed an immortalized oral epithelial cell line ROE2 from fetal transgenic rats harboring temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. Here, to identify genes involved in ROE2 cell differentiation, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
ROE2 cells, an immortalized oral epithelial cell line from transgenic rats harboring temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen, were cultured for 0, 3, 6 and 9 days at 37˚C. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was monitored by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer's instructions.
