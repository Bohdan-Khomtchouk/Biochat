TITLE
Three-Dimensional Tumor Profiling Reveals Minimal mRNA  Heterogeneity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We microdissected discrete sub-regions of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and analyzed the transcriptomes throughout three-dimensional (3D) tumor space.

DESIGN
Nine cases were used for TP/TC comparison, five cases were used for 3D analysis, one normal case was set as a control.
