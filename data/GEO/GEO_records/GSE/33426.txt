TITLE
Three-Dimensional Tumor Profiling Reveals Minimal mRNA  Heterogeneity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We microdissected discrete sub-regions of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and analyzed the transcriptomes throughout three-dimensional (3D) tumor space.
