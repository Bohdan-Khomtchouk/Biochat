TITLE
Efficient immune responses in immunocompetent individuals developing symptomatic CMV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection usually goes unnoticed, causing mild or no symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Some rare severe clinical cases have however been reported without investigation of host immune responses or viral virulence. In this present study, we investigate, for the first time, phenotypic and functional features together with gene expression profiles in immunocompetent adults experiencing a severe primary HCMV infection. Twenty PHIP were enrolled as well as 26 HCMV-seronegative and 39 HCMV-seropositive healthy controls. PHIP had a huge lymphocytosis marked by massive expansion of NK and T cell compartments. Interestingly, PHIP mounted efficient innate and adaptive immune responses with a deep HCMV imprint, revealed mainly by the expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells, CD16+ V2-  T cells and conventional HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells.  The main effector lymphocytes were activated and displayed an early immune phenotype that developed toward a more mature differentiated status. We suggest that both huge lymphocytosis and excessive lymphocyte activation could contribute to a massive cytokine production known to mediate tissue damage observed in PHIP. Taken together, these findings bring new insights into the comprehensive understanding of immune mechanisms involved during primary HCMV-infection in immunocompetent individuals.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile were performed from PBMCs from HCMV-seronegative (n=12) or HCMV-seropositive (n=25) healthy donors or from immunocompetent adults undergoing a symptomatic primary HCMV-infection (n=11). Healthy-seropositive healthy sudjects were discriminated according to the presence (n=13) or not (n=12) of the NKG2C+ NK cell expansion.
