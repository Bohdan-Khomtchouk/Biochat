TITLE
Effect of transgenic human IL8 on gene expression in mouse colon cancer tumors

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
mRNA expression in  colon cancer tumores of CBA/C57BL/6 transgenic mice bearing a BAC which contains the human IL8 gene and promoter was compared to that of CBA/C57BL/6 controls.

DESIGN
A. CBA/C57BL/6 mice controls (n=3) B. human IL8 transgenic CBA/C57BL/6 mice (n=3).
