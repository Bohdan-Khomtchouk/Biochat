TITLE
Response to catration in PTEN null and PTEN null ERG expressing mouse prostates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed expression mouse profiling of prostates of 3 month PTEN f/f and Pten f/f;R26(ERG) mice and assessed the response to 3 days of castration.

DESIGN
Mice are in the C57B6 background. Two mice in each group were castrated. Three days after castration, the prostate were harvested and RNA isolated by standard protocols and analyzed by expression profiling.
