TITLE
Expression analysis of HepG2, HepG2-slug and HepG2-slug on Matrigel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hepG2 in regular culture, hepG2-slug in regular culture and hepG2-slug on Matrigel. Whole genome gene expression level changes have been compared in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hepG2 in regular culture, hepG2-slug in regular culture and hepG2-slug on Matrigel.

DESIGN
Roche NimbleGen micro-array analysis was employed to assess global genome expression in HepG2 in regular culture, HepG2-slug in regular culture and HepG2-slug on Matrigel. The results demonstrated that the up-regulated genes and the down-regulated genes increased significantly when HepG2-slug cells with VM forming ablity were cultured on Matrigel and formed VM.
