TITLE
The effect of bisphenol A on human prostaspheres derived from primary prostate epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisphenol A is an environmental xenoestrogen commonly known as an endocrine disruptor. We previously reported BPA-treated human primary prostate epithelial cell derived prostaspheres had larger size, exhibited clonogenicity, and showed increase in stem cell marker expression. Results reveal the molecular basis of BPA action in human prostate stem-progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Human primary prostate epithelial cells from three disease-free Caucasian donors formed prostaspheres from single stem-like cells in matrigel cultures and were treated with 0.1 nM estradiol-17Î² (E2), 10 nM (B10), 200 nM (B200), and 1000 nM bisphenol A (BPA) for 7 days. The vehicle-treated prostaspheres were used as 'untreated controls'.
