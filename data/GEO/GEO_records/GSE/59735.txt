TITLE
Effect of pioglitazone treatment on gene expression in NCI-H2347 lung cancer cells: time course experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray studies was performed to analyze gene expression changes in NCI-H2347 cells after treatment with 50 ÂµM  pioglitazone for 12hr, 24hr and 48hrs.

DESIGN
RNA samples, containing 3 replicates for each sample, were extracted from NCI-H2347 cells after treatment with pioglitazone or vhicle (DMSO)  for 12hr, 24hr and 48hrs. After biotin labeling, samples were hybridized on the Illumina Human HT12v4.0 Expression Beadchip.
