TITLE
Transcriptome profile of human pancreatic beta cell line (EndoC-βH2 ) following knockdown of RFX6.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RFX6 is a key transcription factor for the development of mouse pancreas, however the functional roles of RFX6 in human beta cells are poorly explored. Thus transcriptome analysis was perfomed to determine the functional targets of RFX6 in human beta cells using the recently developed human beta cell-line EndoC-βH2.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profile of human beta cell line (EndoC-βH2 cells) following siRNA induced knockdown of RFX6 is compared with siControl (siNT)  treated EndoC-βH2 cells.
