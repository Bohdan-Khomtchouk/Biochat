TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 acetate stress (43 mM)

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Metabolite accumulation has pleiotropic, including toxic, effects on cellular physiology, but such effects are not well understood at the genomic level.  Using DNA microarrays, the Clostridium acetobutylicum transcriptional stress response to acetate was analyzed. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from both acetate challenged  (43 mM) and unchallenged bottles at 10, 30, 45, 60 (1h), 120 (2h), 360 (6h), 720 (12h), and 1440 min (24h) poststress. Two slides per timepoint were hybridized on a dye swap configuration, except for the 720 min. point where both slides have the same dye configuration.
