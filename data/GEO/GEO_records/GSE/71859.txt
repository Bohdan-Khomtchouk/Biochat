TITLE
Tissue-specific laser microdissection of the Brassica napus funiculus improves gene identification and spatial control of biological processes

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Tissue-specific RNA profiling of the Brassica napus funiculus and funicular subcompartments using laser microdissection and RNA-sequencing

DESIGN
Funiculi were collected seven days after fertilization, histologically processed, and and embedded in paraffin. Entire funiculus or funiculus subcompartment (vasculature, epidermis, cortex) was collected using laser microdissection. RNA was extracted from laser microdissected tissues. This was used to prepare RNA-sequencing libraries with the Ovation RNA seq V2 cDNA amplificationand Illumina Truseq V2 library preparation kits.
