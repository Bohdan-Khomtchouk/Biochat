TITLE
NRG-1 induces mature ventricular cardiac differentiation from iPS cells contributing to cardiac tissue repair

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combined treatment with NRG-1 and DMSO led to efficient differentiation of iPS into mature ventricular-like cardiac cells, which were capable of preserving cardiac function and tissue viability when transplanted into a mouse model of myocardial infarction.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of cardiomyocytes, neonatal or adult, and iPS cells with or without differentiation treatment with DMSO or NRG1 were compared. Gene expression was measured with affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Arrays
