TITLE
Pig SISP jejunal segments: Lactobacillus plantarum and msa/srt mutant strains vs control, perfusion 4 or 8 hours

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Mannose-specific interactions of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v with jejunal epithelium were investigated using an in situ pig small intestinal segment perfusion (SISP) model. L. plantarum 299v wildtype strain was compared to two isogenic mutant strains either lacking the gene encoding for the mannose-specific adhesin (msa) or sortase (srtA; responsible for anchoring of cell surface proteins like Msa to the cell wall). Salmonella typhimurium served as a positive control for gene expression analysis. Scrapings from jejunal segments were collected after perfusion with bacterial suspensions or PBS (control) for 4 or 8 hours, and host gene expression was assessed using a home-made cDNA porcine microarray. Keywords: host-microbe interaction, Lactobacillus plantarum, mannose-specific adhesion
