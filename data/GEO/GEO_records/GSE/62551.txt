TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed during half-head regeneration in Schmidtea mediterranea

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
We used Nimblegen arrays with design 2007-11-06_Smed_ESTs_4_exp to measure changes in gene expression during a timecourse of regeneration of one side of the head in Schmidtea mediterranea flatworms.  Following amputation of one side of the head, samples were collected from both the regeneration blastema and non-regenerating side of the head on days 2, 3, and 4 post-amputation.  Gene expression in these samples was compared to that in non-regenerating control samples collected at the time of amputation.

DESIGN
Four independent biological replicates for each sample type were collected from non-regenerating control animals and from the blastemas of regenerating animals on days 2, 3, and 4 post-amputation.  Two independent biological replicates were collected from the non-regenerating side of the head on days 2, 3, and 4 post-amputation.  Each probe is spotted in duplicate on the array, providing us with two simultaneously processed technical replicates for each biological sample.
