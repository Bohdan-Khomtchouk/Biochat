TITLE
Prospective transcriptomic identification and validation of a circulating biomarker panel for human lymphatic vascular insufficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human skin biopsies to determine differential gene expression between normal tissue from an unaffected limb and lymphedema tissue from an affected limb.

DESIGN
Single condition experiment, paired normal and diseased skin biopsies from each study subject were tested for differential gene expression

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
