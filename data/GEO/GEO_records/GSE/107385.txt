TITLE
Cardiomyocytes microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we employed DNA microarray platform to compare the gene expression patterns in primary human cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab (50µg/ml), trastuzumab (50µg/ml) plus pertuzumab (50µg/ml), T-DM1 (10 µg/ml), or control (no treatment).

DESIGN
gene expression patterns in primary human cardiomyocytes treated with trastuzumab (50µg/ml), trastuzumab (50µg/ml) plus pertuzumab (50µg/ml), T-DM1 (10 µg/ml), or control (no treatment).

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
