TITLE
SMARCA4/Brg1 Coordinates Genetic and Epigenetic Networks Underlying Shh-type Medulloblastoma Development [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma could be classified into four subtypes: Wnt, Shh, Group 3, and Group 4. Subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct epigenetic properties. We report that a chromatin regulator SMARCA4/Brg1 controls a transcriptional program that specifically required for Shh-type medulloblastoma identity and proliferation. We show that Brg1 deletion significantly inhibited tumor formation and progression in a mouse medulloblastoma model. Genomic experiments indicate that Brg1 specifically coordinates with key transcription factors including Gli1, Atoh1, and REST to regulate the expression of both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Shh-type medulloblastoma displays distinct H3K27me3 properties. We demonstrate that Brg1 modulates activities of H3K27me3 modifiers to regulate expression of medulloblastoma genes. Brg1 is important for the growth of a human medulloblastoma cell line and Brg1-regulated pathways are conserved in human Shh-type medulloblastoma. This study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism that controls medulloblastoma development and provides a rationale for developing subtype-specific treatment strategies.
