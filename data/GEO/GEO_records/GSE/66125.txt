TITLE
Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of Clostridium termitidis CT1112 during growth on α-cellulose, xylan, cellobiose and xylose.

ORGANISM
[Clostridium] termitidis CT1112

SUMMARY
High throughput “omics technologies” such as transcriptomics and proteomics provide insights into the metabolic potential of an organism and have been used to understand the genetic and the central carbon metabolism mechanisms for the production of desired end products in various cellulolytic clostridia cultured on different substrates In this study, C. termitidis was cultured on lignocellulose derived simple and complex sugars: cellobiose, xylose, xylan and α–cellulose as sole carbon sources. 2D HPLC-MS/MS quantitative Proteomic profiles and RNA seq transcriptome profiles (next generation sequencing to identify and quantify RNA in biological samples) were analyzed to identify the genes involved in substrate degradation, cellodextrin transport and end product synthesis related genes Identification of these genes is important in understanding the metabolic networks of C. termitidis and could be valuable engineering targets for improving biomass to biofuel production.

DESIGN
Closridium termitidis was cultured on 2g/L each of α-cellulose, xylan, cellobiose and xylose. Samples were collected from the exponential phase. 2 replicate experiments were conducted under each substrate condition
