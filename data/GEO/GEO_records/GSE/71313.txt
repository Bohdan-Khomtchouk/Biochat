TITLE
MeDIP-chip of adult mouse hippocampus exposed to neonatal ethanol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we exposed mice to ethanol injections on postnatal days 4 and 7. We then extracted whole-hippocampus on postnatal day 70. We performed MeDIP-chip  using an antibody against 5mC. We also perfomed MEDME anaylsis using a chip with fully methylated DNA to act as a control. We found alterations in both modifications at many sites, including oxidative stress genes and imprinted loci. We also found many affect lipid metabolism pathways.

DESIGN
Comparision of neonatal ethanol-injected  with saline injected C57BL/6J mouse hippocampus in adulthood (day 70)
