TITLE
X chromosome cDNA microarray screen of lymphoblasts from males with XLMR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify genes that show altered transcript levels in lymphoblasts from male patients with XLMR as candidate genes that are responsible for XLMR. Keywords: disease state

DESIGN
Using a custom X chromosome cDNA microarray, we studied X chromosome gene expression in lymphoblasts from 43 patients with XLMR and identified those genes with altered transcript levels as compared to that in 6 normal controls.
