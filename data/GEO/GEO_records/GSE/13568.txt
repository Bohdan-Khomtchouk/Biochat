TITLE
Expression data from colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling has been widely used to screen for metastasis-associated genes by comparing the difference in paired primary and metastatic colorectal carcinomas, orthotopic implantation mouse model or cells with different metastatic potential in the field of CRC research In our study, we observed that the genes differentially expressed in M5 relative to its parent SW480 cell line

DESIGN
Here we used the SW480, a human CRC cell line, as a model system. In vivo variant lines with increasing metastatic capacity were selected in a metastatic orthotopic model of human CRC. A subpopulation named as M5 with enhanced metastatic abilities to liver was isolated by in vivo selection of SW480 cells. We identified genes associated with tumor metastasis by comparing the difference between high metastatic subclone and its parent cells.
