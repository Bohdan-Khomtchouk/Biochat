TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Human Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD Tubuli vs. Control Tubuli)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified 1,700 differentially expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 in diabetic tubuli; 330 probesets were commonly differentially expressed in both compartments. The canonical complement signaling pathway was determined to be statistically differentially regulated in both DKD glomeruli and tubuli and was associated with increased glomerulosclerosis even in an additional set of DKD samples.

DESIGN
Affymetrix expression arrays were used to identify differentially regulated transcripts in 44 microdissected human kidney samples. Stringent statistical analysis using the Benjamini_Hochberg corrected 2-tailed t-test was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts in control and diseased glomeruli and tubuli. This Series includes DKD and control tubuli samples.
