TITLE
The transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in bovine and cervine in peak lactation and dry period

ORGANISM
Cervus elaphus ; Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify genes which are differentially expressed in the peripheral blood nuclear cells of two breeds of cattle (Holstein-Friesian and Polish Red) and cervine in different points in their physiological states (dry-off period, peak of lactation)

DESIGN
RNA from peripheral blood nuclear cells taken from cattle and cervine in peak lactation and dry period were hybridized to Agilent two color microarrays with a common reference. There were four Holstein-Friesian cattle, four Polish Red cattle and four deer investigated. The whole blood was drawn in two time point from each animal â€“ during dry period and peak lactation. This means that there were six research groups (Holstein-Friesian cattle in dry period and Holstein-Friesian cattle in peak lactation; Polish Red cattle in dry period and Polish Red cattle in peak lactation; Deer in dry period and Deer in peak lactation). Using Gene Spring Software (one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD Post-hoc test) three lists of differentially expressed transcripts were obtained: a list of 576 transcripts which differ deer in dry period and in peak lactation, a list of 437 transcripts which differ Holstein-Friesian cattle in dry period and in peak lactation and a list of 158 transcripts which differ Polish Red cattle in dry period and in peak lactation.
