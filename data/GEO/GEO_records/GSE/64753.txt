TITLE
CCm2-regulated cardiac genes in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes that are regulated by ccm2 signaling with the zebrafish heart at around 72 hours post fertilization.

DESIGN
In total, 4 samples based on cDNA from extracted cardiac tissue were analyzed: 2 samples of ccm2 m201 mutant embryos and 2 WT control samples.
