TITLE
Mouse preimplantation development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined expression profiles of genes that could be regulated by the MAPK pathways during mouse preimplantation development.  We used Affymetrix GeneChips for microarray analysis, and three independent experiments were carried out.  8-cell stage embryos were treated or untreated with MAPK inhibitors, and blastocyst stage embryos were recruited for the study.  Hybridization was carried out with the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 or GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array following Affymetrix instructions.  The array was then washed and stained using the GeneChip fluidics station according to the manufacture's instructions.  Hybridized arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner.  Expression analysis was performed using GeneChip Operating Software 1.0 (Affymetrix) and scaled to an average probe set intensity of 500. Keywords: other
