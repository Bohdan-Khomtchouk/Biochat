TITLE
Comparative expression of bone metastasis clones and its parental cells on Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A-1 and human larger cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 by cDNA array.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells (SPC-A-1) and human larger cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H460) were injected into left cardiac ventricle of nude mice for bone metastases model, respectively. Bone metastatic lesions were detected by bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-methylene diphophonate, removed bone metastatic lesions for cell primary culture, chromosome analysis for determine the bone metastatic cells have a characterization of unchanged humanization, in the anesthesia death mice. Through eight in vivo ~ in vitro selections, the 4th, 8th generation cells of SPC-A-1, 8th generation cells of NCI-H460 and their parental cells were used for microarray analysis, respectively.

DESIGN
Bone metastatic clones 4th and/or 8th generation SPC-A-1 vs. SPC-A-1, 8th generation NCI-H460 vs. NCI-H460, respectively. Biological replicates: one replicate for every group, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
