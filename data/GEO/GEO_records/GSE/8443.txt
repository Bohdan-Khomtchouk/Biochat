TITLE
cDNA expression profiles of wild-type and fl-mutant upland cotton ovules during fiber initiation peroid

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
We constructed cDNA library from 0-10 day post anthesis cotton fibers when fiber cells begin to initiate and elongate throughout this peroid. We randomly sequenced over 95,000 ESTs from this library, and with request of upland cotton ESTs from other laboratories, we acquired a gene pool of more than 30,000 UniESTs. The cotton UniESTs were then PCR-amplified and printed onto microarray. This array is comprised of about 29,000 high-quality cotton cDNAs (each sequence length > 400bp, average length > 600bp) and external controls. Keywords: repeat samples for transcriptome analysis
