TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of gastric epithelial cells isolated from high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice by using Next Generation Sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We obtained transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of H+/K+ ATPase negative epithelial cells purified from gastric corpus of mice fed with HFD or control diet by using next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression pfofiles between HFD-fed and control mice.

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
