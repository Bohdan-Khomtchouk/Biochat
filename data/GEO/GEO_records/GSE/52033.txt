TITLE
Expression data from ATRA-treated endometrial stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Decidualization is critical for the embryonic implantation and successful pregnancy. ATRA can suppress in-vitro decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) induced by MPA and estrogen treatment. However, the mechanism by which RA suppressed estrogen and progesterone induced decidualization of mESCs is not clear. We used microarrays to investigate the mechanism by which all-trans RA (ATRA) regulates the decidualization of endometrial stroma cells (mESCs).

DESIGN
mESCs were isolated at day 4 of pregnancy and cultured with administration of E2 and P4 in the presence or absence of ATRA for 72h.
