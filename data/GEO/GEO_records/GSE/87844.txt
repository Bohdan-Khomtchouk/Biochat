TITLE
Developmental effects of maternal dietary vitamin A deficiency and P450 cytochrome 1b1 deletion in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type C57Bl/6J, Cyp1b1-null, and a substrain of Cyp1b1-null that are resistant to diet-induced obesity (Resistant Cyp1b1-null) timed mated pregnant dams were administered either a defined vitamin A sufficient diet or matched vitamin A deficient diet from embryonic day 4.5. Offspring liver gene expression was examined at birth (post-natal day 0) and at weaning (post-natal day 21).

DESIGN
Nine comparison experiment. C57Bl/6J WT vitamin A sufficient birth (PN0) control with WT vitamin A deficient PN0 and Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN0. Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN0 with Cyp1b1-null vitamin A deficient PN0. WT vitamin A sufficient weaning (PN21) control with WT vitamin A deficient PN21 and Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN21 and R-Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN21. Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN21 with Cyp1b1-null vitamin A deficent PN21.R-Cyp1b1-null vitamin A sufficient PN21 with R-Cyp1b1-null vitamin A deficient PN21. WT vitamin A sufficient PN0 with WT vitamin A sufficient PN21.
