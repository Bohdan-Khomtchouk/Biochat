TITLE
Transcriptomic of meiocytes.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
What are the gene expressed during meiosis pathway in Arabidopsis thalina. Comparison of total RNAs from isolated meiocytes with those isolated from root tips, and those from leaves. Comparison of transcriptomes of normal stamen (ecotype columbia) with root tips and leaves. And, comparison of transcriptomes of normal stamens (ecotype L. erecta) with stamens from sporocyteless mutant (L. erecta). Keywords: organ comparison
