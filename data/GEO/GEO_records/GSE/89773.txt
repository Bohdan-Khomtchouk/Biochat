TITLE
Gene expression profile of M. smegmatis expressing RbpA truncations

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression profile of strains expressing domain truncations of the essential mycobacterial transcriptional activator RbpA

DESIGN
Triplicate RNA samples of wildtype (MGM6232), RbpACD-BL-SID(MGM6234), and RbpABL-SID(MGM6236) were prepared from logathrimically growing cells
