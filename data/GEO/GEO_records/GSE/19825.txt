TITLE
Prolonged IL-2R alpha expression on virus-specific CD8+ T cells favors terminal effector differentiation in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD25, the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain, is rapidly upregulated by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells after T cell receptor stimulation. We demonstrated that during an acute viral infection, CD25 expression was dynamic, and a subset of virus-specific CD8+ T cells sustained CD25 expression longer than the rest. Examination of the in vivo fate of effector CD8+ T cells exhibiting differential responsiveness to IL-2 revealed that CD25lo cells, which were relatively less sensitive to IL-2, preferentially upregulated CD127 and CD62L and gave rise to the functional long-lived memory pool. In contrast, CD25hi cells that accumulate enhanced IL-2 signals, proliferated more rapidly, were prone to apoptosis, exhibited a more pronounced effector phenotype, and appeared to be terminally differentiated. Sustained IL-2 receptor signaling resulted in increased CD8+ T cell proliferation, higher granzyme B expression and exaggerated contraction after antigen clearance. These data support the hypothesis that prolonged IL-2 signals during priming promote terminal effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
An important question in memory development is understanding the differences between effector CD8 T cells that die versus effector cells that survive and give rise to memory cells. In this study we have performed genomic profiling of terminal effectors and memory precursors as defined by CD25 heterogeneity, towards better understanding the generation of these subsets. The two effector subsets were FACS purified based on the amount of cell surface CD25 expression into CD25lo and CD25hi subsets during the early expansion phase (Days 3-4 post-infection) and analyzed for their gene expression profiles (by genome-wide microarray analyses).
