TITLE
Lasp1 gene deletion: Effect on gene expression in the gastric mucosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression in murine gastric fundic mucosa in wild-type and Lasp1-null littermates. The data provide a comprehensive overview of genes expressed in the mouse gastric mucosa and show that the expression of several known and unidentified genes is modified by disruption of the Lasp1 gene. Keywords: Genotypic comparison

DESIGN
Total mRNA isolated from fundic gastric mucosae of three-month old mice, C57Bl/6Ncr strain, was used for this comparison.
