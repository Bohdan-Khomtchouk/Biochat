TITLE
miRNA expression in C. elegans fem-2(b245ts) and fem-3(q20ts) mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We compared animals that produce oocytes but no sperm fem-2(b245ts) to animals that produce sperm but no oocytes fem-3(q20ts). Using miRNA microarrays and we found that the mir-35-41 cluster genes were expressed to much greater extent in oogenesis than in spermatogenesis; furthermore, these miRNAs were the only C. elegans miRNAs that showed such differential germline expression.
