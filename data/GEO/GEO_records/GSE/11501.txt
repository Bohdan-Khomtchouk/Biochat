TITLE
Primary human leucocyte RNA expression of unrelated celiac disease cases and unrelated healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to study the effect of genetic variation on gene expression of untouched primary leucocytes. This expression data is used in conjunction with genome-wide association genotype data that is available for the celiac disease samples, typed on the Illumina Infinium HumanHap300 platform. All genotype data are available upon request.
