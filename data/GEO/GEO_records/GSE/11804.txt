TITLE
Pharmacological regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exercise activates serine/threonine kinase AMPK and transcriptional factor PPARdelta that re-model metabolism and endurance capacity of skeletal muscle.  Whether and how synthetic activation of these molecules regulated muscle gene signature is unknown. We have conducted skeletal muscle microarrays from mice treated with AMPK agoinst (AICAR), PPARdelta agonist (GW1516) or the combination of the two drugs to investigate the individual and interactive effects of the two on muscle genes. Keywords: Pharmacology study

DESIGN
C57Bl/6J mice were treated with Vehicle, AICAR, GW1516 and the combination of two drugs for 6 days, followed by collection of quadriceps for gene expression analysis.
