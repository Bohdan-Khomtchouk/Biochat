TITLE
The rectal mucosal transcriptome of men who have sex with men (MSM) engaging in condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI) compared with men who have never engaged in anal intercourse (controls)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report differences in mRNA gene expression in rectal biopsies from MSM compared to controls and for MSM timed with episodes of CRAI.

DESIGN
Rectal biopsies were obtained from MSM at two study timepoints: 1. after who abstaining from CRAI for > 72 hours and 2.after engaing in CRAI within the last 24 hours.  Rectal biopsies were also obtained from men who never engaged in AI.
