TITLE
Gene expression comparisons of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors isolated from wild type and c-MybTG/c-MybTG mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgene insertion in proximity to the c-Myb gene disrupts c-Myb expression in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs), resulting in skewed commitment to megakaryocyte lineage. To understand the genes regulated by c-Myb at the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte bifurcation,  MEPs of c-MybTG/c-MybTG mice were examined.  Detailed analysis on c-MybTG/c-MybTG is descried in the paper by Mukai et al, Mol Cell Biol 2006.

DESIGN
The IL-7R-Lin-Sca-1â€“c-Kit+ fraction was subdivided into FcR loCD34+, FcRloCD34-, and FcRhiCD34+ populations.  Among them, FcRloCD34- fraction was use as MEPs.  MEPs from 16 wild type mice and those from 32 c-MybTG/c-MybTG mice were pooled and used for RNA purification.
