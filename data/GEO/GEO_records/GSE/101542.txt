TITLE
Integrative Analysis of the Pekin Duck (Anas anas) MicroRNAome during Feather Follicle Development

ORGANISM
Anas platyrhynchos

SUMMARY
The quality and yield of duck feathers are very important economic traits that might be controlled by miRNA regulation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism underlying the crosstalk between individual miRNAs and the activity of signaling pathways that control the growth of duck feathers during different periods.

DESIGN
We conducted a comprehensive investigation using Solexa sequencing technology on the Pekin duck microRNAome over six stages of feather development at days 11, 15, and 20 of embryonic development (during the hatching period), and at 1 day and 4 and 10 weeks posthatch.
