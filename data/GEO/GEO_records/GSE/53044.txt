TITLE
Expression Data from Mouse Mammary Gland Adipose Stroma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipose stroma in the mouse mammary gland undergoes remodeling throughout the 5 stages of development.  These include nulliparous (virgin;never been pregnant), pregnant, lactating, involuting and regressed. We used a microarry to determine the changes in gene expression during gland development.

DESIGN
Mouse mammary glands were selected at three developmental stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
