TITLE
Prostate cancer cell lines: non-targeting siRNA versus SChLAP1-siRNA treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SChLAP1 is a novel long non-coding RNA expressed in prostate cancer. Here we performed transcriptional profiling of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1 comparing non-targeting siRNA treatment versus SChLAP1-siRNA treatment. Goal was to determine the effect of SChLAP1 knockdown on gene expression in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: non-targeting siRNA versus SChLAP1 siRNA treated cells. Biological replicates: 1 control replicate, 2 treatment replicates.  Technical replicates: 3 replicates per SChLAP1 siRNA.  Cell lines: 22Rv1 and LNCaP.
