TITLE
UTX regulated genes in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
UTX gene is localized on the X chromosome, identified as a demethylase on histone H3 lysine 27.

DESIGN
Two independent UTX conditional knockout (cKO) embryonic stem cell lines and two UTX knockout (KO) cell lines were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes without feeder cells at desity of 1 million cells/10 cm dish. Cells were cultured overnight and collected. Total RNAs were sequentially purified with Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) at NIDDK Microarray Core Facility following standard protocols.
