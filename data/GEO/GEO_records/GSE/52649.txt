TITLE
Effect of estradiol on murine alveolar macrophages and RAW264.7 cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse BAL alveolar macrophages from pregnant E14 and control dams are compared to RAW cells cultured with estradiol to determine shared gene expression change patterns induced by pregnancy and estrogen

DESIGN
BAL cells from intact pregnant and control mice were directly processed for RNA extraction. RAW cells were cultured overnight with estradiol or vehicle, then RNA was exctracted.
