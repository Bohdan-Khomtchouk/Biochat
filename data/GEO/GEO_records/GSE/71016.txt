TITLE
Gene expression profiling of African-American prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
African-American (AA) men have both a higher incidence and significantly higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) than European American (EA) men. In this study we have carried out a detailed analysis of both CNAs and gene expression changes in PCas from AA men compared to their matched benign tissues. We have identified MNX1 as a novel androgen regulated oncogene that is upregulated to a greater degree in AA PCa compared to EA PCa. Furthermore, RGS12 is a novel tumor suppressor on 4p16.3 that is preferentially deleted in AA PCa which negatively regulates MNX1 expression.

DESIGN
In this study we have carried out a detailed analysis of gene expression changes in PCas from AA men compared to their matched benign tissues. two-group comparison
