TITLE
Expression data from OVE26 diabetic mouse kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OVE26 mouse was chosen to study the progressive changes in renal gene expression because it displays the most advanced albuminuria mouse models that assembles advanced human diabetic nephropathy. OVE26 mice induce inflammatory gene expression changes consistent with advanced renal disease, associated with severe albuminuria and not reported in any other diabetic models. They provide the first opportunity in a model of diabetic nephropathy to assess the effect of induction of inflammatory proteins that have been implicated in renal injury.

DESIGN
Microarray expression was performed on whole kidney from control and diabetic mice at 2, 4 and 8 months of age and validated by rtPCR, in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.
