TITLE
Identification of early and late responder genes during cell reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our recent approach to induction of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts using protein extract from mouse ESCs could overcome the potential tumorigenicity risks associated with random retroviral integration. Here we examine the epigenetic modifications and transcriptome in two kinds of iPSCs and a partially reprogrammed iPSC (iPSCp) generated from adult cardiac and skin fibroblasts independently to assess any perturbations of transcription program during reprogramming.

DESIGN
The histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 profiles were obtained from ESC, two kinds of iPSCs and a partially reprogrammed iPSC (iPSCp) generated from adult cardiac and skin fibroblasts.
