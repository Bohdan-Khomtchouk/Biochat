TITLE
Expression data from primary mammary epithelial cells expressing ectopic p190B RhoGAP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P190B RhoGAP is required for mammary gland development, and its overexpression disrupts mammary gland branching morphogenesis.  To better understand the mechanisms by which p190B regulates mammary gland development we performed gene expression microarray analysis on mammary epithelial cells isolated from p190B overexpressing transgenic mice compared to control mice.

DESIGN
The mice used in this study were previously developed to inducibly overexpress p190B selectively in the mammary gland (Vargo-Gogola 2006). FVB/N mice carrying the MMTV-rtTA and TetO-p190B-IRES-luciferase transgenes or the MMTV-rtTA transgene only (Gunther EJ, FASEB) were fed doxycycline (Dox) chow (2 g/kg) for 7 d prior to removal of mammary glands and isolation of primary mammary epithelial cells at 6 weeks of age.
