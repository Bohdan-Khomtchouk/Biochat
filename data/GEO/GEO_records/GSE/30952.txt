TITLE
Microarray expression data from human renal mesangial cells (HMC) treated with a Cyclosporine A (CsA) time course.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HMCs were treated with CsA (4.2 µM) for 0 12 and 48 hours. To exmaine global gene changes in the renal mesangium following CsA treatment in order to identify novel contributors to CsA-induced renal dysfunction Microarray analysis was used to identify novel mechanisms of CsA nephrotoxicity in the golmerulus

DESIGN
Glomerulosceroisis is a key component of overall CsA neophrotxocity. The mesangial cells of the glomerulus are an important cell type with the renal glomerulus. In order to delineate this complex process and identify novel mechanism of the disease and identify possible future therapeutic targets HMCs were treated with CsA for 0 (control) 12 or 48 hours. HMCs were treated with 4.2 µM CsA and RNA extracted and hybridised on Affymetrix  (HG-U133A) microarrays
