TITLE
Mutually Exclusive CBC-Containing Complexes Contribute to RNA Fate.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) stimulates processing reactions of capped RNAs, including their splicing, 3'-end formation, degradation, and transport. CBC effects are particular for individual RNA families, but how such selectivity is achieved remains elusive. Here, we analyze three main CBC partners known to impact different RNA species. ARS2 stimulates 3'-end formation/transcription termination of several transcript types, ZC3H18 stimulates degradation of a diverse set of RNAs, and PHAX functions in pre-small nuclear RNA/small nucleolar RNA (pre-snRNA/snoRNA) transport. Surprisingly, these proteins all bind capped RNAs without strong preferences for given transcripts, and their steady-state binding correlates poorly with their function. Despite this, PHAX and ZC3H18 compete for CBC binding and we demonstrate that this competitive binding is functionally relevant. We further show that CBC-containing complexes are short lived inÂ vivo, and we therefore suggest that RNA fate involves the transient formation of mutually exclusive CBC complexes, which may only be consequential at particular checkpoints during RNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of HeLa cells treated with PHAX, ZC3H18 and control siRNAs were generated by paired-end sequencing, in triplicated samples. iCLIP experiments were carried out on the CBP20, ARS2, PHAX, and ZC3H18 proteins in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Two replicates per protein were used.
