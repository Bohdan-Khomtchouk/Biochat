TITLE
Gene expression profile of human melanocytes derived from iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to show the similarity among normal human epidermal melanocytes, melanocytes derived from human 3F-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and human 3F-iPS cells.

DESIGN
Human 3F-iPS cells without c-myc were established and then differentiated into melanocytes. The differentiated cells were collected and the gene expression profile was compared to normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) and orginal 3F-iPS cells.
