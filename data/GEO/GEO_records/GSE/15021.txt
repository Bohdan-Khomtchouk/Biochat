TITLE
Microarray analysis of strain EG4 vs. Nipponbare

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In the japonica rice strain Gimbozu EG4, the DNA transposon mPing is actively transposing to attain over 1,000 copies, whereas in Nipponbare, where this element is virtually silent and has only 50 copies. To analyze the impact of such a massive amplification of transposable element on gene regulation, we performed the rice 44k oligo microarray analysis.
