TITLE
Impeding transcription of expanded microsatellite repeats by deactivated Cas9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of expanded microsatellite repeats is associated with multiple human diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, Fuchsâ€™ endothelial corneal dystrophy, and C9orf72-ALS/FTD. Eliminating or reducing production of RNA and proteins arising from these expanded loci holds therapeutic benefit. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a deactivated form of the Cas9 enzyme impedes transcription across expanded microsatellites. We observed a repeat length-, PAM-, and strand-dependent reduction in the abundance of repeat-containing RNAs upon targeting dCas9 directly to repeat sequences. Aberrant splicing patterns were rescued in DM1 cells, and production of RAN peptides characteristic of DM1, DM2, and C9orf72-ALS/FTD cells was drastically decreased. Systemic delivery of dCas9/gRNA by adeno-associated virus led to reductions in pathological RNA foci, rescue of chloride channel 1 protein expression, and decreased myotonia. These observations suggest that transcription of microsatellite repeat-containing RNAs is more sensitive to perturbation than transcription of other RNAs, indicating potentially viable strategies for therapeutic intervention.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was perfomed on DM1 and non-DM1 myoblasts treated dCas9 plus control gRNA or (CAG)6 gRNA.
