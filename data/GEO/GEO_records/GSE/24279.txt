TITLE
Pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis miRNA profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes pancreatic tissue profiles of pancreatic cancer patients, pancreatitis patients, and controls. Since miRNAs are known to be valuable diagnostic markers, we asked whether respective patterns of pancreatic cancer patients can be detected in biopsies. The project aimed at an impoved understanding of complex profiles rather than single markers. Thus, a high-throughput technique was necessary, profiling all known miRNAs integratively. Three markers have been validated by using qPCR.

DESIGN
n = 22 normal controls, n = 27 pancreatitis samples, and n = 136 pancreatic cancer samples have been screened for the complete miRNA repertoire. Please note that each miRNA has been measured in seven replicates and the median of the replica has been computed.
