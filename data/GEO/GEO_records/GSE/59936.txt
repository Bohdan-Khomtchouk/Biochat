TITLE
Expression data with either EglN2 or control knockdown in T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to perform integrated analysis for EglN2 ChIP-Seq and microarray to identify EglN2 direct target genes, we performed the microarray analysis for T47D breast cancer cells with either control or EglN2 siRNA followed by hypoxia+DMOG treatment

DESIGN
T47D cells were transfected with either control or EglN2 siRNA in duplicate with RNAi max. 36 hours following transfection, cells were treated with hypoxia (1%) and DMOG (1 mM) for 16 hours. Following treatment, total RNA was extracted using Rnaeasy kit from Qiagen.
