TITLE
Severe Hypoxia Exerts Parallel and Cell-specific Regulation of Gene Expression and Alternative Splicing in Human Mesenchymal Stem CellsMesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the effects of hypoxia on stem cell populations,  we subjected human mesenchymal stem cells to a pO2 of 4 mmHg and analyzed global gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) by genome-exon microarray.

DESIGN
Hypoxia induced gene expression in human mesenchymal stem cells was measured at 24 hours after exposure to 0.5% oxygen or normal 21% oxygen.  Three independent experiments were performed per condition (Hypoxia or Normoxia).
