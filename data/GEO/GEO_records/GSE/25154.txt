TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the affect of neutrophil-derived microparticles on HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the role of neutrophil-derived microparticles (MP) on gene expression modulation on HUVECs. This study shows that MP can influence gene expression on target cells, demonstrating that these MP are functional entities.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HUVECs treated with two different subsets of MP: suspension MP or Adherent MP and vehicle control.
