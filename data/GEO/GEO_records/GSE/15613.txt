TITLE
OsMKK4 regulated genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsMKK4 is a rice MAPKK and immediately activated by treatment with chitin elicitor, a fungal MAMP. OsMKK4DD is a constitutively active mutants of OsMKK4. We identified OsMKK4 regulated genes using a conditional gain-of-function transgenic system and rice 44K oligoarray.

DESIGN
We used transgenic rice expressing OsMKK4 in wild-type and constitutive active forms under the dexamethazone (DEX)-inducible promoter. Callus of the DEX inducible OsMKK4DD or OsMKK4WT line was compared with vector control line using two-color method with 3 biological replicates.
