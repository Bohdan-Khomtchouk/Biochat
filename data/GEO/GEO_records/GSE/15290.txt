TITLE
miRNA profiling of human adipose stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of undifferentiated and neuro-differentiated adipose-derived stem cells.

DESIGN
Adipose-derived stem cells obtained from 4 different donors were divided into 2 groups, undifferentiated " control " group and neurally-differentiated " neuro " group. miRNA of each cells were analyzed using Agilent miRNA microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL9081 Agilent-016436 Human miRNA Microarray 1.0 G4472A (miRNA ID version)
