TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of M1BP in Drosophila S2R+ cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The genomic distribution of a novel transcription factor called M1BP was determined in Drosophila S2R+ cells

DESIGN
Polyclonal antibody raised against M1BP was used to immunoprecipitate M1BP-DNA adducts generated by treating Drosophila cells with formaldehyde, lysing the cells, and shearing DNA by sonication.  Immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced using the AB SOLiD system.
