TITLE
Evaluation of the physiology of medaka for standardized toxicity tests of chemicals

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
The “Fish Acute Toxicity Test” in the “OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals” is an essential test for environmental toxicity.  Here we have tried to evaluate the physiology of medaka during this test procedure by using genomics.  Genomics technology can provide genome-wide expression profiles of mRNA, and these profiles correspond to the physiology of organisms.  Thus, a comparison of mRNA expression profiles gives information on the reproducibility of experimental conditions.  Expression profiles of mRNA were measured for medakas maintained within the allowable range of the test conditions and also under extreme conditions beyond the guidelines limits. We confirmed the high physiological reproducibility of medaka kept in the recommended conditions of the “Fish Acute Toxicity Test” in the “OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals " from the expression profiles obtained under all experimental conditions except for the type of feeding.

DESIGN
This series contains gene expression profiles in medaka fish under 15 kinds of physiological conditions. Each physiological series included with 3 independent males and 3 independent felames, except Strain JPRI (GSM385865-GSM385868). *** No processed data for Samples GSM385886, GSM385887. ***
