TITLE
DNA damage responses activate a multi-functional genetic program in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA damage response kinase ATM regulates the genetic program of lymphocytes with phsiologically induced DNA DSBs.  In bone marrow-derived macrophages, related kinase DNAPKcs is also responsible for activating DNA damage responses after infection with Listeria monocytogenes.  Here we show that both ATM and DNA-PKcs regulate the genetic program of Listeria monocytogenes-infected macrophages.

DESIGN
Two independent bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures for each genotype (LysMcre/+ and Scid: Atmc/c: LysMcre/+) were infected with Listeria monocytogenes for 24 hrs at an MOI of 5.  RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen).  Gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina MouseRef-8 expression microarrays.
