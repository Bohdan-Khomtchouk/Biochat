TITLE
Microarray expression profliling of mouse whole spleen tissue after infection with L. monocytogenes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The infection with the intracellular pathogen Listerial monocytogenes in mice is well characterized resulting in bacterial colonization of various organs, mediated cellular response, and its role in the subsequent clearace of the bacteria, have been well described. In order to comprehensively describe the course of infection and identify molecular events leading to control of infection, we have undertaken whole organ profiling of the mouse spleen after infection. Keywords: L. monocytogenes infection, spleen, microarray

DESIGN
4-5 weeks old female animals were i.v. infected with a sub-lethal dose L. monocytogenes EGDe and total spleen RNA was isolated on consecutive hours  from 1-4 and days from 1 to 9 post infection. As control pooled RNA of non-infected spleens were used. For each measurement 2-4 chip technical replicates including 1-2 dye swap experiments have been performed.
