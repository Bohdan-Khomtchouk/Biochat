TITLE
Transcriptome evaluation of gene expression changes during carotenoid accumulation in the storage root of carrot (Daucus carota)

ORGANISM
Daucus carota

SUMMARY
In this study, a cross species hybridization (CSH) approach was used to evaluate whole transcriptome changes during carotenoid accumulation in the storage root of carrot (Daucus carota). Carotenoids are isoprenoid compounds providing red, yellow and orange color to plants. Previous gene expression analyses of carotenoid accumulation in non-model plant species have primarily used a candidate gene approach. Since global transcriptome analyses require extensive genome sequence, in the absence of these genomic resources an alternate approach uses platforms developed for model plant species. To assess transcriptome patterns associated with carotenoid pigmentation in carrot storage root, two carrot sibling inbred lines, B8788, true breeding for orange color and B8750, true breeding for white root color, were hybridized to the Medicago Affymetrix GeneChip microarray.

DESIGN
Near isogenic recombinant inbred lines B8788 and B8750, derived from a cross between white rooted wild carrot (QAL) and orange-rooted B493 were used for comparative analyzes to minimize background genetic differences. B8788 is true breeding for orange color whereas B8750 is true breeding for white storage root color. Carrots were grown in three pots for each genotype under greenhouse conditions and carrots were selected arbitrarily from these pots for harvest. Roots were harvested at approximately 11 weeks post planting when carotenoid accumulation becomes apparent in the storage root. Storage root tissue from sixteen individual carrot roots was pooled into three one-gram tissue pools of four carrots for each genotype.
