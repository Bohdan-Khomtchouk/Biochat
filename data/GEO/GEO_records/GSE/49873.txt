TITLE
Transcriptome evaluation of gene expression changes during carotenoid accumulation in the storage root of carrot (Daucus carota)

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
In this study, a cross species hybridization (CSH) approach was used to evaluate whole transcriptome changes during carotenoid accumulation in the storage root of carrot (Daucus carota). Carotenoids are isoprenoid compounds providing red, yellow and orange color to plants. Previous gene expression analyses of carotenoid accumulation in non-model plant species have primarily used a candidate gene approach. Since global transcriptome analyses require extensive genome sequence, in the absence of these genomic resources an alternate approach uses platforms developed for model plant species. To assess transcriptome patterns associated with carotenoid pigmentation in carrot storage root, two carrot sibling inbred lines, B8788, true breeding for orange color and B8750, true breeding for white root color, were hybridized to the Medicago Affymetrix GeneChip microarray.
