Let-7, mir-98 and mir-181 as biomarkers for cancer and schizophrenia

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Recent evidence supports a role of microRNAs in cancer and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, through their regulatory role on the expression of multiple genes. The rather rare co-morbidity of cancer and schizophrenia is an old hypothesis which needs further research on microRNAs as molecules that might exert their oncosuppressive or oncogenic activity in the context of their role in psychiatric disorders The expression pattern of a variety of different microRNAs was investigated in patients (N=6) suffering from schizophrenia termed control, patients with a solid tumor (N=10) and patients with both schizophrenia and tumor (N=8). miRNA profiling was performed on whole blood samples using the miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA Array technology (6th & 7th generation). Significant down-regulation of the let-7p-5p, miR-98-5p and of miR-183-5p in the study groups (tumor alone and tumor and schizophrenia) was observed (p < 0.05). let-7, miR-98 and miR-183 may play an important oncosuppressive role through their regulatory impact in gene expression irrespective of the presence of schizophrenia
