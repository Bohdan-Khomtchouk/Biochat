TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of the Salt Stress Induced Transcripts in Fast Growing Bioenergy Tree, Paulownia elongata

ORGANISM
Paulownia elongata

SUMMARY
Paulownia elongata is a fast-growing tree species native to China that is grown in different climates, types of soils, and can be easily re-grown. The versatility of the P. elongata species makes it an ideal candidate for biofuel production. High soil salinity is known to inhibit plant growth dramatically or lead to death. Salinity in soil is a detrimental abiotic stress affecting crop production worldwide and a hindrance for potential crop candidates used for biofuel production. The purpose of this study was to characterize the salt-induced transcriptome of P. elongata. Transcriptome differences in response to salt stress were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 646 genes were found to have significant altered expression in response to salt stress, and expression levels of a selective subset of these genes were chosen and confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of salt-induced transcriptome analysis in P. elongata. The current study indicates that the differential expression of certain genes may have an important role in the adaptation of P. elongata in response to salt stress. Functional characterization of these genes will assist in future development of salt tolerance in P. elongata, which could be used to enhance biofuel production.
