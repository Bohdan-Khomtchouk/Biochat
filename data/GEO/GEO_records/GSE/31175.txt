TITLE
Beta 1 blockers improve survival and provide cardioprotection in septic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Septic cardiac dysfunction is a key feature of severe sepsis and septic shock, contributing to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death. It has been established that persistent beta adrenergic stimulation is detrimental in sepsis, and that specific beta 1 blockade mitigates excessive systemic inflammation and improves myocardial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of specific beta 1 blocker esmolol on septic mouse myocardium by genomic and proteomic techniques. We also evaluated survival of septic mice and systemic inflammation under esmolol treatment.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were rendered septic by 2 models: cecal ligature and perforation (CLP) and intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Effects of esmolol on myocardium were assessed by microarray technique. Total RNA were isolated and purified from a 30mg sample of the heart of 6 groups of 8 animals, depending on the sepsis model and the treatment. The labeled cDNA from the treated animals were hybridized against the labeled cDNA from the untreated animals with 2 dye-swaps done for each sepsis model.
