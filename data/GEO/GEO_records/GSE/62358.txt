TITLE
Expression data from liver samples of wild type and Pfn2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix microarrays were used to characterize the differential expression profile of liver samples from wild type and Pfn2-/- mice (reference Pilo Boyl et al., EMBO J, 2007).

DESIGN
6 liver samples were analyzed in total: 3 independent biological replicas from wild type and 3 from Pfn2-/- mice. All the microarray procedures were conducted at the Affymetrix Microarrays Platform (Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain) using standard Affymetrix protocols.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
