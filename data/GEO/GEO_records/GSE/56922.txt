TITLE
Global variation of gene expression induced by constitutive activation of the NIK receptor in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis was transformed with the NIK receptor or the mutant T474D NIK receptor and infected with CaLCuV. The global variation of gene expression was analysed by RNA-seq at 10 days post inoculation and 20 days post inoculation and differential gene expression was determinated in comparison with mock inoculated Arabidopsis lines.

DESIGN
Pairwise comparison between mock inoculated and infected genotypes (WT,NIK-expressing lines and T474D-expressing lines)  at 10 dpi and 20 dpi

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
