TITLE
Combined transcriptome and translatome analyses reveal a role for tryptophan dependent auxin biosynthesis in the control of DOG1 dependent seed dormancy

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome and translatome analyses of 6 and 24 hours imbibed seeds dormant and non-dormant seeds of NILDOG1-Cvi with and without addition of the transcription inhibitor Cordycepin. NILDOG1-Cvi is the Ler WT containing an introgression of the Cvi accession on chromosome 5, which includes the DOG1 gene (Bentsink et al., 2006).

DESIGN
Gene expression of total and polysomal bound mRNA of 6 and 24 hours imbibed dormant and non-dormant NILDOG1-Cvi seeds in the presence of water or the tranacriptional inhibitor cordecypin. For each sample condition three replicates were used (two replicates were used for P_Cor_D24.CEL, P_Cor_ND24.CEL, P_Water_D24.CEL)
