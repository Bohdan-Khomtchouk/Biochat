TITLE
Ribosomal profiling of CRISPR edited and parental CHL-1 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribosomal stress was evaluated in melanoma cell line CHL-1 after CRISPR editing genomic locus containing SNORD50A/B

DESIGN
We have used CRISPR genome editing tool to KD snoRNAs SNORD50A/B from CHL-1 genome and assessed ribosomal binding genome-wide using ribosome profiling

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
