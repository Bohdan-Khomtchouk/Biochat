TITLE
Established glioma cell lines prove valuable models for tumour heterogeneity - mediated cellular response studies in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both established glioma cells lines U87MG and U373 were used for studying their interactions in the indirect co-cultures. Eventhough both being derived from the glioma tissue, those two cell lines prove morphologically and physiologically disctinct. Therefore their intre-cellular interactions were examined on gene exprexssion level in vitro to observe whether those co-cultures could make for a suitable in vitro cell model mimicking the in vivo glioma tumour heterogeneity.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of four cell set-ups were performed: U87MG monoculture, U373 monoculture, U87MG co-cultured with U373 (in Boyden chambers) and U373 co-cultured with U87MG (in Boyden chambers).
