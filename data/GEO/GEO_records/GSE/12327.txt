TITLE
Expression profiling reveals distinct clusters of transcriptional regulation during bovine preimplantation in vivo

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of gene expression and transcriptome dynamics of bovine metaphase II oocytes and in vivo developing bovine embryos. For this study, Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Array which covers ~23,000 transcripts was used, which revealed several distinct clusters of genes regulated during various stages of bovine preimplantation development. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
In vivo matured oocytes were aspirated from the pre-ovulatory follicles of 9 animals on day 0 (=day of standing estrous). For embryo collection, donor animals were inseminated with frozen/thawed semen samples from one Holstein-Friesian bull with proven 270 fertility. Zygotes, 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-to 16-cell stages were recovered by oviductal flushing using a minimally invasive endoscopic approach (24 cows) 1-4 days after artificial insemination (AI). These oviductal stages were collected in pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (44). Morulae and blastocysts 12 were collected by uterine flushing at day 7 or 8 after AI (7 animals) using routine nonsurgical 275 procedures. All embryos were carefully evaluated under a stereo microscope and only morphologically intact embryos meeting established criteria (Manual of the International Embryo Transfer Society, IETS) were used. Embryos were pooled in groups of 5, in the case at blastocysts, or 10 embryos for the other stages, washed in PBS + 0.1% PVA, frozen in a minimum amount of medium in siliconised 0.6 ml cups and stored at -80Â°C. Typically, the 280 time period between flushing and freezing was less than 30 minutes. Animal treatments were conducted according to the German animal welfare guidelines.
