TITLE
Expression profiling reveals distinct clusters of transcriptional regulation during bovine preimplantation in vivo

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of gene expression and transcriptome dynamics of bovine metaphase II oocytes and in vivo developing bovine embryos. For this study, Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Array which covers ~23,000 transcripts was used, which revealed several distinct clusters of genes regulated during various stages of bovine preimplantation development. Keywords: Time course
