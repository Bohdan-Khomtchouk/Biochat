TITLE
Metabolomic heterogeneity of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although multiple gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the mechanism for the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension remains elusive.  Analysis of the global metabolomic heterogeneity within the pulmonary vascular system leads to a better understanding of disease progression. Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we showed unbiased metabolomic profiles of disrupted glycolysis, increased TCA cycle, and fatty acid metabolites with altered oxidation pathways in the severe human PAH lung. The results suggest that PAH has specific metabolic pathways contributing to increased ATP synthesis for the vascular remodeling process in severe pulmonary hypertension. These identified metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of severe PAH. By profiling metabolomic alterations of the PAH lung, we reveal new pathogenic mechanisms of PAH in its later stage, which may differ from the earlier stage of PAH, opening an avenue of exploration for therapeutics that target metabolic pathway alterations in the progression of PAH.

DESIGN
Global profiles were determined in human lung tissue and compared across 11 normal and 12 severe pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Using a combination of microarray and high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we showed unbiased metabolomic profiles of disrupted glycolysis, increased TCA cycle, and fatty acid metabolites with altered oxidation pathways in the severe human PAH lung.
