TITLE
Molecular function of Lhx1 in early mouse development (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of wild-type and Lhx1 null mouse definitive endoderm cultures using Illumina whole genome mouse V2 arrays. The hypothesis tested was that Lhx1 regulates gene expression of definitive endoderm and anterior mesendoderm genes

DESIGN
Lhx1 null and littermate control wild-type embryonic stem cells were generated from blastocyst outgrowths.  Total RNA was obtained from four wild-type ES cell clones and four Lhx1 null ES cell clones differenitated for five and six days with  Activin-A to enrich for defintive endoderm cells and hybridized to Illumina WG6_V2 arrays
