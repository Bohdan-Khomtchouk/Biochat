TITLE
The role of the Cj0440c gene in Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Cj0440c encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. To determine the role of Cj0440c in C.jejuni, we knocked out Cj0440c in the wild-type strain (S) to obtain the Cj0440c mutants (SM). Then we compared the transcriptome of the Cj0440c mutant with that of the parent strain using DNA microarray. These comparisons identified 19 genes that showed aâ‰¥2-fold change in expression in SM. The differentially expressed genes in SM encode proteins involved in flagellar biosynthesis, O-linked glycosylation and hypothetical proteins with unknown fuctions. Cj0440c may regulate flagellar structural element expression or as a compenent of flagellar complex co-expressed with other flagellar genes. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that inactivation of Cj0440c affected corresponding phenotypes of C.jejuni, including broken flagella, weaker motility and reduced colonization ability in chickens. These findings indicate that Cj0440c governs the expression of multiple genes related to flagellar biosynthesis and O-linked glycosylation. This study provides favorable evidence for completing the information of the Campylobacter jejuni genome.

DESIGN
An eight chip study using total RNA recoverd from four separate wild-type cultures of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC111168 (S) and four separate cultures of a mutant strain, Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 delta- Cj0440c (SM), in which Cj0440c is deleted. Each chip measures the expression level of 1634 genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168.
