TITLE
Effects of Oxygen on Virulence Traits of Streptococcus mutans

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
To gain further insights into the molecular basis of the effects of oxygen on biofilm formation by S. mutans (Ahn and Burne, 2007), we used DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles of cells cultured under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Keywords: Oxygen, Biofilm, Caries, Microarray
