TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of NKTCL (Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a comprehensive genome-wide miRNA expression profiling (MEP) of extranodal nasal-type Natural Killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) using formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) (n=30) and NK cell lines (n=6) in comparison with normal NK cells, with the objective of understanding the pathogenetic role of miRNA deregulation in NKTL.

DESIGN
Total RNA, including miRNA, were extracted using Ambion Recoverall Kit and profiled using Agilent human miRNA V2.
