TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen reactivity in BXD2 mice with spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine autoimmune BXD2 mouse sera reactivity to linear peptide epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database.  Pooled sera from six 8-10 month old BXD2 mice was diluted at 1:1000 and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens.
