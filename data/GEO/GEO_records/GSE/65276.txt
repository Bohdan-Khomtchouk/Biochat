TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen reactivity in BXD2 mice with spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine autoimmune BXD2 mouse sera reactivity to linear peptide epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database.  Pooled sera from six 8-10 month old BXD2 mice was diluted at 1:1000 and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens.

DESIGN
In this study, pooled sera from six 8-10 month old BXD2 mice was profiled for anti-mouse IgG (H+L) analysis of autoantibody reactivity to peptide auto-epitopes printed in duplicate on a PepperPrint Chip.
