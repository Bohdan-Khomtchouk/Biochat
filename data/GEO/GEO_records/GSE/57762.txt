TITLE
Methylation Changes in Soybean Cotyledon Stage Seed Parts

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Seeds are comprised of three major parts of distinct parental origin: the seed coat, embryo, and endosperm. The maternally-derived seed coat is important for nurturing and protecting the seeds during development. By contrast, the embryo and the endosperm are derived from a double fertilization event, where one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the triploid endosperm. Each seed part undergoes distinct developmental programs during seed development. What methylation changes occur in the different seed parts, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of three major parts of cotyledon stage seeds, the seed coat, embryonic cotyledons, and embryonic axis, using Illumina sequencing.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA from three parts of soybean cotyledon stage seeds: seed coat (COT-SC), embryonic cotyledons (COT-COT), and embryonic axis (COT-AX).

PLATFORM
GPL15008 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Glycine max)
