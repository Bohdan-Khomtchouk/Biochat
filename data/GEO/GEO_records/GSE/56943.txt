TITLE
Genes regulated by Gadd45a during somatic cell reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gadd45a can enhance somatic cell reprogramming significantly. To explore the roles of  Gadd45a playing in reprogramming, we performed whole genome microarray to identify genes and signals pathways that regulated by Gadd45a.

DESIGN
Genes expression of MEFs was measured at day8 in reprogramming. Three samples were set: MEFs infected with SKO plus Flag, MEFs infected with SKO plus Gadd45a and MEFs infected with SKO plus G39A which is a negative mutant of Gadd45a.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
