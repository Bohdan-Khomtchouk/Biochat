TITLE
HSD17B14 induction in breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase family is involved in the fine tuning of conversion of different substances such as steroids, retenoids and fatty acids. The expression of HSD17B14 has been correlated to better prognosis in breast cancer. The function of HSD17B14 is still not known, but it may convert estradiol to estrone. We transfected breast cancer cell lines with a HSD17B14-containing plasmid and compared with mock-transfected samples. The influence on global gene expression was examined with microarrays.

DESIGN
The breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 and ZR75-1 were transfected with a HSD17B14-containing plasmid or a plasmid without insertion as control. This was performed in duplicates. The cells were harvested after 48 hours, and RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
