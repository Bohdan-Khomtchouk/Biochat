TITLE
Genome-wide association study of abnormal Paneth cell phenotype in Japanese patients with Crohn's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Morphological patterns of Paneth cells are a cellular biomarker in western Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) patients. They integrate genetics and environmental factors, and are associated with outcomes. To broaden the applications of Paneth cell phenotype, identification of novel genetic determinants and clinical validation in other ethnic groups is critical.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide linear regression analysis of percentages of normal Paneth cell  in Japanese patients with Crohn disease (n=98).
