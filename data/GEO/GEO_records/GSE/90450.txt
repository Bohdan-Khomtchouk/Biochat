TITLE
Expression data from keratinocyte-specific Zfp36-deficient mouse skin treated with imiquimod

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tristetraprolin (TTP, encoded by Zfp36) regulates the mRNA stability of several important cytokines. Due to the critical role of this RNA-binding protein in the control of inflammation, TTP deficiency leads to the spontaneous development of a complex inflammatory syndrome. So far, this phenotype has been largely attributed to dysregulated production of TNF and IL-23 by myeloid cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of TTP in keratinocytes. These mice developed exacerbated inflammation in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis model. Furthermore, these mice progressively developed a spontaneous pathology with systemic inflammation, psoriatic-like skin lesions and dactylitis. Finally, we provide evidence that keratinocyte-derived TNF productin drives the different pathological features. In summary, these findings expand current views on the initiation of psoriasis and related arthritis by revealing the keratinocyte-intrinsic role of TTP.

DESIGN
Mice with a specific deletion of Zfp36 in keratinocytes and their littermate control were topically treated or not with imiquimod during 5 consecutive days (5 animals by group). 4h after the last application, skins from abdomen were sampled and prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
