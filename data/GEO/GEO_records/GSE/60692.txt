TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of DEK binding in the U937 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that the DEK oncoprotein preferentially binds close to the transcription start sites of highly and ubiquitously expressed genes.

DESIGN
Sequencing of DNA precipitated by an antibofy against the DEK oncoprotein (ChIP-seq).
