TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of maize developing earshoot from tropical maize hybrid genotypes native to Nigeria

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Tropical maize genotypes are well known for their traits of late flowering and higher biomass. Carbon/Nitrogen balance in these genotypes is significantly different from temperate genotypes. Microarray analysis of gene expression changes occuring in developing earshoots was done and results were compared with the temperate genotype microarray analysis, previously conducted. A low yielding variety was used as a reference against three high yielding varities. Keywords: Genotype response

DESIGN
Technical replicates, dye swaps, technical replicates of dye swaps, no biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL5439 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array A GPL5440 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array B
