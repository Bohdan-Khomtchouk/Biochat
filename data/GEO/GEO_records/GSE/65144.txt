TITLE
Gene array analysis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma tissue versus matched and unmatched normal thyroid tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Currently there is a lack of effective therapies which result in long-term durable response for patients presenting with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a very rare and lethal variant of thyroid cancer. ATC is resistant to chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies currently available. In an effort to identify novel tumor-specific therapeutic targets, we performed high throughput gene array analysis screening numerous patient ATC tumor tissues, and compared their gene expression levels to matched and unmatched normal thyroid tissue samples.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from flash frozen patient tumor and normal samples. Gene array analysis was performed, and resulting expression levels were compared between normal and tumor samples.
