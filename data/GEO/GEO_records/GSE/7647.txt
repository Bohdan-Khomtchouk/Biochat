TITLE
Comparison of mock treated L929 cells with L929 cells infected with wildtype versus nt3A mutant VRP at 5hpi

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This series includes arrays from two separate experiments where the gene expression profile of mock treated L929 cells was compared to that of L929 cells that had been infected with wildtype versus nt3A mutant Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP).  Total RNA was isolated from all samples at 5 hour post-infection. Keywords: virus infection-induced gene expression changes
