TITLE
Comparison of mock treated L929 cells with L929 cells infected with wildtype versus nt3A mutant VRP at 5hpi

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This series includes arrays from two separate experiments where the gene expression profile of mock treated L929 cells was compared to that of L929 cells that had been infected with wildtype versus nt3A mutant Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP).  Total RNA was isolated from all samples at 5 hour post-infection. Keywords: virus infection-induced gene expression changes

DESIGN
L929 cells were mock treated or infected at an MOI of 5 with either wildtype or nt3A mutant null-VRP, and total RNA was isolated at 5 hpi using the UltraSpec reagent protocol as described above.  The UNC-CH Functional Genomics Core Facility provided Affymetrix sample preparation and hybridization services, hybridizing the samples to Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A (MOE430A) GeneChip arrays, which include analysis of ~22,600 genes.  Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Suite 5.0 software was used for washing, scanning, and basic analysis, with sample quality assessed by examination of 3’ to 5’ intensity ratios of certain genes.  Expression analysis files created by Microarray Suite were imported into GeneSpring 6.2 (Silicon Genetics) for further gene expression analysis and filtering.  Two independent array studies were completed, and gene lists were compiled representing only those genes that were up- or downregulated by greater than 2-fold in replicate analyses.
