TITLE
MeDIP sequencing of Ovis aries

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We have completed the high quality reference genome for domestic sheep (Oar v3.1).

DESIGN
Early-stage Illumina GA sequence platform sequenced less reads in high GC content regions than in other regions. To read through higher GC content regions, we generated 2 Gb MeDIP-seq data for filling gaps in sheep reference genome assembly.

PLATFORM
GPL15670 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Ovis aries)
