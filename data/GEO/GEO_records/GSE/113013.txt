TITLE
Comparison of atrial appendage tissues of patients with Valvular Heart Disease and patients with Valvular Heart Disease-Atrial Fibrillation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia disease. The greatest risk of atrial fibrillation is stroke, and stroke caused by valvular heart disease with atrial fibrillation (AF-VHD) is more serious. the development mechanism from VHD to AF-VHD is not yet clear. The research on expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA is helpful to explore molecular mechanism in patients with valvular heart disease who develop atrial fibrillation.

DESIGN
the atrial appendage tissues of five AF-VHD and five SR-VHD (sinus rhythm, SR) patients  were obtained from patients undergoing heart surgery

PLATFORM
