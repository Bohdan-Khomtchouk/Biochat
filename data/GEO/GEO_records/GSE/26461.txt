Epigenetic regulation of type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Epigenetic alteration of the genome has been shown to provide palliative effects in mouse models of certain human autoimmune disorders. We have investigated whether chromatin remodeling could provide protection against autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Treatment of female mice during the transition from prediabetic to diabetic stage (18-24 weeks of age) with the well-characterized histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) effectively reduced the incidence of diabetes and abrogated the ability of splenocytes to adoptively transfer the disease into immunodeficient NOD.scid mice. Protection against diabetes was accompanied by histone hyperacetylation in pancreas and spleen, increased frequency of CD4+ CD62L+ cells in the spleen, reduction in cellular infiltration of islets, restoration of normoglycemia and glucose-induced insulin release by beta cells. In vitro activation of splenic T lymphocytes derived from protected mice resulted in enhanced expression of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein without altering the expression of Il4, Il17, Il18, Inos, and Tnfa genes nor the secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17 and TNF-alpha proteins. Consistently, expression of the transcription factor involved in Ifng transcription, Tbet/Tbx21 but not Gata3 and Rorgt, respectively required for the transcription of Il4 and Il17, was upregulated in activated splenocytes of protected mice. These data indicate that abrogation of autoimmune diabetes is associated with the selective upregulation of certain inducible genes in T lymphocytes. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the changes in global gene expression underlying abrogation of autoimmune diabetes by TSA-mediated epigenetic modulation and identified a distinct group of genes down-regulated during this process.
