TITLE
Investigation of extra-telomeric effects of hTERT in neoplastic transformation of IMR90 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complexity and heterogeneity of cancer cells are under-represented by the current experimental models which revolve around primary tumor cells, cancer cell lines, and rodent models. We used the transformed cell model in our studies. IMR90 and BJ fibroblast cells were transformed by three oncogenic genetic factors, SV40 Large-T antigen, H-Ras and human telomerase (hTERT). These transformed cells can grow under anchorage independent conditions, are self-sufficient in growth signals, have decreased sensitivity to apoptosis, and showed recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. Further characterization of transformed cells through cell cycle profiling and mass spectrometry analysis also revealed an increased fraction in the G2/M phase, and an up-regulation of Ku70. Furthermore, transformed cells exhibited increased telomerase activity that was not accountable by hTERT overexpression alone. Microarray results revealed that hTERT overexpression promoted cell migration and the initiation of DNA damage responses; two cellular processes that are important in cancer progression. Collectively, these data imply that IMR90 transformed cell model is an invaluable tool for cancer studies. Our results in the systematic study of this model helped us identify possible early events in cancer transformation and reveal the extra-telomeric effects of telomerase in cell migration and DNA damage initiation.

DESIGN
IMR90 and BJ fibroblast cells were transformed by three oncogenic genetic factors, SV40 Large-T antigen, H-Ras and human telomerase (hTERT). Through microarray analysis, gene expression of transformed cells were compared against control cells.
