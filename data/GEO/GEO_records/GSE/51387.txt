TITLE
SM009 - SARS infection of C57BL6, and PLAT knock-out mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This purpose of this experiment was to investigate the transcriptional differences between C57BL6, PLAT knock-out mice infected with SARS MA15 virus.

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Groups of 20 week old C57BL6 and PLAT knock-out mice were infected with SARS MA15 virus. Infections were done at 10^5 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 4 and 7 d.p.i.  There were 2-4 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
