TITLE
Gene expression profiling of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer MCF7L cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endocrine resistance is a major obstacle in treating estrogen receptor Î± (ER)-positive (+) breast cancer.  In order to better understand the mechanism of endocrine resistance, we established a stable tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) MCF7L cell model by culturing the parental (P) MCF7L cells in the presence of 100 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) for over 6 months.  To characterize the transcriptomic profiles in these cells, we performed an RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (by RNA-seq) were taken of a TamR cell model.  The tamoxifen-sensitive P cells and TamR cells were compared to each other.
