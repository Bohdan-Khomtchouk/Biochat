TITLE
Identification of the RNAs that bind MOV10 in postnatal murine brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These are the repetitve element RNAs and mRNAs found associated with MOV10 by RNA IP (RIP)

DESIGN
RNAs were isolated from 28 C57bl/6 mice aged P2 brains. The RNAs immunoprecipitated with MOV10 were compared for enrichment over input RNA by RIPSeeker

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
