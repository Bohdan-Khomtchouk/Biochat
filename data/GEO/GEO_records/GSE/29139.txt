TITLE
Identification of  response genes upon neuronal activation in mouse cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We search for developmental changes specific to humans by examining gene expression profiles in the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque prefrontal and cerebellar cortex. In both brain regions, developmental patterns were more evolved in humans than in chimpanzees. The major human specific genes in prefrontal cortex was enriched in neuronal functions and regulated by several transcription factors, which were previously implicated in regulation of neuronal functions. To confirm neuronal function of the human prefrontal cortex specific genes, we identifed response genes upon neuronal activation in mouse cortical neurons. Our results show that human specific genes are enriched in the response genes upon neuronal activation, implying the function of human prefrontal cortex specific genes in synaptic development.

DESIGN
The cortical neurons from E15 mouse were isolated and cultured. We then exposed neurons to bicuculline (Bic), or potassium chloride (KCl), or without treatment. The cultured neurons under each group were hybridized to Agilent whole mouse genome oligo microarray (4x44k).
