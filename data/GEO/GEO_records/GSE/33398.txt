TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of trichothecene-induced gene expression in barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Fusarium Head Blight susceptible barley variety, Morex, was infected with deoxynivalenol production deficient mutant strain (GZT40) and wild type stains (Z3639) of Fusarium graminearum. The RNA was sampled at 48 and 96 hours after inoculation. and was used hybridize to Barley_1 GeneChip.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Jayanand Boddu.
