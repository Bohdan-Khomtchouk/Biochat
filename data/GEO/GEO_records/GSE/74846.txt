TITLE
Drosophila Oga deletion perturbs O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin factors

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila development is a complex and dynamic process regulated, in part, by members of the Polycomb (Pc), Trithorax (Trx) and Compass chromatin modifier complexes.  O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT/SXC) is essential for Pc repression suggesting that the O-GlcNAcylation of proteins plays a key role in regulating development. OGT transfers N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) onto hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues of key transcriptional regulators using the nutrient-derived UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate, which is dynamically removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA).  We performed ChIP-chip and microarray analysis after OGT or OGA RNAi knockdown in Drosophila S2 cells and found that O-GlcNAc was elevated genome wide particularly at genes related to mitosis and cell cycle in OGA RNAi cells, but not at sites co-occupied by Pc member Pleiohomeotic (Pho), such as the Hox and NK homeobox gene clusters. Microarray analysis suggested that altered O-GlcNAc cycling perturbed the expression of genes associated with morphogenesis and cell cycle regulation. To examine the in vivo consequences of disturbed O-GlcNAc cycling in the whole animal, we produced a null allele of oga (ogadel.1) in Drosophila. Epigenetic activators including Trx group members Trithorax (Trx), Absent small or homeotic discs 1 (Ash1) and Compass member Set1 histone methyltransferases are O-GlcNAc modified in ogadel.1 mutants. ogadel.1 mutants displayed altered expression of a distinct set of cell cycle related genes in ovaries. Our results suggest that the loss of OGA could affect epigenetic machinery by accumulating O-GlcNAc on numerous chromatin factors including Trx, Ash1 and Set1 in Drosophila.

DESIGN
We performed affymetrix tilingarray  analysis after OGT or OGA RNAi knockdown in Drosophila S2 cells to find if that O-GlcNAc was elevated genome wide particularly at genes related to mitosis and cell cycle in OGA RNAi cells, but not at sites co-occupied by Pc member Pleiohomeotic (Pho), ------------------------------- This represents the gene expression component only
