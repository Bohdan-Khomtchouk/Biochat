TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of NKX2.2 knockdown in human pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim:Transcriptional analysis of NKX2.2 knockdown versus control in human pancreatic islets Methods:Pancreatic islets from 3 human donors  were transduced with an adenovirus encoding an shRNA directed against human NKX2.2 or a scrambled shRNA control.  Total RNA was extracted.Libraries were prepared from total RNA (RIN > 8) with the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument. More than 20 million reads were mapped to the human genome (Human: NCBI/build37.2)) using Tophat (version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. Significantly differentially expressed genes were calculated using DEseq. Results: Among the dysregulated genes with a p-value=0.05 are important genes for the maintenance of  beta cell function and idenity. Conclusion: Nkx2.2 is a critical regulator of beta cell function and identity

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of the pancreatic islets from 3 human donors transduced with Ad.sh-NKX2.2 or scramble sh-RNA control vector were generated by deep sequencing ,  using Illumina HiSeq2000.
