TITLE
Fetal Rat Testis mRNA Expression after 50 mg/kg Dibutyl Phthalate Exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
High dose level dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure of fetal rat testes in vivo inhibits testosterone production (i.e. endocrine disruption).  Here, fetal testis mRNA levels were profiled following exposure to a DBP dose level that did not significantly reduce testosterone levels.  The goal was to identify the constellation of gene expression changes that do not correlate with endocrine disruption.

DESIGN
Fischer 344 rats were exposed via oral gavage of the dam to vehicle (corn oil) or 50 mg/kg (body weight) DBP daily from gestational day (GD) 12 to 20.  The day after mating was defined as gestational day 0.  Six hours after the final exposure on GD20, fetal testes were dissected and mRNA levels quantified using Affymetrix Rat Expression 230 2.0 microarrays.
