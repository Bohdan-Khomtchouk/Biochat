TITLE
Clinical impact of a novel microRNA chemo-sensitivity predictor in gastroesophageal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: miRNAs might be potentially useful biomarkers for prediction of response to chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy and survival. The aim of this retrospective study was to validate miRNA response predictors in a cohort of patients with gastroesophageal cancer in order to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Material and methods: The study population encompassed 53 patients treated with curative intended for loco-regional gastroesophageal cancer. miRNA expression was quantified from pre-therapeutic and diagnostic, formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor specimens using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0 Array. Based on growth inhibition of the NCI60 panel in the presence of cisplatin, epirubicine and capecitabine, a miRNA based response predictor was developed. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to assess the correlations of the response predictor with OS and DSS. Results: A univariate analysis demonstrated a statistical significant improvement of OS for patients who had undergone surgical resection with prediction scores above the median prediction score (HR: 0.41 (95% CI: 0.17-0.96). Adjusting for surgery and stage, this predictor was identified to be independently associated with both OS (HR: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.16-0.87)) and DSS (HR: 0.32 (0.12-0.87)). Conclusion: The miRNA profile predictive for sensitivity to cisplatin, epirubicine and capecitabine was shown to be independently associated with OS and DSS in patients with gastroesophageal cancer.
