TITLE
Expression data from human iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we studied human dopaminergic neuron differenation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We included the gene expression data obtained from iPSCs and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons. This dataset is used to predict chromatin accessibility in iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons using BIRD (Big data Regression for predicting DNase I hypersensitivity).

DESIGN
2 samples of iPSCs and 2 samples of iPSC-derived neurons were analyzed.
