TITLE
Identification and Differential Expression of MicroRNAs Associated with Fat Deposition in Wistar Rat Liver Using Solexa Sequencing

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
we analyzed the miRNAs expression in Wistar rat liver tissues, High glucose (HG)-induced NAFLD Wistar rats (NAFLD group, n=3) and normal Wistar rats (normal group, n=3).  Results provided the first global miRNAs in the NAFLD Wistar rat livers, and expanded the miRNAs repertoire in normal Wistar rat livers, which should be useful for further investigation into the biological functions and evolution of miRNAs in rats and other species. These findings suggest an important role of miRNAs in liver fat deposition, and implicate the participation of miRNAs in the NAFLD pathophysiological processes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated NAFLD Wistar rat liver tissues compared to normal Wistar rat liver tissues.
