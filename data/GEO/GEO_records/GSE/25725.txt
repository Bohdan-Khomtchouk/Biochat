TITLE
gene expression data from cep701 treated HEL cells and shPRMT5 knocking down HEL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
compare the gene expression profile between cep701 treated HEL cells with shPRMT5 knockingdown HEL cells. HEL cells contain homologous alells with mutation Jak2V617F. We found JAK2V617F can inactivate PRMT5 activity by directly phosphorylating PRMT5 through histone methylation.

DESIGN
compare the gene expression profile between cep701 treated HEL cells with shPRMT5 knockingdown HEL cells
