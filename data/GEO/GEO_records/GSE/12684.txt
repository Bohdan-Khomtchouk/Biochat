TITLE
hog1, slt2, rlm1, and msn2/4 mutants exposed to zymolyase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae wild type (BY4741) and mutants were grown on YEPD. For Zymolyase experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 2h 30min. Next, culture was divided into two parts. One continues growing under same conditions (non-treated culture) while the other was supplemented with 5units/ml Zymolyase 100T. Cells were collected at 3 hours of growth, frozen at -80 °C and processed for RNA extraction. The total RNA from one culture was analyzed, and, in addition, for this sample two different hybridizations were performed, including fluorochrome swapping in order to minimize transcriptional changes due to technical variability. This therefore corresponded to two DNA microarrays analyzed.
