TITLE
HDAC and aminopeptidase inhibitor treatment of myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H929 human myeloma cells were exposed to aminopeptidase inhibitor (CHR-2797), HDAC inhibitor (CHR-3996), or a combinaion of the two agents, for 24 hours. Following this treatment RNA was extracted and microarrays used to determine gene expression changes.

DESIGN
Myeloma cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic agent for 24 hours.
