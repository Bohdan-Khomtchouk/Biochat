TITLE
miRNA expression profiles among SiHa, SiHa-tw2 and SiHa-shtw2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further identify the most significantly changed miRNA resulting from the different expression levels of TWIST2 in cervical cancer cells, we used a miRNA microarray to identify the miRNA expression profiles among SiHa, SiHa-tw2 and SiHa-shtw2. The significantly deregulated miRNAs (changes of more than 2-fold in expression) included miR-23b-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-502-3p, miR-221-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-1227, miR-93-5p and miR-4257.

DESIGN
SiHa-tw2 cells overexpressed TWIST2 and SiHa-shtw2 cells down-expressed TWIST2 in SiHa cells.
