TITLE
Reducing Cytoplasmic Polyamine Oxidase Activity in Arabidopsis Increases Salt and Drought Tolerance by Reducing Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Increasing Defense Gene Expression.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana polyamine oxidase 5 gene (AtPAO5) functions as a thermospermine (T-Spm) oxidase. Aerial growth of its knock-out mutant (Atpao5-2) is significantly repressed by low dose(s) of T-Spm but not by other polyamines. Massive analysis of 3â€™-cDNA ends (MACE) was performed. Cell wall, lipid and secondary metabolisms were dramatically affected in low dose T-Spm-treated Atpao5-2. Intriguingly Fe-deficient responsive genes and drought stress-induced genes were up-regulated, suggesting that vascular system loses the function. Histological observation showed that vascular system of the joint part between stem and leaves was structurally destroyed. The results indicate that T-Spm homeostasis by a balance of synthesis and catabolism, catalysed by AtPAO5 in Arabidopsis, is important for maintaining vascular system. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PAOs from vascular plants are classified into four clades (I-IV) and AtPAO5 belongs to the clade III. Clade III members show high identity to metazoan PAOs and are not found in non-vascular plants. Furthermore, all the clade III genes are intron-less or contain a single intron whereas the other three clade genes usually contain 7 to 9 introns. The data suggest the occurrence of a horizontal gene transfer of ancestral clade III PAO gene(s) from primitive animals. Fine tuning of T-Spm metabolism is critical for vascular plants and its catabolic gene was acquired from a certain Metazoan to equip the vascular system.
