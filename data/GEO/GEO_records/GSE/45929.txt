TITLE
FGFR2 Signaling Underlies p63 Oncogenic Function in Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to examine the requirement for the p63 transcription factor in Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumor maintenance in an in vivo murine system.  A tamoxifen-inducible Keratin 14-driven Cre recombinase transgene was used to conditionally excise p63 in advanced murine SCC tumors.  These data show the context-dependent regulation of p63 target genes in cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA from murine Squamous Cell Carcinoma tumors was examined 1-3 days following genomic excision of TP63 in Keratin 14-expressing tumor cells.
