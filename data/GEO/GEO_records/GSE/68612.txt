TITLE
microRNA expression in CUTLL1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-ALL cell line CUTLL1 was assessed for microRNA expression. Cells were treated with DMSO (ctr) or DAPT (10uM) to inhibit Notch1 cleavage for 3d and then harvested.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were used per group (DMSO, n=3; DAPT, n=3).
