TITLE
Chem-Seq of chemical derivatives in MM1S cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An ability to map the global interactions of a chemical entity with chromatin genome-wide could provide new insights into the mechanisms by which a small molecule perturbs cellular functions. we developed a method that uses chemical derivatives and massively parallel DNA sequencing (Chem-Seq) to identify the sites bound by small chemical molecules throughout the human genome.

DESIGN
We developed in vivo and in vitro Chem-Seq protocols with a biotinylated derivative of small molecules.  In the in vivo protocol, Cells were first treated with biotinylated ligand and cross-linked with formaldehyde at the same time.  Cells were then lysed, sonicated to shear the DNA, and streptavidin beads were used to isolate biotinylated ligand and associated chromatin fragments.  We then used massively parallel sequencing to identify the enriched DNA fragments, and mapped these sequences to the genome. In in vitrol protocol, MM1.S cells were fixed and the derived sonicated lysate incubated with biotinylated drug to enrich for bound chromatin regions in vitro. We then used massively parallel sequencing to identify the enriched DNA fragments, and mapped these sequences to the genome.
