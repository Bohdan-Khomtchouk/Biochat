TITLE
Characterization of parental and rociletinib-resistant derived H1975 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through development of an in vivo orthotopic lung cancer model, we reveal an unanticipated pathway driving spontaneous metastasis that is orchestrated by the developmentally-regulated transcriptional repressor, Capicua (CIC).

DESIGN
RNAseq and DNA copy number analysis of H1975 (EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma) cells in the context of drug resistance to rociletinib
