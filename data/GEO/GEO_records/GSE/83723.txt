TITLE
Identifying Transcription Factors Expressed by V0v Spinal Cord Interneurons

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We isolated and expression profiled V0v spinal interneurons, as well as all spinal neurons and all trunk cells using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of different transgenic zebrafish lines in which these cells express fluorescent proteins at 27 hours post fertilization (hpf). We used a custom-designed Agilent microarray to study the expression of transcription factors in these cell types.

DESIGN
Twelve samples were analysed in total, all at 27 hours post fertilisation (hpf). Four biological replicates were performed for each of the three cell types under study - V0v spinal interneurons (isolated from Tg(evx1:EGFP)SU1), all spinal neurons (isolated from Tg(elavl3:EGFP)) and all trunk cells (FAC-sorted trunk cells).
