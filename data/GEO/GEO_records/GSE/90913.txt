TITLE
Altered Nucleocytoplasmic Proteome and Transcriptome Distributions in an In Vitro Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An integrated analysis of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the proteome and transcriptome demonstrated multiple candidate pathways including RNA processing/transport and protein synthesis and folding that may be relevant to the pathomechanism of ALS.

DESIGN
After subcellular fractionation of motoneuronal cell lines expressing human wild-type or mutant SOD1 (G93A), quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

PLATFORM
