TITLE
Identification of wild soybean miRNAs and their target genes responsive to aluminum stress

ORGANISM
Glycine soja

SUMMARY
In this study, two small RNA libraries and two degradome libraries were constructed from roots of Al-treated and Al-free Glycine soja seedlings. For miRNA, a total of 7,287,655 and 7,035,914 clean reads in Al-treated and Al-free small RNAs libraries were generated, and 105 known miRNAs ,51 p3/p5 strands of known miRNA and 80 novel miRNAs were identified. Among them, expression of 34 miRNAs was responsive to Al stress. Through degradome sequencing, 82 and 11 genes were identified as tagerts of known and novel miRNAs obtained from this study, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of target transcripts indicated that 52 out of 66 targets cleaved by conserved miRNA families may play role in regulation of transcription.

DESIGN
