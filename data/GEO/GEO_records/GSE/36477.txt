TITLE
Expression data from mammary macrophages isolated from MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to profile macrophages from mammary glands isolated from transgenic mice that express inducible FGFR1 in mammary epithelial cells (MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mice). The mice were treated with with dimerizer to activates iFGFR1 for 48 hours and 4 weeks to induce mammary hyperplasias. Control mice included non-transgenic littermates treated with dimerizer for the same amount of time.

DESIGN
Macrophages were sorted from mammary glands of MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice following dimerizer treatment using Cd11b-PE. Macrophages from 3 mice were pooled for each sample. RNA was extracted and analyzed using the Affymetrix Mouse 2.0 chip.
