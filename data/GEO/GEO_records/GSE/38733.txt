TITLE
Gene expression profile of STIM1 deficiency for cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STIM1 is a Ca2+ sensor of intracellular Ca2+ stores and essentially activates the Ca2+ entry channels of the plasma membrane. STIM1 is predicted to activate transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels and Orai channels, and has a critical role in promoting the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Gene array experiments were performed to analyze the effects of STIM1 deficiency using total RNA from the left ventricles of WT sham, WT TAC, STIM1KO sham and STIM1KO TAC 4 weeks after the operation.
