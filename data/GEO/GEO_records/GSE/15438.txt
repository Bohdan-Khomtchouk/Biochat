TITLE
High-throughput pyrosequencing of miRNAs from Medicago truncatula nodules and roots

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We have used deep sequencing of small RNAs from nodules and root apexes of the model legume Medicago truncatula, to identify 113 novel candidate miRNAs. These miRNAs (legume or Mt-specific) are encoded by 278 putative hairpin precursors in the M. truncatula genome. Several miRNAs are differentially expressed in nodules and root tips and large variety of targets could be predicted for these genes. Specific miRNA isoforms showed contrasting expression patterns in these tissues Keywords: Transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
3 samples examined: nodules, root tips, and root tips + NaCl
