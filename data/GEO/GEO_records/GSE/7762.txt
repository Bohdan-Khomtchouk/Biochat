TITLE
Morphine effects on striatal transcriptome in four inbred mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic opiate use produces molecular and cellular adaptations in the nervous system, leading to tolerance, physical dependence and addiction. Genome-wide comparison of morphine-induced changes in brain transcription of mouse strains with different opioid-related phenotypes provides an opportunity to discover the relationship between gene expression and behavioral response to the drug. Keywords: Drug response
