TITLE
Identification of gene expression patterns in lymphoma-prone SJL mice of different ages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SJL mice spontaneously develop mature B cell lineage lymphomas. These studies were designed to evaluate significant gene expression differences between spleens of control mice that do not develop lymphomas compared to spleens from SJL mice of differeing ages

DESIGN
22 samples were tested from 4 groups of mice - 10 samples from one group and 4 samples each from the other three groups.  One sample per array

PLATFORM
GPL18619 Agilent-017138 Mouse Array
