TITLE
comparison between salmonella wild type 14028s and salmonella mutant prgh in arabidopsis infection.-Transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis genes after treatment with Salmonella 14028s and Salmonella type three secretion system (T3SS) mutant prgh

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra11-01_prgh - comparison between salmonella wild type 14028s and salmonella mutant prgh in arabidopsis infection. - What is the transcriptomic reprogramming after Salmonella infection, What is the importance of the T3SS in the plant infection, Are there differences in gene expression between the 2 bacterial strains? What are the functions of these genes,         - Seedlings treated with S.Typhimurium 14028 WT and St 14028 prgH mutant.Mock treatment done with equal volume of MgCl2.

DESIGN
22 dye-swap - time course,treated vs untreated comparison
