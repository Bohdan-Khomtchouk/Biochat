TITLE
Probing Brachyury Function during ES cell differentiaiton

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To probe how Brachyury regulates its target genes, we performed mRNA-seq to analyze gene expression changes after Brachyury depletion by the lentivirus-mediated shRNA

DESIGN
WT and Brachytury Knockdown embryoid bodies were collected at EB day 4. Subsequently, mRNA-seq expriments were performed with whole embryoid bodies

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
