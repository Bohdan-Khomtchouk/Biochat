TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of medaka germ cells and gonadal somatic cells during the gonadal sex differentiation.

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed using germ cells and gonadal somatic cells  isolated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) from XX and XY embryos at st.33 and st.35.

DESIGN
Medaka germ cells (olvas-EGFP) and somatic cells (sox9b-DsRed) were isolated by FACS. The microarray experiments were done using three independent biological replicates.
