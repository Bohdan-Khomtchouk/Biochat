TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of tumors from Olfactory neuroblastoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The RNA from tumors of four olfactory neuroblastoma patients were studied to understand the molecular pathways perturbed in such tumors. The resulting up and down regulated genes were used to look for novel cellular pathways that are commonly perturbed in plfactory neuroblastoma

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from four FFPE olfactory neuroblastoma tumor was compared to commercially purchased healthy control RNA sample comprised of pooled RNA from three healthy tissues.
