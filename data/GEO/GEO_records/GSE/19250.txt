TITLE
Comparative Gene Expression Profiling of Olfactory Ensheathing Cells from Olfactory Bulb and Olfactory Mucosa

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to use global gene expression profiling to define intrinsic molecular differences that distinguish olfactory ensheathing cells from mucosa (OM-OECs) from olfactory ensheathing cells from olfactory bulb (OB-OECs). 10,000 OECs from olfactory mucosa (OM) or olfactory bulb (OB) were isolated from 4 rats.

DESIGN
Two-color experiment, OM (Cy5) vs. OB (Cy3) OECs. Biological replicates: 4. Paired samples.

PLATFORM
GPL4135 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Feature Number version)
