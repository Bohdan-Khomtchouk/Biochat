TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of nasopharyngeal carcinoma model system (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent malignancyt disease in Southeast Asia among the Chinese population. Aberrant regulation of transcripts has been implicated in many types of cancers including NPC. Herein, we characterized mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of NPC model systems.

DESIGN
Matched total mRNA and small RNA of undifferentiated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC xenograft X666 and its derived cell line C666, well-differentiated NPC cell line HK1, and the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP460 have been sequenced by Solexa technology.

PLATFORM
