TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional responses to Deepwater Horizon oil in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) embryos and larvae

ORGANISM
Sciaenops ocellatus

SUMMARY
Purpose:To investigate the transcriptomic profiles in red drum embryos reflective of the DWH oil toxicity at different critical windows of development and to predict the most impacted biological processes and pathways based on differentially expressed gene transcripts at different developmental stages using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Methods:Total mRNA profiles of 24, 48, 72 hpf red drum larvae after slick and source oil exposure were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500. Results:Oil type-dependent transcriptional effects were observed, with more significant by source oil exposure at 24 and 48 h, and similar responses by source and slick at 72 hpf. Informatic analyses indicated source oil exposure started significant perturbation in metabolism, AhR, visual, and cardiac-associated genes as early as 24 hpf.  Both source and slick oil significantly affected EIF2 pathway, nervous and cardiovascular systems from 48 hpf to 72 hpf.

DESIGN
Total mRNA profiles of 24, 48, 72 hpf red drum larvae after slick and source oil exposure were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500.
