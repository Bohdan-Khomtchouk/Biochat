TITLE
RNA-seq data from six cell types for cell type phylogenetics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from a total of 12 samples (6 different cell types, each with two biological replicates) to infer the relationship among those cell types

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in six different human cell types grown in culture with two biological replicates for each cell type
