TITLE
Gene expression in lacrimal gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the gene expression of mouse embryonic lacrimal gland and its developmental related organs such as harderian gland and eye lid. We performed microarray using them.

DESIGN
To analyze the gene expression patterns of  lacrimal gland epithelium (LGE), we used mouse whole 7w LG and 7w harderian gland (HG), and separated epithelial and mesenchymal tissues from the lacrimal glands, harderian glands and eye lid (Lid), including ocular conjunctiva of embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) of mouse embryos.
