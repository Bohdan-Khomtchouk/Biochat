TITLE
Dysregulated expression of genes in regulatory T cells from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the global gene expression pattern of Tregs between healthy donors and prostate cancer patients.  We found that genes related to cell cycle, cellular proliferation, immune responses, hematological system development and function were differentially expressed in Tregs from prostate cancer patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples of Tregs, isolated from peripheral blood, were obtained from three separate healthy donors and three metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.  Global gene expression pattern was examined by performing GeneChip microarray hybridization.  Genes differentially expressed between the two groups of donors were sorted and categorized based on their biological functions.
