TITLE
Effect of knock down of LASP-1 on luminal breast cancer cells (MCF7)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear LASP-1 has a direct correlation with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Gene expression analysis of MCF7 human breast cancer cells cultured in 3D-Matrigel was performed. Up regulation of cell junction proteins, extracellular matrix proteins and down regulation of MMP 9 and 2  were observed. This corroborates well with the involvement of LASP-1 in cell migration and chemotaxis.

DESIGN
Non-silencing (control) and LASP-1 knock down MCF7 cells were cultured on 3D-Matrigel, total RNA was extracted and anlyzed - 4 biological replicates each. The first biological replicate was done as a pilot. Biological replicates 2-4 were run as a second set after pilot.
