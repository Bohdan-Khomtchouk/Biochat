TITLE
Transcriptional changes in Aspergillus flavus-infected maize kernels

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Maize kernels are susceptible to infection by the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus flavus. Infection results in reduction of grain quality and contamination of kernels with the highly carcinogenic mycotoxin, aflatoxin. To understand host response to infection by the fungus, transcription of approximately 9,000 maize genes were monitored during the host-pathogen interaction with a custom-designed Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® DNA array. More than 1,000 maize genes were found differentially expressed at a fold change of 2 or greater. This included the up regulation of defense-related genes and signaling pathways. Transcriptional changes also were observed in primary metabolism genes. Starch biosynthetic genes were down regulated during infection, while genes encoding maize hydrolytic enzymes, presumably involved in the degradation of host reserves, were up regulated. These data indicate that infection of the maize kernel A. flavus induced metabolic changes in the kernel, including the production of a defense response, as well as a disruption in kernel development.

DESIGN
Maize kernels were mock inoculated at the blister (R2) or dough (R4) stage or inoculated with A. flavus at the blister (R2), milk (R3), dough (R4), or dent (R5) stage, and harvested 4 days later. Each treatment consisted of three biological replications. For each biological replication, 8 kernels were ground and RNA was isolated and further processed.
