TITLE
Cardiac gene expression (random section containing both ventricles) in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (set 2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to vehicle or 0.162 mg carbon black nanoparticles by intratracheal installation and were sacrificed 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure. Gene expression was investigated in two sets of mice treated according to the identical exposure protocol. MicroRNAs were investigated in the second set of mice.

DESIGN
Individual total RNA (200 ng) from 6 mice per treatment group (control and 0.162mg) and Universal Mouse Reference total RNA (Stratagene, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
