TITLE
Microarray profiling of renal medulla / papilla and cortex during postnatal development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to establish a comprehensive transcriptome atlas that enables identification of key molecular pathways and morphogenic events regulating postnatal renal medulla/papillary and cortex development. To achieve this, a microarray expression profiling was performed on postnatal day 0-90 renal medulla and cortex obtained from CD1 male mice.

DESIGN
Renal medulla and cortex were regionally dissected from postnatal day 0-90 CD1 male mice, and total RNA extracted for microarray expression profiling. Each time point consists of RNA pooled from 4 biological replicates, and an Agilent Bioanalyser test was performed to assess RNA integrity prior to sample pooling. The microarray data was analysed with the use of lumi and limma packages (Bioconductor) in R.
