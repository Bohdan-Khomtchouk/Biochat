TITLE
DNA methylation profiling in WT-AG-haESCs, DKO-AG-haESCs and round spermatids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated RRBS data to analyse the DNA methylation profiling among WT-AG-haESCs, DKO-AG-haESCs and round spermatids, we found deletion of H19 and Gtl2 DMRs do not change the methylation patterns in AG-haESCs base on all detected CpG sites.

DESIGN
We used round spermatids as control and analysed the DNA methylation profiles of all the cell lines were by RRBS.

PLATFORM
