TITLE
Identification of TGA-regulated genes in response to phytoprostane A1 and OPDA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and phytoprostane A1 (PPA1) are cyclopentenone oxylipins that are formed via the enzymatic jasmonate pathway and a nonenzymatic, free radicalâ€“catalyzed pathway, respectively. Both types of cyclopentenone oxylipins induce the expression of genes related to detoxification, stress responses, and secondary metabolism, a profile clearly distinct from that of the cyclopentanone jasmonic acid. To investigate the role of TGA transcriction factors in oxylipin responses, the regulation of gene expression by OPDA and PPA1 defective in the expression of TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6 was analyzed using Affymetrix ATH1 chips.
