TITLE
TEL-JAK2 dependent transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TEL-JAK2 is a fusion oncogene resulting from a t(9;12) chromosomal translocation in T-ALL, translated as a constitutively activated TEL-JAK2 tyrosine kinase. Mice carrying a TEL-JAK2 transgene develop T-ALL. Gene deregulated in TEL-JAK2 T-ALL cells as compared to  mouse thymocytes were identified

DESIGN
Leukemic cells were collected from the thymus of terminally-ill  TEL-JAK2 mice; thymocytes were collected from the thymus of 2 months-old mice. All mice on C57B/6 background. RNA was extracted from each sample and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
