TITLE
Comparative temporal analysis of wild-type Ptf1a, Neurog2 and mutant Ptf1a (Ptf1aW224A/W242A) overexpressing Xenopus explant transcriptomes after 6 and 25 hours of DEX induction.

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
RNA-seq reveals the downstream gene regulatory network of wild-type Ptf1a, Neurog2 and Ptf1aW224A/W242A

DESIGN
X.laevis embryos were injected in the animal pole of both blastomeres at the two-cell stage with 20 pg mRNA encoding for ptf1a-GR, GR-neurog2 or ptf1aW224A/W242A-GR. At blastula stage, inijected DEX-treated animal caps served as controls (CC).
