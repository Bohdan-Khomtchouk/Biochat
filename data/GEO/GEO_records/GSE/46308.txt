TITLE
Expression analysis of Prdm4 mutant and overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of wild-type, Prdm4 null and Prdm4-EGFP overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina whole genome V2 arrays. The hypothesis tested was that Prdm4 regulates gene expression consistant with Prdm4 genomic binding identified by ChIP-seq

DESIGN
Prdm4 null embryonic stem cells were generated by gene targeting.  Prdm4-EGFP overexpressing cells were generated through stable transfection.  Total RNA was obtained from six wild-type ES cell clones, four Prdm4 null mutant ES cell clones and six Prdm4-EGFP overexpressing ES cell clones and hybridized to Illumina WG6_V2 arrays
