TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of TUDCA on 1 week transveres aortic constriction (TAC) mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in the present study was that ameliorating ER stress by TUDCA could reduce the cardiac remodeling in TAC mice. Results provide important information of the genes that were up- or down-regulated in Veh-TAC operated animals in comparison to Sham, TUDCA -Sham and TUDCA-TAC mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from vehicle treated sham (Veh-Sham)(control), vehicle treated TAC (Veh-TAC), TUDCA treated sham (TUDCA-Sham) and TUDCA treated TAC (TUDCA-TAC) were compared in this study, after 1 week of TUDCA treatment, effect of TUDCA on cardiac remodeling was evaluated.
