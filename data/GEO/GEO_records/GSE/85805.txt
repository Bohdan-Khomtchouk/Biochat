TITLE
Comparison of F4/80 high and low peritoneal macrophages in H.polygyrus - Salmonella Typhimurium co-infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are involved in many different biological processes (e.g. tissue homeostasis, embryonic development, immune defence against invading pathogens). To be able to deal with these different tasks macrophages adopt distinct activation phenotypes tailored to the situation. However, macrophages show a remarkable degree of plasticity and can change their activation phenotype in response to new environmental triggers. Macrophages recruited to the site of infection can be derived from two main sources, blood monocytes and tissue resident macrophages. Of note, different types of pathogens lead to the accumulation of different types of macrophages. Thus, we have asked here whether helminth expanded, tissue resident derived macrophages will change their activation phenotype in vivo in response to consecutive bacterial co-infection.types of macrophages.

DESIGN
F4/80 high and low macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of na√Øve, single H.polygyrus / Salmonella Typhimurium or consecutively co-infected C57BL/6J females and sorted using flow cytometry. Four biological replicates per group were used.
