TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of NF-kB's Rel and RelA proteins

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Rel and RelA proteins were stably expressed in the chicken DT40 pre-B cell line and analyzed by transcription profiling to identify  transformation-impacting genes regulated by NF-kB’s oncogenic v-Rel and c-Rel proteins. This analysis uncovered both common and differential  gene expression profiles in cells expressing Rel vs. RelA proteins, and revealed that Rel protein expression can lead to gene-specific  transcriptional repression, as seen for key B-cell receptor (BCR) components and signaling molecules like B-cell linker (BLNK), the B-cell  adaptor for PI3K (BCAP) and Igλ. These were also downregulated in cells expressing a transformation-competent chimeric RelA/v-Rel protein,  suggesting a correlation with the capacity of Rel proteins to transform lymphocytes. DNA binding, ChIP and transformation assays indicate  that downregulation of BLNK and BCAP is an important contributing factor to the malignant transformation of lymphocytes by Rel and suggest that gene repression may be as important as transcriptional activation for the transforming activity of Rel proteins. Keywords: Comparative transcriptional profiling
