TITLE
Gene expression of A204 parental and acquired resistant cells treated with Pazopanib, Dasatinib, and Sunitinib.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant rhadboid tumours (MRTs) are lethal paediatric cancers characterised by a deficiency in the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1. Here we employ an integrated molecular profiling and chemical biology approach to demonstrate that the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) PDGFRÎ± and FGFR1 are coactivated in MRT cells and that dual blockade of these receptors has synergistic efficacy. Gene expression analysis of the four cell lines in the presence of TKI showed that the resistant sublines clustered together with the untreated parental cells and confirmed that PDGFRA was among the most highly downregulated genes in the resistant cells.

DESIGN
Microarray on parental and acquired resistant A204 cells treated with Pazopanib, Dasatinib, and Sunitinib.
