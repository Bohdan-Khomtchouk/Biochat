TITLE
Gene expression profiles of control and EWS-FLI1-transduced neural crest stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles were generated from hESC-derived neural crest stem cells following transduction with GFP control vector or EWS-FLI1 vector. Expression was analyzed in stem cell conditions 5 days after transduction (undifferentiated conditions) and after 6 weeks in differentiation media (differentiation conditions). Changes in gene expression over time were compared between control and EWS-FLI1 expresssing cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 replicates for each of 4 conditions (undifferentiated control, undifferentiated EWS-FLI1, differentiated control and differentiated EWS-FLI1. Samples were analyzed by Affymetrix exon arrays using standard procedures.
