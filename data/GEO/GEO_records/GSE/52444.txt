TITLE
Effects of RNAi protein overexpression in mutant cells on H3K9 dimethylation in fission yeast cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We test the effects of overexpressing RNAi proteins Dcr1, Rdp1, or Ago1 in wildtype, dcr1∆, ago1∆, or rdp1∆ cells. We find that overexpression does not generally affect H3K9me2 at euchromatic loci, but there are varying effects in H3K9me2 on centromeric heterochromatin.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide enrichment in H3K9 dimethylation in fission yeast haploid cells
