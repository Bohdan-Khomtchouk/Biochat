TITLE
Increased DNA Methylation of Dnmt3b-Targets Impairs Leukemogenesis (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we analyzed global gene expression changes that were associated with over expression of Dnmt3b in MLL-AF9 induced leukemias using the Affymetrix microarray platform.

DESIGN
Changes in global gene expression were determined with Affymetrix microarrays in MLL-AF9 induced leukemias over expressing Dnmt3b.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
