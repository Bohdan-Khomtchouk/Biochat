TITLE
Cross-species transcriptional network analysis defines shared inflammatory responses in murine and human lupus nephritis [Glomeruli]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from human with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and hypertensive nephropathy (HT) We used microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of microdissected renal biopsies from patients with IgAN and HT

DESIGN
RNA from glomeruli and tubulointerstitial compartments was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
