TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with vehicle or YW3-56

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PAD4 is overexpressed in many cancer cells. We developed PAD inhibitors that efficiently inhibit the cancer cell growth. One inhibitor YW3-56 could efficently induce cell death of triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We used microarray to detail the global gene expression of MDA-MB-231 before and after YW3-56 treatment and identify significant up-regulated or down-regulated genes by YW3-56

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or YW3-56. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarry.
