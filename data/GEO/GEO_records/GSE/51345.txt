TITLE
Genomic and Transcriptomic Analyses of the Facultative Methanotroph, Methylocystis Strain SB2

ORGANISM
Methylocystis sp. SB2

SUMMARY
Here we present the assembled genome of the facultative methanotroph, Methylocystis strain SB2, along with assessment of its transcriptome when grown on methane vs. ethanol.  As expected, transcriptomic analyses indicate methane is converted to carbon dioxide via the canonical methane oxidation pathway for energy generation, and that carbon is assimilated at the level of formaldehyde via the serine cycle.  When grown on ethanol, it appears this strain converts ethanol to acetyl-CoA and then utilizes the TCA cycle for energy generation and the ethylmalonyl CoA pathway for the production of biomass.

DESIGN
All cultures were grown in triplicates for subsequent DNA and RNA extraction as well as for subsequent sequencing using Illumina. Transcriptomic analysis results presented in this Series.
