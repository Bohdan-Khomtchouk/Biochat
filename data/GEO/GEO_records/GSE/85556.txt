TITLE
Expression profile of HNF1A knockdown and overexpression in 22RV1 and LNCaP cells respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine genes regulated by HNF1A in 22Rv1, we performed siRNA  mediated knockdown of HNF1A using pooled siHNF1A (L-008215-00-0005 5 nmol) and pooled siSCR purchased from Dharmacon.  RNA was harvested 3 days after transfection and gene expression profiling was performed. Similarly to determine genes regulated by HNF1A in LNCaP, we performed retroviral transduction of  LNCaP cells in duplicate for HNF1A  and empty vector control expression. cDNA for HNF1A in RC211201 vector (origene) was subcloned  into a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral vector with hygromycin selection marker (Addgene). After 3 days of transduction, cells were selected for four days in hygromycin and later on RNA was harvested for gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq.
