TITLE
A model system for assessing the ability of tag sequencing to detect genes specific for malignant B-cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to develop a quantification method that can be used to assess the ability of tag-seq to detect malignant B-cell transcripts. The data support that tumour cell concentration is an important variable with fundamental impact on gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
We analysed eight serial dilutions of the malignant B-cell line, OCI-Ly8, into the embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, by tag-sequencing. No technical replicates were performed.
