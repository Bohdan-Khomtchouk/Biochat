TITLE
Microarray analysis of Etrog citron (Citrus medica L.) reveals changes in chloroplast, cell wall, peroxidase and symporter activities in response to viroid infection

ORGANISM
Citrus medica

SUMMARY
The main objective of the present study was to analyze the effect of a severe isolate of CEVd on gene expression of Etrog citron plants was performed not only in late (post-symptomatic) stages of infection but also in early (pre-symptomatic) stages. A genome-wide 20K cDNA mycroarray of citrus was used.

DESIGN
Four replicates for each sample category (time-point 0: healthy plants; time-point 1: infected plants at the symptomless stage; time-point 2: infected plants at the symptomatic stage) were generated and compared by a reference design .
