TITLE
Neuron-specific transcriptome response to loss of shep

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report RNA-seq data obtained from FACS-isolated live neurons at third instar larval or P14 pupal stage, and from BG3 cells. RNA from neurons with RNAi-based loss of shep or GFP control is used to construct stranded RNA-seq library. RNA from BG3 cells treated with dsRNA targeting shep or GFP is used to construct RNA-seq library.

DESIGN
RNA-seq data of loss-of-shep neurons and control neurons in larval and pupal stages, and from shep-depleted or control BG3 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
