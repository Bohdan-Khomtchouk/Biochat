TITLE
Affymetrix PrimeView human gene expression of different cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators by degrading the target mRNA. miRNAs can regulate and control a variety of biological processes. We want to use these Affymetrix PrimeView microarrays to find different genes between negative control cells and miR-484 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were amplified, labeled and purified by using GeneChip 3'IVT Express Kit (Cat#901229, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturer's instructions to obtain biotin labeled cRNA.Array hybridization and wash was performed using GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (Cat#900720, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) in Hybridization Oven 645 (Cat#00-0331-220V, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Fluidics Station 450 (Cat#00-0079, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were scanned by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Cat#00-00212, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Command Console Software 3.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) with default settings. Raw data were normalized by RMA algorithm, Gene Spring Software 11.0 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).
