TITLE
DNA methylation landscape of fat deposit and fatty acid composition variation in obese and lean pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Obese and lean type pig breeds show obvious differences in fat deposit and fatty acid composition. However, the underlying diversities in DNA methylation that related to the phenotypic differentiation have not been clarified. Here, we employed Landrace pigs (a leaner, Western breed) and Rongchang pigs (a fatty, Chinese breed) as models to survey genome-wide DNA methylation in the backfat adipose using a methylated DNA immunoprecopitation sequencing approch.We sequenced 6 methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) libraries, generated 38.27 gigabases (Gb) of methylated DNA immunoprecitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) data from the six samples, representing about 15 times the size of the pig genome. About 88.89% of all reads could be aligned on the pig reference genome (Sus scrofa 10.2) using the SOAP2 software, and about 76.68% of reads had a unique genomic location. There was 483 different methylated regions (DMRs) located in genes promoter region, which are mainly involved in the processes of “olfactory and sensory activity” and “lipid metabolism”. This study provides a solid basis for exploring the epigenetic mechanisms of fat deposit and fatty acid composition, have benefit to promoting human health diet and improving pork quality and production efficiency.

DESIGN
The aim of our study is to identify different methylated genes that are linked to the phynotypic of fat deposit and fatty acid composition variation in obese and lean pigs
