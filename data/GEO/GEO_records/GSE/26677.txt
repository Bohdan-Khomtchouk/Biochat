TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for breast cancer stem cells (SP cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further compare gene expression profile between breast cancer stem cells (SP cells) and non-SP cells, we have employed illumina GEX microarray as a discovery platform to identify gene differential expression between SP with non-SP cells.

DESIGN
SP analysis and sorting were done using a FACSVantage SE.The breast cancer cells were sorted into SP and non-SP cells.Total RNA was isolated from the FACS-sorted SP or non-SP cells, and gene expression signiture was detected by microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL6884 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip
