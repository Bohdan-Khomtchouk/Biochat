TITLE
Agilent 244K aCGH data for 10 human gastric cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number alteration (CNA) is a good signpost to identify cancer related genes. CNAs were analyzed using the Agilent 244K array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in fresh-frozen tumor and matched normal tissues from 10 gastric cancer patients.

DESIGN
Whole genomic CNAs in 10  human gastric cancers were analyzed using the Agilent aCGH-244K arrays. Matched normal tissues were used as the reference.
