TITLE
RNA-seq from ENCODE/LICR

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Yin Shen mailto:y7shen@ucsd.edu ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu ). Using RNA-Seq (Mortazavi et al., 2008), high-resolution genome-wide maps of the mouse transcriptome across multiple mouse (C57Bl/6) tissues and primary cells were generated.

DESIGN
Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse ). RNA-Seq RNA samples from tissues and primary cells were extracted from TrizolÂ® according to protocol (Invitrogen). PolyA+ RNA was purified with the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen). The mRNA libraries were prepared for strand-specific sequencing as described previously (Parkhomchuk et al., 2009). Sequencing and Analysis Samples were sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer II, Genome Analyzer IIx and HiSeq 2000 platforms for 36 cycles. Image analysis, base calling and alignment to the mouse genome version mm9 were performed using Illumina's RTA. Alignment to the mouse genome was performed using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009). Wig files were generated by TopHat and expression levels were calculated with Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010).
