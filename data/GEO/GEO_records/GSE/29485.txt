TITLE
Expression data from Mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice lacking the function of the PcG protein CBX2 (also known as M33) show defects in gonadal, adrenal, and splenic development. In particular, XY knockout mice develop ovaries but not testes, and the gonads are hypoplastic in both sexes. To clarify the molecular basis of the defects, RNA prepared from both wild type and KO gonads were subjected to microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic gonads of Cbx2 knockout (KO) were sectioned and recovered at E11.5  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four different genotypes of embryos at E11.5 (XY WT, XX WT, XY Cbx2 KO, and XX Cbx2 KO) were frozen in OCT compound without fixation. They were sectioned to 30 Î¼m slices and stained with hematoxylin. The developing gonadal cells localized by GATA4 immunostaining and morphology were prepared using a Laser Microdissection System. The specimens prepared from two or three individuals were combined into one group, and three groups were prepared for each genotype.
