Expression data from Mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice lacking the function of the PcG protein CBX2 (also known as M33) show defects in gonadal, adrenal, and splenic development. In particular, XY knockout mice develop ovaries but not testes, and the gonads are hypoplastic in both sexes. To clarify the molecular basis of the defects, RNA prepared from both wild type and KO gonads were subjected to microarray analyses.
