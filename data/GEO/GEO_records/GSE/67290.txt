TITLE
Dexamethasone treatment alters levels of insulin, leptin, and adiponectin but does not have metabolic effects across generations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis of sperms did not identify significant transcriptome changes upon dexamethasone treatment in mice. These results are consistent with the observation that dexamethasone treatment of parental male mice did not induce metabolic changes in the F1 generation.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression microarray analysis of sperms derived from dexamethasone-treated (n=8) or control mice (n=7).
