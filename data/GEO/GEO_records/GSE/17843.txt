Human osteoblast treated with recombinant TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global expression profile of human osteoblast treated with recombinant TGF-beta compared to human osteoblast treated with growth media alone

DESIGN
Dye-swap design with 6 biological replicates. Three arrays performed with TGF-beta treated samples on channel 1 and media-alone treated on channel 2; three arrays performed with TGF-beta treated samples on channel 2 and media-alone on channel 1.
