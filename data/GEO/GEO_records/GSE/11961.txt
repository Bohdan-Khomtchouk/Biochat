TITLE
Gene expressions of memory B cells and other type of B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To obtain insight into the genetic basis of the increase of functional activity of memory B cells over time, we compared the gene expression profiles of day 7 and day 40 NP-specific/IgG1 memory B cells, GC B cells and plasma cells in immunized WT mice and na√Øve B cells, before and after activation in vitro.
