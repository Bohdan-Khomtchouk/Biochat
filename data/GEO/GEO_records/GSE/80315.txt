TITLE
Boxer dataset for genome-wide association study of modifiers of risk of canine degenerative myelopathy in dogs homozygous for SOD1 mutation

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a canine disease very similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans. We previously showed that DM is a promising model for ALS, as genome-wide association identified a mutation in SOD1, a known ALS gene. In this study, we identify a modifier gene, SP110, which strongly affects overall disease risk and age-of-onset in Pembroke Welsh corgis at risk of DM. Dissecting the complex genetics of this disease in a model organism may lead to new insights about risk and progression in both canine and human patients.

DESIGN
15 DM-affected and 10 unaffected Boxers homozygous for SOD1 mutation genotyped using the Illumina CanineHD array (~170,000 SNPs genomewide)

PLATFORM
GPL17481 Illumina CanineHD BeadChip
