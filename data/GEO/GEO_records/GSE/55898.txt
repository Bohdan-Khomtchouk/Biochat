TITLE
Gene expression profile of hESC/hIPC-derived keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To induce the differentiation, undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (both hESC andh iPSC; T0 time point) were transferred into 20% O2 atmosphere environment and treated with mTESR1 basal media supplemented with 1 μM ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 ng/ml BMP4 (R & D) for 7 days (Induction). To select for the cells that acquired early ectodermal fate, cells were harvested and re-plated onto freshly prepared 3D human dermal fibroblast ECM at a density of 5-10x10^3 cells per cm2 and grown in DMEM:Ham F12 (3:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1 μM ATRA and 25 ng/ml BMP4 for a further 7 days (Selection). To enrich for putative epidermal progenitors, rapid-adhesion to type IV collagen-coated dishes was used, and the rapidly-adhering cells were cultured in DK SFM supplemented with 1 μM ATRA for 7 days (Enrichment). After that, the cells were cultured in EpiLife medium (Life Technologies) for a further 7 days (Expansion) before final harvest (T3 time point) and analysis. We analyzed here gene expression profiles of undifferentiated hESC/hiPSC (T0), hESC/hIPC-derived keratinocytes (T3) and primary normal human keratinocytes from skin biopsy (NHK). We found that hESC/hIPC-derived keratinocytes are similar to NHK.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of undifferentiated (T0) hESC (KCL034) and hiPSC lines (iKCL004, iKCL011) were compared with hESC/hiPSC-derived keratinocytes (T3), primary human keratinocyes (NHK) and fibroblasts (BJ).
