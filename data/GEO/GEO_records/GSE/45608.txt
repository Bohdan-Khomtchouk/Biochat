TITLE
NaMYC2 transcription factor regulates a subset of plant defense responses in Nicotiana attenuata

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of significantly altered transcripts in Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced MYC2 expression after induction with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae.

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata EV and MYC2_VIGS plants was measured at 1 hour after induction with oral secretions of Manduca sexta larvae. Three independent experiments were performed with EV plants and three independent experiments were performed with MYC2_VIGS plants. A total of 47 genes were identified as differentially regulated in MYC2_VIGS plants compared to EV plants.
