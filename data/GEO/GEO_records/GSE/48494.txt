TITLE
Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 actively changes the expression profiles of human cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the global transcription profiling of human cell lines upon colonization with Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 by using DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
We decided to use HT29 monolayer as an in vitro model to investigate the molecular impact of B. bifidum PRL2010 on human intestinal transcriptome. HT29 monolayers cultivated at 15 days of post confluence were placed in contact with PRL2010 cells for a range of time spanning from 0 h, 1 h (T1), 2 h (T2) to 4 h (T4).
