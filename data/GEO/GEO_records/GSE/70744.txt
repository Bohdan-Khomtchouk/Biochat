TITLE
Multiple hierarchies of Polycomb targeting to Drosophila genome (Part2)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of development. Here we compared genomic distribution of Psc protein in cultured Drosophila cells lacking Su(z)12 protein to that of the wild type.

DESIGN
ChIP of Psc protein coupled to next-generation sequencing from wild-type and Su(z)12 - null cultured cells. Done in two replicates, with DNA from corresponding chromatin inputs sequenced as a control.
