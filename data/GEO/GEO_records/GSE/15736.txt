TITLE
Expression data from Smad4-siRNA bEnd3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-beta/Smads signaling plays important roles in vascular integrity. To identify potential Smad4 target genes in brain endothelial cells that control cerebrovascular integrity, the microarray assay was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of bEnd3 transfected with Smad4-siRNA and control-siRNA.

DESIGN
bEnd3 cells were infected by Smad4-siRNA or control-siRNA retrovirus particles produced by PLAT-E packaging cells and selected by puromycin. The specific and control RNAi cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two independent infections were performed and samples were pooled in order to obtain representative populations.
