TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic islets from Men1flf RIP-Cre mice, Rbp2flf RIP-Cre mice, Men1flf Rbp2flf RIP-Cre mice and matched control.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The menin tumor suppressor protein (Men1) is deficient in many endocrine tumors and forms an active complex with MLL family histone methyltransferases.  This Men1 complex promotes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation at target loci including homeobox genes and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes. The loss of Men1 may be tumorigenic because it leads to decreased histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation resulting in expressional changes of specific genes. Reversing tumorigenesis induced by a Men1 deficiency might be achieved by inhibition of histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase Rbp2 (Kdm5a).  To this end, pancreatic islets from Men1f|f, Rbp2f|f and Men1f|f Rbp2f|f mice were expression profiled to determine what transcriptional changes induced by  a Men1 deficiency are reversed by the loss of Rpb2.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islets were isolated from Men1flf RIP-Cre mice, Rbp2flf RIP-Cre mice, Men1flf Rbp2flf RIP-Cre mice and two month old matched control mice.  Total mRNA was extracted from islets and expression profiled on microarrays.
