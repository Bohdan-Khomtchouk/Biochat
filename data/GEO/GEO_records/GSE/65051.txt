TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of colonic epithelial cells in adult rats born with intra-uterine growth retardation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The impact of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) was analyzed on gene expression of the colonic epithelial cells from adults rats fed a standard or a high-fat diet. The hypothesis tested in this study was that IUGR induces sustainable effects on colonocyte transcriptome that may alter further nutritional adaptations at adulthood, especially to high-fat diet.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from control (C) and IUGR (R) rats fed chow (Normal Diet, ND) or  high-fat diet (HFD).
