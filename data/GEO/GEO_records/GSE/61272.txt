TITLE
Expression data of U2OS ER-HA-E2F1 cells induced by OHT with and without knockdown of NFYB

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
E2F1 induces numerous genes, including transcription factors, upon activation. The transcription factors then further cooperates with E2F1 to regulate the target genes and enhance the transcriptional effect. We used microarrays to analyze genes upregulated upon E2F1 activation by OHT with and without knockdown of NFYB and identified genes that are targets of both transcription factors.

DESIGN
NFYB was knocked down by siRNA by transfection. Cells were serum starved for 24 hours before induction of E2F1 by 80nM OHT. Samples were collected before induction and at 4 and 8 hours after induction
