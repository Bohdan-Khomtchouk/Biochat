TITLE
Local regulation and clinical impact of complement gene expression in deceased and living donor kidney allografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biopsy samples obtained at implantation segregated in 2 distinct groups according to donor origin, with a cluster of 319 unique identified genes higher expressed in DD compared to LD kidneys, and 329 genes lower expressed (false discovery rate < 5%). Using pathway analysis software a significant local renal overrepresentation of complement genes in DD implantation biopsies was identified. Complement gene expression in DD kidneys related both to donor death and cold ischemia duration, and was associated with a slower onset of renal allograft function. In post-transplantation protocol biopsies, there was a continued overexpression of complement genes, regardless of donor source. The local renal complement gene expression variability in post-transplantation biopsies correlated with renal graft function. This study demonstrates a significant and clinically relevant local overexpression of complement genes in DD kidneys at engraftment and continuous functionally important regulation of complement gene expression after transplantation, regardless of donor source. Targeted therapy interfering with complement activation is an attractive therapeutic target that deserves further investigation in solid organ transplantation. Keywords: time course, genomics gene expression

DESIGN
A total of 95 human renal allograft protocol biopsies were included in this study, 28 biopsies (14 DD, 14 LD) obtained at implantation prior to revascularization and 67 protocol biopsies obtained after transplantation. Whole genome expression profiles were assessed using microarrays.
