TITLE
Transcriptome of Escherichia coli cells in coculture (Ile auxotroph and Leu auxotroph)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We conducted experimental evolution of E. coli a mutual cross-feeding coculture, composed of two genetically-engineered Escherichia coli populations, I- and L-, which lack genes for biosynthesis of Ile (ilvE gene) and Leu (leuB gene), respectively. These two populations grew in a coculture by complementing required nutrients each other. After 883 generations of evolution experiments, we measured evolutionary changes in transcriptome, and we found ABC transporters for the branched chain amino acids (Ile, Leu, and Val) were significantly increased in both I- and L-. Also, we got other various results that would be interesting to discuss.

DESIGN
In total, 20 samples.
