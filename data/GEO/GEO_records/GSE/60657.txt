TITLE
DNA methylation at transcription start sites blocks TBP binding and transcription onset by RNApolII [ChIPbisSeq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of ChIP bisulfite sequencing (ChIPbisSeq) to establish the methylation state of DNA bound to RNApol2 phosphorylated in Ser5 (RNAPol2Ser5) in the mouse cortex. We first profiled the RNAPol2Ser5 binding using regular ChIPSeq from 45 million raw read pairs (31 million unique pairs were aligned to the genome). Then we used bisulfite converted DNA immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RNAPol2Ser5 (87 million raw read pairs, 38 million unique read pairs aligned to the genome) to map RNAPol2Ser5 sites and to establish the methylation state at these sites.

DESIGN
Examination of methylation state at RNAPol2Ser5 binding sites in the mouse cortex.
