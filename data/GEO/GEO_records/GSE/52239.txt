TITLE
Acetylated Histone Reader Brd4 functions as Repair Adaptor in Immunoglobulin Class Switch Recombination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Class Switch Recombination (CSR) is a B cell specific genomic alteration induced by activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent DNA break, followed by repair and recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. The involvement of several chromatin-associated factors in promoting AID-induced DNA break formation has been reported. However, the involvement of chromatin adaptors at the repair phase of CSR remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that acetylated histone reader Brd4 is critical to the repair and recombination step of CSR. Brd4 was recruited to the AID-induced DNA break region, and depletion of Brd4 from the S region chromatin by knockdown or a chemical inhibitor JQ1 causes CSR impairment without affecting AID-induced DNA break generation. Such inhibition of Brd4 suppressed the accumulation of 53BP1 and UNG at the cleaved S regions, perturbed switch donor-switch acceptor microhomology length and reduced Igh/c-myc translocation. We conclude that Brd4 serves as a histone-reader platform required for the recruitment of CSR repair components.

DESIGN
Brd4 were depleted from the chromatin by either siRNA treatment or JQ1 (40nM) addition in CH12F3-2A cells in the presence of CIT stimulation. RNA from each samples were extracted and relative difference in transcript level were compared with control RNAi- and DMSO-treated, CIT-stimulated samples.
