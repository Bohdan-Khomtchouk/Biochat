TITLE
Cocaine-regulated expression of striatal microRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We cataloged miRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens and at striatal synapses in control and chronically cocaine-treated mice. We identified cocaine-responsive miRNAs, synaptically-enriched and depleted miRNA families, and confirmed cocaine-induced changes in protein expression for several predicted synaptic target genes.

DESIGN
Analysis of small RNA from Mus musculus nucleus accumbens (NAc) and postsynaptic densities (PSD) with and without chronic cocaine treatment.
