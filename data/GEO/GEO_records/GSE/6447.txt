TITLE
Diet and phenobarbital affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism

SUMMARY
High cholesterol diet and xenobiotic treatment induce changes in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. Mice were either 7 days on high cholesterol diet or were treated with phenobarbital. Liver samples were analyzed using Sterolgene v0 cDNA microarrays. Sterolgene microarray is a tool designed to enable focused studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. We show that one week of cholesterol diet down-regulates cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp3 family). Phenobarbital treatment also up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp2b and Cyp3a families). We can conclude that the Sterolgene series of cDNA microarrays represent novel original tool, enabling focused and cost-wise studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. Keywords: Treatment and diet effects
