TITLE
Diet and phenobarbital affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High cholesterol diet and xenobiotic treatment induce changes in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. Mice were either 7 days on high cholesterol diet or were treated with phenobarbital. Liver samples were analyzed using Sterolgene v0 cDNA microarrays. Sterolgene microarray is a tool designed to enable focused studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. We show that one week of cholesterol diet down-regulates cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp3 family). Phenobarbital treatment also up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp2b and Cyp3a families). We can conclude that the Sterolgene series of cDNA microarrays represent novel original tool, enabling focused and cost-wise studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. Keywords: Treatment and diet effects

DESIGN
One group of mice was treated i.p. with 50 mg/kg of phenobarbital in vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). Untreated group was injected vehicle. Third group was 7 days on 1 % (w/w) cholesterol diet prior vehicle treatment. After 10 h animals were sacrificed and livers were stored. Pools of total RNA from two animals were mixed. Three pools of untreated and phenobarbital treated groups, and two pools of cholesterol diet group were co-hybridized with liver reference on Sterolgene v0 cDNA microarray. No dye-swaps were performed.
