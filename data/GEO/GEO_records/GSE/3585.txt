TITLE
Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Non Failing Biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cause of heart failure and a leading cause of cardiac transplantation in western countries. The robust predictive expression profile of cardiomyopathic and NF hearts as well as the functional classification can help to identify promising candidates for DCM and may improve the early diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
This series includes single channel hybridizations of 12 independent heart biopsy samples on Affymetrix Array U133A. The twelve independent subendocardial left ventricular tissue samples were collected from seven DCM patients at the time of transplantation and five NF donor hearts which were not transplanted because of palpable coronary calcifications. No technical or biological replicates are included.
