TITLE
Telomere length effect on genes near the telomere in myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined differential expression of genes within 10MBs of telomeres in myoblasts with long or short telomeres We offer telomere looping with telomere length as a partial mechanistic explanation for the changes gene expression that is observed.

DESIGN
Compare expression of genes within 10MB of the telomere in  normal myoblasts with long (15 kb) and short (6 kb) telomeres.
