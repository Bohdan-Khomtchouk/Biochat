TITLE
Chip-seq analysis of hrpRSL and Lon in Pseudomonas syringas

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas syringae

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas syringae uses HrpRSL to regulate the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS) genes and bacterial virulence. However, the molecular mechanism and the regulons of HrpRSL have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) on HrpRSL and Lon. The direct regulation of these genes by corresponding regulator has been confirmed by Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR). Binding motifs are found by using MEME suite and verified by footprint assays in vitro. Collectively, this work provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of T3SS systems in P. syringae.
