TITLE
Expression profiling of the overexpression of MILDEW-INDUCED LESIONS 4

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The 4 weeks old plant of genotype overexpression mil4 mutants were sprayed with BTH. The rosette tissue were collected for RNA expression profiling. Keywords: defense response

DESIGN
The rosettes were collected when the plants were 4 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
