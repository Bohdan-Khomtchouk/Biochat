TITLE
Genes regulated in mouse liver by expressing ectopically hURI in hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed using the RNA extracted from the bottom half of right lobe of mouse livers. Mice fall into two groups, mutant group which express ectopic hURI and their control littermates which do not express hURI. Two time points were considered in the study, 1-week-old mice, expressing hURI since 1 week (n =3, 4 for control and mutant, respectively) and 8-week-old mice expressing hURI since 8 week (n= 4, 3 for control and mutant, respectively), as hURI is expressed since conception.

DESIGN
Determination of differentially expressed transcripts over two time points (1 week and 8 weeks) in mouse livers expressing hURI (1 week and 8 weeks).
