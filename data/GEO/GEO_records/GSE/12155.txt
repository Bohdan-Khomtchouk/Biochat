TITLE
Characterization of a Colony Assay Used to Investigate Endothelial Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subjects underwent endothelial testing and blood sampling at baseline and after 3 months of exercise training.  Microarray and flow cytometry-based characterization of cells from an endothelial progeniator colony assay was consistent with T lymphocytes, but not endothelial cells. Keywords: expression analysis
