Expression data from iPS and human ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assays to assess the quality of the reprogramming of human Induced pluripotent stem cells are needed. We have previously shown that hESC can be differentiated into embryonic and fetal type of red blood cells that sequentially express three types of  hemoglobins recapitulating early human erythropoiesis. We report here that we have produced iPS from three somatic cell types: adult skin fibroblasts as well as embryonic and fetal mesenchymal stem cells. We show that some of these iPS are fully reprogrammed into a pluripotent state that is undistinguishable from that of hESCs based and low and high-throughput expression analysis and detailed expression of globin expression patterns suggesting that reprogramming with the four original Yamanaka pluripotency factors leads to complete erasure of all functionally important epigenetic marks associated with hematopoietic differentiation regardless of the age or the tissue type of the donor cells. We also report that reprogramming can also lead to abnormal iPS that are undistinguishable from hES cells by morphology, and by the expression of their endogenous genes but that are grossly abnormal in their differentiation potential. The most likely cause of abnormal reprogramming is failure to silence the virally transduced reprogramming factors. The ability to produce large number of erythroid cells with embryonic and fetal-like characteristics is likely to have many translational applications
