TITLE
Gene expressions of BMDC with or without Rbpj

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray data of Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) with or without Rbpj gene

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from Rbpj fl/fl (RFF) or Rbpj fl/fl x CD11c-cre (RFF11) mice were cultured to differentiate into dendritic cells. CD11c+ cells were isolated and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
