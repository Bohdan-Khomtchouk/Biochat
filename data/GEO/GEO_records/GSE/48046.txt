TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Early immature  and Late mature T-ALL cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early immature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) account for about 5-10% of pediatric T-ALLs and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the genetic defects that drive the biology of these tumors remain largely unknown. Analysis of microarray gene expression signatures in adult T-ALL demonstrated a high prevalence of early immature leukemias and revealed a close relationship between these tumors and myeloid leukemias. Consistently, adult immature T- ALLs showed characteristic mutations in myeloid specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors including IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, FLT3 and NRAS. Moreover, we identified ETV6 mutations as a novel genetic lesion uniquely present in immature adult T-ALL. All together, our results demonstrate that early immature adult T- ALL represents a heterogeneous category of leukemias characterized by the presence of overlapping myeloid and T-ALL characteristics and highlight the role of ETV6 mutations in these tumors.

DESIGN
Samples for microarray analysis were prepared and hybridized in Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and as previously described. RNA was extracted from duplicate cultures of T-ALL cell lines treated for 24 h with vehicle. Interarray intensity differences were normalized with GCRMA.
