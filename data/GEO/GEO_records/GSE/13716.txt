SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Rat liver submitted to high fat diets made with either crude (HFC) or refined salmon oil (HFR). Keywords: transcriptomic analysis

DESIGN
Two groups of rats were submitted  to high fat diet containing either crude salmon oil (HFC) or refined salmon oil (HFR). After 28 days, livers were retrieved and RNA extracted.
