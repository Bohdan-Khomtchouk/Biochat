TITLE
miRNA profiling for mouse B10+ cells and B10- B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we used genome-wide transcriptome analysis to profile the mRNA, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) expression of B10 cells, an antigen-specific Cd1dhiCd5+Cd19hiIl10 competent regulatory B cell. Potential key upstream regulators (including transcription factors, cytokines, trans-membrane receptors, and kinases) for Breg biogenesis and function were identified.

DESIGN
B10+ B cells (Cd1dhiCd5+Cd19hiIl10+) and B10- cells (Cd1d-Cd5-Cd19hiIl10-) from mouse splenic B cell were sorted for RNA preparation. Two independent repeats were prepared for microarray analysis
