TITLE
DNA Methylation Barcodes in Human Fetal Tissues and Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we assessed the genome-scale DNA methylation in multiple tissues and derived iPSs using the Illumina 450k array.

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA methylation of  fetal human tissues at mutiple timepoints
