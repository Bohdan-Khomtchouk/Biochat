TITLE
Med1 overexpression induces cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Med1 overexpression leads to induction of a wide spectrum of genes. Adenovirally-driven overexpression of Med1 in mouse liver stimulates hepatocyte DNA synthesis with enhanced expression of DNA replication, cell cycle control and liver specific genes as observed at day 3 and day 5 post injection. Med1 gene is amplified in a number of cancers so in this study we tested the hypothesis that Med1 by itself has the capacity to induce cell proliferation. Analysis of the Med1- induced gene expression showed a robust induction of a wide spectrum of genes involved in hepatocellular proliferation.

DESIGN
Med1 floxed mice (Med1fl/fl) were injected with Ad-His-Med1 (adenovirus expressing Med1 gene) via tail vein and killed 3 or 5 days after injection. Ad-LacZ (adenovirus expression beta-galactosidase gene) injected mouse liver served as control. Total RNA were isolated from the liver and subjected to the microarray.
