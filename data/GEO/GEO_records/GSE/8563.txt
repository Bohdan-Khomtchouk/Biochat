TITLE
Lymphtoxin pathway effects on thymic medullary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of lymphotoxin alpha- and lymphtoxin beta receptor-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells with their wild-type littermates, as well as with Aire-deficient and wild-type littermates. This was done in order to determine whether there was overlap in the effects of lymphotoxin and aire. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Individual thymi were digested with collagenase, dispase and DNAse, and meduallary epithelial cells with the phenotype CD45-G8.8+Ly51intMHCclasssIIhi were isolated by FACS.
