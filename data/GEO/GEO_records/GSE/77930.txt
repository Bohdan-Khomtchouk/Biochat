TITLE
Substantial interindividual and limited intraindividual genomic diversity among tumors from men with metastatic prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile 171 CRPC tumors from 63 patients. RNA was amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines. Custom Agilent 415K whole human CGH microarrays were used to profile 149 CRPC tumors from 60 patients.  Genomic DNA from tumors was hybridized against a pool of reference normal male DNA.
