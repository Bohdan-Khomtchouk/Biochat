TITLE
Expression analysis of miR-302 knockout and wild-type embryos during neurulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type or miR-302 knockout tissue was isolated from embryos during neurulation in replicate

DESIGN
Performed in biological triplicate except for E7.5 WT which was in duplicate and E9.5 timepoints which were in quadruplicate. Biological replicate samples represent independent embryos. Total RNA collected with Trizol. All processing conducted at the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core. MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips.
