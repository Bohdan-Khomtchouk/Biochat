TITLE
DNA sequence properties that determine susceptibility to epiallelic switching [Bisulfite-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transgenerationally heritable epialleles are defined by the stable propagation of alternative transcriptional states through mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. Given that the propagation of DNA methylation at CpG sites, mediated in Arabidopsis by MET1, plays a central role in epigenetic inheritance, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation in partial and complete loss-of-function met1 mutants. We interpreted the data in relation to transgenerational epiallelic stability and provide evidence that DNA sequence features such as density of CpGs and genomic repetitiveness of the loci largely determine their susceptibility to epiallelic switching. The importance of this rule was confirmed by analyses of common epialleles in natural Arabidopsis accessions and verified in rice.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation of 2 met1 mutant alleles, 2 replicates of F2 plants obtained by crossing met1-3 with WT, and 2 transgenic MET1 complemented met1-1 lines.
