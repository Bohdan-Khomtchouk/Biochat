TITLE
Global methylation alteration in Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant double mutant HSPCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated DNA methylation alterations in Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant HSPCs in comparison with the megarkaryocyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) and Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitor(GMP) of Dnmt3a knockout, Idh2 mutant, WT genotypes. We generated an average of 17.42 million reads per sample (12.17 - 24.53 million) of which an average of 16.39 million could be mapped to the mm9 genome (11.74 - 23.73 million). We achieved an average CpG coverage depth of 27.88-fold (19.52 - 35.89-fold) and average bisulfite conversion efficiency of 99.61% (98.43 - 99.94%).

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of megarkaryocyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) and Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitor(GMP) of Dnmt3a knockout, Idh2 mutant, WT and Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant HSPC using Illumina HiSeq 2000
