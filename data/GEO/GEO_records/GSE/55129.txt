TITLE
The role of Rif1 in ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The goals of this study are to understand the mechanisms underlying reduced self-renewal and loss of pluripotency by depletion of Rif1. Methods: We performed global gene expression analysis of Rif1 knockdown ES cell lines using Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays, compared to shRNA controls.

DESIGN
J1 ES cells were transfected with Control shRNA and Rif1 shRNA using lipofectamine 2000. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected for global gene expression analysis using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. Stable F1 Rif1 knockdown ES cells at passage 16 were used for long-term gene expression chip microarray using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array.
