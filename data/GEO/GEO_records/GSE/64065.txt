TITLE
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clp Gene Regulator is Required for in vitro Reactivation from Hypoxia-induced Dormancy

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551

SUMMARY
The isogenic Mtb:ΔRv2745c mutant is significantly more sensitive normoxia conditions after a period of hypoxia, relative to wild-type Mtb, implicating a role for ClgR in response to reactivation, in vivo. Both hypoxia and reaeration treatment led to dysregulation of the σH regulon in the isogenic mutant, Mtb:ΔRv2745c. Induction of clgR in Mtb did lead to Clp protease induction, indicating that clgR plays a role in differntially activating downstream genes in a condition dependent manner. Disruption of genes involved in the dosR regulon, the Enduring Hypoxia Response, lipid synthesis, and mycolic acid synthesis also occurred in the knock out, implicating clgR as a possible regulator of downstream signaling cascades that facilitate Mtb survival. There was also a differnetial response of genes that are known Clp protease targets, in addition to potential Clp protease targets that had similar induction patterns as known Clp protease targets.
