Genes associated with angiogenic response to Ang-1 or VEGF

Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Specific Aims To identify novel transcriptional events associated with angiogenesis in VEGF and Ang-1 stimulated rat aortic rings.  Our studies take advantage of the capacity of rat aortic rings to generate new vessels in collagen gels. Rat aortic rings embedded in collagen gel immediately after excision from the animal produce a self-limited angiogenic response under serum-free conditions and in the absence of exogenous stimuli.  This angiogenic response can be dose-dependently promoted by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), which are critical regulators of the angiogenic process during embryonal development and postnatal angiogenesis.  Aortic rings lose their capacity to spontaneously generate new vessels if embedded in collagen gels 10-14 days after excision. VEGF has the capacity to turn back “on” these quiescent rings producing florid angiogenesis.  Conversely, Ang-1 potentiates an existing angiogenic response, but is unable to turn the quiescent system “on”.  Since VEGF-mediated induction of angiogenic sprouting occurs 1-2 days of treatment, we hypothesize that this process is regulated by a unique set of “angiogenesis inducer genes” that are activated by VEGF and not by Ang-1.  Identification of the proteins encoded by these genes may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the earliest stages of the angiogenic cascade.
