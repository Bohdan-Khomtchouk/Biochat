TITLE
K. lactis Ste12-myc ChIP-Seq in pheromone-responding a cells

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the genes directly regulated by Ste12 in K. lactis. The experiment was performed in a cells to determine if the a-specific genes were bound by Ste12. Ste12 was tagged with c-myc and was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody. Cells were starved in SD media lacking phosphate for 2 hours, then treated with 10Âµg/mL K. lactis alpha factor for 2 hours before harvesting.  A control untagged strain was processed in parallel. The experiment was repeated 3 times, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

DESIGN
K. lactis Ste12-myc vs. untagged control under pheromone response condition with 3 technical replicates done on different days
