TITLE
Gene expression profiling of triple negative breast cancer, normal ductal cells, and normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel molecular targets for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling.   We purified 30 surgically resected breast cancer tissue diagnosed triple negative by means of immunohistochemical staining and 13 normal mammary ductal cells with lasermicrobeam microdissection system (PALM MicroBeam, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Co., Ltd), performed whole human genome microarray, and compared gene expression levels of TNBC, normal mammary ductal cells, and normal vital organs to develop molecular targets with a minimum risk.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels of 30 TNBC, 13 normal mammary ductal cells, and 4 normal vital tissues were evaluated.  to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in TNBC, we analyzed gene expression profiles of 30 TNBC as well as 13 normal epithelial ductal cells purified by laser microbeam microdissection, and identified 301 transcripts that were significantly up-regulated and 321 transcripts that were significantly down-regulated in TNBC. In addition, gene-expression profiles analysis of normal human vital organs including heart, lung, liver, and kidney allowed us to identify 90 cancer-specific genes involved in breast carcinogenesis such as NEK2, PBK, DTL, MELK and GPSM2.  Among them, we focused on cell cycle regulators, asp (abnormal spindle) homolog, microcephaly associated (Drosophila) (ASPM) and centromere protein K (CENPK) as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC.
