TITLE
MMSET regulation of gene expression in t(4;14)+ myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated gene expression in isogenic myeloma cell lines with or without overexpressed MMSET protein. MMSET is a histone methyltransferase which methylates lysine 36 on histone H3. Overexpression of MMSET in myeloma leads to a global increase in H3K36 methylation and concomitant decrease in H3K27 methylation. These global changes in histone methylation lead to altered gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from parental KMS11 cell line, NTKO cells which have the wild type MMSET allele inactivated and TKO cells which have overexpressed MMSET allele inactivated. Two different TKO clones were tested. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
