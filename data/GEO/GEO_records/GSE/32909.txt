TITLE
Human transcriptome analysis of acute responses to glucose ingestion reveals a role of leukocytes in hyperglycemia induced inflammation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective was to examine acute gene expression responses to physiologic oral glucose ingestion in human circulating leukocytes. Microarray study of human circulating leukocytes sampled before, 1 hour after and 2 hours after glucose ingestion was performed. The present study demonstrated 36 genes which showed acute gene expression change in human leukocytes within 1 hour after glucose ingestion and suggest that leukocytes participate in the inflammatory process induced by acute hyperglycemia.

DESIGN
Microarray study of human circulating leukocytes sampled before, 1 hour after and 2 hours after glucose ingestion
