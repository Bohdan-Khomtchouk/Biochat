TITLE
Microarray analysis of cell types exposed to alpha particle radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Four human-derived cell types: transformed monocytes (THP-1), transformed lung epithelial cells (A549), normal human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEAC) and normal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) Cell types were independently exposed to alpha particle radiation using Americium-241 discs (0.9Gy/hr) at a dose range from 0-1.5 Gy. Twenty-four hours post-exposure cells were harvested and RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by array analysis-Sample set, 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 Gy ( n=5), analysed 24h post exposure, for THP-1 cells analysis was also conducted 72 h post-exposure

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
