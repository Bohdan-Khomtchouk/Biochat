TITLE
Gene expression in the GWAT of ob/ob and ob/ob/Fsp27-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GWAT store most of the TAG in mice, ob/ob mice is an obese mice. Ob/ob/Fsp27-/- mice are lean when compared with ob/ob mice. The GWAT weight was dramatically reduced in ob/ob/Fsp27-/- mice. We next extract the total RNA from the GWAT of ob/ob and ob/ob/Fsp27-/- mice, to perform microaary analysis using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, Affymetrix. We then analysised the up-regulated and down regulated pathways.

DESIGN
We extract the RNA of GWAT from 4 month old mice and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We then analysis the data.
