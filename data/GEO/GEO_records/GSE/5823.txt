ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Hu133 GeneCHIP Microarray data for Control and c-MYC knock-down (KD) human cancer cell lines. Data related to article 'Novel c-MYC target genes mediate differential effects on cell proliferation and migration', from D. CAPPELLEN et al., EMBO Reports Note: Samples GSM136093 and GSM136094 (Hela cell line, expt 1) were hybridized and normalized separately from the other 18 Samples. Keywords: siRNA analysis
