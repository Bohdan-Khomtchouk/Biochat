TITLE
Effects of RNA interference-mediated c-MYC depletion on gene expression profiles in human cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Hu133 GeneCHIP Microarray data for Control and c-MYC knock-down (KD) human cancer cell lines. Data related to article 'Novel c-MYC target genes mediate differential effects on cell proliferation and migration', from D. CAPPELLEN et al., EMBO Reports Note: Samples GSM136093 and GSM136094 (Hela cell line, expt 1) were hybridized and normalized separately from the other 18 Samples. Keywords: siRNA analysis

DESIGN
The cells were harvested 3 days after LacZ (Control)  and c-MYC (c-MYC KD) small interfering RNA transfection, and total RNA was used for microarray-based global gene expression profiling.
