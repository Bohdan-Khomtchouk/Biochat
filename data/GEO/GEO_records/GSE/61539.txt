TITLE
Genome map of SND1 binding sites by ChIP-chip analysis in human HepG2 cells under inflammatory conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling of promoter occupancy by SND1 coactivator in human hepatoma cells. Control  and TNFα-treated HepG2 cells are immunoprecipitated with anti-SND1 antibody and input and immunoprecipitated material were hybridized in an Agilent human promoter microarray

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 TNFα-treated replicates. Input vs. Immunoprecipitated material

PLATFORM
GPL14622 Agilent-027811 SurePrint G3 Human Promoter Microarray 1x1M [Probe Name Version]
