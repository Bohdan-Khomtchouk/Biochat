TITLE
Expression data from M0505 and STOSE murine ovarian surface epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our lab established the M0505 cell line from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) of FVB/N mice in May 2005 in order to study OSE biology. This cell line spontaneously transformed into the spontaneously transformed OSE (STOSE) cell line in mid 2012. We used microarrays to try to determine the molecular pathways that may have lead to the transformation of M0505 cells into STOSE cells to gain information that may lead to a greater understanding of human ovarian cancer initiation.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of M0505 and STOSE cell were collected for RNA extraction and subesequent hybridization on the Affymetrix GPL6246 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
