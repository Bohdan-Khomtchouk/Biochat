TITLE
MiRNA expression pattern in different prognosis of colon cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured the expression of human microRNAs in tumor cells derived from 8 FFPE samples among non-invasive CRC patients with different prognosis. Patients lived for more than 5 years after surgery were classified as good prognosis, and patients died within 5 years from surgery were classified as poor prognosis. Tumor tissues were macrodissected under the control HE staining slides. And there were at least 75 percent cancer cells in the samples.

DESIGN
MicroRNA microarray was used to measure the expression of human miRNAs in tumor cells derived from 8 FFPE samples among early stage CRC patients with different prognosis.
