TITLE
Pediatric AML classification according to C/EBPδ expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined if pediatric AMLs rank-ordered according to C/EBPδ expression showed the activation of similar pathways. AML samples were dichotomized into groups including the upper quartile (Q1) and the lower three quartiles (Q2-4) according to their C/EBPδ expression values. Moreover, AML samples were associated to French-American-British (FAB) classification.

DESIGN
100 ng of bone marrow RNA from 85 patients with de novo AML at diagnosis were hybridized on the GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0.
