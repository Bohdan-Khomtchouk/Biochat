TITLE
Cholinergic Receptor and Cyclic Stretch-Mediated Inflammatory Gene Expression in Intact Airway Smooth Muscle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis that cholinergic stimulation (via treatment with carbachol) and cyclic stretch regulate inflammatory gene expression in intact airway smooth muscle by measuring mRNA expression in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Keywords: response to stress and drug
