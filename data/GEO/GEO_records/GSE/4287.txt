TITLE
Cholinergic Receptor and Cyclic Stretch-Mediated Inflammatory Gene Expression in Intact Airway Smooth Muscle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis that cholinergic stimulation (via treatment with carbachol) and cyclic stretch regulate inflammatory gene expression in intact airway smooth muscle by measuring mRNA expression in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Keywords: response to stress and drug

DESIGN
Airway smooth muscle from 5 animals was treated with 4 treatments (+/- stretch, +/- carbachol).  RNA from these 20 samples were split into two:  one labeled with Cy3 and one labeled with Cy5.  These 40 labeled RNA samples were then hybridized to 20 custom oligonucleotide arrays containing a number of genes known to be involved in airway smooth muscle function
