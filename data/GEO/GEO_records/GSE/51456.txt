TITLE
Gene expression in HNSCC cell lines after knockdown of CTTN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression level of CTTN was decreased in HPV-negative HNSCC cell line with an amplification and overexpression of CTTN by performing knockdown experiments using RNA interference. Gene expression profiling and consecutive pathway analyses showed a number of deregulated genes known to be involved in metastatic processes such as migration and invasion. Furthermore, three potential downstream targets of CTTN (MAF, MAFB and PLAC2) were identified.

DESIGN
cells with knockdown of CTTN vs. Control,  4 biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
