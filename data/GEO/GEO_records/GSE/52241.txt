TITLE
Gene induction in STAT1-/- fibroblasts transduced with lentiviruses expressing human cGAS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested was that lentiviral driven cGAS expression activates antiviral gene expression.

DESIGN
Cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing cGAS or a control (firefly luciferase). Total RNA was harvested 48 h post-transduction and processed for Illumina BeadArray.
