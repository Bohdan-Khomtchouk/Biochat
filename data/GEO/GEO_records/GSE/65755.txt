TITLE
Plasticity of Hopx+ Type I alveolar cells to regenerate Type II cells in the lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hopx is a transcription co-factor expressed during lung development and we wanted to profile Hopx +/+ and -/- embyonic lungs. Results inform the role of Hopx in embryonic lung development

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile the transcriptome of Hopx -/- lungs compared to Hopx +/+ lungs. Lungs were microdissected and three biological replicates were used for each genotype.
