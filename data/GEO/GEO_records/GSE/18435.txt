TITLE
Analysis of the role of CggR in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and WCFS1 by transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum ; Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
The level of the Central glycolytic gene regulator (CggR) was engineered in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and WCFS1 by over-expression and in-frame mutation of the cggR gene in order to evaluate its regulatory role on the glycolytic gap operon and the glyco

DESIGN
The hybridization scheme of the different strains (wild-type, cggRKO mutant, cggR+) in relation to carbon source (glucose or ribose) has a loop design.

PLATFORM
GPL4318 WCFS Lactobacillus plantarum 11K 60-mer array, Version 1, our ID LPAG1
