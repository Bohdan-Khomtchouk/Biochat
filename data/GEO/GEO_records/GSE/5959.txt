TITLE
Expression differences in the liver of a congenic mouse with low serum IGF-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Several studies have shown that bone mineral density (BMD), a clinically measurable predictor of osteoporotic fracture, is the sum of genetic and environmental influences.  In addition, serum IGF-1 levels have been correlated to both BMD and fracture risk.  We previously identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for Bone Mineral Density (BMD) on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 6 that overlaps a QTL for serum IGF-1.  The B6.C3H-6T (6T) congenic mouse is homozygous for C57BL/6J (B6) alleles across the genome except for a 30 cM region on Chr 6 that is homozygous for C3H/HeJ (C3H) alleles.  This mouse was created to study biology behind both the BMD and the serum IGF-1 QTLs and to identify the gene(s) underlying these QTLs.   Female 6T mice have lower BMD and lower serum IGF-1 levels at all ages measured. As the liver is the major source of serum IGF-1, we examined differential expression in the livers of fasted female B6 and 6T mice by microarray. Keywords: Genetic variation

DESIGN
The experimental design of this experiment was a simple two-factor experiment, with three biological replicates of each factor (in this case mouse strain, B6.C3H-6T vs. C57BL/6J).  Each sample represented one mouse; no samples were pooled.   No technical replicated were done.
