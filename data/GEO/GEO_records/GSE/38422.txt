TITLE
Network Analysis of HEK293T Gene Expression Profile Modulation During Nonviral Gene Delivery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current understanding of the molecular factors underlying PEI-mediated transfection is largely unknown. The cationic polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymer gene delivery system was used to transfer the GFP gene to HEK293T cells. FACS separation of transfected (GFP positive), untransfected (GFP negative), and untreated cells enabled gene expression profiles to be obtained using AffymetrixÂ® HG-U133A 2.0 microarrays for each cell population. Gene profiles were differentially compared for each population combination.

DESIGN
Control (untreated), transfected (GFP positive), and untransfected (GFP negative) RNA samples were purified from HEK293T cells after FACS isolation. The experiment was repeated on triplicate days to run 3 microarrays for each cell population. Only 2 untreated replicates are included in this submission.
