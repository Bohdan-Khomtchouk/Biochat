TITLE
Host Regulatory Network Response to Infection with Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Over the last decade, more than half of humans infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have died, and yet virus-induced host signaling has yet to be clearly elucidated.  Airway epithelia are known to produce inflammatory mediators that contribute to HPAI H5N1-mediated pathogenicity, but a comprehensive analysis of the host response in this cell type is lacking.  Here, we leveraged a systems biology method called weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify and statistically validate signaling sub-networks that define the dynamic transcriptional response of human bronchial epithelial cells after infection with influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1, VN1203). A detailed examination of two sub-networks involved in the immune response and keratin filament formation revealed potential novel mediators of HPAI H5N1 pathogenesis, and additional experiments validated upregulation of these transcripts in response to VN1203 infection in C57BL/6 mice.  Using emergent network properties, we provide fresh insight into the host response to HPAI H5N1 virus infection, and identify novel avenues for perturbation studies and potential therapeutic intervention of fatal HPAI H5N1 disease.

DESIGN
Calu-3 cells were infected with VN1203 influenza virus and profiled at 0, 3, 7, 12, 18, and 24 hours post infection. There are 3 mock and infected replicates for each time point.
