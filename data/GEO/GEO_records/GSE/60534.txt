TITLE
crr4_dyw1_col0-Comparative Arabidopsis Transcriptome -Sequencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cat-seq - crr4_dyw1_col0 - A comparative assessment of the Arabidopsis sequencing approach High-throughput sequencing cDNA GAII or HiSeq2000 sequenceur (technology Solexa) and data on CATMA array hybridation (version 6). These different characteristics will be studied through the analysis of control samples but also samples from mutants in genes coding for cytosolic or nuclear PPR proteins - CRR4 and DYW1 are two PPR mutants. They have the same post-transcriptonnel molecular defect and their phenotype is very close. We will try to determine here if their transcriptome is similar or not.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - genotype comparaison

PLATFORM
GPL15719 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K CATMAv6-HD12 [100701_Athal_CATMA6_SB_exp]
