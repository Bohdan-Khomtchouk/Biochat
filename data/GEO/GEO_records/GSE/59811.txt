TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human adipose derived stem cells microvesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ASC was preconditioned with endothelial differentiation medium for 4 days; after which the medium was changed to endothelial basal medium (2% FBS-MV Free) for two days; The conditioned medium was then harvested for microvesicle isolation; The ASC-MV were used for microarray analysis

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling; ASC-MV were used in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL18999 Applied Biosystems Human Taqman MicroRNA Array v3.0
