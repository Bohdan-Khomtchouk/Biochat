TITLE
The effect on cancer cells of the glycodendrimers believed to decrease tumor growth, prolong survival time, and enhance immune response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The potential therapeutic relevance of synthetic glycodendrimers was shown on animal subjects bearing colorectal carcinoma and melanoma. The application of glycodendrimers led to decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival time of the animals, accompanied by an enhancement of immune response. Comparison of mass spectra and biochemical analyses have indicated that the uptake of glycodendrimers by target cells resulted in changes of surface glycosylation. Moreover our research shows changes in membrane constitution. Recently our lab found changes in proliferation potential and expression of GnT-III and GnT-V in cancer cells in contrast to the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. As there are a sizable amount of enzymes involved in glycan metabolism and signaling pathways, the glyco-chip would be a very effective tool to determine which genes are involved in metabolism of these glycodendrimers. Our lab would like to develop expression profiles of cancer cells treated by glycodendrimers and a corresponding untreated control.

DESIGN
For chip analyses we have chosen cell lines derived from chronic myeloid leukemia (K562), multiple myeloma (U266) and colon carcinoma (HT-29). There are untreated control samples and post glycodendrimers treatment samples from each cell line. All samples were produced and developed in triplicate for a total of 18 samples.  The RNA was labeled and hybridized onto the GLYCOv3 array.  .
