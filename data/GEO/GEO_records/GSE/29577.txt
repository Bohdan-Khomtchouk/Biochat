TITLE
Global gene expression profiles of Oryza sativa wild type Nipponbare and mutant coi1-13

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of jasmonate inhibits gibberellins signaling in rice, we performed transcriptional profiling of wild type nipponbare and mutant coi1-13 plants on a global scale using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array

DESIGN
Rice young uppermost internodes were harvested and three biological repeats were performed on Nippombare (wild-type) and coi1-13 (mutant), respectively.
