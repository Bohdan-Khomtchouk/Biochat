TITLE
Modulated electro-hyperthermia related mRNA expression profile development in HT-29 xenograft mouse model.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were xenografted into both femoral regions of 6 to 8-week old Balb/c (nu/nu) mice. After 18 days electromagnetic heat treatment was performed. We used microarray technology to identify the heat treatment releted gene expression alterations using human tumor xenograft mouse model.

DESIGN
Fresh frozen tissue sections were performed from the xenograft and tumorous regions were microdissected for total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis purposes.
