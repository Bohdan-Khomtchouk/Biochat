TITLE
High-resolution Brachyury DNA-binding Sites Mapping by ChIP-exo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mapping ultra high resolution of Brachyury:DNA interaction would provide us with valuable new mechanistic insights into complex molecular transactions at Brachyury-bound enhancers.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cells were differentiated into Brachyury-positive mesoendoderm cells. And, ChIP-exo experiment was then performed to identify detailed Brachyury-DNA binding profiles.

PLATFORM
