TITLE
MiR-204-3p inhibits the production of TLR4-related cytokines in familial Mediterranean fever by targeting the PI3KÎ³ signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data suggest that serum miR-204-3p has a potential as a useful biomarker among patients with FMF and that miR-204-3p plays a critical role as a suppressor to regulate the production of TLR4-related cytokines by targeting PI3K signaling pathway.

DESIGN
The RNA was obtained from THP-1 cells after LPS stimulation. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We performed the cDNA microarray using the SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray.
