TITLE
Translocase malfunction causes extracellular protein translocation stress ( EPTS) in Streptomyces lividans

ORGANISM
Streptomyces lividans

SUMMARY
The genomic and proteomic analyses of Streptomyces lividans strains deficient in the major signal peptidase SipY or in the translocase complex protein SecG resulted in a set of genes being equally regulated. These genes are apparently responsible for the common deficiencies in extracellular protein production and sporulation shared by both mutant strains, constituting a cellular response to the stress caused by the potential malfunction of the translocase complex, which we have named “extracellular protein translocation stress (EPTS)”.

DESIGN
All microarray analyses were performed with RNA samples obtained from three independent cultures grown under identical conditions. The cDNA obtained from each RNA preparation of the SipY-deficient strain or the SecG-deficient strain were hybridised with the cDNA obtained from the equivalent RNA preparation of the wild type strain (S. lividans TK21).
