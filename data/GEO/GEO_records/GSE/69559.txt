TITLE
miRNAs expression profiling from mouse heart after Ang II (angiotensin II) (1500ng/kg/min) infusion for 3 days and 7 days

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II stimulates fibroblast proliferation and substantially alters gene expression patterns leading to cardiac remodeling, but the mechanisms for such differences are unknown. MicroRNAs are a novel mechanism for gene expression regulation. Herein we tested the miRNAs patterns in mouse heart using microarray assay, and investigated their role in angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling.
