TITLE
miRNAs expression profiling from mouse heart after Ang II (angiotensin II) (1500ng/kg/min) infusion for 3 days and 7 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II stimulates fibroblast proliferation and substantially alters gene expression patterns leading to cardiac remodeling, but the mechanisms for such differences are unknown. MicroRNAs are a novel mechanism for gene expression regulation. Herein we tested the miRNAs patterns in mouse heart using microarray assay, and investigated their role in angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling.

DESIGN
In this study, nine samples (three groups) from mouse were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling and the function of the abudant miRNAs in the heart were analyzed by bioinformatic methods.
