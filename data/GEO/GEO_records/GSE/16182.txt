TITLE
Gene expression profile of regenerating intestine in the sea cucumber H. glaberrima

ORGANISM
Holothuria glaberrima

SUMMARY
Regenerating intestine tissues were compared with normal (non-regenerating tissues) to determine the gene expression profile at early stages of regeneration (3, 7 and 14 days post- evisceration  (dpe)). Immuno activated tissues with LPS were compared with Normal (non-regenerating tissues) and regenerating tissues (3 and 7 dpe) to determine the gene expression of immune related genes in the sea cucumber and it's expression during early stages of regeneration.

DESIGN
16 Total arrays. 8 comparisons with 8 dye swap replicates. Normal Vs. (3, 7 and 14 days of regeneration), and Vs. (LPS) 2 microarray slides used. Each slide with 8 Arrays (8 x 15k). 15,744 probes printed per array. (all 16 arrays are identically printed). 7,209 ESTs from Normal, 3 dpe and 7 dpe tissues were used to design the probes. Two probes per EST from diferent regions of the sequence (as a technical replicate). 536 technical controls and more than 600 internal biological controls (from different species).
