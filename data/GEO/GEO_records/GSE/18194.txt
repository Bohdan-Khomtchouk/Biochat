TITLE
Transcriptional profiling across adult Anopheles gambiae age

ORGANISM
Anopheles gambiae

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcription was quantified in adult female and male Anopheles gambiae atdifferent ages; 0 (0-24 h), 10, 20 and 30 days post-eclosion. The objective of the experiment was to identify genes with significant age-dependent transcription.

DESIGN
One-colour gene expression arrays were run in duplicate on both male and female RNA samples at the following ages;  0 (0-24 h), 10, 20 and 30 days post-eclosion.
