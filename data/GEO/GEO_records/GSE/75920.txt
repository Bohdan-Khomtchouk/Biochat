TITLE
The major diversification of Vγ1.1+ and Vγ2+ thymocytes in mice occurs after commitment to the γδ T-cell lineage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult murine gammadelta thymocytes can be divided into two major subsets based on their expression of TCRVgamma1.1 or TCRVgamma2, respectively. gammadelta thymocytes mature through distinct stages characterized by CD24 and CD73 in the following order: immature uncommitted (CD24+CD73-), immature committed (CD24+CD73+) and mature (CD24-CD73+). In this dataset we have sorted gammadelta thymocytes into 6 distinct populations based on subset and developmental stage and analyzed their gene expression. These data were used to identify 3400 differentially expressed genes during gammadelta thymocyte development and to show that the two major adult gammadelta T cells follow a similar path through early development and mainly diversify after commitment to the gammadelta T cell lineage.

DESIGN
22 samples (6 populations 3-4 biological replicates) were analyzed for differential expression to identify genes shared between cells of the different subsets at each developmental stage.
