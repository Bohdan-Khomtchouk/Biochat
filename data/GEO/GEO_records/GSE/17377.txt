TITLE
The transcriptional response of Drosophila melanogaster to infection with the sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Bacterial and fungal infections induce a potent immune response in Drosophila melanogaster, but it is unclear whether viral infections induce a similar immune response. Using microarrays, we examined the changes in gene expression in Drosophila that occur in response to infection with the sigma virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus (Rhabdoviridae) that occurs in wild populations of D. melanogaster. We detected many changes in gene expression in infected flies, but found no evidence for the activation of the Toll, IMD or Jak-STAT pathways, which control immune responses against other pathogens. We identified a number of functional categories of genes, including serine proteases, ribosomal proteins and chorion proteins that were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. We also found that the sigma virus alters the expression of many more genes in males than in females. In contrast to previous results, our data suggest that either Drosophila do not mount an immune response against the sigma virus, or that the immune response is not controlled by known immune pathways. The genes which we identified as differentially expressed after infection are promising candidates for controlling the hostâ€™s response to the sigma virus.

DESIGN
We used dual channel microarrays to compare genome-wide expression profiles of adult males and females infected with the sigma virus to uninfected controls. In total 10 hybidizations were performed for males and 8 for females, including dye-swaps.
