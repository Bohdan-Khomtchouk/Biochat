TITLE
Expression data from Lbx1-EGFP+ flow sorted cells from Pitx2 WT, HT, Null forelimb tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determing the gene network regulated by Pitx2 in during forelimb muscle development of mouse embryos at E12.5.  Lbx1 is coexpressed in Pitx2+ cells during forelimb development, thus Pitx2-LacZ and Lbx1-EGFP+ mice were cross bred to allow us to purify Lbx1-EGFP+|Pitx2 -wildtype, het, or null cells by flow sorting We used microarray analysis to determine the genes misregulated in Pitx2 null mice compared to Pitx2 wildtype and heterozyogtes.

DESIGN
Lbx1-EGFP+|Pitx2(+/+, LacZ/+, or LacZ/LacZ) cells were flow sorted, RNA extracted, labelled cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays
