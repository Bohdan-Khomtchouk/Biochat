TITLE
Sex-Dependent Programming of Glucose and Fatty Acid Metabolism in Mouse Offspring by Maternal Protein Restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of glucose and Lipid metabolism in male and female offspring after protein restriction of the mother Male offspring showed features of metabolic syndrome after receiving a high fat diet, regardless of the diet of the dam. Glucose and lipid metabolism in male offspring was unaltered. Insulin sensitivity and hepatic fatty acid storage in female offspring of low-protein-fed dams changed in such a way that it resembled the male pattern of insulin sensitivity and hepatic fatty acid storage. Microarray analysis on hepatic gene expression patterns confirmed these findings. We therefore conclude that in mice, maternal protein restriction does not change the response of glucose and fatty acid metabolism to a high fat diet in male offspring, but does program metabolism in female offspring in such a way that it resembles male metabolism. Our findings might have implications for potential future gender-specific treatment of the features of metabolic diseases.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver (16 samples per gender) were compared in the different groups. In total, 4 groups per gender, each group consisting of 4 biological replicates.
