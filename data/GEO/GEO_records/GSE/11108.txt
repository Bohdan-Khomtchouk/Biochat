TITLE
Study of HepG2 cells transduced with HBX expressing recombinant Adenoviruses (AdHBx) and treated with UV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, AdHBx (experimental) UV vs AdEasy (vector control) UV.  HepG2 cells were infected with either recombinant HBx adenoviruses (AdHBx) or control adenoviruses (AdEasy). Seventy-two hours later, infected cells were exposed for 30 seconds to UVC (254 nm) irradiation with a germicidal lamp calibrated to deliver 8 or 16 J/m2.  Cells were then harvested for either ChIP-chip profiling or expression microarray profiling.
