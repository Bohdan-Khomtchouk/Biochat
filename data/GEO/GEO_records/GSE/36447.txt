TITLE
Transcriptional analysis for cell-cell communication during graft union development in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Grafting is an ancient cloning method that has been used widely for thousands of years in agricultural practices. However, the molecular mechanisms for graft union development are still largely unknown. The developmental stage of graft union was characterized based on micrografting method. Microarray data revealed a signal exchange process between cells of scion and stock at 1dag, which reestablished the communication network in graft union. This process was concomitant with the cleaning of cell debris, and both of the processes were initiated by a wound-induced program. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential power of investigating various plant developmental processes by this method and represent a primary and significant step in interpretation of the molecular mechanisms underlying graft union development.

DESIGN
WT/WT seedling grafts of 22-26 hours after grafting were collected for microarray, intact WT seedlings and ungrafted scions and stocks were as control. All three types of sample, grafts (marked as A: whole graft), ungrafted scions and stocks (marked as B: mixture of ungrafted scions and stocks) and intact seedlings (marked as C: whole seedling), were collected at the same time of 22-26 hours after grafting. For sample B, scions and stocks were cut at the same time during grafting. For sample C, intact seedlings were also reserved during grafting. Data were firstly compared between sample A and C, differential expressed probe sets were than tested based on A and B to obtain graft-specific probes.
