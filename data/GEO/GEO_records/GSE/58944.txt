TITLE
Gene expression data from myelomonocytes and whole kidney marrows in zebrafish adult kidney after deletion of miR-142-3p

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
hematopoiesis and myelopoiesis was tightly controled by microRNAs. In the zebrafish adult kidney, specific sets of genes were dysregulated in myelomonocytes or whole kidney marrow after deletion of miR-142-3p. microarrays were used to clarified the miR-142-3p regulatory network in myelopoiesis in miR-142-3p knockout zebrafish kidney and we identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in zebrafish myelopoiesis or hematopoiesis after deletion of miR-142-3p.

DESIGN
The myelomonocytes and whole kidney marrow (without erythrocytes) were sorted from wild-type or miR-142-3p double knockout zebrafish kidney at 60 dpf (four zebrafish kidneys and two independent repeats for each sample). Total RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
