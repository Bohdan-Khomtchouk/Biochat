TITLE
Dexamethasone Acutely Down-regulates Genes Involved in Steroidogenesis in Stallion Testes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three stallions were treated with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone i.v. while three control stallions received an equivalent volume of saline. Serum testosterone dropped 60% in treated stallions at 12 h post-injection. Testes were collected 12 h post-injection and assessed for differential gene expression.
