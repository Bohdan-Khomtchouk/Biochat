TITLE
Dexamethasone Acutely Down-regulates Genes Involved in Steroidogenesis in Stallion Testes

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Three stallions were treated with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone i.v. while three control stallions received an equivalent volume of saline. Serum testosterone dropped 60% in treated stallions at 12 h post-injection. Testes were collected 12 h post-injection and assessed for differential gene expression.

DESIGN
Adult stallions were acclimated to the clinic over a 10 day period, then treated 12 h prior to collection of testes. Differential gene expression in treated vs. control stallion testes
