TITLE
Adipocyte-derived Exosomal miRNAs from Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue: A Novel Mechanism for Obesity-Related Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 array profiling of adipocyte-derived exosomes from obese and lean human subjects. We used miRNA arrays to profile exosomes shed from obese and lean human subcutaneous fat that was cultured for 60 minutes.

DESIGN
Human obese and lean subcutaneous fat were surgically acquired, dissected, and promptly cultured for 60 minutes. We used the culture supernatants for exosome purification and isolation using ExoQuick-TC Precipitation Solution.

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
