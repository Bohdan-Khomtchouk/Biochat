TITLE
Expression profiling of FACS-purified fetal germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to profile global gene expression changes of Pou5f1-GFP-positive germ cells between E11.5 to E15.5.

DESIGN
Germ cells were FACS-purified from gonadal single cell suspension based on Pou5f1-GFP expression. Three timepoints were included in this study: E11.5 (male/female), E13.5 (male) and E15.5 (male). For each timepoint, three biological replicates were analyzed. The Pou5f1-GFP-negative (non-germ cell) fraction of E13.5 (male) gonads was also included as a control.
