TITLE
Genome-wide ChIP-seq binding profiles and linked gene expression arrays [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pu.1-mutated murine AML cell line X18.1.1 transfected with inducible Pu.1 (PuER) or empty vector (EV) and clonal lines selected. Cells were induced with OHT for 2 hours prior to collection for ChIP-Seq and expression arrays.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factors Pu.1 and CEBPA and histone mark H3K27Ac by ChIP-Seq.

PLATFORM
