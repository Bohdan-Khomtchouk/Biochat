TITLE
Expression data for HepG2 cells treated with 34 different chemicals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides an evaluation of changes in gene expression associated with treating human HEPG2 cells with 34 different chemical compounds. Gene expression experiments studies were performed in triplicate (n=3) with the cells for each replicate treated and harvested on separate days.

DESIGN
This series is part of a SuperSeries in which human toxicology-relevant cell lines were treated with three doses of 34 chemical compounds (and corresponding vehicle controls) for 6 hours.  Each compound/vehicle treatment group was an individual study performed at different times. Each study was analyzed separately and themes common between studies were reported.
