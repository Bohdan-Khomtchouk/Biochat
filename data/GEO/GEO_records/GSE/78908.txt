TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Anoxybacillus sp. SK 3-4 to aluminum exposure

ORGANISM
Anoxybacillus sp. SK3-4

SUMMARY
By comparing the gene expression profiling in Anoxybacillus sp. SK 3-4 with and without aluminum exposure, the sets of gene up-regulated and down-regulated by aluminum were identified. The function of genes or proteins induced under these conditions can a reflection of the mechanism of resistance. Transcriptome profiling of Anoxybacillus sp. SK 3-4 treated by aluminum would allow a better understanding of the gene involving in tolerance and removal of aluminum.
