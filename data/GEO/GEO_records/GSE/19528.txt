TITLE
Effect of c-Myb deficiency on pre-selection DP thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the mRNA expression profiles of c-Myb deficient and c-Myb sufficient Tcra-/- DP thymocytes. Results provide insight into the role of c-Myb in the regulation of survival and differentiation during the pre-selection DP stage where c-Myb expression is abundant during T cell development.
