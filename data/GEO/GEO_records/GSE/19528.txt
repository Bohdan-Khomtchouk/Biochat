TITLE
Effect of c-Myb deficiency on pre-selection DP thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the mRNA expression profiles of c-Myb deficient and c-Myb sufficient Tcra-/- DP thymocytes. Results provide insight into the role of c-Myb in the regulation of survival and differentiation during the pre-selection DP stage where c-Myb expression is abundant during T cell development.

DESIGN
DP thymocytes were purified from four c-Myb deficient and four c-Myb sufficient mice over magnetic columns.  RNA from each biological replicate was individually hybridized onto a total of eight MOE430 2.0 Chips.
