TITLE
Effects of MYCN knockdwon on miRNA expression in neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global miRNAs expression profilling of SK-N-BE(2)-C cells after dsRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN

DESIGN
To identify MYCN-associated miRNAs, we carried out a small RNA-seq on MYCN knockdown in SK-N-BE(2)-C cells to profile the miRNA expression.
