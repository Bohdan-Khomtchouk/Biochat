TITLE
Mac-1 cells with SATB1 silencing vs control Mac-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell line Mac-1 cells transduced with lenti-virus vector harboring shRNA against SATB1 gene comparing control untreated Mac-1 cells and Mac-1 cells transduced with scrambled shRNA, in which SATB1 expression is not affected.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, SATB1 silenced Mac-1 cells vs control Mac-1 cells. Biological replicates: 2 transduced replicates, 2 control replicates

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
