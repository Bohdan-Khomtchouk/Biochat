TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 during infection in a murine air pouch model

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis SC84

SUMMARY
During infection in the air pouches, S. suis encounters changing environments and host factors. It is important for S. suis to modulate the gene expression in response to stimulants. Using DNA microarray analysis, we compared the transcriptome of S. suis obtained from the air pouches with that from working cultures.
