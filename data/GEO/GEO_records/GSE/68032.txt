TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 during infection in a murine air pouch model

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
During infection in the air pouches, S. suis encounters changing environments and host factors. It is important for S. suis to modulate the gene expression in response to stimulants. Using DNA microarray analysis, we compared the transcriptome of S. suis obtained from the air pouches with that from working cultures.

DESIGN
S. suis were injected into the air pouches. Mice were euthanized at 6 h post infection, and bacterial cells collected from the air pouches were used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using an SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). Total RNA isolated from S. suis grown in working cultures was used as control. RNA concentration and integrity was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Microarray experiments were repeated 4 times for both samples.
