TITLE
Gene expression microarray analysis on hippocampus of Schnurri-2 knockout and wild-type control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Schnurri-2 (Shn-2), an NF-kappa B site-binding protein, tightly binds to the enhancers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes and inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to harbor common variant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with schizophrenia. Shn-2 knockout mice show behavioral abnormalities that strongly resemble those of schizophrenics. We performed gene expression microarray analysis of hippocampi from Shn-2 knockout and wild-type control mice.

DESIGN
Hippocampal RNA isolated from four Shn-2 knockout and four control wild-type mice were compared.
