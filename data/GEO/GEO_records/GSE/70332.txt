SUMMARY
ChIP-Sequencing on Shox2-HA E12.5 heart

DESIGN
ChIP-Sequencing on Shox2-HA E12.5 heart (contain proximal part of pulmonary vein and R/LSVC, part of ventricle was dissected away). For Shox2, anti-HA(Cat.Ab9110, Lot.  GR146572-6).  For Nkx2-5, anti-Nkx2-5 (SantaCruz. Cat. N-19, Lot. SC-8697, mixed  Lot C0113 and Lot 12514) was used. Please see associated manuscript for more detailed information.
