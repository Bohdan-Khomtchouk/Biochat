SUMMARY
By performing biotin-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for two different NUP98 fusions, we defined the genome-wide direct binding sites of NUP98-HOXA9 or NUP98-HOXD13. To test whether NUP98 fusions and Mll1 were recruited to the same region of Hox genes promoters, Mll1 ChIP-seq analysis was carried out in murine NUP98-HOXA9 transformed cells using an anti-Mll1n antibody. In agreement with our results showing that NUP98-HOXA9 interacts with MLL1 in NSL/MLL1 complex, Mll1 binding targets significantly overlap with that of NUP98-HOXA9 at promoter region and gene body region. Given that MOF and MLL1 work in concert to modify H4K16ac and H3K4me3 at promoters, we further test whether H3K4me3 and H4K16ac marks are associated with NUP98-HOXA9-bound targets in murine NUP98-HOXA9 transformed cells by anti-H3K4me3 and anti-H4K16ac ChIP-seq. Our data show that both H3K4me3 and H4K16ac mark presents on NUP98-HOXA9 binding targets at promoters, and this is in line with the coordination role in the activities between MOF-mediated H4K16 acetylation and MLL/SET-mediated H3K4 methylation. In summary, our results confirmed that NUP98-HOXA9 and Mll1 are recruited to the same Hox loci, and this recruitment is associated with activating epigenetic marks, supporting the notion of the association between NUP98 fusions and NSL/Mll1 complex, suggesting that the recruitment of NUP98 fusions to the Hox gene loci maybe through MLL1.

DESIGN
To define the binding targets of NUP98 fusion proteins, and the co-bound sites with MLL1. To determine the status of 2 different histone modifications on NUP98 fusion binding targets using NUP98-HOXA9 transfromed mouse bone marrow LSK cells.
