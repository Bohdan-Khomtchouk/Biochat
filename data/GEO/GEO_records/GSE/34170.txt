TITLE
Dual knockdown of Esrrb and Sox2 in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Esrrb, Sox2 or Esrrb and Sox2 were knocked down in mouse ES cells using shRNA plasmid pSUPER.puro containing shRNAs from the publications Feng et al., 2009 and Rodda et al., 2005. Knockdown was transfected into mouse ES cells using lipofectamine and then cells were selected for knockdown using puromycin. RNA was harvested after 2 days of knockdown.

DESIGN
Esrrb and Sox2 were knocked down in mouse ES cells either individually or together, cells were selected with puromycin and RNA harvested and subjected to microarray after 2 days.
