TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of germ cell proliferation in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Proliferating germ cells in C. elegans provide a useful model system for deciphering fundamental mechanisms underlying the balance between proliferation and differentiation.  Using gene expression profiling of mutants with excess germ cell proliferation, we identified approximately 200 genes expressed in the proliferating germ cells of C. elegans.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from young adult C. elegans hermaphrodites of the genotype unc-32(e189) (control) and from unc-32(e189)glp-1(oz112gf) (excess germ cell proliferation) was directly compared on DNA arrays representing > 90% of C. elegans genes.  Four biological replicates were performed, with balanced dye swaps.
