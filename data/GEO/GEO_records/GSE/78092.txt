TITLE
CricRNA expression profiling  in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive cricRNA array, we screened 13617 circRNAs abundant in the human gastric cancer and Adjacent normal gastric mucosa  tissues, and the function of differentially expressed circRANs were analyzed by bioinformatics. The enrichment results indicated that these circRNAs perhaps participated in the occurrence and development process of gastric cancer.

DESIGN
In this study, three cases of  gastric cancer were used to acquire the circRNA expression profiling, and qPCR was employed to confirm the results of circRNA chip. The function of the differentially expressed circRAN were analyzed by bioinformatic methods.Finally,compared with the adjacent mormal moucosa tissues，the expression of  16 cirRNAs  were up regulated,and 84 cicRANS were down regulated in gastric cancer..qPCR results showed an expression pattern consistent with that of the chip analysis,of those ,three circRNAs exhibited significant differently expression, hsa_circ_0061274 up regulated expression(3.5fold,p < 0.01)，hsa_circ_0000026(-2.1fold,p < 0.01) and hsa_circ_0005927 (-2.7fold,p < 0.01) down regulated expression . The expression profiles of circRAN were compared between garstic cancer and its adjacent normal tissues
