TITLE
Identification of genes up-regulated by the overexpression of HSF1 in human HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze target genes of human heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), we first generated two independent HeLa clones (RDT1 and RDT2) expressing an actively mutated hHSF1 (hHSF1Î”RDT), which lacks the regulatory domain that masks its activation domain and possesses a glutamic acid at amino acid 395 instead of a leucine in the suppression domain of the trimerization domain (Fujimoto et al., J. Biol. Chem. 280, 34908-34916, 2005). We also generated a HeLa clone expressing chicken HSF1 (HeLa/cHSF1) to compare its profile of gene expression with those of RDT1 and RDT2 cells (Nakai and Morimoto, Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 1983-1997, 1993). We then carried out DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from HeLa, HeLa/cHSF1, RDT1, and RDT2 cells grown under normal growth conditions.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in human HeLa, RDT1, RDT2, and HeLa/cHSF1 were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix).
