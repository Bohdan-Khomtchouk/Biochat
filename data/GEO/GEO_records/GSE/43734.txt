TITLE
Expression data from 0.15M and 0.7M-fed wild-type and ChREBP mutant, third instar Drosophila larval fat bodies (FBs)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chronic high sugar feeding induces obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance in flies and mammals. These phenotypes are controlled by the fat body, a liver- and adipose- like tissue in Drosophila flies. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the connection between diet and insulin sensitivity, we used Illumina RNA-seq to profile gene expression in fat bodies isolated from chronically high sugar fed, wandering (post-prandial) third instar wild type larvae w(L3). These data were compared to control-fed wild-type wL3 fat bodies as well as those expressing transgenic interfering RNA (i) targeting CG18362 (Mio/dChREBP) in the fat body on both diets.

DESIGN
Female VDRC w1118, cgGAL4, UAS-Dcr2 or UAS-ChREBPi(52606), cgGAL4, UAS-Dcr2 wandering third instar larvae were fed control (0.15M) or high (0.7M) sucrose and fat bodies isolated for RNA extraction.
