TITLE
Gene expression data of BBB and BCB two-cell embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We constructed one-cell stage embryos by maternal pronuclear (mPN) transfer having B6 ooplasm, B6 paternal PN (pPN), and either B6 or C3H mPN (BBB and BCB, respectively). We collected embryos of each type that were either treated (BBB+a, BCB+a) or untreated with α-amanitin (BBB, BCB) at the two-cell stage for microarray analysis. Comparison of the transcriptomes of these different kinds of embryos revealed genes for which expression differs according to maternal PN strain of origin, and the α-amanitin data revealed which of these differences is due to gene transcription, as opposed to any transcription-independent differences attributable to ooplasm-derived maternal mRNA pools.

DESIGN
There are 4 replicates for each kind/treatment two-cell embryos (BBB, BCB, BBB+a, BCB+a).
