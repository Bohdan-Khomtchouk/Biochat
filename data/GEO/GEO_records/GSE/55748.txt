TITLE
MicroRNA levels in non-transformed and transformed lung cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA levels in non-transformed BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells, two lines of mycoplasma transformed BEAS-2B cells, and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were measured. Microarray analyses of 1145 microRNAs in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and two other transformed lung cell types relative to BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were performed.  106 miRNAs were down-regulated and 69 miRNAs were up-regulated in all three transformed lines

DESIGN
The control cells were the human non-transformed BEAS-2B cells (Lechner JF, LaVeck MA. A serum-free method for culturing normal human bronchial epithelial cells at clonal density. J. Tissue Culture Methods 9: 43-48, 1985).  The BEAStra1 and BEAStra2 cells were replicate populations of BEAS-2B cells that were transformed following infection with mycoplasma (Jiang, S., Zhang, S., Langenfeld, J., Lo, S.C., and Rogers, M.B., Mycoplasma infection transforms normal lung cells and induces bone morphogenetic protein 2 expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms. J Cell Biochem. 104(2): 580-594, 2007).  A459 lung adenocarcinoma cells were derived from a human lung tumor (Giard DJ, et al. In vitro cultivation of human tumors: establishment of cell lines derived from a series of solid tumors. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 51: 1417-1423, 1973. PubMed: 4357758).
