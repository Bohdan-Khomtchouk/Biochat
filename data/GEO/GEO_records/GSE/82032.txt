TITLE
Human basal-like breast cancer cell line HCC1143 treated with BET inhibitor JQ1 in combination with MEK inhibitor Trametinib or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to understand the changes in gene expression in the human basal-like breast cancer cell line HCC1143 following treatment with the MEK inhibitor Trametinib (T), PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 (B), the BET inhibition JQ1 (JQ), Trametinib + JQ1 (TJ), or BEZ235 + JQ1(BJ), compared to a DMSO control (D). Samples were treated for 72hr and run in triplicate.

DESIGN
The human basal-like breast cancer cell line HCC1143 was treated for 72hr with 1uM Trametinib (T), 1uM BEZ235, 1uM JQ1 (JQ), 1uM Trametinib + 1uM JQ1 (TJ), 1uM BEZ235 + 1uM JQ1 (BJ), or a 0.05% DMSO control. Total RNA was isolated using a QIAGEN total RNA RNeasy kit, libraries were generated with a Truseq kit, and samples were run on the Nextseq500, data processing is described below.
