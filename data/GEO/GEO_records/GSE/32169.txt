TITLE
Gene expression profile of phagocyticially challenged human trabecular meshwork cells under physiolgical and oxidative stress conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In theses experimetns we have analized the differential gene expression profile in human trabecular meshwork cells phagocytically challenged to E. coli and pigment under physiological and oxidative stress conditions using affymetrix microarrays

DESIGN
HTM cells grown for two weeks either at 5% oxygen concentration or 40% oxygen concentration were phagocytically challenged to either E.coli or pigment. Changes in gene profile were analyzed at day 2.
