TITLE
Gene expression signatures in heart tissues of mice simulating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [Study1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a PTSD mouse model, we investigated the longitudinal transcriptomic changes in heart tissues after the exposure to stress through intimidation

DESIGN
We designed our initial study (Study I) with four experimental conditions where we varied the length of time that subservient mice were exposed to aggressor mice and the length of rest time after the exposure.  The conditions included were short exposure-short rest (T5R1-T indicates the number of days of trauma exposure; R indicates the number of days of rest after exposure), short exposure-long rest (T5R10), long exposure-short rest (T10R1) and long exposure-long rest (T10R42)
