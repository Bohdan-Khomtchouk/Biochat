TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in the liver tumors of mir-122 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To invesigate the physiological roles of mir-122 in hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed expression profiling of the liver tumors of mir-122 knockout mice and the liver tissues of the control B6/129 mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from three tumors of mir-122 knockout mice and liver tissues of  two control mice of 11 months of age; five tumors of  mir-122 knockout mice and the liver tissues of three control mice of 14 months of age. Gene expression was quantified by robust multi-array analysis (RMA) using the Genomic Suite software from Partek.
