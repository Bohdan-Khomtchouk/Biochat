TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in the liver tumors of mir-122 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To invesigate the physiological roles of mir-122 in hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed expression profiling of the liver tumors of mir-122 knockout mice and the liver tissues of the control B6/129 mice.
