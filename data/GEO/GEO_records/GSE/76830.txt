TITLE
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from T-cell compared with that from adult dermal fibroblast (aHDF) [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we determine the transcriptional profile by microarray of iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurospheres generated from T-cells or aHDF by using direct neurosphere method.

DESIGN
iPSCs and iPSC-derived tertiary neurospheres generated from T-cells or aHDF subjected to the gene expression microarray analysis.
