TITLE
Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells cultured on 3D nanofiber scaffolds or 2D films

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to evaluate expression differences from a single donor human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) as a function of varied polymer-based tissue engineering scaffolds.  These scaffolds include polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers (PCL_NF), films (PCL_SC), poly D,L-lactic acid (PDLLA) nanofibers (PDLLA_NF), films (PDLLA_SC), tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and TCPS with osteogenic supplements (TCPS_OS). The results revealed that scaffold structure was able to significantly affect gene expression, with nanofiber scaffolds inducing similar gene expression patterns to hBMCSs cultured with osteogenic media.

DESIGN
A library of scaffolds prepared from polycaprolactone or poly D,L-lactic acid was sythesized and cultured with hBMSCs for 14 days with RNA extracted from cells on Day 1 and Day 14.  Gene expression analysis was performed using BRB ArrayTools. SC = spun coat, BNF = big nanofiber, TCPS = tissue culture polystyrene, TCPS+OS = tissue culture polystyrene with osteogenic supplements. This data forms is part of a pending publication:  Baker et al. Ontology Analysis of Global Gene Expression Differences of Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Cultured on 3D Scaffolds or 2D Films and is a subset of the 72 array data referenced in ( Kumar et al. The determination of stem cell fate by 3D scaffold structures through the control of cell shape, Biomaterials (2011) 32, 9188-9196.)  The 72 array data set is submitted separately to GEO as GSE50743.
