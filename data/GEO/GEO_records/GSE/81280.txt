TITLE
The CENP-B fission yeast homolog, ABP1, is involved in the repression of cryptic transcription from the Tf2 and rRNA genes repeat [smallRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Abp1 is homologous to mammalian CENP-B. Abp1 has various seemingly independent functions in the yeast nucleus. It binds to pericentromeric repeats and contribute to heterochromatin formation (ref). Abp1 is involved in regulating the directionality of mating-type switching by regulating the transcription of a member of the recombination-promoting complex (refs). Abp1 also preserves genome integrity by silencing the Tf2 retrotransposons and protecting replication forks during pausing (ref). The profile of the RNA extracted from abp1Δ cells shows an accumulation of RNA in size ranging between 100 and 200 bp. Solexa sequencing of these “little RNA” (liRNA) and comparison of their levels with the WT showed an increase in liRNA coming from various classes of genomic features. The biggest fold changes are attributed to liRNA coming from LTR retrotransposons and the rDNA genes repeats. We show that these liRNAs are targeted for degradation by the exosome and are the products of pervasive RNA Polymerase II transcription. Finally, we describe the genetic interactions of various transcriptional gene silencing effectors with the abp1 deletion in the silencing of the liRNA.
