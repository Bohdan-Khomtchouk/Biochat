TITLE
Expression data from fibroblasts cultured from normal and fibrotic human lung tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary fibrosis develops as a consequence of environmentally induced lung injury and/or an inherent disease susceptibility causing fibroblast activation, proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. The study was undertaken to characterise global gene expression in pulmonary fibroblasts to better understand the mechanisms underlying the fibrotic fibroblast phenotype.

DESIGN
Gene expression was evaluated in lung fibroblasts derived from ten controls (normal periphery of resected tumor), open lung biopsies from eight patients with interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis (fibrotic non specific interstitial pneumonia pattern on biopsy), and from three patients with usual interstitial pneumonia. Lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. At confluence, lung fibroblasts were serum-deprived for 44 hours in the presence of fibroblast growth medium with the addition of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma).
