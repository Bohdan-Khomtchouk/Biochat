TITLE
Widespread Discordance of DNA Methylation Between two Accessible Human Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inter-individual variability in DNA methylation has been hypothesized to contribute to complex phenotypes through epigenetic modulation of gene expression levels. Population epigenetic studies have been examining differences in DNA methylation in a variety of accessible tissues for association with specific diseases or exposures, but relatively little is known about how this inter-individual variation differs between tissues. This study presents an analysis of global DNA methylation differences between matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal epithelial cells; specifically it examines differential DNA methylation, probe-wise DNA methylation variance, and how methylation relates to a number of demographic factors across the two tissues. We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells have overall higher DNA methylation than buccal epithelial cells, and regions of the genome that are differently methylated between the tissues tend to have low CpG density. We also discovered that although both tissues show extensive probe-wise variability, the specific regions and magnitude of variability differed between tissues. Finally, we observed that while both buccal epithelial and peripheral mononuclear blood cell DNA methylation was associated with gender, only  methylation of the latter was associated with body mass index. The work presented here offers insight into variability of DNA methylation between individuals and across tissues and the suitability of buccal epithelial and peripheral mononuclear cells for the biological questions explored by epigenome-wide association studies in human populations.
