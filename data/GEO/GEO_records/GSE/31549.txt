TITLE
RNA-Seq on Illumina platform of Drosophila DrosDel deficiency lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq reads of DrosDel deficiency (Df/+) and parental strain diploid flies along with spike-in controls was performed on the Illumina platform. Samples are named in this dataset according to the following sample naming scheme: tissue_genotype shorthand_sex_biological replicate #_platform.

DESIGN
We sequenced mRNA from pools of female or male DrosDel and w1118 (parental strain for the Df/+ flies).

PLATFORM
GPL9061 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Drosophila melanogaster)
