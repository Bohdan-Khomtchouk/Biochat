TITLE
Identification of miRNA-like RNAs in a plant pathogen fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum by High-throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum

SUMMARY
This study provides a first large-scale cloning and characterization of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum milRNAs and milRNAs candidates. Two microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) and 42 milRNA candidates were identified by sequence analysis. These milRNAs and candidates provide new insights into the functional roles of small RNAs and adds new resources for the study of plant pathogenic fungi.

DESIGN
We constructed a small RNA library from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
