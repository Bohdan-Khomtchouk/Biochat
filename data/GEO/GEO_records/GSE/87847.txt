TITLE
A Putative Blood-Based Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder-Associated Ileocolitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in inflamed gastrointestinal tissue and blood from GI-symptomatic children with ASD compared to non-inflamed tissue and blood from typically developing GI-syptomatic children. The hypothesis being tested was that peripheral blood would yield a surrogate biomarker for GI inflammation in children with ASD.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from inflamed gastrointestinal tissue (terminal ileum and/or colon) and peripheral blood from children with ASD and corresponding (non-iflamed) tissue and blood from typically developing children.
