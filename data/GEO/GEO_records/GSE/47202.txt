TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in brm mutant seedlings and in wt seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
By using ChIP-seq, we found that loss of BRM activity in developing seedlings leads to ectopic and increased H3K27me3 deposition at several hundred genes, indicating the critical role of BRM in preventing the inappropriate deposition of this histone mark. Unexpectedly, BRM also facilitates PcG function at some PcG targets, suggesting the requirement for BRM in the deposition of this mark at certain PcG target genes.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 in 14-day-old wt and brm seedlings. Two biological replicates for each one.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
