TITLE
GATA3 induces human T cell commitment following Notch-induced T-lineage specification (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we show that GATA3 induces T-lineage commitment following Notch-induced T-lineage specification through direct regulation of at least 3 distinct processes: repression of NK-cell fate, activation of T-lineage genes to promote further differentiation, and down modulation of Notch signalling activity.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in RPMI8402 cells after transduction with control, shGATA3 or shTCF1 and culture for 48h. Cells were collected 48h after transduction and sorted for EGFP+. This was performed for 2 replicates.
