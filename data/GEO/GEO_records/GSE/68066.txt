TITLE
Definition of the AmrZ regulon under a twitching-promoting condition

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
A novel approach using cellophane sheets was designed to promote Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility, as well as to provide convenience for cell harvest. The AmrZ regulon was defined under this specific growth condition by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
WT P. aeruginosa and amrZ mutants were cultivated under this novel condition, and their transcriptional profiles were defined. WT P. aeruginosa strains include PAO1 and WFPA510 (complemented strain), while amrZ mutants include WFPA205 (Î”amrZ) and WFPA513 (AmrZV20A, DNA binding deficient). Each strain has 3 biological replicates.
