TITLE
Transcriptome-wide discovery of microRNA binding sites in human brain by Ago2 HITS-CLIP [Ago2-miRNA complexes]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, seeking to gain insight into the array of transcripts engaged with miRNAs in human brain, we performed HITS-CLIP to profile transcriptome-wide Ago2:RNA interactions in a panel of eleven post-mortem adult human brain samples harvested from adult motor cortex and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with movement and psychiatric disorders .

DESIGN
High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) Eleven post-mortem adult human brain tissues were subjected to ultraviolet radiation to crosslink proteins with nucleic acids, and HITS-CLIP was performed as previously described by Chi et al Nature. 2009 Jul 23;460(7254):479-86 using an anti-Ago2 polyclonal antibody and some additional modifications.
