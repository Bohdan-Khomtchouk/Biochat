TITLE
Evaluation of autoantibody signatures in meningioma patients using human proteome array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our objective was to identify the potential autoantibody markers in meningiomas using high-density human proteome arrays (~17,000 full-length recombinant human proteins). This study revealed the dysregulation of 489 and 104 proteins in grades I and II of meningioma, respectively, along with the enrichment of signalling pathways which play a major role in the manifestation of the disease. This study revealed the dysregulation of 489 and 104 proteins in grades I and II of meningioma, respectively, along with the enrichment of signalling pathways which play a major role in the manifestation of the disease. Autoantibody targets like IGHG4, CRYM, EFCAB2, STAT6, HDAC7A and CCNB1 were dysregulated across both grades.

DESIGN
We performed screening of sera from 15 healthy controls, 10 Grade I and 5 Grade II meningioma patients.
