TITLE
Release of Human Cytomegalovirus from latency by a KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A new actor of HCMV latency is unveiled, where KAP1 protein binds to viral genome to recruit SetDB1 and trigger H3K9 trimethylation. A switch of phosphorylation state mediated by mTOR leads to lytic replication, opening new approaches to curtail CMV infection but also to purge the virus from organ transplants.

DESIGN
Analyses of transcriptional profiles and chromatin state in KAP1 WT and KO (or KD)  cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
