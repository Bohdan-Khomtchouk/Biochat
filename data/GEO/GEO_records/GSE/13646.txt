TITLE
Global effect of JTV or JTV-Alt overexpression in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JTV is not only a structural component of multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, but also a regulator of FBP that in turn controls c-Myc expression. In order to identify JTV target genes other than FBP and c-Myc, JTV or JTV-Alt (alternatively spliced form of JTV, enriched in the nucleus) protein was over-expressed in HeLa cells and global gene expression changes were monitored using cDNA expression microarray.
