TITLE
Expression data from murine colorectal tumours of control and IL-6Ralpha-deficient mice fed a high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity increases colorectal cancer despite other disturbances. We have used the AOM/DSS protocol to induce colitis-associated cancer in control and IL-6Ra deficient animals. Tumours were microdissected and globalgene expression was analysed using microarray.

DESIGN
Upon weaning control and IL-6Ralpha-deficient animals were fed a High fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. Azoxymethane (AOM) (10mg/kg) was injected at week 8 and 4 days later 1.5% dextrane sodium sulphate (DSS) was supplied in the drinking water for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed 62 days after AOM injection and colorectal tumours were microdissected and processed for RNA isolation.
