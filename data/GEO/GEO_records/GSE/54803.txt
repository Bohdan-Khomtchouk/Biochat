TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the bacterial pustule-resistant soybean cultivars(2)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To investigate the differential action between resistance and susceptible cultivars, we examined genome wide expression levels at five time points after Xag-inoculation using microarray. The soybean microarray was designed using the server-based eArray platform ( http://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/ ) from Agilent Technologies (Wolber et al., 2006). The current slide layout consists of four arrays of > 44,000 features, including a set of Agilent's positive and negative control features.

DESIGN
An oligonucleotide microarray containing 42,564 unique probes (60-mer) was created from 33,574 unigenes from Glycine max database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=3847 ) (May 2009) as templates for probe design.

PLATFORM
GPL18266 Agilent-023991 GT-PNU-Gmax-090519 (Probe Name version)
