TITLE
Characterizing the expression of Pan troglodytes olfactory receptor genes

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes

SUMMARY
We aim, among other things, to characterize olfactory receptor (OR) genes wich are differentially expressed between olfactory epithelium (OE) and other organ tissues, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and to make comparisons with human data from a previous series using the same platform. Keywords: Comparative
