TITLE
Duchene Muscular Dystrophy Dogs Escapers and Affected Muscle Dogs Compared to Normal Dogs

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of dog muscle tissue comparing control dogs. tested, genomewide, for genes differentially expressed in muscle between the escapers and the affected dogs. Using Agilent mRNA SurePrint Canine arrays, we compared muscle gene expression of the two escapers, four affected, and four normal dogs at age 2 years.

DESIGN
normal, affected DMD, and escapers
