TITLE
Identification of inflammation-related microRNAs deregulated in the plasma from intracerebral hemorrhage patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) present in plasma might display a specific signature in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Global miRNA profiles were determined with the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray platform, 027233. ICH patients display a characteristic inflammation-related miRNA profile as compared to healthy controls.

DESIGN
Plasma samples were collected from the following 6 subject groups: male ICH patients (n=8), female ICH patients (n=7), male healthy control (n=4), female healthy control (n=4), male ischemic stroke patients (n=8) and female ischemic stroke patients (n=8). Total RNAs isolated from 1 ml plasma were pooled for each group. A fixed volume of RNA sample was withdrawn from each pool and used for microarray detection.
