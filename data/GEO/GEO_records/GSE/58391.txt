TITLE
KDM6 demethylase independent loss of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation during early embryonic development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K27me3 represses developmental genes at initial embryonic stages. The KDM6 family, comprised of UTX and JMJD3, are the only known proteins that demethylate H3K27me3 and they are hypothesized to catalyze the rapid removal of repressive chromatin in early mammalian development. However, we report that male embryos carrying mutations in both Utx and Jmjd3 survive to term and appear phenotypically normal at mid-gestation. We utilize several cell culture models to demonstrate that H3K27me3 is lost from repressed promoters in the absence of active KDM6 demethylation. Our data indicate that KDM6 H3K27me3 demethylation is not essential in the early embryo and that H3K27me3 loss from developmental genes occurs via novel mechanisms.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) in 2 cell types (ES and retinoic acid treated ES cells) comparing WT to UTX and JMJD3 KOs.  In ES cells, there are two WT replicates and two KO replicates, both measuring H3K27me3, and one replicate measuring input.  In retinoic acid treatment, there are two replicates each for measuring H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in WT and KO cell lines, and one replicate measuring input.
