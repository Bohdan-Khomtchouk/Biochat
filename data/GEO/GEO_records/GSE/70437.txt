TITLE
The acute cold response of brown adipose tissue analyzed by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to map the global changes in gene expression of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) of mice subjected to acute cold exposure for 3 days. Here we find extensive changes in the iBAT transcriptome in response to cold with a prominent induction of genes associated to lipid-related metabolic processes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of poly-A enriched RNA isolated from brown adipose tissue of 5 mice housed at room temperature (22°C) and 5 mice exposed to cold (4°C) for 3 days.

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
