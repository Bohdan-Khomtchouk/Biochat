TITLE
Impact of bariatric surgery on RNA-seq gene expression profiles of peripheral monocytes in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiles in peripheral monocytes (PM) from 19 obese women before and 3 months after bariatric surgery using the RNA-seq technology. This dataset is linked to the dataset GSE65540 providing expression profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in the same population. Due to exclusion of some individuals for technical reasons, the overlap between the 2 datasets is of 18 women.

DESIGN
mRNA sequencing of peripheral monocyte (PM) samples from 19 obese women before and 3 months after bariatric surgery
