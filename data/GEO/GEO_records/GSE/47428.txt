TITLE
A haploid gene-trap mutant collection enables functional genetics in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently, gene-trap mutagenesis in near haploid human cells has been used to disrupt genes and identify novel host-pathogen interactions and elucidate mechanisms of drug action. Building on this technology, we here report the generation of a human gene-trap mutant collection of individual clones, which currently covers over a quarter of the expressed genome.

DESIGN
Strand specific RNA-Seq of ribosomal RNA depleted total cellular RNA to measure transcript abundance and to detect fusion transcripts in KBM7 cells at standard culture conditions.
