TITLE
RISC-mediated control of selected chromatin regulators stabilizes ground state pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (RIP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed an integrated analysis of RNA and proteins at the transition between na√Øve ES cells and cells primed to differentiate. During this transition, mRNAs coding for chromatin regulators were specifically released from translational inhibition mediated by RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). This suggests that, prior to differentiation, the propensity of ES cells to change their epigenetic status is hampered by RNA interference. The expression of these chromatin regulators was reinstated following acute inactivation of RISC, and it correlated with loss of stemness markers and activation of early cell differentiation markers in treated ES cells.

DESIGN
Cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes from mouse embryonic stem cells at different stages of neural in vitro differentiation were immunoprecipitated with anti-Argonaute antibody and analyzed by microarray hybridization
