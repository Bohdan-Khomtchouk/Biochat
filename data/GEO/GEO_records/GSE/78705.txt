TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of control and SRSF2-/- Huh7 cells Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated the SRSF2-/- Huh7 cells,and collected the cells at 2 days after transfected with siRNA. Then, we extracted RNAs and performed next generation sequencing. By comparing sequencing data from control and SRSF2 -/- samples, we profiled the alternative splicing events and gene expression regulated by SRSF2 in HCC.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells mRNA profiles of  control and SRSF2-/- were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
