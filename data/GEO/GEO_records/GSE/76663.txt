TITLE
miRNAs affected by antagomiR-17 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the the effect of antagomir-17 treatment on human endothelial cells derived from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, we have employed mRNA sequencing. The antagomiR-17 used in this study was purchased from Dharmacon and cell transfection was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAx from Life Technologies. Scramble antagomiR from Ambion was used as control. Cells were transfected with antagomiR-17 or scrambled antagomiR for 48 hours.  After 48 h, the cells were collected, RNA was isolated and RNA samples were shipped to Exiqon Services, Denmark for mRNA sequencing. All sequencing experiments (RNA integrity measurements, library preparation and next generation sequencing) were conducted at Exiqon Services, Denmark.

DESIGN
CD34+ endothelial cells differentiated from umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) were treated with 50 nM antagomiR-17 (Dharmacon) or scrambled antagomiR (Ambion) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAx (Life Technologies) for 48 h.  Three replicates were used for each condition (i.e. antagomiR-17 and scramble antagomiR conditions).
