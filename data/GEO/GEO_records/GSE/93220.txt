TITLE
Microarray analysis on fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae fed with either a semi-purified diet only or a semi-purified diet supplemented with palm fruit juice (PFJ)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PFJ (4 ml for a final concentration of 19,000 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per kg diet or 0.86 mg GAE per kcal diet) was supplemented to larvae of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) given a semi-purified diet to observe for possible effects on energy metabolism and lifespan. Larvae were used five days since the egg stage for gene expression studies. Results from the microarray data analysis carried out show that fruit fly larvae given PFJ had up-regulated transport and metabolic processes, while development and morphogenesis processes were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from larvae of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) given PFJ in a semi-purified diet (five days since the egg stage) were compared to controls (three replicates in the treatment group versus three replicates in the control group, with each replicate containing total RNA from three to four larvae).
