TITLE
Genome-wide expressing profiling of nasopharyngeal carcinoma primary tumors versus non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore differentially expressed genes between nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) primary tumors and non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues, 18 NPC tissue samples versus 18 control samples were utilized to perform genome-wide expressing profiling. Consequently, 2992 genes were found to be differentially expressed in NPC tissues relative to the control (FC > 2, P < 0.05). Among these 2992 genes, uPA was ranked as the top one in all upregulated genes sorted by ascending order of P-value. Moreover, expression of uPAR was also upregulated in NPC tissues with FC=3.34 and P=7.52Ã—105.

DESIGN
18 nasopharyngeal carcinoma primary tumors and 18 non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues were used to perform genome-wide expressing profiling. The median ages of patients were 46 (range, 19-77) for NPC patients and 45 (range, 18-78) for the non-cancerous cohort. Almost one third of patients were female. All samples were collected before any anti-cancer treatment.
