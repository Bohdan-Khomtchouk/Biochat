TITLE
tRNA gene identity acts as a determinant of gene positioning

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we report that the spatial organization of yeast tRNA genes depends upon both locus position and tRNA identity; supporting the idea that the genomic organization of tRNA loci utilizes tRNA dependent signals within the nucleoprotein-tRNA complexes that form into clusters. We use high-throughput sequencing coupled to Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture to detect interactions with two wild type tRNAs and these same positions replaced with suppressor tRNAs (SUP4-1).

DESIGN
Detect DNA-DNA interactions (Circular chromosome conformation capture; 4C) with two wild type tRNAs and these same positions replaced with suppressor tRNAs (SUP4-1) Supplementary files: Alignment files generated by Topography v1.19 software.
