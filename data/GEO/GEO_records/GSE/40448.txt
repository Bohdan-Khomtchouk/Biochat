TITLE
Microarray analysis of toxicogenomic effect of Ortho-Benzyl-Para-Chloro Phenol (OBPCP) on Staphylococcus aureus.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of Staphylococcus aureus following Ortho-Benzyl-Para-Chloro Phenol (OBPCP) treatment using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Results from this study provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to OBPCP.

DESIGN
We conducted five independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Ortho-Benzyl-Para-Chloro Phenol(OBPCP). Fold change was calculated as a ration between the signal averages of five untreated (control) and five OBPCP-treated (experimental) cultures after 0, 10 and 60 min exposure time.
