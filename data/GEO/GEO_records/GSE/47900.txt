TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis in motor and sensory cortex as a result of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a neuroinflammatory model for Multiple sclerosis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed micrarrays to investigate neuronal gene expression changes during acute inflammatory CNS axon injury using the murine myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. The present study was assigned to assess the direct and indirect endogenous neuronal response to spinal axonal injury in the motor and sensory cortex.

DESIGN
Gene expression in motor and sensory cortex enriched tissue was assessed from four healthy and six EAE female mice. Tissue was collected from mice with paraplegia or monoplegia, with contralateral hindlimb paresis (EAE day 18-21).  The gene expression profiles of the EAE mice were compared to the motor or sensory cortex of healthy control mice, resulting in a list of differentially expressed genes in healthy and EAE mice.
