TITLE
RNA-sequencing of subcellular fractions in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the subcellular localization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
We performed cellular fractionation in V6.5 male mouse embryonic stem cells to isolate chromatin-associated, soluble nuclear, and cytoplasmic RNA, and sequenced total and polyadenylated RNA.
