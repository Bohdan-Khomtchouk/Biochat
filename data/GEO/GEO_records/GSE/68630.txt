TITLE
miRNA expression during early, mid and late breast cancer disease progression in mammary glands from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that typically inhibit the translation and stability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), controlling genes involved in a variety of cellular processes. miRNA dysregulation is recognized to play an essential role in the development and progression of cancer. MMTV-PyMT mice (Jax Strain: FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J) are a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. Upon activation of the MMTV-PyVT transgene (mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat upstream of a cDNA sequence encoding the Polyoma Virus middle T antigen (PyVT)) female carriers develop palpable mammary tumors as early as 5 weeks of age. We performed miRNA microarrays on samples from the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs during development of malignant disease in this model.
