TITLE
Comparative gene array analysis of progenitor cells from deep neck and subcutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of progenitor cells from human supraclavicular and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Studies in animal models revealed that brown and white adipocytes derive from different progenitor cells. Molecular characteristics of these cells have not been investigated in detail in humans. Results provide evidence into the molecular basis of the difference of white and brown progenitor cells in humans.

DESIGN
Progenitor cells from paired samples of supraclavicular and subcutaneous of six patients undergoing neck surgery were isolated by collagenase digestion and subsequently transferred to cell culture. After reaching subconfluency (7 days), we harvested RNA and analyzed differencens in gene expression by microarray analysis.
