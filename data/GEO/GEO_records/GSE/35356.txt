TITLE
Gene expression profiles of oral normal fibroblasts (NFs) and oral carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify genes differentially expressed in oral CAFs with respect to their normal counterparts, i.e. oral NFs. We collected oral normal mucosal tissues and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues from 12 healthy people and 12 OSCC patients, respectively, at West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuang University, P. R. China. The tissues were isolated, cultured and purified using standard protocols to obtain oral NFs and CAFs. Agilent 4×44K Whole Genome Oligo Microarrays were used to measure the gene expression profiles of the samples. Sample preparation and hybrid reactions were performed according to the manufacture’s instructions. RNA samples from NFs and CAFs were pooled respectively before hybridization. The chips were scanned and visualized using the Agilent DNA microarray scanner. Probe set intensities were measured using Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 10.5.1.1). Raw data were normalized in the Agilent GeneSpring GX software (version 11.0) using the Agilent FE one-color scenario (mainly median normalization).

DESIGN
Oral NFs and CAFs were obtained from tissues derived from 12 healthy people undergoing plastic surgery and 12 OSCC patiens undergoing surgical resection. RNA samples from NFs and CAFs were pooled respectively before hybridization.
