SUMMARY
bra-inra09-02_bioen_nitrogen - nitrate induction - nlp mutants - Short term nitrate induction kinetics in wildtype, nlp7-1, nlp7-3 and nlp6nlp7 - 10 days old seedling grown in liquid culture on 3mM nitrate wer starvec for N for 3 days and the kinetic for the resupply of nitrate was studied during a short kinetic (0,5, 10,20 minutes).

DESIGN
