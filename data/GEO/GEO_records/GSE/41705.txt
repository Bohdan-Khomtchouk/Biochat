TITLE
Transcriptomic study of Sphingomonas sp. LH128 inoculated into phenanthrene-contaminated soil

ORGANISM
Sphingomonas sp. LH128

SUMMARY
The survival, pollutant degradation activity and transcriptome response was monitored in Sphingomonas sp. LH128 inoculated into soil. Cultivable cell numbers were determined by plating, while phenanthrene degradation was monitored by HPLC. The genetic base for the adaptive strategy of LH128 in soil was investigated by using microarray consisting 7,200 gene-coding ORFs. During 4 hours of incubation, 510 genes were differentially expressed (317 increased and 193 reduced expression) while 610 genes were differentially expressed (318 increased and 292 reduced) after 10 days of incubation. Genes with increased expression comprised of gene encoding PAH catabolic enzymes, stress resistance, oxidative stress tolerance, outer membrane proteins/porins and efflux pump proteins while the downregulated genes comprised of genes encoding flagellar biosynthesis, ribosomal proteins and ATPase.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic response of phenanthrene degrading Sphingomonas sp. LH128 inoculated into phenanthrene contaminated soil after 4h and after 10 days of incubation was studied using genome-wide gene expression analysis. For this purpose, the strain was pregrown in minimal medium and inoculated at appropriated celld densitites. RNA was extracted both from soil and and from initial inoculum and cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy3. Transcriptomic response in soil of three replicates per conditions after both incubation duration were analyzed and compared with the initial inoculum
