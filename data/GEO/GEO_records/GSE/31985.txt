TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomes between Marf1+/+ (WT) and Marf1 ENU/ENU (Mutant) fully-grown oocytes (FGO)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Marf1 (MUT) female mice are infertile and the meiosis of the oocytes are arrest at prophase I. We thought to identify the potential causes of the meiotic arrest phenotype in the mutant oocytes by comparing the transcriptomes of the WT and mutant fully-grown oocytes (from 23-d old mice) that are transcriptional silent. We compared the transcriptomes of WT and MUT FGOs.

DESIGN
3 individual oocyte samples of each genotype (WT and MUT).
