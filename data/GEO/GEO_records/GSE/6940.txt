TITLE
Characterisation of the mouse megakaryocyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify all genes expressed in primary mouse megakaryocytes Keywords: Megakaryocyte, SAGE, transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
Mouse megakaryocytes were grown in vitro from bone marrow progenitors.  Mature, polyploid (approximately 95% 64n and 128n) differentiated megakaryocytes were used to generate RNA for SAGE library construction.
