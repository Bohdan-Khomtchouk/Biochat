TITLE
The Pelvic Radiation and Vorinostat (PRAVO) Study - Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study objective was to propose molecular mechanisms of action of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. In the PRAVO phase 1 study, patients that were scheduled to receive pelvic palliative radiation to 30 Gy in 3-Gy fractions for gastrointestinal carcinoma, were enrolled onto four sequential dose levels of vorinostat, starting at 100 mg daily with dose escalation in increments of 100 mg. Endpoints included treatment safety and tolerability, tumor response, and biological activity of vorinostat. For the purpose of identifying biomarkers of vorinostat action, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, representing normal tissue exposed to vorinostat, were used. The samples were collected, one at baseline and two on-treatment samples. The time points for sample collection were chosen based on our previous data from experimental colorectal carcinoma models exposed to vorinostat, demonstrating that the maximum tumor histone acetylation 2-3 hours after drug exposure was restored to baseline after 24 hours. In PRAVO study patients, tumor histone hyperacetylation was observed 3 hours after vorinostat administration.

DESIGN
From the 17 patients enrolled onto the PRAVO study, a full set of three samples was obtained from 14 individuals: one baseline sample collected prior to commencement of vorinostat treatment (T0), and two on-treatment samples collected 2 and 24 hours after the patient had received the preceding daily dose of vorinostat (T2 and T24). Individual vorinostat dose levels were 100 mg (D100), 200 mg (D200), 300 mg (D300), or 400 mg (D400).
