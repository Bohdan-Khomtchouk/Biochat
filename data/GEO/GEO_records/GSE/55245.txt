TITLE
micro RNA-379 couples glucocorticoid hormones to metabolic dysfunction in diabesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In metabolic control, GC signaling acts as a major counter-regulatory system against insulin action, and aberrantly elevated GC activity is tightly linked to major components of the so-called Metabolic Syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and systemic dyslipidemia. Here we identify the hepatic induction of the conserved microRNA (miR)-379/410 genomic cluster as a key component of GC/GR-driven metabolic dysfunction in “diabesity” Microarray data were utilized to screened for differentially regulated miRNAs between wt and db/db and between wt and GR Knockdown mice

DESIGN
For wt vs. db/db: mice were fasted for 24 hours and refed for 6 hours; For GR-dependent miRNAs: mice were treated with rAAV delivering either control or GR-directed miRNA for the knockdown of the GR specifically in the liver.
