TITLE
Effect of Seprase/FAP alpha on the metastasis of human melanoma LOX cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to detect the molecular mechanism of seprase involved in tumor metastasis, a comparison of gene expression pattern was made between two groups of human melanoma LOX cell sublines, one is transfected with mock vector expressing GFP only (GUS-1 < GSM30738 > , GUS-2 < GSM30729 > and GUS-3 < GSM30730 > ) and the other with pGUS expressing GFP and siRNA targeting mRNA of seprase/FAP alpha (sep-1 < GSM30731 > , sep-2 < GSM30732 > and sep-3 < GSM30740 > ). Keywords: other
