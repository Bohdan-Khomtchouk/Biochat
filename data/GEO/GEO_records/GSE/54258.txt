TITLE
Over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 in neuronally differentiated cells (SK-N-SH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: to detect genes that are differentially transcribed in neuronal cells(SK-N-SH) over-expressing either of the two MECP2 isoforms, MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2. Methods: the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH was stably infected by lentiviral vectors over-expressing MECP2_e1, MECP2_e2, or eGFP, and were then differentiated into neurons. RNA extracted, and used for gene expression microarray analysis

DESIGN
3 replicates for MECP2_e1; 3 replicates for MECP2_e2; 3 replicates for eGFP as control; 3 replicates for MECP2_e1 with 9bp insertion mutation in N-terminal

PLATFORM
