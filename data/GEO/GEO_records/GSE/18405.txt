TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in Vitis vinifera

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Vitis vinifera endogenous small RNAs

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts of Vitis vinifera leaves, inflorescences, tendrils and small berries were ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa/Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.
