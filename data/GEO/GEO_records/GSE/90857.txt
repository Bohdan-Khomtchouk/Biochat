TITLE
Expression data from Staphylococcus aureus MR23 treated with norgestimate

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We found that norgestimate effectively inhibits staphylococcal biofilm formation. We used microarrays to clarify gene expressions of S. aureus MR23 culture treated with norgestimate.

DESIGN
S. aureus MR23 was grown at 37C for 12 h in the presence or absence of norgestimate for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
