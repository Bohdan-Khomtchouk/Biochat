TITLE
CD133+ and CD133- expression profiles of benign and HRPC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial cell cultures derived from benign and HRPC tissue biopsies were expanded in culture for 2-3 weeks. CD133+ and CD133- cells were isolated using the miltenyi magnetic bead system after adherence to collagen. CD133+ and CD133- RNA was isolated and amplified using the RiboAmp HS kit and expression profiling performed using the CRUK WGA gene set. Keywords: Tumour vs normal comparison

DESIGN
28 samples  - All samples compared to universal reference RNA

PLATFORM
