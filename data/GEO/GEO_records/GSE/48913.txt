TITLE
Characterization of the Quality of Imbibed Soybean at an Early Stage of Pre-Germination for the Development of a New Protein Food Item

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Global analyses on gene expression profiles in short-term imbibition (0, 8, and 16 h) was performed using DNA microarray technique to look at changes of expression of genes coding for components that may determine food protein quality. DNA microarray analysis followed by gene ontology statistics revealed that, prior to 16 h, (i) genes for carbohydrate metabolism giving rise to nutrients as the primary metabolism were up-regulated; (ii) genes response to water-, temperature-, and light-stimulation which may not be related to soybean protein properties were down-regulated; and (iii) gene associated with lipid metabolism and secondary metabolite production which can be activated during germination showed indistinct up- and down-regulations.

DESIGN
Soybean seeds were selected at 0, 8, and 16 h imbibition for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL15901 Agilent-016772 G. max (Soybean) Oligo Microarray 4x44K (Probe Name version)
