TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation aberrations in human atherosclerosis (sequencing)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetics may help understanding the molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis as genetic predisposition explains only part of cardiovascular disease risk. In particular, DNA methylation, a reversible and highly regulative DNA modification could contribute to disease onset and progression as it functions as effector for environmental impacts, including dietary and life-style, similarly to risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. We addressed this issue by performing whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing and high-resolution DNAmethylation array analysis of healthy and diseased donor-matched atherosclerotic DNA methylomes.

DESIGN
Sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA and array based analysis of atherosclerotic lesions and normal carotid tissue.
