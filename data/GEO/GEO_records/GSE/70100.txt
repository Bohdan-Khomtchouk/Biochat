TITLE
Identification of mRNAs Regulated in Response to Transcriptional Activation of the Arabidopsis ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) Transcription Factor cDNA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Liquid grown, seven day old wild type Arabidopsis seedlings and seedlings carrying a cDNA encoding the ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) gene under the control of an estrogen inducible promoter were treated with estrogen for 0, 60 and 120 minutes at which point seedlings were flash frozen and mRNA was extracted.

DESIGN
Wild-type and ESTAIG1 Col samples were treated with estrogen and flash frozen 0, 60 and 120 minutes later. Each sample type has three biological reps, except ESTAIG1.120, which has two. There are therefore 17 total samples. mRNA samples were sequenced by Otogenetics and then analyzed using the Tuxedo suite of applications. (Note: " AIG1 " has since been renamed " ABIG1 " in publication.)
