TITLE
Effect of temperature and irradiation intensity on grapevine berry ripening in Muscat Hamburg fruiting cuttings

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
At the onset of ripening (veraison), Vitis vinifera L. cv Muscat Hamburg fruiting cuttings were exposed to four different environmental regimes in two growth chambers set up: 20/15ºC (day/night) and 30/25ºC (day/night) and with two different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) conditions (200 and 400 μmol•m−2•s−1 PPFD) at grape bunch level during a 14 h photoperiod. Fruiting cuttings were selected to have similar grape bunch size avoiding changes in berry quality. At least 9 plants were transferred to each treatment. Global pericarp gene expression was compared among the four growth conditions using the GrapeGen GeneChip®. The transcriptomic analysis was carried out in 14 DAT berries in order to identify stable responses to differential temperature and PPFD conditions not masked by quick transient responses to the environmental change. Moreover, grapes of the same density range (100-110 g NaCl·L-1)) from all four treatments were compared to ensure that treatment effects other than ripening rate shifts  originated by the treatments, at least in terms of saccharimetric ripening, were being studied.   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.
