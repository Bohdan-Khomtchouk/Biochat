TITLE
Tethered Oligonucleotide-Primed sequencing (TOP-seq): a high resolution economical approach for DNA epigenome profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe the development and thorough validation of a new approach for epigenome analysis (named TOP-seq) that is based on a novel concept â€“ combination of selective covalent tagging and targeted genomic sequencing of the genome. The technique reports the modification status of each genomic CpG site by priming the DNA polymerase action from a tethered oligonucleotide probe that is selectively attached to the unmodified CpG sites.

DESIGN
DNA methylation analysis of 4 human tissues/cell lines (Prefrontal brain cortex - 4 replicates; IMR90 - 9 replicates; Neuroblastoma specific LA1-55n - 3 replicates; Non-neuronal progenitor LA1-5s - 3 replicates) Please note that processed files created by merging data from multiple samples are linked as Series supplementary file and are indicated in the corresponding Sample description field.
