TITLE
Gene expression analysis of primary human trabecular meshwork cells cultured in fibroblast medium following selective laser trabeculoplasty treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human trabecular meshwork cells cultured in fibroblast medium underwent selective laser trabeculoplasty treatment. RNA was extracted from a pool of cells 30 min after treatment while the remaining cells were further cultured and RNA was extracted respectively 2 and 6 hour after treatment. Control cells stored in incubator in absence of SLT treatment were used as reference samples. Gene expression was evaluated by hybridization on miRNA-microarray and laser scanner analysis.

DESIGN
Time course experiment; HTM cells, ScienCell, San Diego, California:  cat. n. 6590: isolated from juxtacanalicular and corneoscleral region of the human eye. TMC are cryopreserved on primary culture and delivered frozen.
