TITLE
Comparison of Osx+ cells and Ocn+ cells in the bone marrow.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression microarray comparing Osx-mCherry cells and Ocn-Topaz cells isolated from the OsxCre-mCherry;OcnCre-Topaz double transgenic mice by flow cytometry.

DESIGN
In the OsxCre-mCherry;OcnCre-Topaz mouse model, Osx+ cells were labeled red, Ocn+ cells were green, and Osx+Ocn+ cells were yellow within the same animal. This system allows isolation of osteolineage subsets within the same animal by flow cytometry.
