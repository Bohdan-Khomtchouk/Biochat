TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse macrophages following long noncoding RNA Malat1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied next-generation sequencing to investigate the gene expression profiles in mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages with or without long noncoding RNA-Malat1 knockdown. We identified a number of differentially regulated genes in cells with Malat1 knockdown.

DESIGN
Mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages were transfected with Antisense LNAâ„¢ GapmeRs against Malat1 or Negative Control oligos (Exiqon). 48h after transfection, total RNA was isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencin (RNA-seq), using Illumina GAIIx. Gene expression profiles were compared between two groups.

PLATFORM
