TITLE
ALDH-positive MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an Aldefluor assay system to study the signaling pathways that regulate the frequency and maintenance of ALDH-positive cell population in MCF-7 cells as a CSC model. Through microarray analysis, we investigated a possible receptor that increases the proportion of the ALDH-positive cell population in MCF-7 cells.

DESIGN
MCF-7 were stained with Aldefluor and ALDH-positive cells were sorted using flow cytometry. Gene expression profiles of ALDH+ cells were compared with ALDH- cells.
