TITLE
Regulatory consequences of TARBP2 knock-down in MDA-LM2 cell-line [stability experiment]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
siRNA-mediated knock-down followed by transcriptomic profiling revealed that silencing of TARBP2 resulted in a significant increase in the stability of sRSE-carrying transcripts.

DESIGN
Two independent siRNAs were used to knock down TARBP2 in metastatic MDA-LM2 cells. The cells were then subjected to whole-genome transcript stabiliy measurements in comparison to mock-transfected cells.
