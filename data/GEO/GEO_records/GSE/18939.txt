TITLE
Comparison of nucleosome positioning among two yeast species and their hybrid for wild-type and deletion mutant strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces paradoxus ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces paradoxus

SUMMARY
To study the evolution of nucleosome positioning we mapped nucleosome positioning in two species of yeasts. Identified differences in nucleosome positioning were classified into cis-based changes or trans-bseed changes based on the pattern of nucleosomes in the hybrid. This analysis was performed for wild-type strains as well as for strains deleted of 5 chromatin regulatoirs allolwing us to examine their roles in determining nucleosome positioning.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of mono-nucleosome fragments isolated by MNase digestion. Samples include pooled DNA fragments of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus or DNA fragments of the interspecific hybrid. Experiments were performed for WT strains as well as strains deleted of 5 chromatin regulators.
