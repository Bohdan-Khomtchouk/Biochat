TITLE
TIPE1 suppresses invasion and migration through down-regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish between the gastric cancer and adjacent nontumor tissue. The human gastric cancer tissue belonging to low-differentiated adenocarcinoma and adjacent nontumor tissue were analysed. Expression of TIPE1 and Wnt family from this signature was quantified in the same kind of samples by real-time PCR, confirming the change pattern.

DESIGN
The human gastric cancer tissue belonging to low-differentiated adenocarcinoma and adjacent nontumor tissue were analysed.
