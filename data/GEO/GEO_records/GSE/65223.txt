TITLE
Small RNA loading licenses Argonaute for assembly into a transcriptional silencing complex

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We analyzed the small RNAs bound to the fission yeast RITS and ARC complexes, and to Ago1 in wild-type and ARC mutant cells, to gain insight into the molecular role of ARC. We found that ARC contains longer heterochromatic siRNAs than RITS, and that ARC subunit Arb1 is required for loading small RNAs onto Ago1.

DESIGN
Sequencing of 18-28 nt small RNAs from Tas3, Arb1 and Ago1 purifications.
