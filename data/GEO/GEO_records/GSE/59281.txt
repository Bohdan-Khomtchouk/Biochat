TITLE
Cancer stem cells subpopulations within the CD44high human breast cancer stem cell compartment [HMT clones]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The CD44hi compartment in human breast cancer is enriched in tumor-initiating cells, however the functional heterogeneity within this subpopulation remains poorly defined. From a human breast cancer cell line with a known bi-lineage phenotype we have isolated and cloned CD44hi populations that exhibited mesenchymal/Basal B and luminal/Basal A features, respectively:CD44+/CD24-,Basal B (G4, H6) cells and CD44hi/CD24lo epithelioid Basal A (A4, AB) cells.

DESIGN
Seven replicates of A4, seven replicates of G4, three replicates of AB, three replicates of H6

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
