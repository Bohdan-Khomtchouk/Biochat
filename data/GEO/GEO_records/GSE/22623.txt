TITLE
RNAi-independent role for Argonaute2 in CTCF/CP190 chromatin insulator function

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin insulators and Polycomb group (PcG) complexes control nuclear organization to effect changes in gene expression.  In Drosophila, RNA silencing pathways influence long range interactions mediated by PcG proteins and nuclear localization of the gypsy insulator; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.  Here, we identify a singular requirement for Argonaute2 (AGO2) for the activity of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/Centrosomal protein 190 (CP190) dependent Fab-8 insulator.  AGO2 and CP190 interact physically, and genome wide localization of AGO2 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals extensive colocalization of AGO2 with insulators and Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) but minimal overlap with regions of endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) production.  Finally, depletion of either CTCF or CP190 results in loss of AGO2 association with insulators, PREs, and other cis-regulatory regions.  Our findings suggest that Dicer-independent recruitment of AGO2 to chromatin by insulator proteins promotes the definition of transcriptional domains throughout the genome.
