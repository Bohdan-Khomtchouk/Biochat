TITLE
Human CD200+CD49+ hair follicle keratinocytes versus CD200-CD49+ keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human hair follicles from normal areas of the scalp were disassociated to single cells, sorted and tested by microarrray To compare the expression of human CD200+ CD49+ hair follicle keratinocytes versus CD200-CD49+ keratinocytes

DESIGN
3 independent biologic replicates  (each from a distinct human subject) were sorted for both CD200+CD49+ and CD200-CD49+ populations

PLATFORM
