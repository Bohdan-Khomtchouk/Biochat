TITLE
Csac growth on monosaccharides found in lignocellulose

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

SUMMARY
The co-utilization of hexoses and pentoses derived from lignocellulose is an attractive trait for in microorganisms considered for consolidated biomass processing to biofuels. This issue was examined for the H2-producing, extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (Csac) growing on individual monosaccharides (arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose and xylose), mixtures of these sugars. Based on the whole-genome transcriptional response analysis and comparative genomics, carbohydrate specificities for transport systems could be proposed for most of the 24 putative carbohydrate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the C. saccharolyticus genome.  Transcriptome contrasts for monosacchride growth showed that minimal changes were observed in some cases (e.g., 31 ORFs changed > /=2-fold for glucose/galactose) while substantial changes occurred for cases involving mannose (e.g., 363 ORFs > /=2-fold for glucose/mannose). No evidence for catabolite repression was noted for either growth on multi-sugar mixtures or in the corresponding transcriptomes.

DESIGN
C. saccharolyticus was subcultured (overnight) seven times on the substrate of interest in modified DSMZ 640 medium before inoculating a 1-liter batch containing 0.5 gram substrate per liter. Cells were grown at 70 °C until mid-logarithmic phase (3-5*107) and harvested by rapid cooling to 4 °C and centrifugation and then stored at -80 °C. To elucidate the transporters plus the central carbon metabolic pathways and their regulation utilized on the different sugars, transcriptome analysis was performed after growth on arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, xylose and a mixture of all six substrates.
