TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of siliques at 4 developmental stages in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To search for the differential expressed genes during postferlization and embryonic development in Arabidopsis, We profiled transcriptome of siliques at 4 developmental stages using RNA-seq based on poly(A) selection. Each RNA library yielded 100 million 101-bp paired-end reads.Using Tophat and Cufflinks with the Arabidopsis TAIR10 annotation as reference, we identifed 33,451 assembled transcripts in 4 samples. Of them, 5,608 were up-regulated genes in at least one sample. A group of them are preferentially expressed at mature green-stage of seeds.
