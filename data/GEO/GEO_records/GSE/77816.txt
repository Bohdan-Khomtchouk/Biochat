TITLE
Expression analysis of WT and Zbtb4 -/- mouse primary fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZBTB4 is a mammalian transcription factor with Zinc fingers and a BTB/POZ domain, which can bind methylated CpGs, as well as certain unmethylated consensus sequences. ZBTB4 is frequently downregulated in human cancers, but it is unclear whether this is a cause or consequence of transformation. To investigate the role of ZBTB4 in normal and pathological conditions, we generated Zbtb4-/- mice

DESIGN
To address the Zbtb4 dependant transcriptome, a 10 chip study has been realized using total RNA recovered from wild type and Zbtb4 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
