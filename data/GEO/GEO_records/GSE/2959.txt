TITLE
Genome-wide SNP Microarray Mapping in Basal Cell Carcinomas Unveils Uniparental Disomy as a Key Somatic Event.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 10K SNP mapping arrays were used to profile 14 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) with matched blood DNA samples. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number abnormality (CNA) profiles were derived from each tumour-blood pair. Keywords: Genomic DNA on Affymetrix 10K SNP array

DESIGN
14 BCC/Blood pairs were used in this study to obtain genome-wide SNP profiles. By comparing tumour and blood DNA, LOH for each SNP could be obtained. Signal intensity for each SNP were used to deternime CNA.
