TITLE
Expression data of  hiPSC-derived anterior foregut endoderm cells (AFECs), ventral anterior foregut cells (VAFECs), EpCAM+CPM+ and EpCAM+CPM- cells and CPM+ cells sorted from VAFECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Specific surface marker for NKX2-1+ VAFECs may be helpful for isolating a homogeneous population of alveolar epithelial progenitor cells and distinguishing the differentiation from a thyroid lineage to a lung lineage. In order to identify specific markers of VAFECs, a microarray analysis was performed to compare the global gene expression patterns between AFECs and VAFECs in 201B7 hiPSCs. We hypothesized that NKX2-1+ cells could be purified by sorting CPM+ VAFECs. After dissociating VAFECs cells on day 14 with Accutase, FACS was performed using anti-EPCAM and anti-CPM antibodies. EPCAM+CPM+ and EPCAM+CPM- cells were then sorted, and the global gene expression patterns of these two populations were examined using a microarray analysis. In addition, MACS was performed to obtain CPM+ cells for comparison.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNA from hiPSCs-derived AFECs, VAFECs, EPCAM+CPM+ and EPCAM+CPM- VAFECs and CPM+ VAFECs and hybridized them to Affymetrix microarrays.
