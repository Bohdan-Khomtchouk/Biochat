TITLE
Host Responses to Sepsis Vary in Different Low-Lethality Murine Models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CS and CLP murine models of intra-abdominal sepsis have unique transcriptomic respones 2 hrs, 1 and 3 days after sepsis

DESIGN
We used mouse microarrays to detail the molecular profile of the events that occur following infection in two different sepsis models Infection protocol: Used the Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) model and Cecal Slurry (CS) method in young mice.
