TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with cisplatin's anti-tumor effect in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of cisplatin in vitro and various miRNAs induced by cisplatin also may contribute to tumor growth in vitro.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 1719 human miRNA probes in the cell lines in vitro that were treated with and without cisplatin.

PLATFORM
GPL17061 3D-Gene Human miRNA V19_1.0.0
