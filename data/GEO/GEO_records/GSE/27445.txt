TITLE
Scl Represses Cardiomyogenesis in Prospective Hemogenic Endothelium and Endocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelium in embryonic hematopoietic tissues generates hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; however, it is unknown how its unique potential is specified.  We show that transcription factor Scl/Tal1 is essential for both establishing the hematopoietic transcriptional program in hemogenic endothelium and preventing its misspecification to a cardiomyogenic fate. Scl-/- embryos activated a cardiac transcriptional program in yolk sac endothelium, leading to the emergence of CD31+PdgfrÎ±+ cardiogenic precursors that generated spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. Ectopic cardiogenesis was also observed in Scl-/- hearts, where the disorganized endocardium precociously differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Induction of mosaic deletion of Scl in Sclfl/flRosa26Cre-ERT2 embryos revealed a cell-intrinsic, temporal requirement for Scl to prevent cardiomyogenesis from endothelium. Scl-/- endothelium also upregulated the expression of Wnt antagonists, which promoted rapid cardiomyocyte differentiation of ectopic cardiogenic cells. These results reveal unexpected plasticity in embryonic endothelium such that loss of a single master regulator can induce ectopic cardiomyogenesis from endothelial cells.

DESIGN
There are 24 samples analyzed, divided into 3 separate experiments. All the samples were performed in biological duplicates.
