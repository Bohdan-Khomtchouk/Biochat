Diet Synergistically Affects Helicobacter pylori-Induced Gastric Carcinogenesis in Nonhuman Primates

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastric cancer results from a combination of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection, exposure to dietary carcinogens, and predisposing genetic make-up. Because the role of these factors in gastric carcinogenesis cannot be determined readily in human beings, the present study examined the role of an oral carcinogen and H pylori infection in rhesus monkeys. METHODS: Gastroscopies were performed in 23 monkeys assigned to 4 groups: controls; nitrosating carcinogen ethyl-nitro-nitrosoguanidine administration alone; and inoculation of a virulent H pylori strain alone (H), or in combination with ethyl-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (EH). Follow-up gastroscopies and biopsies were performed at 3-month intervals for 5 years for pathologic and molecular studies. RESULTS: Postinoculation, H and EH groups showed persistent infection and antral gastritis. Starting at 2 and 5 years, respectively, gastric intestinal metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia developed in 3 EH monkeys but in no other groups. Transcriptional analysis of biopsies at 5 years revealed group-specific expression profiles, with striking changes in EH monkeys, plus a neoplasia-specific expression profile characterized by changes in multiple cancer-associated genes. Importantly, this neoplastic profile was evident in nonneoplastic mucosa, suggesting that the identified genes may represent markers preceding cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric intraglandular neoplasia is induced in primates when H pylori infection is associated with consumption of a carcinogen similar to the nitrosaminesfound in pickled vegetables, suggesting that H pylori and the carcinogen synergistically induce gastric neoplasia in primates. Monkey arrays used for analysis of the affect of Helicobacter pylori and diet on development of gastric cancer.  Each RNA was hybridized against a common reference.

Infection: Rhesus monkeys were infected with H. pylori (+/-) Compound Based Treatment: Rhesus monkeys were treated with ENNG (N-ethyl-N-nitrosoguanidine) (+/-)
