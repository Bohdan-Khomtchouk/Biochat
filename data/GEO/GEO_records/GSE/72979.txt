TITLE
MeDIP-chip from 3 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated modifications of genome are common events in carcinogenesis and is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of various cancers including gastric cancer Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with a human miRNA tiling microarray analysis demonstrated that there are much methylation differention between gastric cancers and adjacent controls

DESIGN
microRNA gene methylation comparison of 3 pairs of gastric cancer and controls
