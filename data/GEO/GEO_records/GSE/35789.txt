TITLE
Transcription profiling of mouse liver cells during the circadian cycle at 4 hour time resolution

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclic regulatory systems are ubiquitous in cells and tissues. In the liver rhythms in mRNA expression are determined by the homeostatic regulation that operates on daily circumstances. In particular the specific response to nutrients, as well as systemic and peripheral circadian oscillators, contribute to the set up of the hepatic homeostasis at different phases of the day. In this series we used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in the mouse liver under physiological daily variations, determined by both the feeding and the circadian cycles.

DESIGN
We examined 7 samples, each consisting in a pool of RNAs extracted from the whole liver of 5 mice. Samples were collected at times ZT2, ZT6, ZT10 ,ZT14, ZT18, ZT22, ZT26 (ZT0/24 and ZT12 are the times when the lights are switched on and off, respectively)
