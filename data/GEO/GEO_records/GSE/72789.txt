TITLE
Identification of target antigens of CSF OCB-derived monoclonal antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of target antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies that have been derived from oligoclonal band IgG of CSF samples from multiple sclerosis patients.

DESIGN
Protoarrays were hybridized with monoclonal antibodies derived from oligoclonal band IgG of CSF samples from multiple sclerosis patients. Six individual monoclonal antibodies, derived from four different MS patients, were used. The humanized r8-18C5 with known specificity and the secondary antibody alone served as isotype and secondary antibody control, respectively.
