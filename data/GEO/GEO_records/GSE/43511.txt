TITLE
Variability of gene expression profiles in neutrophils from Germ-free mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neutrophils, key cells of the innate immune system, are responsible for preventing bacterial infections. It was already demonstrated that albeit neutrophils synthesize lower levels of protein and RNA they are able to marked change its gene expression after bacteria exposure. The absence of microbial stimulation has consequences on development of the mucosal immune system as demonstrated using germ-free mice as a model. We are interested in understanding if commensal flora induces changes in the gene expression profile of neutrophils in its site of production, the bone marrow.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated neutrophils from Bone Marrow from Germ-free mice and control
