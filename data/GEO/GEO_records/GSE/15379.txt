TITLE
Expression data from lung of septic PPTA knockout mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we have explored microarray-based differential gene expression profile in mouse lung tissue 8 h after inducing polymicrobial sepsis and the effect of preprotachykinin-A (PPTA) gene deletion. A range of genes differentially expressed ( > 2-fold) in microarray analysis was assessed, PPTA-knockout septic mice with their respective sham controls.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying sepsis in mice lacking the gene for substance P and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Lung samples from wild-type or PPTA-knockout mice were selected at 8 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham surgery for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. Triplicates were performed for each condition.
