TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of BMI1-silenced human prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BMI1-silenced Prostate cancer cells exhibited a significant change in the expression of several proliferation-associated genes. These included Cyclin-D1, BCL2, IL and NF-kappaB. An increased expression of p16, p15 and TIMP3 in BMI1-silenced tumor cells was observed List of Selected Genes Modulated by BMI1-supression in Prostate cancer Cells

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  LNCaP and BMI1-silenced LNCaP cells were used as indicated in the summary. Equal amount of total RNA from each group was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
