TITLE
Differential gene expression in the adipose tissue of crossbred beef cows with divergent gain after feed restriction and ad libitum feeding studies.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Beef cow adipose tissue transcriptome Evaluation of the naturally occurring transcriptome variation among beef cows with divergent gain.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of adipose tissue obtained after feed restriction and ad libitun feed were examined for expression differences that contribute to body weight gain.
