TITLE
Array-based comparative genomics of Campylobacter jejuni sheep abortion isolates (Part 2)

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Campylobacter jejuni has become the predominant cause of sheep abortions in the U.S. However, little is know about the genetic diversity among the isolates collected from different time periods. In this study, the genetic diversity of sheep aborion isolates of C. jejuni was investigated by Array-based CGH

DESIGN
Each isolate was compared to IA3902, a dye-swap replicate was applied for each isolate
