TITLE
NRSF/REST ChIP-seq binding profile in the rat paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide changes in NRSF binding following early life events that may be associated with resilience

DESIGN
Examination of NRSF binding in vehicle incubated and ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist exposed PVN explants

PLATFORM
GPL18694 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Rattus norvegicus)
