TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of HeyA8 human ovarian cancer cells co-incubated with platelets under low attachment conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in cancer cells upon interaction with platelets. The hypothesis tested in the present study was to test whether platelets can influence anoikis resistance and metastasis in ovarian cancer by influencing genes which are important for apoptosis, metastasis and proliferation. Results provide important informations of the response of HeyA8 human ovarian cancer cells upon platelet interaction and provide insights on platelet-regulated gene expression changes related to increased cancer cell survival under low attachment/anoikis conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeyA8 human ovarian cancer cells co-incubated with or without mouse platelets for 24 hours under low attachment conditions
