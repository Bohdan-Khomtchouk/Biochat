TITLE
Genome wide study of adult microglia in Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice treated or not during one week with antibiotics (ABX) in males and females.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq was performed on microglia from male and female, controls and ABX to elucidate the genetic differences implicates by microbiota and gender.

DESIGN
Microglia from SPF and GF mice from embryonic and adult stages of both gender were sorted for sequencing. DEGs were obtained to observe if any significant genes were affected. Pathway analysis was performed with the set of DEGs. SPF mice were given ampicillin (1mg/ml), streptomycin (5mg/ml), colistin (1mg/ml) and amphotericin (0.1mg/ml) in sterile drinking water ad libitum for one week, between 7 and 8 weeks of age. Sterile drinking water devoid of antibiotics was provided to control mice ad libitum.
