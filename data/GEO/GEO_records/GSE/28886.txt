TITLE
Modulation of gene expression by complement protein C1q in amyloid-beta injured neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Complement protein C1q is induced after injury in the brain and during Alzheimer's disease and has been shown to protect against amyloid-beta induced neuronal death. In this study, we used microarray approach to identify the pathways modulated by C1q that are associated with neuroprotection.

DESIGN
Immature rat cortical primary neurons are treated with fibrillar amyloid-beta peptides and/or C1q for 3h before RNA extraction and hybridization on rat Affymetrix microarrays. Supplementary file: Processed/normalized, probe-level signal intensities from neurons treated with amyloid-beta or C1q. Median signal intensity used as global normalization method, done with JMP genomics (v5.0) software.
