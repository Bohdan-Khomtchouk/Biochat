TITLE
Musashi proteins are post-transcriptional regulators of the epithelial-luminal cell state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling of neural stem cells overexpressing or knocked out for Musashi RNA-binding proteins

DESIGN
Study of the global effects of Musashi (Msi) proteins on the transcriptome of embryonic neural stem cells. Neural stem cells were derived from brains of E12.5 or E13.5 embryos engineered to have inducible Msi1 or Msi2 genes, or from embryos with double floxed alleles of Msi1 and Msi2 carrying a Tamoxifen-induclble Cre (CreER). The overexpression mice were made using the Flp-in system (OpenBioSystems), where a cDNA of interest (in this case Msi1 or Msi2) is knocked into the Collagen (Col1A1) locus. The expression of the cDNA of interest is driven by m2rTTA that is knocked into the Rosa26 locus (R26). KH2 describes a strain containing the R26-m2rTTA but lacking Msi1 or Msi2 cDNA. MSI1 describes a strain containing R26-m2rTTA and Msi1 cDNA in Col1A1. MSI2 describes a strain containing R26-m2rTTA and Msi2 cDNA in Col1A1. C1 describes a strain lacking the CreER allele but containing double floxed alleles of Msi1/Msi2 (used as Tamoxifen control). C4 describes a strain carrying the CreER allele and double floxed alleles of Msi1/Msi2.
