TITLE
Gene expression profile of E18.5 mouse lungs lacking epithelial Hdac3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanism of how lung sacculation occurs is poorly understood. Loss of epithelial Hdac3 results in defects in the proper expansion of distal lung saccules into primitive alveoli. In this microarray, we seek to investigate the gene profile changes caused by loss of Hdac3 to better understand the molecular pathways that are regulated by Hdac3 during lung sacculation.

DESIGN
We collected a total of ten E18.5 mouse lung samples in RNA later,  five for the control group or and five for the Hdac3 KO group.
