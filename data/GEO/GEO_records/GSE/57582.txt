TITLE
hMeDIP-seq profiling of DNA hydroxymethylation in primary adipocytes from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of adult C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA hydroxymethylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, using hMeDIP-seq experiment, we report the mapping of DNA hydroxymethylation in adipocytes from mouse eWAT

DESIGN
Examination of DNA hydroxymethylation pattern in adipocytes from mouse eWAT
