TITLE
Differential response of normal and tumor cells to nucleosome depletion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene-expression in siRNA treated U2OS and hTERT-RPE1 cells showed that CASP8AP2, NPAT and HINFP do not regulate expression of each other, and do not have any common target genes, except histones. Most histone genes are downregulated in U2OS cells following loss of CASP8AP2, NPAT or HINFP. In normal cells, highly-expressed histone genes were downregulated, albeit less than in tumor cells following loss of CASP8AP2. The p53 target genes were upregulated relatively late, clearly after the changes in expression of histone genes were observed.

DESIGN
U2OS and hTERT-RPE1 cells were treated with CASP8AP2, NPAT,  HINFP or control siRNA in duplicates or triplicates and collected for RNA purification on 1st, 2nd and 3d days.
