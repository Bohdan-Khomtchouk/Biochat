TITLE
Tissue microRNA signatures to predict breast cancer recurrence in young women aged under 35 years old

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification for microRNA signatures to predict breast cancer recurrence in young women were performed through expression profiling of a total 2565 miRNAs in 45 samples diagnosed as invasive ducatal carcinoma of no special type (NST) cases which had been consecutively operated on within a defined short period of time.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohorts of 45 primary breast cancer cases were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 2,565 microRNAs. Cases were analyzed according to the recurrence status in first 5 years after curative surgery.
