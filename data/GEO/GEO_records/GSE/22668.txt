TITLE
Expression data from human PBMC induced by mixed Congeners of PCBs at Human equivalence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exposure to Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) is known to cause serious health effects in human but the gene expression profiles leading to development of differnet diseases and disorders are not fully understood. The knowledge of global gene expression will help us to devlop early disease or disorder biomarkers for PCB induced health effects. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile underlying the effects of mixed PCB exposure at Slovak Human equivalance Level on human PBMC leading to identification of distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes and cellular processes.

DESIGN
PBMC cells are grown for 48 hours in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Pennicilllin-Streptromycin with 1.25 mircogram/ml PHA-M and 0.15% (v/v)pokeweed mitogen and 50 microgram Beta-mercaptoethanol.Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 microgram of total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix). Following fragmentation, 10 microgram of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Human Genome Array (HGU133 plus 2.0). GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000. The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 150.
