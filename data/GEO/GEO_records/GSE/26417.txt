TITLE
Microarray analysis of CaSki cell line grown as spheroids and adherent conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarry based whole genome expression analysis was done for the more tumorigenic CaSki spheroids cultures and the less tumorigenic CaSki adherent cultures to identify signaling mechanisms that vary between the two populations. Subsequent to this, an independent array was done to characterize the differences in gene expression between the cancer stem cell-like Lin-CD66+ and the bulk Lin- CD66- cells isolated from primary human cervical carcinomas. The second array was custom-designed and had genes implicated in stemness, epithelial differentiation, signaling pathways implicated in stemness (Notch and Wnt) and cell cylce-regulation.
