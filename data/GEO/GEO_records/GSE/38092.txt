TITLE
Diet-Induced Obesity Reprograms the Inflammatory Response of the Murine Lung to Inhaled Endotoxin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify key biological pathways that define susceptibility factors for pulmonary infection during obesity, diet-induced obese (DIO) and regular weight (RW) C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.5 µg/L inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1 hr/d for 4 days over a period of 2 weeks. Transcriptional responses were measured by global microarray analysis of lung tissue.

DESIGN
Groups (N=8 biological replicates) of regular weight (RW) and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice (15-weeks old at start of exposures) were exposed to either filtered air (sham controls, SC) or 0.5 µg/L LPS by nose-only inhalation exposure for 1 hr/day for 4 days over a 10-day period with necropsies occurring on the day following the last exposure (Day 11).
