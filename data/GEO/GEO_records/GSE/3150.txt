TITLE
Aging Liver Profiles of the Long Lived Prop-1 Mutant Mouse (Ames) and Wild Type Controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare and contrast genetic signatures from livers of young and aged Ames dwarf mice with their wild type controls. Keywords: Time Course

DESIGN
25 micrograms of liver RNA was isolated from  young (5 dwarfs, 5 wildtype), middle aged (5 dwarfs, 5 wild type) and aged (5 dwarf, 6 wild type) mice for use in hybridization of Affymetrix gene chips according to Affymetrix protocols.
