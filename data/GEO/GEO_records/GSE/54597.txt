TITLE
Dose-response modeling of early molecular and cellular key events in CAR-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male and female CD-1 mice were administered dietary Phenobarbital for 2 or 7 days. In-life, enzyme activity, cell proliferation, genomic analysis, and Bench-mark dose modeling was carried out. The goal was to exmaine low-dose PB effects on early key events in CAR-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.

DESIGN
PB at 0, 0.15, 1.5, 15, 75, or 150 mg/kg-day for 2 or 7 days to characterize multiple apical and molecular endpoints.
