TITLE
Expression data from experimental murine asthma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Experimental asthma was induced in BALB/c mice by sensitization and challenge with the allergen ovalbumin. Control groups received PBS. To investigate the innate immune component of experimental asthma, we also analyzed recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficient mice following exposure to ovalbumin and control PBS Keywords: case control

DESIGN
Each experimental group was exposed to ovalbumin or control PBS. At day 22, 1 day after completion of the allergen exposure, whole lungs were harvested, total mRNA prepared, and gene expression determined by hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
