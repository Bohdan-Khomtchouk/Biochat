TITLE
De novo assembly of siRNA immunity in wild plants

ORGANISM
Betula pendula

SUMMARY
We describe an application of deep sequencing and de novo assembly of short RNA reads to investigate small interfering (si)RNAs mediated immunity in leaf samples from eight tree taxa naturally occurring in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK.  BLAST search for homologues of contigs in the GenBank identified siRNA populations against a number of RNA viruses and a Ty1-copia retrotransposons in these tree species.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing and de novo assembly
