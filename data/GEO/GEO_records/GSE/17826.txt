TITLE
Mouse cardiac tissue: Vehicle treated control vs. 15mg/kg doxorubicin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse cardiac tissue treated with 15mg/kg doxorubicin in 10 ml/kg saline over an acute time course (0.5-120 hours) compared to time matched control animals treated with 10ml/kg saline.

DESIGN
Two colour microarrays with time matched controls against 15mg/kg doxorubicin cardiac tissue.  Time points studied were 0.5, 1, 2, 12, 24 and 120 hours following dosing, biological replicates n= > 3 independent animals at each time point, technical replicate n > 1 with reverse labelling at each time point.  One array printed onto two slides (A and B), one replicate per array.
