TITLE
Expression data from hepatocellular carcinoma PDX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma samples were obtained after patients provided written informed consent and with the approval of the institutional research ethics board at the Liver Cancer Institute of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). Fresh tumor tissues were implanted in NOD/SCID mice. Tumor lines were successfully maintained through multiple rounds of serial transplantation. We used microarrays to evaluate the expression similarity between patient tumor and patient-derived xenograft (PDX).

DESIGN
PDX (F0, F2, F4) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
