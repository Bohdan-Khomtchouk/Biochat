TITLE
MiroRNA expression from pig endometrium exposed to developing pre-implantation embryo versus unfertilized oocytes in vivo

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In vivo evidence suggests a dynamic change of microRNA expression with the phase of the endometrial cycle to achieve endometrial receptivity. In vivo animal studies outlined post – implantation changes in microRNA profiles. Little information is available on the role of microRNAs in the early stages of the embryonic – endometrial dialogue prior to established implantation .Our aim is to investigate the possible role of microRNAs the early endometrial response to the developing pre- attachment blastocyst prior to established implantation
