TITLE
MiroRNA expression from pig endometrium exposed to developing pre-implantation embryo versus unfertilized oocytes in vivo

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In vivo evidence suggests a dynamic change of microRNA expression with the phase of the endometrial cycle to achieve endometrial receptivity. In vivo animal studies outlined post – implantation changes in microRNA profiles. Little information is available on the role of microRNAs in the early stages of the embryonic – endometrial dialogue prior to established implantation .Our aim is to investigate the possible role of microRNAs the early endometrial response to the developing pre- attachment blastocyst prior to established implantation

DESIGN
Three sows were laparoscopically inseminated with semen in one oviduct and with diluent in the contra lateral oviduct. Whole endometrial homogenates were surgically collected from the tip of both uterine horns after microscopically confirming the presence of oocytes / blastocysts. An affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 microarray was used to compare the microRNA expression profiles of the endometrium exposed to unfertilised oocytes vs developing embryos
