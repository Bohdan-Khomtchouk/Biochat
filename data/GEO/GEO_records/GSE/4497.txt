TITLE
Breast Cancer experiments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experimental studies confirmed n-6 type polyunsaturated fatty acid as pro-carcinogenic factor and n-3 fatty acid as cancer restraining agent; though their mode of action on tumor cells are still unclear. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
To review the contrasting effect of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids over carcinoma by studying genomic alteration in treated cancer cells, two members from each family of PUFAs, namely EPA and DHA from n-3 PUFA family and, AA and LA from n-6 PUFA family was selected to treat four breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB231, MDA-MB435S, HCC2218 and MCF-7 for two time period- 6hr and 24hr.
