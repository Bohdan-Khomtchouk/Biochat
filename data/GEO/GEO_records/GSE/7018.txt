TITLE
Androgen treatment in female rainbow trout leads to a marked dysregulation of gonadal gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, has a male heterogametic XY genetic system, and this knowledge can be used to produce experimentally all male or all female genetic populations using males with new genotypes (XX and YY males). These monosex populations have been widely used for sex differentiation studies because they give the opportunity to work on undifferentiated gonads for which the natural fate as testis or ovary is known a priori. Using as a resource the availability of a lot of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) sequencing projects in trout, we designed and built a micro-array in order to characterize, at the pangenomic scale, rainbow trout natural gonadal differentiation as well as the mechanisms by which androgen masculinize the embryonic ovary. We choose a Nylon membrane array technique used for large-scale gene expression profiling with low cost, easy customization and high sensitivity, which is important when a limiting amount of RNA is available. Keywords: time course of natural and androgen induced gonadal sex differentiation
