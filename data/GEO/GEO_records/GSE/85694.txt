TITLE
Microarray gene expression analysis after THZ1 treatment in TL-Om1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression profiling was performed in an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell line (TL-Om1) to analyze genes regulated by the THZ1 CDK7 inhibitor.

DESIGN
TL-Om1 cells were treated with control DMSO or THZ1 for 6 hours in biological triplicates. Total RNA was harvested and microarray gene expression analysis was performed.
