TITLE
CD-1mice: db/db vs db/+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse white adipose tissues. The objective of this study is to explore gene expression profiles of obese adipose tissue by DNA microarray data analysis.

DESIGN
Male db/db (BKS.Cg-m+/+ Lepr db/J, 6 weeks old) and db/+ (BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Lepr db/J, 6 weeks old) mice were used in this experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
