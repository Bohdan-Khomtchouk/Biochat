TITLE
Gene expression signatures of transgenic and wild-type tobaccos under normal or salt-stress conditions

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of salt stress on CbFAD3 transgenic and wild-type tobaccos, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling of transgenic and wild-type plants under normal or salt-stress conditons, respectively. We also found the founction of CbFAD3 gene on tobaccos through comparing these data.

DESIGN
Gene expression of tobacco leaves under normal conditions was measured using two-week-old seedlings grown at 25C under 16 h light/8 h dark. Salt stress-induced gene expression in tobacco leaves was measured at 6 hours after treatment with 200 mM NaCl. Leaves from five independent plants of each sample were collected for each hybridization.
