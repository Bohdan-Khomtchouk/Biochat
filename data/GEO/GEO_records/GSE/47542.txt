TITLE
IMR90 lung fibroblasts treated with IL-4 or IL-13

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-4 and IL-13 are cytokines involved in type 2 immune responses involved in atopic asthma and other diseases. They have a partially overlapping set of cognate receptors whose roles are incompletely understood. Here we explore the effects of these cytokines on lung fibroblasts in order to assess the global similarities and contrasts in the genes whose expression their ligation modulates.

DESIGN
IMR-90 lung fibroblast cells were cultured on matrigel or plastic and treated for 24 hours with IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-13 (10ng/ml), or TNFa (10 ng/ml) before harvest.
