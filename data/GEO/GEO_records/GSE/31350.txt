TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the effect of CT16 (PAGE5) expression in WM-266-4 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular gene expression profiles were investigated in CT16 (PAGE5) negative WM-266-4 melanoma cells as well as in the WM-266-4 cells expressing transfected CT16 cDNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three individual cultures of WM-266-4 cells stably transfected with CT16 cDNA- containing plasmid and from three individual cultures of WM-266-4 cells stably transfected with intact vector.
