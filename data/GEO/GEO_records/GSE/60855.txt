TITLE
Expression data from from hTR and hTERT knockdown in human CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found that knockdown of the human telomerase RNA template, hTR, induces Bim-mediated apoptosis independent of telomere length in primary human CD4 T cells, whereas knockdown of the telomerase enzymatic protein, hTERT does not induce apoptosis in the timeframe of our studies. We used microarray analysis to determine any gene changes in human primary CD4 T cells that could provide mechanistic insight into hTR knockdown induced apoptosis. Cells with control shScramble, shTERT, and shTR were used in this experiment

DESIGN
Primary human CD4 T cells were trandsuced in biological triplicates with lentivirus containing shRNAs against a scrambled sequence, hTERT, and hTR 24 hours after CD3 CD28 stimiulation.  Cells were cultured in the presence of puromycin to select for cells with shRNAs. shTERT and shTR were compared to shScramble results.
