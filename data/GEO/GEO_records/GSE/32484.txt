TITLE
DNA methylation of dnmt3a deficient Kras lung tumors and dnmt3a wt Kras lung tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether Dnmt3a deficiency resulted in genomic methylation changes we performed an unbiased methylome analysis. Methylated DNA isolated from three Dnmt3a deficient and two WT tumors was immunoprecipitated and subjected to high throughput sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). We observed that genes that were less expressed in Dnmt3a deficient tumors tended to have lower methylation levels in gene bodies.

DESIGN
Examination of methylcytosine in two tumor types

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
