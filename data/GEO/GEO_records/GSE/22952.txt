TITLE
SF3b155 knock-down by two different siRNA oligos in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the alternative pre-mRNA procesing after SF3b155 siRNA knock-down in HeLa cells employing a custom microarray platform sensitive to splicing.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transfected with either a scrambled RNA or one of the two different SF3b155 siRNA oligonucleotides (oligo 3: 5’-GACAGCAGAUUUGCUGGAUACGUGA-3; oligo 5: 5’-CCCUGUGGCAUUGCUUAAUGAUAU-3’). Total RNA samples from three biological replicates were labeled in direct and dye-swap hybridizations. Labeled samples were hybridized into our custom splicing-sensitive agilent platform which contains 1804 splicing events from 482 genes.
