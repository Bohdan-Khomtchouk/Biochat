TITLE
Gene expression signature of in vitro activated CD8 T cells in response to antigen and B7-1 alone or along with IL-21

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of naive CD8 T cells into cytotoxic effector cells requires three distinct signals- antigen (signal 1), costimulation -B7-1 (signal 2) and cytokine, either interleukin-12, interferon-a/b, or IL-21 (signal 3). Interaction of naive CD8 T cells with antigen and B7-1 programs cell division and proliferation whereas the presence of cytokines- IL-12, IFNa/b or IL-21 promote survival, differentiation and memory establishment. In the absence of signal 3, the cells interacting with antigen/B7-1 undergo tolerance induction. Previous work had analyzed the regulation of mRNA expression changes induced by IL-12 and IFN-a and cells stimulated with antigen, B7-1 and cytokine by comparing mRNA expression levels in na√Øve CD8 T cells, cells stimulated with 2 signals (antigen and B7-1) (Agarwal, P.A., A. Raghavan, S.L. Nandiwada, J.M. Curtsinger, P.R. Bohjanen, D.L. Mueller and M.F. Mescher.  Gene regulation and chromatin remodeling by IL-12 and Type I interferon in programming for CD8 T cell effector function and memory.  J. Immunol. 183:1695-1704 (2009).  PMCID: PMC2893405). That microarray data was deposited in the NCI GEO database and can be found at The objective of the current study was to carry out the same analysis to determine IL-21-dependent changes in mRNA expression in CD8 T cells responding to antigen and B7-1-dependent costimulation in the absence or presence of IL-21.

DESIGN
The programming for development of function and memory in presence of signal 3 occurs over three days of initial stimulation, and antigen, B7-1 and either IL-12, IFNa/b or IL-21 must be present for most of this period to achieve maximal responses. We analyzed gene expression at 48 and 72 hours in cells stimulated in vitro with antigen and B7-1 alone or along with IL-21.
