TITLE
Gene expression profile of KM-H2 cells conditional expressing PU.1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PU.1 is an Ets family transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. PU.1 is down-regulated in classical Hodgkin lymphoma cells via methylation of the PU.1 promoter. To evaluate whether down-regulation of PU.1 is essential for the growth of cHL cells, we generated KM-H2 derived  cell lines conditionally express PU.1 by tet-off system (designated KM-H2tetPU.1). Conditonally expressed PU.1 by tetracycline removal induced complete growth arrest and apoptosis in KM-H2 cells. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by PU.1, we compared gene expression profiles of KM-H2tetPU.1 cells 0, 1 and 3 days after PU.1 induction, by DNA microarray.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNA from KM-H2tetPU.1 cells 0, 1 and 3 days after PU.1 induction by tetracycline removal. We compared gene expression profiles of KM-H2tetPU.1 cells 0, 1 and 3 days after PU.1 induction using DNA microarray analysis. 4 independent experiments were performed with each RNA samples.
