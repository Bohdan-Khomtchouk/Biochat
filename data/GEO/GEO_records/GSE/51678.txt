TITLE
Microarray profiling of STEP knockout mouse striatum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STEP (striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase) is a brain-specific phosphatase named for its robust expression in striatum.   Brains from homozygous and heterozygous STEP knockout mice and wild-type littermates were harvested, and striatum microdissected.  RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix 230_2 microarray chips.

DESIGN
n=4-5 per group.  Wild-type littermates were compared with STEP +/- and -/-
