TITLE
Microarray analysis of male strobili in fertile and sterile male strobili of Cryptomeria japonica

ORGANISM
Cryptomeria japonica

SUMMARY
Investigation of comprehensive gene expression level changes in male strobili of sterile mutant, compared to the fertile plant. We designed a new custum array derived from ESTs of Cryptomeria japonica for this study. Male strobili of C. japonica were collected from Toyama 1 half-sib F2 pedigree. Toyama 1 male-sterile mutant was first reported in Saito, M. , H. Taira, and Y. Furuta (Journal of Forest Research 3(3):167-173).
