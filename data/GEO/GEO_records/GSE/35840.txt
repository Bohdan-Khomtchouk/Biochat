TITLE
Digital gene expression tag profiling of M. grisea G11 and T146

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a major constraint to the world food security. To study the intracellular mechanism involved in its pathogenic morphogenesis, digital gene expression tag profiling was used to compare a previously generated temperature sensitive mutant, T146, which stopped pathogenic morphogenesis at 33Â°C, with its related wide type, Guy11. 416 genes were detected as differential expressed genes, 26 of which were specifically expressed in Guy11 but stopped expression in the mutant. Functional analysis revealed the mutated morphology maybe caused by a defection in translational or mitochondrial related processes. The results and the protocol used will improve our knowledge on the formation of the ts mutant and promote the further study on M. oryzae pathogenesis.

DESIGN
In our experiments, two samples are analyzed. There are no replicates included.
