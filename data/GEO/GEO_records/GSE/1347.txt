TITLE
Pre-analytical changes of mRNA Gene Expression as the result from prolonged storage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Impact of pre-analytical handling on Bone Marrow (BM) mRNA Gene Expression: We have investigated the impact of RNA extraction protocols and time delays (24 and 48h) between sample aspiration and RNA extraction on RNA quality and gene expression profiles. Intact RNA can be extracted from BM samples stored at room temperature for up to 48h after aspiration. However, storage of BM has dramatic effects on mRNA expression of individual transcripts. Keywords: time-course
