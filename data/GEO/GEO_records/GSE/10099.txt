TITLE
Multi-dimensional genomic analysis in breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multi-dimensional genomic analysis identifies a class of breast cancer patients with high metastatic outcome and differential response to chemotherapeutic drugs The application of multi-dimensional genomic analyses might provide a more refined risk assessment of breast tumor aggressiveness and improve the selection of patients for personalized medicine. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using CNAs to predict patient outcome. In combination with gene expression profiles, the clinical implication for such prognostic assays is the identification of breast cancer patients at different risks and sensitivities to chemotherapeutic drugs. Keywords: survival time

DESIGN
try to find the association between genomic DNA copy number changes with breast cancer patients survival time.
