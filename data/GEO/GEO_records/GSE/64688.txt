TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling across the asexual life cycle in PfBDP1 knockdown malaria parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
To study the bromodomain protein PfBDP1 in the malaria parasite P. falciparum, a transgenic parasite line was generated (PfBDP1DD) in which PfBDP1 was tagged with a haemagglutinin tag and a ligand regulatable FKBP destabilization domain that allowed conditional knockdown of PfBDP1 by removal of the stabilizing ligand Shld1 from cultures. Shld1 was removed 30 hours post invasion (hpi) and the cells allowed to reinvade fresh red blood cells. The effects of PfBDP1 knockdown on gene expression were assessed by transcriptional profiling on microarrays over 6 consecutive time points (8 hour intervals) in the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC).
