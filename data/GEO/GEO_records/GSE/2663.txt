TITLE
LIF-dependent gene expression in human neural stem cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cortical neural stem cells, provided by Dr. Clive Svendsen (Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin at Madison), were generated from human fetal cortex (9 weeks post conception) and grown as free-floating neurospheres as previously detailed (Wright, et al 2003. Journal of Neurochemistry 86, 179-195). At 15 weeks of growth, 10 ng/ml LIF was added to the cultures. In cases where LIF was withdrawn, neurospheres were collected, medium removed, and neurospheres washed three times with 1% N2 supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF, and cultured into the same. Total RNA was prepared from a single human neural progenitor cell grown long-term LIF collected at 3 time points: early passage (GSM51360-GSM51362), mid passage (GSM51363-GSM51365), and late passage (GSM51366-GSM51368). Keywords: parallel sample
