TITLE
Expression data from GFP control and GFP-PRDM1 transduced H9 hESCS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of transcriptional regulation underlying human primordial germ cell differentiation are largely unknown. Transcriptional repressor Prdm1/Blimp1 is known to play a critical role in controlling germ cell specification in mice. We show that ectopic expression of PRDM1 in hESCs promotes the generation of cells exhibiting transcriptomic features of early primordial germ cells.

DESIGN
To consolidate if hESCs expressing ectopic GFP-PRDM1 displayed gene expression signature similar to that in germline lineage, we compared the transcription profiles of H9 hESCs transduced with GFP-PRDM1 and GFP control vectors on days 7 and 17.
