TITLE
Noggin vs BMP4 overexpression Epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was performed to determine if there were alterations in the total RNA pool among the epidermal keratinocytes of K14 promotor-driven noggin overexpression compared with K14 promotor-driven BMP4 overexpression transgenic animals, which will directly relate to cellular chemistry and immune and sensory function. The total study is also aimed at determining alterations of transcrption factors and/or regulation of gene function, including methylation states and micro RNA control in keratinocytes following sensory challenge, particularly neuropathic and chronic pain conditions. Keywords: Comparison of RNA expression between BMP4-oex and Nog-oex transgenic epidermal keratinocytes

DESIGN
Eight-ten epidermis strips were laser captured per animal, and six (6) animals were used per transgenic condition. Recovered RNA samples were pooled from 2 groups of 3 noggin transgenics and 2 groups of 3 BMP4 transgnics to create four pools for hybridization.
