TITLE
Transcriptional response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to 5-Fluorouracil (5FU)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We use high-density tiling DNA microarray technology to obtain the specific transcriptome-wide response induced by 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) in the eukaryotic model Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

DESIGN
Schizosaccharomyces pombe cultures with 5FU added to a final concentration of 500 Î¼M. Incubation was allowed to proceed for 0, 15, 60 and 240 minutes.Two biological replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL7715 [Sp20b_M] Affymetrix S. pombe Tiling 1.0FR Array
