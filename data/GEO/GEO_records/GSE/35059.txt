TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis of Phytochrome Interacting Factor 5 DNA binding in low R/FR condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Phytochrome Interacting Factor 5 plays an important role in adaptive responses of plants to shaded environment collectively called shade avoidance syndrome. PIF 5 belongs to the bHLH transcription factor family and regulated gene expression in a low R/FR dependent fashion. In this experiment we investigate PIF5-DNA-binding genome wide to generate a candidate list of genes, which are directly regulated by PIF5.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq sample of whole seedlings treated with low R/FR light
