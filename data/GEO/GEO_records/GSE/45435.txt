TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human hepatocellular carcinoma (validation set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young subjects is rare but more devastating. We hypothesize that genes and etiological pathways are unique to young HCC (yHCC; â‰¤40 years old at diagnosis) patients. We therefore compared the gene expression profiles between yHCCs and HCCs from elderly patients.

DESIGN
In this dataset, a total of 31 gene expression profiles of HCC samples were collected. Four of them are classified as stage T1 (early HCC) and 6 of them were classified as stage T3 (late HCC).
