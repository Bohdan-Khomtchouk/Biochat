TITLE
A molecular roadmap of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region reveals BMPER as a novel regulator of HSC maturation [AGM]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the developing embryo, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region but the molecular regulation of this process is poorly understood. Recently, the progression from E9.5 to E10.5 and polarity along the dorso-ventral axis have been identified as clear demarcations of the supportive HSC niche. To identify novel secreted regulators of HSC maturation, we performed RNA-sequencing over these spatio-temporal transitions in the AGM region, and supportive OP9 cell line.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing profiles of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region from E9.5 embryos and E10.5 embryos sub-dissected into dorsal (AoD), ventral (AoV) and urogenital ridges (UGR) and pooled from between 15 and 34 embryos in three separate experiments.

PLATFORM
