TITLE
RNA-Seq of Kidney Glomeruli from Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and non-diabetic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression profiles of RNA isolated from kidney glomeruli from aged, 25 week old type-2 diabetic (db/db) and non-diabetic mice.

DESIGN
In order to investigate the consequences of hyperglycemia on the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy Kidney glomeruli from 3 diabetic and 3 non-diabetic, control mice were isolated and RNA purified for RNA-Seq analysis on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. The goal of the project was to generate comprehensive list of noncoding RNA genes differentially regulated between the two conditions in order to identify novel targets for further study.
