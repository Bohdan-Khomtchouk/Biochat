TITLE
RNA Deep Sequencing Reveals Expression Patterns of Long Non-coding RNAs during Swine Ovary Development

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, we obtained the expression profiles of lncRNAs during the development of swine ovaries with RNA-seq technology. The results showed 103,233 and 94,251 lncRNAs were identified from the libraries of ovaries from 30-day-old and 90-day-old swine, respectively, and 37,323 were significantly differentially expressed between the two libraries. The target genes of 903 lncRNAs were acquired through prediction, and KEGG pathway analysis showed the differential lncRNAs were involved in 268 pathways, including ovarian follicular development processes and pathways, such as the GnRH signaling pathway and estrogen signaling pathway. As swine is an ideal biological model for human genetics, the work will help further understand human reproduction.

DESIGN
Examination of lncRNA profiles  in  two ovary samples of 30 and 90 days.
