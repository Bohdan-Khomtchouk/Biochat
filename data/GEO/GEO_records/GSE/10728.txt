TITLE
Expression data from epidermis of epithelial activated beta-catenin mutant mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Î²-catenin signaling is required for hair follicle development, but it is unknown whether it is sufficient to activate expression of hair follicle genes in embryonic skin. To address this we profiled gene expression in epidermis from E15.5 KRT14-Cre Ctnnb1(Ex3)fl/+ embryos carrying an activating mutation in epithelial beta-catenin, and control littermate embryos. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Total epidermal RNA from two KRT14-Cre Ctnnb1(Ex3)fl/+ and two control littermate E15.5 embryos was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome MOE430 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays. Appended below is Table S1: Full list of differentially expressed genes in KRT14-Cre Ctnnb1(Ex3)fl/+ mutant compared with control littermate epidermis at E15.5, including normalization and filter parameters. Fold change, listed in the second column, gives the ratio of normalized control : mutant transcript levels.
