TITLE
Genome-wide selection and testing of superior reference genes for quantitative gene expression normalization in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
To diversify the pool of reliable reference genes in tobacco, the expression stability of 44,873 tobacco genes (ESTs) were measured using a custom-designed microarray in a diverse set of 21 samples, representing various tissue types and developmental stages. A total of 14 genes were selected as candidate reference genes because they appeared to be the most stable. These genes were compared with two widely used housekeeping genes (L25 and EF-1a) for further validation by qRT-PCR
