TITLE
Methylation analysis of normal and tumor bile duct samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and tumor bile duct samples. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in 138 tumor bile duct samples and 4 normal bile duct samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 142 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL16304 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip [UBC enhanced annotation v1.0]
