TITLE
Genes Differentially Expressed as a Result of Enforced EDAG Expression In 32D Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Erythroid differentiation-associated gene (EDAG), a hematopoietic tissue-specific transcription regulator, plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of hematopoietic lineage commitment. However, the mechanism and genes regulated by EDAG remain unknown.Here, we performed genome-wide parallel expression analyses of 32D cells stably transfected with EDAG.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the control 32D cells and 32D/EDAG cells were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 36k Mouse Genome Array Genechips, representing about 25000 characterized murine genes.
