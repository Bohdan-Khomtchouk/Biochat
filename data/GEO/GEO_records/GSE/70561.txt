TITLE
TYRP1 knock-down in human melanoma cell line (501Mel)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Efficient TYRP1 knock-down (KD) have been performed in human melanoma cell line expressing a high level of TYRP1 mRNA and protein in order to identify the molecular pathway explaining the decrease of cell proliferation in TYRP1 KD cells.

DESIGN
Two non targeting siRNA (NT1 and NT2) and 3 siRNA targeting the ORF sequence of TYRP1 were used. Experiments have been done 3 or 4 times respectively  (( NT1, NT2, TYRP1 A and TYRP1D) and (TYRP1C )). Technical duplicates have been performed to make the batch effect removal accurate.
