TITLE
Expression data from effects of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides F3 on human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify patterns of gene expression associated with biological effects in THP-1 cells induced by F3, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the THP-1 control and F3-treated THP-1 cells by oligonucleotide microarray

DESIGN
10^7 cells/mL concentrations of THP-1 cells were seeded in 100 mm dish and incubated overnight. After that, cells were treated with F3 at a final concentration of 30 ug/mL. After incubated for 6 and 24 hours, the cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 250g for 5 min, correspondingly. Controlled samples of un-induced cells were treated in the same way with the same amount of medium.
