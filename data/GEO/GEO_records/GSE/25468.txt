TITLE
Expression data from Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with Toxoplasma gondii.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma strains have been shown to modulate host cell transcription.  We have found a type II Toxoplasma gene, GRA15, which activates the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 transcription factor. We used microarrays to determine how GRA15II modulates host cell transcription.

DESIGN
HFFs were infected with type I (RH), type I GRA15II (RH GRA15II), type II (Pru), type II GRA15KO (Pru GRA15KO), type III (cep), or type III GRA15II (cep GRA15II) parasites for 18-24 hours.  Some samples were also stimulated with TNF-alpha.  Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays.
