TITLE
The estrogenic activity of triclosan

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Triclosan is a commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agent. However, safety of TCS has been disputed. We performed gene expression profiling of TCS and estrogen-administrered rat uterus to compare genes and cellular processes to find the effects of TCS and estrogen.

DESIGN
Gene expression in rat Uterus was measured after treating with Triclosan and estradiol. Two replicates were taken for each treatment.
