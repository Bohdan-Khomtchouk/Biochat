TITLE
Rev-erb(alpha) and (beta) Coordinately Protect the Circadian Clock and Normal Metabolic Function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genomic regions enriched for Rev-erb(beta) binding in WT mouse liver, in addition to the false positive regions enriched by ChIP for Rev-erb(alpha) in Rev-erb(alpha) KO liver. In conjunction with previously published data for Rev-erb(alpha) in GSE26345 (GSM647029, GSM647033, and GSM647034), we report the common and subtype specific cistromes for Rev-erb using a quantitative analysis method.

DESIGN
Rev-erb(beta) ChIP-seq in liver from WT mice at 5AM/ZT22 and 5PM/ZT10, and Rev-erb(alpha) ChIP-seq in liver from Rev-erb(alpha) KO mice at 5PM/ZT10.
