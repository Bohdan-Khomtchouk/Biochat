TITLE
Large scale gene expression analysis uncover new molecules related to biology and HPV mediated carcinogenesis in penile tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray was used to evaluate altered genes related and non related to HPV infection status in order to identify potential molecular markers in penile cancer (PC).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from thirty-nine fresh frozen PC samples and submitted to gene expression microarray. The normal penile pool consisted of total RNA from five autopsy glands. Specific gene expression alterations were investigated by RT-qPCR. DNA was also extracted from penile samples and submitted to HPV genotyping.
