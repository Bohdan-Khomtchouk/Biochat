TITLE
Hypoxia induces myocardial regeneration in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Conditional expression of dominant-negative HIF1a in zebrafish cardiomyocytes severely inhibits heart regeneration. To understand more about the mechanism, we performed microarray analysis of wildtype regenerating zebrafish and dnHIF1a regenerating zebrafish to determine which genes are regulated by hypoxia/HIF1a.

DESIGN
We amputated both wildtype and dnHIF1a zebrafish and allowed them to regenerate for 7 days, then compared their transcriptomic profile with unamputated wildtype and dnHIF1a zebrafish, respectively.
