TITLE
Glyco-gene expression in DP thymic T cells from control and mutant mice that carry a mutation in the ligand binding domain of Notch1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Stanley's laboratory is interested in determining how O-fucose glycans function in Notch receptor signaling and in modulating the interactions of Notch receptors with their ligands. We have generated mice carrying a point mutation in the ligand binding domain of Notch1 that reduces Notch ligand binding to mutant T cells. We wish to identify Notch target genes including glycosylation genes with altered expression in DP thymic T cells from mutant and control mice.

DESIGN
DP cells were prepared from the thymus of 3 control and 3 mutant mice at ~8 weeks of age and RNA extracted from each prep will be analysed. RNA preparations from CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) T cells from F+2323, F+2324, F+2329 (control) and FF2330, FF2332, FF2333 (Notch1 with a point mutation to prevent fucosylation in EGF12) mice of ~8 weeks were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
