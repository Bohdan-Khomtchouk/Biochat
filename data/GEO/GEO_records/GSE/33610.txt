TITLE
Gene expression of LNCaP cells grown in 2D cultures and polyethlene glycol-based hydrogels with the presence of synthetic androgen, R1881

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP cell molecular differences and their response to R1881 in 2D and 3D cultures. Androgen regulated genes were differentially expressed between 2D and 3D cultures. These results provide insights into factors that influence the expression of androgen regulated genes

DESIGN
In this study, LNCaP cells cultured in tissue culture plastic (2D) and in the hydrogel (3D) were maintained up to 3 days and 24 days respectively in serum containing media before they were androgen-starved for 48 hours. Cells were either treated with 1nM R1881 or continued to be androgen-deprived (without R1881 with 0.008% ethanol) for another 48 hours prior to cell harvest for gene expression analysis. Biological triplicates were prepared for each condition.
