TITLE
Hypoxia transcriptomic time-series data in three different cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumour hypoxia exhibits a highly dynamic spatial and temporal distribution and is associated with increased malignancy and poor prognosis. Assessment of time-dependent gene-expression changes in response to hypoxia may thus provide additional biological insights and help with patient prognosis.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling was performed for 3 cell lines derived from diverse tumour-types after hypoxic exposure at 8 time-points.
