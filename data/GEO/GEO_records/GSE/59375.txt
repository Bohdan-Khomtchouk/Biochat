TITLE
Gene expression profile of the neonatal female mouse brain after administration of testosterone propionate.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to investigate the gene expression profiles during masculinization of neonatal female mice brain by exogenous androgen treatment. The results of our expression analysis will shed light on the identification of the key molecules of sexual differentiation of mammalian brain.

DESIGN
Expression microarray analysis was performed using the RNAs extracted from the brains of neonatal mice treated with intraperitoneal injection of testosterone propionate during sex determination period of mice brain.
