TITLE
Expression data from cardiac stem cells (CSCs) with or without MSC-exosomes treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiac resident c-kit+ cells aroused much interest among the cardiologists at the beginning of the century. These cells are selfrenewing, clonogenic, and multipotent and possess the potential to differentiate into all cardiovascular lineages. However, one of the critical problems faced by c-kit+ cells is the poor engraftment and survival after transplantation. Therefore, researchers are focusing on developing next generation CSC products that will enhance the engraftment, survival, and regenerative capabilities of these cells. Considering this, we made a proposal that cardiac stem cells preconditioned with exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells could survive and function better in a myocardial infarction model.

DESIGN
We isolated and characterized exosomes from MSCs and evaluated their effects on CSCs in vitro and in vivo. We compared the miRNA expression profiling on CSCs with or without MSC-exosomes treatment.
