TITLE
Expression profiling by array of 44 adrenocortical carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of adrenocortical carcinomas were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array to identify homogeneous molecular subgroups

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 44 adrenocortical carcinomas were hybridized using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array
