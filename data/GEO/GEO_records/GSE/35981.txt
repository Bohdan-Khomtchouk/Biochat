TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (25-70 nt) from Drosophila wild-type and Dnmt2 mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dnmt2 genes are highly conserved tRNA methyltransferases with biological roles in cellular stress responses. The absence of obvious mutant phenotypes under laboratory conditions suggested a function for Dnmt2 under non-physiological conditions. Indeed, Dnmt2 has recently been implicated in various aspects of the cellular stress response  and the tRNA methyltransferase activity of Dnmt2 has been shown to interfere with stress-induced fragmentation of various tRNAs. We used adult animals and small RNA sequencing during a heat stress experiment to determine the tRNA fragment abundance and identities in wild-type and Dnmt2 mutant somatic tissues. Dnmt2 mutants produced tRNA fragments with different identities when compared to wild-type controls, indicating the accumulation of non-physiological tRNA-derived molecules in tissues without Dnmt2.

DESIGN
