TITLE
Expression data from predose and postdose rat blood after acetaminophen treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Predose and postdose gene expression profiles of blood samples of five most susceptible and five most resistant rats to acetaminophen-induced hapatotoxicity were determined by microarray analysis. Four out of ten selected genes were found to be reproducibly in real-time PCR with independent set animals to predict the susceptible individuals to acetaminophen-induced hapatotoxicity.

DESIGN
We combined gene expression profiles of predose and postdose rat blood to predict the susceptible individuals to acetaminophen-induced hapatotoxicity.
