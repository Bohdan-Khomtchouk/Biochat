TITLE
ChIP-seq study of inheritence of Myc in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Myc is an important oncogene. It is considered as a transcription factor, but the function of Myc in normal or cancer cells have not been fully understood. In addition, Myc plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation. It is also important for cell identity and stay on chromatin throughout the cell cycle. However, the inheritance of Myc is still a mystery. Here we study the function and inheritance of Myc in D. melanogaster by mapping the binding sites of Myc during interphase and mitosis using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
DNA sample of ChIP for Myc are collected from Kc cells in interphase or mitosis. Input sequences from previous study in the same cell type (GSM762848, GSM762849) are used as control.
