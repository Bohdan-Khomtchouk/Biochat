TITLE
Gene expression profiling of murine MLL leukemias (whole BM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The genetic programs that promote retention of self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs) at the apex of cellular hierarchies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not known.  In a mouse model of human AML, LSCs exhibit variable frequencies that correlate with the initiating MLL oncogene and are maintained in a self-renewing state by a transcriptional sub-program more akin to that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) than adult stem cells.  The transcription/chromatin regulatory factors Myb, Hmgb3 and Cbx5 are critical components of the program and suffice for Hoxa/Meis-independent immortalization of myeloid progenitors when co-expressed, establishing the cooperative and essential role of an ESC-like LSC maintenance program ancillary to the leukemia initiating MLL/Hox/Meis program.  Enriched expression of LSC maintenance and ESC-like program genes in normal myeloid progenitors and poor prognosis human malignancies links the frequency of aberrantly self-renewing progenitor-like cancer stem cells to prognosis in human cancer.

DESIGN
Samples are from five separate cohorts of mice where leukemia was initiated using distinct MLL fusion oncogenes: MLL-AF1p (n=9), MLL-AF10 (n=8), MLL-GAS7 (n=5), MLL-AF9 (n=5) and MLL-ENL (n=7). Four normal BM samples were also used as controls.
