TITLE
Whole genome DNAse hypersensitivity in human CD4+ T-cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mapping DNaseI hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions.  We employed whole genome tiled array strategies to identify DNaseI HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Keywords: whole genome tiling array
