TITLE
Gene expression profiles in HepG2 cells exposed to atorvastatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the exon array data set, gene level analysis was performed on HepG2 cells exposed to atorvastatin. No genes were found to be statistically significantly differentially expressed upon atorvastatin treatment.

DESIGN
3 control and 3 atorvastatin treated HepG2 samples were analysed. Genes with an FDRâ‰¤5% after Benjamini-Hochberg correction was considered as differentially expressed.
