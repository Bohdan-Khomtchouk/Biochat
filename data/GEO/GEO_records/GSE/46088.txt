TITLE
Ikaros responsive genes in the T29 cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse Ikaros-deficient thymic lymphoma cell line T29 was transduced with an empty retrovirus (MigR1) or a retrovirus expressing an fusion proein between Ikaros1 and the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Cells trreated with ethanol or 4-hydroxy-tamoxyfen (4OHT) for 24h were profiled.

DESIGN
We used expression of an inducible ersion of the Ikaros protein in an Ikaros-deficient cell line to identify Ikaros-regulated genes
