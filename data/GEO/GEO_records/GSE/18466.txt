TITLE
Small RNAs in the Physcomitrella dcl4 mutant

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
To study the function of Physcomitrella DCL4, a knockout plant line was created.  Small RNAs from ~10-day old protonemata were obtained and sequenced using a SOLiD 2 instrument.

DESIGN
A single library each was made from dcl4 mutant protonemata and wild-type protonemata.  The dcl4 library was sequenced in four separate technical replicates.  The wild-type sample was subject to a single sequencing run.
