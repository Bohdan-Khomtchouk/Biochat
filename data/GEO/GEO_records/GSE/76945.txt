TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of FSH and LH dependent gene expression and the crosstalk between these two pathways in mice testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effects of the absence of a functional LH receptor and/or expression of a constitutively active FSH receptor on gene expression in the gonads of male mice were studied. The results provide insights into the roles of the hormones LH and FSH in male reproduction. The main conclusion is that constant strong FSH stimulation is able to rescue the impaired spermatogenesis and fertility of male mice in the absence of LH signalling.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from testis of 12 weeks old mice of different genotypes and extracted using Trizol followed by clean up with Qiage RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit
