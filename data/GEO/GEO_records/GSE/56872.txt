TITLE
Transcription factor cooperativity in early adipogenic hotspots and super-enhancers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we have used a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches to investigate the extent and mechanisms of transcription factor cross-talk at genomic hotspots. We identify ~12,000 transcription factor hotspots in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate for the first time that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions and that these drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers constitute important regulatory hubs integrating external stimuli on chromatin.
