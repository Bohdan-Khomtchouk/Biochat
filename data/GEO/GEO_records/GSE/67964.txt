TITLE
Discrete Functions of Rev-erba Couple Metabolism to the Clock [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian and metabolic physiology are intricately intertwined, as illustrated by Rev-erb , a transcription factor (TF) that functions both as a core repressive component of the cell autonomous clock and as a regulator of metabolic genes.  Here we show that Rev-erb  modulates the clock and metabolism by different genomic mechanisms. Clock control requires Rev-erb  to bind directly to the genome at its cognate sites, where it competes with activating ROR TFs. By contrast, Rev-erb  regulates metabolic genes primarily by recruiting the HDAC3 corepressor to sites to which it is tethered by cell type-specific transcription factors.  Thus, direct competition between Rev-erb  and ROR TFs provides a universal mechanism for self-sustained control of molecular clock across all tissues, whereas Rev-erb  utilizes lineage-determining factors to convey a tissue-specific epigenomic rhythm that regulates metabolism tailored to the specific need of that tissue.

DESIGN
Gene expressions in wild type and RORs depleted mouse livers were compared using Affymetrix MoGene2.0st array. Four biological replicates were used for each condition.
