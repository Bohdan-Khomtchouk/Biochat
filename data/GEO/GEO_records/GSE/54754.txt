TITLE
Differential gene expression in 2 days old zebrafish after glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) morpholino-mediated knockdown

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Gene expression signature was explored to identify gene targets regulate by dysfunctional glucocerebrosidase function. We found 131 upregulated genes and 63 downregulated genes. Some of the most upregulated (PON3, PLOD1) and downregulated (gpx-1b and complemewnt c9) genes  were analyzed by q-PCR demonstrating the correct differential gene expression signature among control and morpholino-microinjected fish.

DESIGN
Knockdown of GBA1 function was measured in 4 biological replicates at 2 days post fertilization after microinjection of GBA1 morpholino and control morpholino at one -cell stage embryos.
