TITLE
An Estradiol-Inducible Promoter Enables Fast, Graduated Control of Gene Expression in Fission Yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacks a diverse toolkit of inducible promoters for experimental manipulation.  Available inducible promoters suffer from slow induction kinetics, limited control of expression levels and/or a requirement for defined growth medium.  In particular, no S. pombe inducible promoter systems exhibit a linear dose response, which would allow expression to be tuned to specific levels.  We have adapted a fast, orthogonal promoter system with a large dynamic range and a linear dose response, based on _-estradiol-regulated function of the human estrogen receptor, for use in S. pombe.  We show that this promoter system, termed Z3EV, turns on quickly, can reach a maximal induction of 20 fold, and exhibits a linear dose response over its entire induction range, with few off target effects.  We demonstrate the utility of this system by regulating the mitotic inhibitor Wee1 to create a strain in which cell size is regulated by _-estradiol concentration.  This promoter system will be of great utility for experimentally regulating gene expression in fission yeast.
