TITLE
Genome-wide Identification of Neuronal Activity-regulated Genes in Drosophila [DA_PDF]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified ARGs in a genome-wide manner, in fly brains as well as in sorted neurons; they included dopaminergic neurons (DA) and a subset of circadian-related neurons (PDF+ neurons).

DESIGN
TH-GAL4 (DA neurons)/PDF-gal4 (PDF+ cells);UAS-TrpA1 or TH-GAL4 flies stimulated with temperature shift and mRNA isolated and sequenced 0 or 60 min after.

PLATFORM
GPL15334 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Drosophila melanogaster) GPL22106 NextSeq 550 (Drosophila melanogaster)
