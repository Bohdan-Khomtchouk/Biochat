TITLE
Comparison of  testes gene expression in Gipr–/– and Gipr+/+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim is to compare gene expression profiles of Gipr–/– mice testes with those of Gipr+/+ mice testes.

DESIGN
Testes from Gipr+/+ 　and Gipr–/–mice (8-week-old, n=3, each genotype) were utilized for the microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
