TITLE
RIP-Chip analysis of the C. elegans FOG-1 and FOG-3 proteins

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
FOG-1/CPEB and FOG-3/Tob are the terminal regulators of the sex determination in C. elegans germ cells.  CPEB and Tob proteins are both translational regulators.  To investigate how FOG-1 and FOG-3 regulate germ cell sex determination we sought to identify the target mRNAs.  We used transgenic epitope tagged animals (3xMyc::FOG-1 and FOG-3::3xFLAG).  To identify the mRNA targets of FOG-1/CPEB and FOG-3/Tob on a genome wide scale we used RNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis.  We found 81 putative mRNA targets of FOG-1 and 722 putative targets of FOG-3.  76 target mRNAs were common to both FOG-1 and FOG-3.

DESIGN
FOG-1 RNA-coimmunoprecipitation (RIP) samples were prepared as follows.  Parallel RIPs were performed with wild type animals as the control IP.  Worm extracts were made from wildtype and 3xMyc::FOG-1  late L3/early L4 animals.  Myc affinity gel was used to immunoprecipitate 3xMyc::FOG-1 from the extracts.  RNA was extracted from the pellets and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.  7 biological replicates of both 3xMyc::FOG-1 and wildtype were used.  FOG-3 RNA-coimmunoprecipitation (RIP) samples were prepared as follows.  Parallel RIPs were performed with wild type animals as the control IP.  Worm extracts were made from wildtype and FOG-3::3xFLAG  late L3/early L4 animals.  Myc affinity gel was used to immunoprecipitate FOG-3::3xFLAG from the extracts.  RNA was extracted from the pellets and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.  7 biological replicates of both FOG-3::3xFLAG and wildtype were used.
