TITLE
Cataloguing of Potential HIV Susceptibility Factors during the Menstrual Cycle of Pigtail Macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca nemestrina

SUMMARY
Our earlier studies in pig-tailed macaques demonstrated varying SHIV susceptibility during the menstrual cycle, likely caused by cyclic variations in immune responses in the female genital tract.  There is concern that high-dose, long-lasting, injectable progestin-based contraception could mimic the luteal phase and predispose women to HIV-1 acquisition and transmission. In this study, we adopted a systems biology approach employing proteomics (tandem mass spectrometry), transcriptomics (RNA microarray hybridization), and other specific protein assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and multiplex chemokine-cytokine measurements) to characterize the effects of hormonal changes on the expression of innate factors and secreted proteins in the macaque vagina. Several antiviral factors and pathways (including acute phase response signaling and complement system) were overexpressed in the follicular phase. Conversely, during the luteal phase there were factors overexpressed (including moesins, syndecans, integrins, among others) that could play direct or indirect roles in enhancing HIV-1 infection. Thus, our study showed that specific pathways and proteins/genes might be working in tandem to regulate innate immunity, thus fostering further investigation and future design of approaches to help counter HIV-1 acquisition in the female genital tract.

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Rhesus Macaque Genome Arrays. Vaginal pinch biopsies were collected from 12 pig-tailed macaques at both the follicular and luteal phases. The data from one animal suggested low RNA quality and was excluded.
