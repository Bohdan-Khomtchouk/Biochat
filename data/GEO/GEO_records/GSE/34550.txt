TITLE
Systematic RNA-seq analysis of the early events of CD4+ T cell activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to look at the transcriptome changes and the early events of T cell receptor stimulation in CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were stimulated with immobilised anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 4 hours and RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis.
