TITLE
Identification of miRNAs which bind to YB-1 protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the direct association of the nucleic acid binding protein yb-1 with mature microRNAs in breast cancer. To do this we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of YB-1 protein to pull-down linked RNAs Two breast cancer cell-lines, representative of Luminal A and Basal molecular subtypes were used, MCF7 and MDA-MB-435S. An input control represents the RNA present in the lysate used for the IP, prior to treatment.

DESIGN
IPs were performed in triplicates on different cell-lysates with one input control used as a representative of the RNA added to the IP reaction.
