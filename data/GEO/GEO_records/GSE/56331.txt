TITLE
E2F1 transcription factor knockdown effect on gene expression in LNCaP-abl cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our computational approach identified E2F1 as a potential collaborator of EZH2 in androgen-independent prostate cancer. This experiment is to designed to validate the crosstalking of E2F1 and EZH2 pathways. We showed that majority of the EZH2-induced genes in androgen-independent prostate tumor cells are in downstream of E2F1, providing insight into the EZH2-E2F1 collaborative regulatory pathway.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq experiments to compare the gene expression profles before and after E2F1 siRNA silencing
