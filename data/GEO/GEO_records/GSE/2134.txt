TITLE
Effects of Fescue Toxins On Hepatic Gene Expression in Mice.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fescue toxicosis is a disease of wild and domestic animals grazing on fescue pasture infected with the endophytic fungus, Neotyphodium Coenophialum. Mice, previously selected for increased sensitivity to endophyte-infected fescue seed diets indicated by slow weight gain, were used to study the effects of fescue toxicosis on hepatic gene expression. Liver genes differentially expressed due to fescue toxins were studied using DNA microarray. A two-stage ANOVA of microarray data identified forty differentially expressed genes between mice fed endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) fescue seeds. Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) analysis identified 9 genes as differentially expressed between treatment groups. Hierarchical clustering with the 40 genes identified by ANOVA clearly separate the mice according to their diets, with 100% confidence as computed by bootstrap analysis. Expressions of eleven genes were verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The E+ diet resulted in downregulation of genes involved in sex-steroid metabolism pathway, genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism.
