TITLE
Microarray analysis of V. cholerae genes differentially expressed in 12 h rabbit ileal loop fluid

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type V. cholerae isolated from the rabbit ileal loop was performed by quickly pelleting bacteria from the fluid accumulated in the ileal loops after 12 h of infection. The bacteria were then resuspended in Trizol reagent and frozen on dry ice. The wild-type bacteria from two independent experiments in two different rabbits were analyzed. RNA was isolated from the Trizol agent, treated with DNaseI (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States), and cleaned by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). Labeling of cDNA and microarray hybridizations were performed as described [Yiliz et al. 2001, Mol. Micro. 53: 497-515]. Microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 400A instrument (Axon Instruments), using the GENEPIX 5.0 software. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
