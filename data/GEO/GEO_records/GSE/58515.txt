TITLE
Gene expression of Bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated in ERR-alpha knock-out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ERRα negatively regulates TLR-signaling pathways. To examine this, we performed global gene expression analysis of ERRα+/+ and ERRα-/- BMDMs after LPS stimulation. Microarray analysis revealed that several genes encoding various TLR-negative regulators were downregulated in LPS-stimulated ERRα-/- BMDMs, when compared with ERRα+/+ BMDMs

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated in 6~8 week old male C57BL6 mice and then divided into 4 groups 1) Solvent control-treated ERRα+/+ BMDM  2) LPS-treated ERRα+/+ BMDM 3) Solvent control-treated ERRα-/- BMDM 4) LPS-treated ERRα-/- BMDM
