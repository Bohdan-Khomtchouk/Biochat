TITLE
Organoid mRNA Abundance with different treatment conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small intestine organoids were formed from wild-type and MPC1 fl/fl mice harboring the Lger-EGFP transgene. Organoids were treated with growth factors, drugs to modulate metabolism, or induce recombination of the Mpc1 fl/fl allele and subjected to mRNA analysis.

DESIGN
Each group of smaples for comparison was composed of 3 biological replicates (labeled 1-3).
