TITLE
Developmental Timecourses total-RNA sequencing [Ribosome repleted total RNA]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We report the presence of extensive, transcriptionally controlled oscillations in the C. elegans, developmental transcriptome. Furthermore, using ribosome profiling, we show that these oscillating transcripts are actively translated.

DESIGN
Examination of two timecourses that were collected over C. elegans development and analyzed by RNA-seq of " RiboMinus " libraries

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
