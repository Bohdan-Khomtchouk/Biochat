TITLE
Expression data from inflorescence (unopened flower buds) of Arabidopsis thaliana - comparison between Ler and ask1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE1 (ASK1) protein is involved in regulating flower development. We have compared ask1 mutant floral transcriptome with wild-type Ler to identify the role of ASK1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating flower transcriptome. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana Ler and ask1 mutant flower buds. We identified 42 genes and 74 genes that are down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively.

DESIGN
Totally 5 samples were analyzed: 3 samples of ask1 and 2 samples of Ler. The average values were compared between ask1 and Ler.
