TITLE
Origin and pathogenesis of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma as revealed by global gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and its relationship to other lymphomas are largely unknown. This is partly due to the technical challenge of analyzing its rare neoplastic L & H cells, which are dispersed in an abundant non-neoplastic cellular microenvironment. We performed a genome-wide expression study of microdissected lymphocytic and histiocytic (L & H) lymphoma cells in comparison to normal and other malignant B cells, which indicates a relationship of L & H cells to and/or origin from germinal center B cells at transition to memory B cells. L & H cells show a surprisingly high similarity to the tumor cells of T cell-rich B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, a partial loss of their B cell phenotype and deregulation of many apoptosis-regulators and putative oncogenes. Importantly, L & H cells are characterized by constitutive NF-ÎºB activity and aberrant ERK signaling. Thus, these findings shed new light on the nature of L & H cells, revealed several novel pathogenetic mechanisms in NLPHL, and may help in differential diagnosis and lead to novel therapeutic strategies.

DESIGN
Analysis of differential gene expression in primary human lymphoma cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) in comparison with primary lymphoma cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma cells and other B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) samples and subsets of non-neoplastic B lymphocytes isolated from blood or tonsils. 67 gene expression profiles were analysed.
