TITLE
Expression analysis of melanoma harvested from GFP versus SETDB1 transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of expression differences between melanomas harvested from MiniCoopR-GFP versus MiniCoopR-SETDB1 transgenic zebrafish.

DESIGN
An eight-chip study using total RNA prepared from four distinct melanomas from zebrafish injected with MiniCoopR-GFP (control) transposon and four distinct melanomas from zebrafish injected with MiniCoopR-SETDB1 transposon.  Injected animals carried a p53 loss-of-function mutation, a mutation in nacre, and an mitf:BRAF-V600E transgene.  Each chip measures the expression level of 32,292 genes.
