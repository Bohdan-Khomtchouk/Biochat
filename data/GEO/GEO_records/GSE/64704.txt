TITLE
Impact of Glucocorticoids and PI3K Inhibition on Gene Expression in Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously noted that combination glucocorticoids and PI3K inhibition induces synergistic cell death.  To identify genes involved in myeloma cell death we examined mRNA expression in each individual treatment and in the combination.  The glucocoriticoid resistant cells (MM.1RL) are used as a negative control.  Gene expression is assessed using Illumina Human HT-12v4 bead chips

DESIGN
For this experiment, the lab is using human multiple myeloma cell lines that were isolated from a patient.  MM.1S cells display sensitivity to glucocorticoids.  MM.1RL cells display resistance to glucocorticoid treatment due to spontaneous mutations that render the glucocorticoid receptor inoperable. In this experiment, there will be 4 conditions for the MM.1S cells, and 2 conditions for the MM.1RL cells.  We will be treating the MM.1S cells with a glucocorticoid alone (Dexamethasone - 1 uM), a PI3K inhibitor alone (LY249002 - 25 uM), a combination of the two drugs, and a vehicle control.  The MM.1RL cells will be treated with a PI3K inhibitor alone, and with a vehicle control.  Since the PI3K inhibitor is diluted in DMSO, as a control an equal volume of DMSO will be added to all conditions not containing the PI3K inhibitor.  Conditions within the MM.1S cell line will be compared with each other.  Specifically, we hope to identify genes that are similarly affected by all three experimental conditions. The MM.1RL conditions will not be analyzed at this time. There will be 4 biological replicates of each condition.
