TITLE
Expression profiles of MDA-MB-231, MDA-231 S1a and S1b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes that are involved in self-seeding by comparing gene expression profiles between parental MDA-MB-231 cells and seeder cells (MDA-231-S1a and S1b)

DESIGN
2 replicates from each sample (parental  MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231 S1a and  MDA-MB-231 S1b) were analyzed
