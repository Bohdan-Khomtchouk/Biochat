TITLE
Dynamic changes of Arabidopsis cis-NAT pairs during de-etiolation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We systematically identified long noncoding natural antisense transcripts (lncNATs), defined as lncRNAs transcribed from the opposite DNA strand of coding or noncoding genes. We identified in total 37,238 sense-antisense transcript pairs and found 70% mRNAs are associated with antisense transcripts in Arabidopsis. To investigate the role of NATs in response to white light treatment, we designed an Agilent custom array, ATH NAT array, and analyzed WT seedlings grown in the dark (0h) and seedlings undergoing de-etiolation in continuous white light for 1h and 6h. To obtain information on organ-specific transcriptome profiles, we further dissected seedlings into cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots.

DESIGN
We examined the abundance of NATs in etiolated seedlings and seedlings undergoing de-etiolation in continuous white light for 1/6h. Seedlings were further dissected into cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots. RNAs from 3 biological replicates of each of the 3 organs were separately hybridized to ATH NAT arrays to profile light-regulated NAT pairs.
