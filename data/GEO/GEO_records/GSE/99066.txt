TITLE
Next-Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Rumen Epithelium Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
We compared the biological processes altered by an increase of dietary concentration from 10% to 35% (energy-rich status) with those altered by an increase of dietary concentration from 35% to 65% (energy-excess status).

DESIGN
Examination of the goat rumen epithelium from 3 groups that were fed with 3 different types of concentrate diet.
