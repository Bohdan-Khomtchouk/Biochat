TITLE
Effects of Sirt1 manipulation on gene expression in human Caco-2 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare gene expression in human intestinal cell line after Sirt1 manipulation by overexpression or targetted siRNA knockdown

DESIGN
Triplicate biological replicates for Caco-2 control and Sirt1 overexpression (6 samples), duplicate biological replicates for Caco-2 control siRNA and two non-overlapping targetted Sirt1 siRNAs (6 samples)
