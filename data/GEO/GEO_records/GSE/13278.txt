TITLE
Expression analysis to identify inducible genes in T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression microarrays were employed to identify genes induced by phorbol ester and ionomycin stimulation of EL4 cells. EL4 is a murine T cell line. To identify induced genes that were independent of new protein synthesis cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide. This expression study was used in conjunction with histone acetylation ChIP-chip to determine if inducible genes had a specific histone acetylation profile and whether the acetylation profile differed for genes with different kinetics of induction. Keywords: drug treatment comparison
