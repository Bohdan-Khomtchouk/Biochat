TITLE
Expression data from L-02 and Hep3B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Constitutively expressed intracellular antiviral factors are responsible for the resistance of cells against alphavirus, especially for the inhibition of virus entry and early replication. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles between resistant (L-02) and susceptible (Hep3B) cells and identified the antiviral genes that are defective in susceptible cells.

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from normally cultured L-02 and Hep3B cells. cDNA and cRNA were produced and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
