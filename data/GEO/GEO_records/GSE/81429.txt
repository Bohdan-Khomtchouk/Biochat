TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in HT29 and SW480 cells depleted of Prdx2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prdx2 is the thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase that reduces H2O2 using reducing power NADPH in the presence of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Prdx2 plays an important role in growth. factor signaling in mammlian cells. Therefore, we examined the gene expression in colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 after Prdx2 depletion. Prdx2 depletion resulted in a significant alteration on gene expression, including protein synthesis, metabolisms, and cell cycle.

DESIGN
Control-siRNA-transfected versus PRDX2-siRNA-transfected HT29 and SW480 cells

PLATFORM
