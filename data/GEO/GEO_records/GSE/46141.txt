TITLE
Expression data from fine-needle aspiration biopsies of breast cancer metastases from different anatomical sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer molecular subtypes preferentially metastasize to specific organs and the anatomical location of the metastasis is associated with the length of survival post-recurrence. We used microarrays to provide a detailed characterization of breast cancer site-specific metastases  with particular focus on identifying genes predictive of breast cancer liver metastatic proprnsity

DESIGN
We performed global gene expression profiling on fine-needle aspirates of metastatic lesions from different anatomical sites obtained  from breast cancer patients treated within the Swedish randomized trial (TEX) of first-line chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Samples were collected before commencement of treatment.
