TITLE
Expression data of wild type and C-DGCR8 KO cones at different timepoints [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed gene expression in cone photoreceptors isolated from wild type and C-DGCR8 (DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8) KO mice at five different time points to get a mechanistic inside into the altered molecular pathways after microRNAs depletion.

DESIGN
Cones were isolated by FACS from wild type and C-DGCR8 KO mice expressing Cre recombinase postnatally specifically in cones (D4-Cre) and bearing conditional null Dgcr8 allele. Experiments were performed in duplicates from different time points (P30, P40, P50, P60, and P90). Total RNA was extracted and next-generation RNA sequencing was performed.
