TITLE
Analysis of mir-17~92 targets in motor neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify mir-17~92 targets in MNs, a set of target candidate genes from the intersection of upregulated genes found only in the mir-17~92 KO MNs that were predicted to be direct targets of mir-17~92 by TargetScan.

DESIGN
Motor neurons in the spinal cord from WT ; Hb9::GFP and mir-17~92 -/- ; Hb9::GFP embryos at E12.5 were isolated by FACS. Subsequently, both WT and KO motor neurons (GFPon) and non motor neurons (GFPoff) transcriptome were analyzed by Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Agilent-G4858A-028005).
