TITLE
Differential expression of miRNAs in granulosa cells of bovine preovulatory dominant and subordinate follicles

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The study aimed to uncover differential expression pattern of regulatory microRNAs in bovine granulosa cells  derived from  preovulatory dominant and subordinate  follicles.

DESIGN
We used ovarian follicle samples  of experimental heifers slaughtered at day 19 of the estrous cycle .  Follicles were catagorized as preovulatory dominant follicles (PDF)  and  anovulatory subordinate  follicles (SF).  The granulosa cells were collected from each follicle and subjected to microRNA enriched  total RNA isolation and used for miRNAs deep sequencing. A total of 6 samples (three biological replicated  from PDF and 3  biological replicates from SF) were used for miRNA deep sequencing.
