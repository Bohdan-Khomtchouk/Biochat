TITLE
Differentially expressed genes following injection with miR-1 mimics of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, during pupation

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
The molting of insects is a complex biological progress which requires varies of genes to participate in the event. MicroRNAs are considered to be one of the key roles involved in development in many organisms. Microarray technology was employed to examine the expression profile of multiple genes after extrinsical up-regulation of miR-1 level by injection of miR-1 mimics in silkworm (Bombyx mori.L), which caused altered expression profile of numerous genes, especially those which involved in the processes of cuticle renewing and development. 814 genes were up-regulated and 636 were down-regulated after treated with miR-1 mimics, the rest 2961 detectable genes were considered to have no significant changes in expression level.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling experiments, 3 pairs of samples (miR-1 injected and negative control) were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with control samples labeled by Cy5 and miR-1 injected samples labeled by Cy3. Fold change was calculated via comparing signal intensity of Cy3 vs Cy5. 3 biological replicates were performed.
