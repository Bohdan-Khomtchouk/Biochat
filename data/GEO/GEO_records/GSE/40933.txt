TITLE
Identification of microRNAs differentially expressed in zebrafish larvae following immunostimulation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To identify key microRNAs involved in innate immune response of zebrafish larvae. Immunostimulation experiments were carried out on 72 hours post fertilisation larvae by exposing them to lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan. Samples were collected at 1, 2 and 12 hours after exposure and total RNA was extracted. Transcript level of 246 microRNAs was quantified using microarray and further validated through real-time PCR

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression in immunostimulated zebrafish larvae was measured at 1, 2 and 12 hours after exposure to 200 Âµg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enterica typhimurium or peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus. Experiments were preformed in triplicates
