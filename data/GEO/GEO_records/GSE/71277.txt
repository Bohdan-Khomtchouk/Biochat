TITLE
Gene expression profiles in liver of Sprague-Dawley rat using two types of anesthesia.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To reveal influence of anesthesia in toxicogenomics study, gene expression analysis of liver of Sprague-Dawley rat after isoflurane anesthesia or CO2/O2 anesthesia was performed. The liver samples were excised from each rat after isoflurane anesthesia or CO2/O2 anesthesia. The gene expression profiles in liver were measureed by Agilent microarray.

DESIGN
In animal study, corn oil was administrated for three days in  Sprague-Dawley rats of 9-week-old. Rats were killed after isoflurane anesthesia (n=3) or CO2/O2 anesthesia (n=3). Microarray analysis was performed one replicate per array.
