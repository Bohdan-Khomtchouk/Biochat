TITLE
Genome wide identification of p63 binding sites in human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report here genome wide identification of p63 binding sites in cycling neonatal foreskin keratinocytes using high throughput sequencing of ChIP enriched DNA.  Analysis of gene ontology, database mining with integration with publicly available data, reveals a role for p63 in transcriptional regulation of multiple genes genetically linked to cleft palate. In addition, we identify AP-2Î±, a transcription factor which, when mutated, also results in craniofacial clefting syndrome, as a co-regulator of p63 responsive genes.
