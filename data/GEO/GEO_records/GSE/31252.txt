TITLE
Benzo[a]pyrene-induced changes in microRNA-mRNA networks

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray contains 9360 reporters, each present four times on the microarray. In our analysis 1326 human and viral reporters were used, of which 880 are unique human mature microRNAs. The other 8024 reporters represent microRNAs from other species. cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA per sample. RNA was labeled only with Hy3 containing dye using the microRNACURY LNA™ microRNA Hy3 Power labeling kit (Exiqon, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s protocol in a total volume of 25 μl. To adjust the volume to 100 μl, a hybridization buffer provided in miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array, 5th generation kit (Exiqon, Denmark) was used.

DESIGN
For each biological experiment, one hybridization per time point was conducted and one sample per array. In total, 24 arrays were used for 8 different conditions (BaP or control, at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours).

PLATFORM
GPL11432 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 5th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
