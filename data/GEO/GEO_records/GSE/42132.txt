TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of Gli1 and Sox2 input to neural progenitor program and integration with actve histone marks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the vertebrate neural tube, regional Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling invokes a time- and concentration-dependent induction of six different cell populations mediated through Gli transcriptional regulators. Elsewhere in the embryo, Shh/Gli responses invoke different tissue appropriate regulatory programs. To elucidate Shh/Gli regulation of neural fate sepcification, we performed Gli1  ChIP-Seq analysis. We further analyzed two transcription factors whose motifs were enriched in Gli1 ChIP data (Sox2 and Foxa2).  Two active histone marks (H3K4me2 and H3K27ac) were additionally analyzed to study activity status of Shh-responsive cis-elements.

DESIGN
Active enhancer histone marks and transcription factor binding patterns were obtained from neuralized emrbyoid bodies. Biological replicates were performed for Gli1 and mock FLAG chips. Histone profiling for enhancer marks were taken from  time course experiment performed in parallel.
