TITLE
Genome binding profile of the conserved CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein in CSB-null UVSS1KO cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein arose over 43 million years ago when a 2.5 kb piggyBac 3 (PGBD3) transposon inserted into intron 5 of the Cockayne syndrome Group B (CSB) gene in the common ancestor of all higher primates. The CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein binds internally-deleted PGBD3 elements called MER85s in vitro, and induces a strong interferon-like innate antiviral immune response when expressed in CSB-null UVSS1KO cells. To explore the connection between DNA binding and gene expression changes induced by CSB-PGBD3, we investigated the genome-wide DNA binding profile of the fusion protein.
