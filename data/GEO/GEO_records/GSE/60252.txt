TITLE
The whole transcriptome expression profiling comparison between the ovarian cancer spheroids and monolayer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To discover the core gene expression features of ovarian cancer spheroids The compared the whole transcript expression profiling between 5 pairs of spheroids and monolayer cancer cells, including the RMG1, MCAS and Ov432 plus two cases of serous ovarian cancer ascites cells.

DESIGN
The 3 paired good spheroid formed ovarian cancer cells (MCAS, RMG1 and OV432) and two pairs of serous ovarian cancer ascites (RB-223 and RB-407) were used to discover the ovarian cancer spheroid feature signature. The RNA was extracted from well cultured spheroid (4days cultured) and monolayer cells (4 days cultured) using TRIzol reagent, and whole transcriptome gene expression  profiling were performed using an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST microarray platform.
