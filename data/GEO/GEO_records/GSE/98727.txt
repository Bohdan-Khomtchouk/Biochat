TITLE
Identification of p53-regulated genes in breast epithelial cells using MCF10A with wild-type p53 or p53-null

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis of MCF10A p53+/+ and MCF10A p53−/− treated with doxorubicin to activate p53 in time-dependent manner.

DESIGN
MCF10A p53+/+ and MCF10A p53−/− cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml of doxorubicin for 2 hours. Total RNA was isolated at 12, 24, and 48 hours after the treatment; including non-treated cells (0 hour) as controls.
