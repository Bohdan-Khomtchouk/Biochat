TITLE
Transcriptom analysis of differentially regulated genes in metastasis associated macrophages(MAM) compared with lung and spleen resident macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in metastasis associated macrophage (MAM) FACS sorted cells from mice bearing pulmonary metastasis of breast tumor cells  were compared with  lung and spleen resident macrophages sorted from healthy mice using same sorting protocol.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from metastasis associated macrophages from three individual mice and lungs and spleens all from three individual mice.  Each chip measures the expression level of 42586 genes.

PLATFORM
GPL13179 NimbleGen mouse expression array (2006-08-03_MM8_60mer_expr)
