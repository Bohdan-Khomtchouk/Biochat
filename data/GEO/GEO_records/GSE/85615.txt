TITLE
Epigenetic Activation of WNT5A Drives Glioblastoma Stem Cell Differentiation and Invasive Growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin and transcriptome comparisons of matched NSCs and derivative GSCs reveal activation of WNT5A and an EC signature WNT5A-mediated GdEC differentiation and EC recruitment support the invasive growth of glioma cells in the brain parenchyma.

DESIGN
Identify the GSC lineage differentiation based on gene expression in oncogenic transformation of human neuronal progenitor cells.
