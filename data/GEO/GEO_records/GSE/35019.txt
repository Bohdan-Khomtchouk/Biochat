TITLE
Whole genome DASL analysis of tumour epithelial and stromal compartments during breast cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in tumour epithelium (DCIS and invasive breast cancer) and stroma both immediately surrounding the lesions and more distantly.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded archival material and the individual compartments (stroma and epithelium) compared independently across the samples. Sample abbreviation key: BC = breast cancer DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ IDC = invasive ductal carcinoma RM = reduction mammoplasty S = stroma NS = normal stroma.
