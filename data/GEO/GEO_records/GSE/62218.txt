TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for human prostate tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metabolomics was used to identify metabolic fingerprints of AKT1 activation or MYC overexpression in human prostate tumors. Genomics was used to determine how many of these tumors had a genetic aberration underlying signaling activation.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays was performed for 59 human prostate tumors and 6 normal prostate samples.
