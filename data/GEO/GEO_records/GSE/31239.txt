TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone modifications unwind in vivo chromatin states of the hair follicle lineage [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse hair follicles undergo synchronized cycles. Cyclical regeneration and hair growth is fueled by stem cells (SCs). During the rest phase, the HF-SCs remain quiescent due to extrinsic inhibitory signals within the niche. As activating cues accumulate, HF-SCs become activated, proliferate, and grows downward to form transient-amplifying matrix progenitor cells. We used ChIP-seq to reveal the genome-wide maps of histone modifications underlying the states of hair follicle stem cells and their transient-amplifying progeny before differentiation.

DESIGN
Quiescent hair follicle stem cells (qHF-SCs), activated hair follicle stem cells (aHF-SCs) and transient-amplifying matrix cells (HF-TACs) were FACS-purified for ChIP-sequcencing.
