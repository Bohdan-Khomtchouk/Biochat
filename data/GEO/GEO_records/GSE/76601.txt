TITLE
Tumor suppressor role of Ezh2 in an NRASQ61K driven model of Early T-cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To characterize changes in genome-wide H3K27me3 associated with homozygous inactivation the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) lysine methyltransferase Ezh2 in a mouse model of earlt T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) Methods: We performed Chip-seq for the H3K27me3 Chromatin mark on Ezh2ff and Ezh2ko cells NRASQ61K leukemias. Results: Inactivation of Ezh2 in this model leads to accelerated leukemia development. Resulting gene expression changes are complex and include enrichment of genes associated with immature hematopoietic cells, Ras signaling and Cytokines and their cognate receptors.  Genes that lose K27me3 in Ezh2ko vs. Ezh2ff cells (ChIP-Seq) are enriched by GSEA in Ezh2ko vs Ezh2ff cells. Conclusions: Inactivation of Ezh2 in our model leads to accentuated expression of early hematopoietic gene expression programs, to accentuated growth and survival signaling and to transcriptonal enrichment of PRC2 targets.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for H3K27me3 using Ezh2ff and Ezh2ko NRASQ61K leukemias harvested from leukemic mice and expanded on OP9DL1 cells.
