TITLE
Diagnosis and early detection of CNS-SLE in MRL/lpr mice using peptide microarrays (GPL17600)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In addition to determining possible diagnostic and predictive peptides of lupus and CNS-lupus, we also used our microarray technology along with the Guitope computer program to determine possible natural protein match to five monoclonal autoantibodies that were created using one of the autoimmune MRL/lpr mouse. Submitter states " We have no processed data to submit.  We have no gpr files to submit. "

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on five monoclonal brain-reactive autoantibodies (F9, G10, G4, D1 and D9) that were created from one autoimmune mouse with altered behavior.  These samples were tested in duplicated along with a control sample on the GPL17600 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17600 10K immunosignaturing peptide microarray version 2
