TITLE
Effects of hepatocyte-restricted Fra-1 overexpression on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatic mRNA expression was compared between control and Fra-1hep mice, which were fed chow diet

DESIGN
Liver RNA pooled from 5 chow-diet fed control mice (control pool) was Cy3-labeled and liver RNA from 6 individual Fra-1hep mice was Cy5-labeled. On each microarray, Cy3‐labeled control pool and one Cy5-labeled mutant sample were hybridized at 65°C for 17 hours.
