TITLE
Study of microbial functional structure in Xiangjiang River sediment

ORGANISM
uncultured bacterium

SUMMARY
Xiangjiang River (Hunan, China) has been contaminated with heavy metal for several decades by surrounding factories. However, little is known about the influence of a gradient of heavy metal contamination on the diversity, structure of microbial functional gene in sediment. To deeply understand the impact of heavy metal contamination on microbial community, a comprehensive functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) has been used to study the functional genes structure, composition, diversity and metabolic potential of microbial community from three heavy metal polluted sites of Xiangjiang River.

DESIGN
Three groups of samples, A, B and C. Every group has 3 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL22263 Geochip 5.0
