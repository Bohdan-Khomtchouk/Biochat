TITLE
Sensory ray genes

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These experiments were undertaken with the goal of identifying genes whose expression is enriched in or restricted to the sensory rays of the C. elegans male tail. We constructed two mutant strains in which ray development is either compromised (EM672) or enhanced (EM673), and harvested mRNA from adult males. Labeled cDNAs were compared on seven arrays (representing three different sets of mRNA preps). In all experiments, Channel 1 (green) represents the EM672 expression profile and Channel 2 (Red) corresponds to EM673. Ray-enriched genes would therefore generally be expected to have higher intensities in Channel 2 than in Channel 1. Experimental details and results from these studies are available in D.S. Portman and S.W. Emmons (2004) Identification of C. elegans sensory ray genes using whole-genome expression profiling. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series.
