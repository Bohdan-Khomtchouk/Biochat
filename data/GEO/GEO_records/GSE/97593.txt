TITLE
Gene expression changes in adult mouse cardiomyocytes when Brg1 and Brm are knocked out

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of gene expression changes in wild type versus mutant mouse hearts where Brg1 and Brm were knocked out in adult cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
A Tamoxifen induced knock out of Brg1 in Brm null MHC Cre-ERT mice created the double knock out in adult mouse cardiomyocytes.  Agilent Sure Print G3 Mouse Gene Expression one color (Cy3) microarray platform was utilized to compare 4 wild type and 4 control cDNA samples.

PLATFORM
GPL21163 Agilent-074809 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE v2 8x60K Microarray [Probe Name version]
