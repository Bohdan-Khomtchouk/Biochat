TITLE
TMEM45A, SERPINB5 and p16INK4A transcript levels are predictive for development of high-grade cervical lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Women persistently infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 are at high risk for development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or cervical cancer (CIN3+). We aimed to identify biomarkers for progression to CIN3+ in women with persistent HPV16 infection. In this prospective study, 11,088 women aged 20â€“29 years were enrolled during 1991-1993, and re-invited for a second visit two years later. Cervical cytology samples obtained at both visits were tested for HPV DNA by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), and HC2-positive samples were genotyped by INNO-LiPA. The cohort was followed for up to 19 years via a national pathology register. To identify markers for progression to CIN3+, we performed microarray analysis on RNA extracted from cervical swabs of 30 women with persistent HPV16-infection and 11 HPV-negative women. After further validation, we found that high mRNA expression levels of TMEM45A, SERPINB5 and p16INK4a were associated with increased risk of CIN3+ in persistently HPV16-infected women.

DESIGN
We aimed at identifying genes differentially expressed in women with persistent HPV16 infection that either progressed to CIN3+ or not. As a test of principle we first compared HPV16 persistently infected women with HPV-negative women.
