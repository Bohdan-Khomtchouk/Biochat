TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the oral cavity in a mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied global gene expression with samples derived from a recently established mouse model for oral cancer recurrences and identified a list of genes with differential expression between primary and recurrent tumors.

DESIGN
5 independent primary tumors and respectivce recurrences were analyzed. Two replicates of the original cell line used for the generation of all tumors was also added to the study.
