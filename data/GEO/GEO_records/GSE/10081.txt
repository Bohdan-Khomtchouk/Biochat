TITLE
Expression data from UPD12 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression levels between matUPD12 and patUPD12 15.5 dpc whole embryo or placenta samples (maternal versus paternal uniparental disomy of Chr 12). Identification of highly differentially expressed transcripts. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Pairwise array comparative analyses were performed using MAS5/GCOS where sample age and tissue were matched, while the sample genotype varied between the compared arrays: matUPD12 vs patUPD12.
