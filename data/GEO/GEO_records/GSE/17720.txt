TITLE
Microarray studies of drb0090 mutant vs wild type

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans

SUMMARY
Deinococcus radiodurans exposed to higher doses of gamma radiation showed induced levels of DRB0091 polypeptide annotated as a putative response regulator in an operon expressing upstream to DRB0090, histidine kinase. Deletion of drB0090 generated,  showed decreased tolerance to DNA damage and impairment in DSB repair. Recombinant DR0090 protein showed phosphotransferase activity on its cognate response regulator, DRB0091. The drb0090 deletion mutant was checked for its role in regulation of gene expression in response to DNA damage in Deinococcus radiodurans R1. The gene expression profiling of this mutant was carried out by complete transcriptome analysis of these cells grown under normal as well as upon gamma-irradiated conditions and compared with wild type cells. DRB0090 mutant showed extreme sensitivity to gamma radiation and was used for Gene expression profiling using microarray and compared with wild type data.
