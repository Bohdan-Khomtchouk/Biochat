TITLE
Zoledronic acid inhibits NFAT and IL-2 signaling pathways in regulatory T cells and diminishes their suppressive function in patients with metastatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the processes altered in T regulatory cells (Treg) by Zoledronic acid (ZA), we examined RNA expression by RNA-seq in Treg treated with and without ZA. We identified gene expression alterations in ZA-treated Treg that were essential to Treg function.

DESIGN
Human T regulatory cells isolated from healthy donors (n=6) were cultured overnight with IL-2 and OKT3 (anti-CD3) in the presence or absence of ZA. RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500) was performed to identify differential gene expression induced by ZA treatment of Treg.
