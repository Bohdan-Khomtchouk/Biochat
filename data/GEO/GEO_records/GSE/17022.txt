TITLE
Profiling of caf1a and caf1b mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identify the genes which are misexpressed in Atcaf1a and Atcaf1b mutants before and in response to mechanical wounding.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were utilized for every genotype x treatment combination.  All samples were pooled and labeled with cy5 to serve as the reference.
