TITLE
White Cells Facilitate Opposite- and Same-Sex Mating of Opaque Cells in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Modes of sexual reproduction in eukaryotic organisms are highly diversified. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes a phenotypic switch from the white to the opaque phase in order to become mating-competent. In this study, we report that functionally and morphologically differentiated white and opaque cells show a coordinating behavior in the process of mating. Although white cells are mating-incompetent, they are induced to produce sexual pheromones when treated with opposite pheromones or interacted with opaque cells of an opposite mating type. In a co-culture system, pheromones released by white cells induce opaque cells to form mating projections and thus facilitate both opposite- and same-sex mating of opaque cells. Deletion of genes encoding the pheromone precursor proteins and inactivation of the pheromone response signaling pathway (Ste2-MAPK-Cph1) impair the promoting role of white cells (MTLa) in sexual mating of opaque cells. White and opaque cells communicate via a paracrine pheromone signaling and thus create an environment conducive to sexual mating. This coordination behavior of the two different cell types may be a trade-off strategy between sexual and asexual lifestyles in C. albicans.
