TITLE
Rosiglitazone Signature in Mouse White Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the murine white adipose expression traits that were changed in response to treatment with Rosiglitazone. Keywords: drug treatment response signature

DESIGN
White adipose tissue from three Rosiglitazone treated KO mice were arrayed against a pool of white adipose tissue from vehicle treated wildtype B6 animals.  All samples were hybridized as fluor-reverse pairs, and then the data between the pairs was combined to form a single experiment.  Three repeats were performed to increase the power to detect expression changes and to reduce effects of experimental noise.
