TITLE
Blood mRNA profile during EPO treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we obtained a global view from the transcriptome of total blood cells with or without darbepoetin alpha -an Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESAs)- treatment using the SAGE method, which allows large-scale quantitative gene expression measurements.

DESIGN
We sequenced 60,000 tags from 3 SAGE libraries.
