TITLE
The histone lysine demethylase Kdm6b is required for activity-dependent preconditioning of hippocampal neuronal survival

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled basal and bicuculline+4-AP inducible mRNA expression in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons with or without viral shRNA mediated knockdown of Kdm6b

DESIGN
We harvested mRNA from neurons under four conditions (pLKO vector/treatment control, pLKO vector/3hr bicuculline+4AP, Kdm6b knockdown/treatment control,Kdm6b knockdown/3hr bicuculline+4AP). Libraries were generated and used for RNA sequencing.
