TITLE
Expression analysis of circadian light response in Drosophila recombinant inbred lines (RIL)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in circadian photosensitivity in Drosophila, by measuring the locomotor response to early night light pulse (Zt15). We used QTL mapping of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which was followed by microarrays expression comparison of two RI lines which differed significantly in their light response (RIL 104 shows  a strong long phase delay response while  RIL 58  shows a weak light response).

DESIGN
Each of the two strains was sampled after light pulse, and without a light pulse (control), totalling 8 samples: 2x lines (L) x treatments (T) x 2 replicates
