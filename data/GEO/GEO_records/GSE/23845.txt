TITLE
Time course for bladder UCC development in UPII-SV40Tag mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified genes that are differentially expressed between the bladders of UPII-SV40Tag mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates at 3, 6, 20, and 30 weeks of age. These are ages that correspond to premalignant, carcinoma in situ, and early-stage and later stage invasive UCC, respectively Analysis of the microarray data sets has revealed ∼1,900 unique genes differentially expressed (≥3-fold difference at one or more time points) between wild-type and UPII-SV40Tag urothelium during the time course of tumor development.

DESIGN
RNA from the urothelium of duplicate UPII-SV40Tag hemizygous and age-matched wild type littermate mice was isolated at 3, 6, 20, and 30 weeks of age and gene expression profiles were obtained.
