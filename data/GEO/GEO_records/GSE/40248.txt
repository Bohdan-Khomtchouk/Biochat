TITLE
Expression data from control and heat shocked mouse spermatocytes and hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In somatic cells elevated temperature induces activation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) what leads to heat shock proteins synthesis and cytoprotection. However, in the male germ cells (spermatocytes) upon HSF1 activation, caspase-3 dependent apoptosis is induced and spermatogenic cells are actively eliminated. To elucidate a mechanism of such diverse HSF1 activity we carried out genome-wide transcriptional analysis in control and heat-shocked cells, either spermatogenic or somatic. As model somatic cells we used hepatocytes that respond to hyperthermia in a classical way by induction of heat shock genes transcription. As spermatogenic cells we used a fraction of cells enriched with spermatocytes, which are the most sensitive to damage in elevated temperatures. Using isolated spermatocytes we avoided the influence of the somatic testicular component on the our final results. Genes that are differently regulated during hyperthermia in both types of cells have been identified.

DESIGN
On Affymetrix gene chip arrays we analyzed RNA isolated from spermatocytes or hepatocytes, either untreated (control) or after heat shock and 2h of recovery at physiological temperature. Analyses were done in triplicate.
