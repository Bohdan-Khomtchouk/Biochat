TITLE
Trancriptome profiling of rat inner medullary collecting duct

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of gene expressed in the enriched inner medullary collecting duct cells in rat. Keywords: gene expression comparision between cell type

DESIGN
Rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells were isolated from 7 male Sprage-Dawley rats by collagenase and hyaluronidase digestion and follow by low speed centrifugation. The non-IMCD cells were collected by centrifugation of supernatant of enriched IMCD samples. Total RNA about 3 ug were used per microarray (Rat 230 2.0 Genechip array). The experiments were repeat 3 times (3 pairs of IMCD VS non-IMCD)
