TITLE
DNA repair genes: Alternative transcription and gene expression at the exon level in response to the DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA repair is an essential cellular process required to maintain genomic stability. Every cell is subjected to thousands of DNA lesions daily under normal changes in transcription. Transcription is a primary process where protein amount and function can be regulated. One aspect of the transcriptional IR response that little is known about on a whole genome basis is alternative transcription. These investigations focus on the response to IR at the exon level in human cells but also at the whole gene level. Whole genome exon arrays were utilized to comprehensively characterize radiation-induced transcriptional expression products in two human cell types, namely EBV-transformed lymphoblast and primary fibroblast cell lines.

DESIGN
12 human primary fibroblast cell lines and 12 primary lymphoblast cell line samples were used for two doses (0 and 10 Gy) and two time points (0 and 4hr). Additional doses ( 1 Gy, 2 Gy, 5 Gy, and 20 Gy) and time points ( 1hr, 2hr, 8hr, 24hr and 48hr) were assessed in four primary lymphoblast cell lines and four primary fibroblasts.
