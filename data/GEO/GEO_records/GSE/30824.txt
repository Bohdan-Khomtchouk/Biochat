TITLE
Meis1 deficiency effect on thymic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of thymic epithelial cells lacking Meis1 gene using K14-CreERT2 Meis1fl/fl mice. Meis1 is a TALE class homeodomain transcription factor that critically regulates numerous embryonic developmental processes. Results provide insight into the role of Meis1 in the maintenance of postnatal thymic epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Meis1-regulated gene expression in CD45- EpCAM+ mouse thymic epithelial cells was measured at 4 days after the induction of Meis1 deletion.  Two independent experiments (pools of 6 mice; 2 pools per genotype) were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
