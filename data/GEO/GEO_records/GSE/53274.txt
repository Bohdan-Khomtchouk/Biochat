TITLE
Expression data from human femoral artery atherosclerotic lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired samples from human femoral artery lesions were obtained during intravascular surgery exploiting Silverhawk device Microarrays were used to identify genes differentially regulated in human femoral artery atherosclerotic and corresponding restenotic plaques

DESIGN
Human femoral atherosclerotic lesions collected during atherectomy
