TITLE
Primary TNBC tumor in the presence or absence of SHP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The first bona fide PTP proto-oncogene was the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11), an ubiquitously expressed PTP that transduces mitogenic, pro-survival, cell fate and/or pro-migratory signals from numerous growth factor-, cytokine- and extracellular matrix receptors. In malignancies, SHP2 is hyperactivated either downstream of oncoproteins or by mutations.We provide analysis of a primary triple-negative breast tumor grown as xenografts in the presence or absence of SHP2 for 30 days.

DESIGN
A primary triple-negative breast tumor (BT8) was transduced with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector expressing a CTRL miR or SHP2 miR1 or SHP2 miR2. Cells from each group were injected in imuunodeficient mice and after tumor development, the knockdown of SHP2 was induced for 30 days in vivo. At day 30, tumors were dissected and RNA isolated for gene expression analysis.
