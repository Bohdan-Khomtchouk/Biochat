TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SOX2 binding in asynchronous and mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SOX2 is part of the core network of transcription factors regulating embryonic stem cell pluripotency. We found that SOX2 has the ability to remain bound to mitotic chromosomes, in contrast to most transcription factors that are excluded from mitotic chromatin as transcription shuts down. We obtained a highly purified population of mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells and compared the genome-wide binding profile of SOX2 to that in asynchronous cells by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), and show that SOX2 remains bound to a small set of genes during mitosis.

DESIGN
SOX2 ChIP-seq in asynchronous and mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells. The study includes three biological replicates for each of the two conditions, together with one input sample per replicate.
