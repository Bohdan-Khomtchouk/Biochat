TITLE
Next-generation sequencing identifies mRNAs targets that experience significant changes in alternative splicing upon PQBP1 knockdown in mouse embryonic cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PQBP1 is a highly conserved protein closely related to neurodegenerative disorders. We identified PQBP1 as an important alternative splicing effector necessary for maintaining normal neuron functions in the brain. In order to explore PQBP1's functions in alternative splicing regulation and neuronal activities, we systematically profiled the alternative splicing targets of PQBP1 in mouse embryonic cortical neurons by RNA-seq. The mRNAs whose alternative splicing are affected by PQBP1 showed tissue-specific functional enrichment especially in neurite outgrowth, with strong Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments for neuron projection development/morphogenesis, dendrite development and axonogenesis. PQBP1's alternative splicing targets are also functionally enriched in RNA splicing, chromatin modification, and ARF signal transduction.

DESIGN
We applied RNA-seq to compare the transcriptomes of mock and PQBP1 knockdown mouse embryonic cortical neuron samples.
