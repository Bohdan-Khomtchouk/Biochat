TITLE
Expression data from HaCaT cells stimulated by IL-22

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease and the exact pathogenesis has not been fully illuminated yet. It has been demonstrated that interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Our study aimed to explore the role of IL-22 and its target miRNAs in pathogenesis of psoriasis.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in HaCaT cells with IL-22 stimulation were analysed through miRNA and mRNA microarrays. qRT-PCR assay was conducted to validate microarrays results.
