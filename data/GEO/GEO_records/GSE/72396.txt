SUMMARY
Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease and the exact pathogenesis has not been fully illuminated yet. It has been demonstrated that interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Our study aimed to explore the role of IL-22 and its target miRNAs in pathogenesis of psoriasis.
