TITLE
MethlyC-Seq of met18-1(SALK_121963) and met18-2(SALK_147068) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using MethylC-Seq to provide single-base resolution of DNA methylation status in  met18-1 and met18-2 mutants

DESIGN
MethylC-Seq: 2 mutants examined, met18-1 and met18-2, each mutant has two bilogical replicates
