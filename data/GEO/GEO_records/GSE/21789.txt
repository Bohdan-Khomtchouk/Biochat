TITLE
Global gene expression profile of Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HPcpxRpML125 relative to 35000HPcpxRpLS88

ORGANISM
[Haemophilus] ducreyi

SUMMARY
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HPcpxRpML125 which over-expresses CpxR in a CpxR deletion background, was compared to it vector alone counterpart (35000HPcpxRpLS88) in hopes to elucidate members of the CpxRA regulon.

DESIGN
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HPcpxRpML125 and 35000HPcpxRpLS88 were grown in Columbia broth.  After 8 hr of growth, total RNA was isolated and processed for DNA microarray analysis.  This study includes 3 biological replicates (paired samples), two of which were selected for dye swap.
