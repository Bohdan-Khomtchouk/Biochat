TITLE
Protein kinase C is essential for viability of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
A strain of M. oryzae was constructed in which the native PKC1 gene was replaced with an analogue-sensitive PKC1 allele (pkc1AS). This allele could be inhbited by the analogue 1NA-PP1. Global transcriptional profiling of mycelium following selective PKC inhibition identified significant changes in gene expression associated with cell wall re-modelling, autophagy, signal transduction and secondary metabolism.

DESIGN
Mycelium was grown in the presence and absence (control) of the inhibitor 1NA-PP1 for a number of different times up to 24 hours.
