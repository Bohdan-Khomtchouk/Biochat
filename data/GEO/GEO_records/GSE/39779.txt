TITLE
Profiling study of B cells from lymph nodes in miR-146a over-expression transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B cells were isolated from wild type and miR-146a transgenic mice, and analyzed using microarray assay.WT1 and WT2 were samples repeats, so were TG1 and TG2 .

DESIGN
Each probe ID of a mouse transcript was ranked by fold change from up to down-regulated comparing to WT control. Sylamer miRNA seed enrichment analysis was performed with Markov correction as described (Nature Method 2008). WT vs. TG.
