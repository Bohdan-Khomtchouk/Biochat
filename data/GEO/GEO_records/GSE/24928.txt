TITLE
Gene expression change induced by bisphenol A in mouse urogenital sinus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), is a well-known, ubiquitous estrogenic chemical. To investigate the effects of fetal exposure to low-dose BPA on the development of the prostate, we first examined the alterations of in situ sex steroid hormonal environment in the mouse urogenital sinus (UGS). Next, to investigate the BPA-specific gene alterations related to increases of the E2 levels and aromatase activity, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip in the BPA-treated or DES-treated male UGS at embryonic day 17th and postnatal day 1st.

DESIGN
Pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to BPA (20 μg/kg/day) or synthetic estrogen Diethylstilbestrol (DES: 0.2 μg/kg/day), which were dissolved in tocopherol-stripped corn oil, on embryonic day 13 (E13) to E16. Between E17 and postnatal day 1 (P1), all animals were terminated by an overdose of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. Fetuses were collected at E17, E18, P0, and P1. The bladder and urethra were removed and dissected to isolate UGS and collected in RNA later. To isolate pure UGS, other tissues such as the bladder, urethra, Wolffian duct (WD), seminal vesicle (SV), and Mullerian duct (MD) were removed from both the male and female urogenital tracts. The histopathology of the mouse UGS was then examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen mini RNA Easy kit. Each RNAs were linearly amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip.
