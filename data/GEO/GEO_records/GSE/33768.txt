TITLE
S100A8 treatment on gene expression of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies showed that S100A8 and S100A9 are involved in neovascularization as well as in tumor development. At high concentrations, S100A8 and S100A9 cause inflammatory response or apoptosis mediated damage in vascular endothelial cells. But the effect of low concentrations of such proteins on endothelial cells remains unknown. This assay was performed to screen for genes that are involved in the response of Human Unbilican Vascular Endothelial Cells to low concentrations of S100A8.

DESIGN
Human Umblical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were cultuered and treated with 10ug/mL S100A8 proteins for 4 or 24 hours. Gene profiling was carried out using two-color microarray. Two-condition experiment, S100A8 treatment vs. non-treatment. Two time points: 4 hours and 24 hours. Biological replicates at each time point: 3 control replicates, 3 treatment replicates.
