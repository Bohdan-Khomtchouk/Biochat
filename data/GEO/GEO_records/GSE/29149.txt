TITLE
Ath29 congenic mice - gene expression in aorta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A congenic mouse line was constructed by introgressing a C3H chromosome 9 region harboring Ath29 into the C57BL/6 apoE-deficient background.  RNA was extracted from aorta using a QIAGEN kit . Total RNA was pooled in an equal amount from 3 mice for each group. Standard Affymetrix procedures were performed using 8ug of total RNA. Microarrays were used to detect gene expression in the aorta  of Ath29 congenic mice and C57BL/6 apoE-deficient mouse strains fed a chow or western diet.

DESIGN
4 groups of mice were studied: C57BL/6 apoE-/- control mice and Ath29 congenic mice fed a chow or Western diet.  After fed a  Western diet for 2 weeks, aorta was harvested and total RNA prepared.
