TITLE
H. salinarum TrmB dynamics

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Previous work characterized TrmB as a global glucose responsive metabolic transcription factor in archaeal extremophiles. However, it remains unclear how TrmB dynamically regulates its ~100 metabolic enzyme-coding genes. Using a dynamic perturbation approach, we elucidate the topology of the metabolic GRN in Halobacterium salinarum. We assayed gene expression in a wild-type and trmB knockout strain before and immedeatly following glucose perturbation. Clustering dynamic gene expression patterns reveals that TrmB functions alone to regulate central metabolic enzyme-coding genes, but cooperates with various regulators to control peripheral metabolic pathways.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 100 genes was assayed in two strains - a wild-type and a trmB knockout. Two biological replicates of each strain were performed. Gene expression was assayed 240, 60, and 0 minutes prior to glucose addition and 5,10,20,45,90,180,360 minutes after.
