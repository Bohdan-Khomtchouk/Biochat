TITLE
Glycosylation change in mouse CD8 T cells during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Jameson's research focus is on development and regulation of lymphocytes, especially T cells. Recent work has suggested that differential glycosylation effects the sensitivity of the T cell receptors and its coreceptors, suggesting that regulation of glycosylation may be a critical element in controlling T cell development, survival and functional activity.

DESIGN
Determination of how glycosylation enzymes/substrates change in gene expression during development of mouse CD8 T cells. Highly purified pre-selection CD4+8+ thymocytes (using transgenic/knockout mice in our colony) are compared to mature CD8 T cells from the lymph node. The goal is to build on data suggesting that this developmental step involves regulated expression of sialyltransferases (and/or neuraminidases). Highly purified pre-selection CD4+8+ thymocytes (using transgenic/knockout mice in our colony) are compared to mature CD8 T cells from the lymph node. Pre-selection  CD4+8+ (DP) thymocytes were sorted from TCRa-/- thymi.  Post-selection (post-positive selection) DP thymocytes came from an OT-I TCR transgenic mouse.  Naïve (CD44lo) CD8 T cells from  lymph node of OT-I mice were used as naïve CD8 T cells. For activated cells,  naïve OT-I T cells were activated for 48 hours in vitro with cognate antigen (SIINFEKL peptide/Kb) (displayed on cell sized latex beads) in the presence of IL-2 and IL-12.
