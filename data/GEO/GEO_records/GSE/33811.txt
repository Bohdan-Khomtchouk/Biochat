TITLE
Paired whole blood human transcription profiles from children with severe malaria and mild malaria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood transcriptomes from a longitudinal study of  5 Malawian children who first present with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and return in one month with mild malaria We used microarrays to identify transcripts that were associated with each clinical presentation.

DESIGN
A blood sample was taken upon presentation during the severe and mild malaria episodes in 5 Malawian children (total n=5 pairs)  followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array, using a paired analysis
