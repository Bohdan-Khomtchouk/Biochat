TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs have age-dependent diurnal expression that correlates with age-related changes in genome-wide facultative heterochromatin (RNA-Seq data set)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The circadian rhythm controls timed choreography of gene expression to maintain normal cell physiology and metabolism. The predominant regulatory mechanism of the circadian rhythm is a transcriptional negative feedback loop that facilitates, and is facilitated by, circadian-regulated facultative heterochromatin. The long-term consequence of disrupted diurnal rhythm, or mutations in core clock genes, cause accelerated aging and an increased incidence in age-related diseases. To understand chromatin dynamics underlying age-related changes to circadian transcription, we performed a combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq at two diurnal time-points for three different age groups. Our analysis focused on uncovering relationships between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and age-related changes to heterochromatin. We determined that the core clock genes maintain rhythmic expression regardless of age, but circadian output, including numerous lncRNAs, changes dramatically with age. In addition, there is both diurnal and age-related changes in Histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) that correlate with the changes in gene expression. Collectively, the data suggest a model where age-related changes in diurnal gene expression occur, in part, due to age-related redistribution of rhythmic facultative heterochromatin. Alterations in heterochromatin appear to be mediated by changes in diurnal lncRNA expression creating an interlocked circadian-chromatin regulatory network that undergoes age-dependent metamorphosis.
