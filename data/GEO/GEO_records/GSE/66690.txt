TITLE
CGH of stage 13 amplifying follicle cells to measure changes in replication fork progression in DNA damage checkpoint and double-strand break repair mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to compare amplification gradients of stage 13 follicle cells from several DNA damage checkpoint and double-strand break repair mutants to wild-type (OrR) gradients. Two-three replicates were done for each genotype.

DESIGN
Stage 13 egg chamber genomic DNA from each genotype was measured relative to diploid genomic DNA from 0-2 hour wild-type (OrR) embryonic DNA.
