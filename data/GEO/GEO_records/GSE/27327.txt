TITLE
Genome-wide sequencing small RNAs in response to powdery mildew and heat stress in wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
To test whether non-coding RNAs play roles in regulating response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, by using Solexa high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis and experimental approach we cloned the small RNAs and identified 125 putative long npcRNAs from wheat leaves infected by preponderant physiological strain Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici (Egt) or by heat stress treatment. Among long non-coding RNAs, some were precursors of small RNAs such as microRNAs and siRNAs, two long npcRNAs were identified as signal recognition particle (SRP) 7S RNA variants, and three were characterized as U3 snoRNAs. Wheat long npcRNAs showed tissue dependent expression patterns and were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress.

DESIGN
Examination non-coding RNAs of 2 near isogenic lines 8866 (Susceptible) and Pm30 (Resistant) in response to powdery milew and two genotypes CK (insensitive) and TAM107 (insensitive) to heat.  CK and TAM107 represent the same material in different treatments (no heat stress or 1hour after heat stress).
