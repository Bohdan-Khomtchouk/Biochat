TITLE
Developmental heterogeneity of cardiac fibroblasts does not predict pathological proliferation and activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The resulting heat map shows an increased expression of ECM and ECM regulatory genes, 'activated' fibroblast genes, and cell cycle genes in the THY1+HE- sorted cells and in Tie2 and Tbx18-derived cardiac fibroblasts from TAC relative to sham

DESIGN
RNA-seq of Thy1+HE- cells isolated 7 days after injury in mice that underwent sham and transaortic constriction (TAC) operations.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
