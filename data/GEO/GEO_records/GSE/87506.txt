TITLE
Characterization of CAMTA mutant plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 as a wild type and camta1/2/3/sid2-1 as a mutant were compared in their gene expression at the end of day. By comparing the transcriptomes, we showed the presence of SA-independent and CAMTA-dependent pathway at ambient temperature.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in the Arabidopsis grown in soil at warm conditions.
