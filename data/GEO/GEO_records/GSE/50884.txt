TITLE
Expression data from heart tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is an unavoidable event occurring during heart transplantation, leading to graft failures and lower long-term survival rate of the recipient. IR causes apoptosis / death of cardiomyocytes, resulting from up-regulation of apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detect gene expression profile of ischemia reperfusion injured hearts and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down regulated genes during this I/R.
