TITLE
Normal thyrocytes vs papillary vs anaplastic thyroid carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the gene expression of 11 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), 49 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 45 normal thyroids (N)

DESIGN
We hibridized a series of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) onto Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. ATCs were obtained from different hospitals in France and Belgium. Paired RNA samples of PTCs and non-tumoral thyroid tissues were obtained from Ukraine via the Chernobyl Tissue Bank (www.chernobyltissuebank.com). Diagnoses were confirmed by the members of the International Pathology Panel of the Chernobyl Tissue Bank.
