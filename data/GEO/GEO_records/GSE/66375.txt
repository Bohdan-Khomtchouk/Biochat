TITLE
Long-term effects of low doses of γ-irradiation on hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) irradiated at 0Gy, 0.02Gy, 0.1Gy and 0.5Gy six months after transplantation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying multiple aspects of LT-HSCs premature ageing after low doses of γ-irradiation (0.02Gy).

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed and correlated with the control group (0Gy).
