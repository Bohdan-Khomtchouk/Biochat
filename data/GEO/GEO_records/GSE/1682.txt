TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of human glioma (Hs 683) cell lines exposed to candoxin

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from candoxin-treated (n = 3 flasks of each time points - 12hrs, 24hrs and 48hrs) and untreated control (n = 3) cells using RNeasy® mini kit.The preparation and processing of labeled, fragmented cRNA for oligonucleotide mcroarray hybridization has been performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols described in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
