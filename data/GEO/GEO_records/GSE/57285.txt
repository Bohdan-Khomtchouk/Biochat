TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of whole blood DNA samples from BRCA1 wild-types without breast cancer and BRCA1 mutants with and without breast cancer (Prague Set 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in whole blood DNA samples from 84 women (42 BRCA1 wild-type and healthy, 7 BRCA1 mutants and healthy, 35 BRCA1 mutants with breast cancer)

DESIGN
whole blood DNA from women, with and without breast cancer, and with or without BRCA1 mutation Bisulphite converted DNA from the whole blood samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2 The BRCA1 mutation status represent 0=healthy-brca1wt, 1=healthy-brca1mt, 2=breastcancer-brca1mt.
