TITLE
Brucella melitensis global gene expression

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis

SUMMARY
In this study we report that B. melitensis at the late logarithmic phase of growth are more invasive for HeLa cells than at mid logarithmic or stationary growth phases. Microarray analysis of B. melitensis gene expression identified 414 up- and 40 down-regulated genes in late-log growth phase compared to the stationary growth phase. The vast majority of the up-regulated genes in late-log cultures were those associated with DNA replication, transcription and translation, intermediate metabolism, energy production and conversion, membrane transport and cell envelope, biogenesis and outer membrane, while the down-regulated genes were distributed among several functional categories. This first Brucella global gene expression study provides novel information on growth phase-specific gene regulation important not only for understanding Brucella physiology but also the initial molecular interactions between Brucella and its host. Keywords: Comparison bacterial growth phase normalized to genomic DNA

DESIGN
There are two kind of samples consisting of RNA isolated from Brucella melitensis grown logarithmically or at stationary phase.  There are four biological replicates of each sample.  Every Brucella melitensis open reading frame was printed in triplicate on each microarray, thereby providing three technical replicates for each biological replicates.  Each replicate was normalized against labeled Brucella melitensis genomic DNA.
