TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of normal prostate tissue and prostate adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained from prostate adenocarcinoma samples (20) and corresponding cancer-unrelated normal prostate tissue (28) using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Approximately 485000 CpG sites were measured in every sample.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
