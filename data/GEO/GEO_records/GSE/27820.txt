TITLE
Expression data from active human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (active HUMSC) and inactive human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (inactive HUMSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Active HUMSC with distinct binding rate to MDA MB-231 breast cancer cells, distinct ability in suppressing tumorigenesis,distinct cell in cell features and distinct features under TEM then inactive HUMSC We used microarrays to detail the difference gene expression between active HUMSC and inactive HUMSC

DESIGN
HUMSC with high MDA MB-231 breast cancer cells suppression rate was selective as active HUMSC and HUMSC with low MDA MB-231 breast cancer cells suppression rate was selective as inactive HUMSC

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
