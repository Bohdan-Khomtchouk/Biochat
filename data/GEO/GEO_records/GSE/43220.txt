TITLE
Functional genomic and phenotypic responses to desiccation in natural populations of a desert drosophilid.

ORGANISM
Drosophila mojavensis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome transcription expression level changes in Drosophila mojavensis wild-type populations (1. Punta Onah:PO; 2. Organ Pipe National Manument:OPNM; 3. Punta Prieta:PP; & 4. San Quintin:SQ). The experiment was designed to investigate effects of desiccation exposure (0, 9 & 18 hr) and host plant (diet) on transcriptome.

DESIGN
A total of  95 hybridizations were performed in this entire experiment. We used 135K 12-plex NimbleGen arrays. Total RNA was recovered from each sample listed below. The experimental design consisted a total of four populations (1. Punta Onah:PO; 2. Organ Pipe National Manument:OPNM; 3. Punta Prieta:PP; & 4. San Quintin:SQ),  two host diets (Agria and Organ pipe) and three desiccation treatments (0, 9 and 18 hours). Each chip measures the expression level of 15528 transcripts. Four to 5 replicates were used for each type (R-1, R-2, R-3 etc.)
