TITLE
Mouse Liver tumor SRC-2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied the effects of loss of SRC-2 in MYC driven mouse liver tumorigenesis

DESIGN
Src-2+/-; LAPtTA females were bred with Src-2+/-; tet-o-MYC males to obtain tet-o-MYC; LAPtTA mice with SRC-2 WT or homozygous null alleles. Doxycycline was withdrawn at 6 weeks of age to induce MYC and animals were dissected at 15 weeks of age. RNA was isolated from liver tumors of 5 SRC-2 WT and 5 SRC-2 -/- animals and processed for RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes between the two groups.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
