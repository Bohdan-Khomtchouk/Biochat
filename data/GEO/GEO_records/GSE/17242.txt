TITLE
RIMD 2210633 wild type versus vtrA or vtrB mutants

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus

SUMMARY
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative marine bacterium. A limited population of the organisms causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. Vibrio parahaemolyticus wild type strain RIMD 2210633 compared with the mutants of VtrA and VtrB have a winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif that genes encoded on pathogenicity island loci, at OD600=1.0 in Luria-Bertani containing medium 0.5 % NaCl at 37ËšC. Our goal is to determine the VtrA or VtrB regulon.

DESIGN
Cohybridized wild type versus vtrA or vtrB mutants on a single array. Biological replicates: three of wild type, three of vtrA mutants and three of vtrB mutants were independently grown and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL6058 Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 5k microarray
