TITLE
Transcriptome change caused by lowered intracellular S-adenosylmethionine level in the X63/0 mouse plasma cell line.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to examine the gene expression changes responding to a depletion of intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The mouse plasma cell line X63/0 was treated with the SAM-synthetase inhibitor cycloleucine (cLEU), and the total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA-sequencing. As a result, we idntified 27 genes, including the ubiquitous SAM-synthetase MAT2A, whose expssions were up-regulated by two-fold or more.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the mouse plasma cell line X63/0 before/after a three-hour treatment with 30 mM cycloleucine. This experiment was triplicated, and the resulting six samples were applied to RNA-sequencing.
