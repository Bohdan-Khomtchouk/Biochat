TITLE
E.coli DH5alpha cells: reuterin-treated vs. untreated control cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli DH5[alpha]

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E. coli DH5alpha cells comparing control untreated cells with cells exposed to sublethal concentrations of reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, reuterin-treated vs. untreated control E. coli DH5alpha cells. 5 biological replicate sets of reuterin-treated vs. untreated cells which were independently grown and harvested. Each array is probed with 1 replicate set.

PLATFORM
GPL7445 MSU E. coli 6.1.K Ver. 1.0.2
