TITLE
Sugar-dependent gene expression in xylose grown A. thaliana cell suspension culture

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Sugars modulate expression of hundreds of genes in plants. Previous studies on sugar signaling, using intact plants or plant tissues, were hampered by tissue heterogeneity, uneven sugar transport and/or inter-conversions of the applied sugars.  This, in turn, could obscure the identity of a specific sugar that acts as a signal affecting expression of given gene in a given tissue or cell-type. To bypass those biases, we have developed a novel biological system, based on stem-cell-like Arabidopsis suspension culture. The cells were grown in a hormone-free medium and were sustained on xylose as the only carbon source.  The functional genomics approach was used to identify sugar responsive genes, which rapidly (within 1 h) respond specifically to low concentration (1 mM) of glucose, fructose and/or sucrose.

DESIGN
A habituated A. thaliana cell culture grown in a hormone free full strength MS media in the dark was adapted to growth on xylose as the only carbon source in the media.The cells were subjected to a 1 hour treatment with 1 mM of either Fru, Glc, Suc or Xyl (control). The experiments were carried out in 3 biological repeats per treatment. Whole genome expression analysis was conducted by hybridization of the extracted RNA to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array.
