TITLE
miR-191 regulates human cell proliferation and directly targets multiple oncogenes [seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We constructed a genome wide target profile of hsa-miR-191 by sequencing RNA isolated from Ago2 immunoprecipitations and total RNA samples following miR-191 transfection

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in HeLa cells and Ago2 immunoprecipitations from HeLa cells following miR-191 mature duplex or control siRNA transfection

PLATFORM
