TITLE
Enhancer landscape of mouse developing forebrain at 11.5 dpc embryos [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the distribution of histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac within the genome of mouse embryonic forebrain. We prepared the chromatin from 11 dpc embryonic forebrain and made chromatin precipitation with antibody against H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (rabbit polyclonal antibody). High-throughput sequencing applied for the ChIP analysis revealed the differential distribution of modified histone within developing forebrain.

DESIGN
ChIP analysis of mouse 11 dpc embryonic forebrain against anti-H3K4me1 and H3K27ac antibody. Forebrain isolated and disected from 11 dpc embryos are fixed by 1% formaldehyde. After conventional ChIP reaction, ChIP library for highthroughput sequence is prepared by NEBNext ChIP-seq library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina.

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
