TITLE
Absence of host innate immune responses in SARS-CoV-infected ferrets upon subsequent challenge

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathogenesis and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of potential drugs and vaccines it is necessary to use an animal model that is highly representative of the human condition in terms of respiratory anatomy, physiology and clinical sequelae.  The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, supports SARS-CoV replication and displays many of the symptoms and pathological features seen in SARS-CoV-infected humans.  We have recently established a SARS-CoV infection-challenge ferret platform for use in evaluating potential therapeutics to treat SARS.  The main objective of the current study was to extend our previous results and identify early host immune responses upon infection and determine immune correlates of protection upon challenge with SARS-CoV in ferrets. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
This study is a simple time course (58 day) examination of host responses in 35 SARS-CoV (TOR2) infected ferrets with the addition of a challenge inoculation of SARS CoV (TOR2) at day 29 post infection.  Three mock-infected ferrets are included as negative controls.    Due to the unavailability of ferret microarrays, Affymetrix Canine 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays were chosen following sequence analysis of our ferret cDNA library (~5000 clones) and demonstration of high levels of homology ( > 80%) between dog and ferret.
