TITLE
Absence of host innate immune responses in SARS-CoV-infected ferrets upon subsequent challenge

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathogenesis and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of potential drugs and vaccines it is necessary to use an animal model that is highly representative of the human condition in terms of respiratory anatomy, physiology and clinical sequelae.  The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, supports SARS-CoV replication and displays many of the symptoms and pathological features seen in SARS-CoV-infected humans.  We have recently established a SARS-CoV infection-challenge ferret platform for use in evaluating potential therapeutics to treat SARS.  The main objective of the current study was to extend our previous results and identify early host immune responses upon infection and determine immune correlates of protection upon challenge with SARS-CoV in ferrets.
