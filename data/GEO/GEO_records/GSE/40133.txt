TITLE
The Methylomes of Six Bacteria

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni ; Bacillus cereus ; Geobacter metallireducens ; Chromohalobacter salexigens ; Vibrio breoganii

SUMMARY
Six bacterial genomes, Geobacter metallireducens GS-15, Chromohalobacter salexigens, Vibrio breoganii 1C-10, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176 and Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168, all of which had previously been sequenced using other platforms were re-sequenced using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing specifically to analyze their methylomes.   In every case a number of new N6-methyladenine (m6A) and N4-methylcytosine (m4C) methylation patterns were discovered and the DNA methyltransferases (MTases) responsible for those methylation patterns were assigned.   In 15 cases it was possible to match MTase genes with MTase recognition sequences without further sub-cloning.  Two Type I restriction systems required sub-cloning to differentiate their recognition sequences, while four MTases genes that were not expressed in the native organism were sub-cloned to test for viability and recognition sequences.  No attempt was made to detect 5-methylcytosine (m5C) recognition motifs from the SMRT sequencing data because this modification produces weaker signals using current methods.   However, all predicted m6A and m4C MTases were detected unambiguously.   This study shows that the addition of SMRT sequencing to traditional sequencing approaches gives a wealth of useful functional information about a genome showing not only which MTase genes are active, but also revealing their recognition sequences.

DESIGN
