TITLE
Expression profiling of sox11-expressing glioma-initiating cell-like cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify factors involved in tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells (GICs), we compared gene expression in GIC-like cells with and without sox11 expression.

DESIGN
We established sox11-expressing mouse glioma-initiating cell (GIC)-like cell line (NSCL61s), NSCL61s-sox11, which lost tumorigenicity when transplanted in vivo. We think that genes, which are differently expressed between NSCL61s and NSCL61s-sox11, would be new targets for glioma therapy.
