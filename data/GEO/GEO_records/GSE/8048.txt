TITLE
Gene Expression of a Hybrid Rice Strain(LYP9) and Its Parental Cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Based our serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data from an elite Chinese super-hybrid rice (LYP9) and its parental cultivars (93-11 and PA64s) in three major tissue types at three different developmental stages, we obtained a much more comprehensive view of genes that related to rice heterosis and analyzed the potential effects of gene-expression difference on the heterosis of rice.These heterotic expression genes among different genotypes provided new avenues for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis, including variable gene expression patterns. Keywords: Heterosis study by SAGE

DESIGN
We constructed nine SAGE libraries parallelly, including root at the first tillering stage, leaf at the milky stage of rice grain maturation, and panicle at the pollen-maturing stage of hybrid rice (LYP9) and its paternal lines (9311, PA64s).
