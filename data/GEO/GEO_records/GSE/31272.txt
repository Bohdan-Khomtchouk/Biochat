TITLE
NF-kB activation confers a prolonged event-free-survival in newly diagnosed myeloma patients harboring t(4;14) treated with bortezomib.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NF-kB pathway activation is the hallmark of hematological malignancies. In multiple myeloma (MM), a large variety of genomic alterations leading to either inactivation of repressor such as TRAF3, CYLD or cIAP1/2 or amplification of activators such as CD40 or NIK collectively contribute to frequently deregulate NF-kB signaling. In order to evaluate the prognostic impact of NF-kB mutations in MM, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a panel of newly diagnosed patients with cIAP1/2 biallelic deletion. We found that all patients have dysregulated NF-kB pathway and the majority of them presented t(4;14). Then we analyzed clinical outcome of 37 MM at presentation with t(4;14) and treated with bortezomib according to their NF-kB status. We showed that increase of NF-kB activity confers prolonged event-free survival. Altogether, our data suggest that NF-kB activation resulting from NF-kB mutations (ie cIAP1/2 deletion) or other mechanisms improves outcome of t(4;14)-positive MM treated with bortezomib.
