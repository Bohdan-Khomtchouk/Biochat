TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Wwox targeted ablation in mouse mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The WWOX gene has been implicated in human cancers, including breast cancer.The development and tumorigenesis between human and mouse mammary glands (MGs) share similar molecular details and signal transduction pathways. We established mouse line that specifically knockout the expression of WWOX gene in the MG epithelial cells (MECs) by crossing BK5-cre mice with our WWOX flox stain. In order to study the gene expression profile in the subpopulation MECs, we isolated the organoids from the 4th MGs of both BK5-cre +; WWOX flox/flox (KO) mice and their WT counterparts (BK5-cre -; WWOX flox/flox), 3 mice each genotype. The total RNA from the mouse MG organoids was extracted and purified by TRIzol/RNeasy Kit and their integrity was checked on Agilent RNA 6000 Nanochip. The goal is to identify the significant perturbation in tumorigenic pathways in these cells induced by WWOX ablation.

DESIGN
Mammary gland epithelial organoids samples and gene expression profiles were deribed from three WWOX-KO mice (BK5-cre +; WWOX flox/flox) and from three WWOX-WT mice (BK5-cre -; WWOX flox/flox)
