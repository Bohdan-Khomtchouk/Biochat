TITLE
Endothelial NOTCH1 is suppressed by circulating lipids and antagonizes inflammation during atherosclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While much progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms that trigger endothelial activation and inflammatory cell recruitment during atherosclerosis, less is known about the intrinsic pathways that counteract these events. Here we identified NOTCH1 as an antagonist of endothelial cell activation. NOTCH1 was constitutively expressed by adult arterial endothelium, but levels were significantly reduced by high fat diet. Furthermore, treatment of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) with inflammatory lipids (Ox-PAPC) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IL1beta) decreased Notch1 expression and signaling in vitro through a mechanism that requires STAT3 activation. Reduction of NOTCH1 in HAEC by siRNA, in the absence of inflammatory lipids or cytokines, increased inflammatory molecules and binding of monocytes. Conversely, some of the effects mediated by Ox-PAPC were reversed by increased NOTCH1 signaling; suggesting a link between lipid-mediated inflammation and Notch1. Interestingly, reduction of NOTCH1 by Ox-PAPC in HAEC was associated with a genetic variant previously correlated to HDL in a human GWAS. Finally endothelial Notch1 heterozygous mice showed higher diet-induced atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, we propose that reduction of endothelial NOTCH1 is a predisposing factor in the onset of vascular inflammation and initiation of atherosclerosis.

DESIGN
Transcript profile from Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAEC) transfected with siRNA targeting NOTCH1 (n=3) or treated with Ox-PAPC (Oxidized 1-Palmitoyl-2-Arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCholine) for 6 hours (n=3) were compared to control HAEC (transfected with control siRNA and control media; n=3).
