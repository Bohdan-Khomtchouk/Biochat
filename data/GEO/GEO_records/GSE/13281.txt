TITLE
Expression profiles of  beta-hematin (BH)- or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-treated RAW 264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hemozoin phagocytosis results in immunomodulation. In the present study, gene expression profiles were analyzed to identify transcriptional changes associated with two of the individual components of Hz in a model macrophage cell line. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to the synthetic form of Hz, β-hematin (BH, 0.1 mg/mL) and HNE (35 μM) for 6 or 24 h. Keywords: variable treatment

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were analyzed for each 3 treatment types (HNE, BH, bead) in LPS stimulated cells in addition to 3 replicates of untreated LPS stimulated cells (control). Each replicate was composed of 6 pooled wells from a 6-well plate. In order to identify transcriptional changes dependent on interactions of BH rather than those due to phagocytosis, differentially expressed mRNAs were controlled by a corresponding particulate latex bead challenge.
