TITLE
Expression profiles of  beta-hematin (BH)- or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-treated RAW 264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hemozoin phagocytosis results in immunomodulation. In the present study, gene expression profiles were analyzed to identify transcriptional changes associated with two of the individual components of Hz in a model macrophage cell line. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to the synthetic form of Hz, β-hematin (BH, 0.1 mg/mL) and HNE (35 μM) for 6 or 24 h. Keywords: variable treatment
