TITLE
Humanized PRDM9 Mouse Testis H3K4me3 and DMC1 ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report testis H3K4me3 and DMC1 enrichment at DSB hotspots in various mice to examine differences between infertile hybrid mice and mice that have been humanized at PRDM9, which have rescued fertility. We find that infertile mice have an excess of " asymmetric " DSB hotspots, where both H3K4me3 and DMC1 reads tend to originate from only one homologue. At these hotspots, we see an excess of DMC1 relative to H3K4me3, consistent with delayed DSB repair at these sites. See Davies et al. Nature 2016 for a complete summary.

DESIGN
Examination of adult testis H3K4me3 and DMC1 enrichment in different mice. This Series contains a re-analysis of Sample GSM869781 submitted by another user. The dmc1hotspots_B6.PRDM9bb* processed data files are linked as supplementary files at the foot of this Series record.
