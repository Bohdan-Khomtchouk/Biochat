TITLE
Analysis of embryonic day E14.5 and E16.5 mouse ureters from Tshz3LacZ/LacZ mutants and wild types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the urinary tract, smooth muscle (SM) is present in the renal pelvis, the ureter, the bladder and the urethra and plays a crucial role in the functional and structural integrity of these organs. In Tshz3 mutant ureters the myogenic program is not activated in the proximal region due to the absence of expression of myocardin (Myocd), a key regulator of SM differentiation. We set out to characterize TSHZ3-dependent mechanisms that participate to the process of ureteric smooth muscle cells (SMC) differentiation. To this aim, we used microarrays to identify distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in Tshz3LAcZ/LacZ mutant ureters at two different time points; at E14.5, which corresponds to the onset of the myogenic program and at E16.5, when SMC express the full repertoire of differentiation marker genes.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic (E14.5 and E16.5) wild type and Tshz3LacZ/LacZ mutant ureters were dissected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
