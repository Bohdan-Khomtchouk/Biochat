TITLE
Developing endosperm: Nipponbare vs NIL(TGW6)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Gene expression profoling of developping endosperm at 3 and 6 days after flowering (DAH): Nipponbare vs NIL(TGW6)

DESIGN
We used two rice varieties, NIL(TGW6) and Nipponbare.NIL(TGW6) is a nearly isogenic line containing the thousand grain weight qTGW6. For samples used three stages: 3 and 6 DAH endosperm in both Nipponbare and NIL(TGW6). Two dye swapped experiments were performed.
