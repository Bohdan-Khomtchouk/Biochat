TITLE
Genome-wide location map of Polycomb in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with human promoter microarrays to idnetify SUZ12 and H3K27me3-occupied gene promoters in prostate cancer cells and tissues. We observed a common set of SUZ12 and H3K27me3-occupied genes in LNCaP cells, and metastatic prostate cancer tissues across individuals as well as tissue types of the metastatic sites. We also found significant overlap of cancer polycomb targets with previously published embryonic stem cell polycomb targets. In addition, a strong association between cancer polycomb targets with prostate cancer outcome was observed. We developed a cancer Polycomb Repression Signature, comprised direct targets of PRC2 silencing in cancer, that is predictive of cancer outcome in multiple expression profling datasets of tumors. Keywords: protein-DNA interaction
