SUMMARY
New alkyl-phospholipids (APLs) that are structurally derived from the platelet-activating factor are promising candidates for anticancer treatment. After the incorporation into cell membranes, APLs are able to interfere with a wide variety of key enzymes implicated in cell growth, motility, invasion and apoptosis.   Recently, using Agilent cDNA microarray technology, we could demonstrate that the glycosidated APL Ino-C2-PAF inhibited the expression of several genes associated with immune response and inflammation in immortalized keratinocytes HaCaT. Here, we analyzed the impact of Ino-C2-PAF on the gene expression profile of HaCaT cells treated with several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-17, IL-22, TNF-α and oncostatin-M).

DESIGN
The influence of Ino-C2-PAF on the transcriptional profile of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) was analyzed treating HaCaT cells with 5 µM Ino-C2-PAF in the presence of a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-17, IL-22, TNF-α and oncostatin-M) for 24 h. Control cells were left untreated. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition, except for control cells where only two experiments were performed. Control cells were mainly necessary to demonstrate the efficiency of this in vitro inflammation model for keratinocytes.
