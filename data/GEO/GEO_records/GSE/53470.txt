TITLE
ERK signaling regulates opposing functions of JUN family transcription factors in prostate cancer cell migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdowns of c-JUN and JUND had opposite effects on PC3 prostate cell migration. We predicted that c-JUN and JUND control the same set of cell migration genes, but in opposite directions. To test this hypothesis, mRNA with expression changes in c-JUN and JUND knockdown PC3 cell lines were compared to mRNA levels in control (luciferase knockdown) PC3 cells by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of luciferase knockdown (WT),  c-Jun knockdown, and Jun-D knockdown in PC3 cells were generated using deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq. Knockdowns were stable shRNA expression from a lentiviral construct selected with puromycin.

PLATFORM
