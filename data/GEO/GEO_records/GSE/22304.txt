TITLE
Expression data in response to abiotic stresses in tomato at flowering stage

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
A comparative study ware made to know the abiotic stress tolerance machanism between tolerant and susceptible plants at flowering stage. The tolerance in response to abiotic stresses are sum of expression of thousands of genes at a particular stage.

DESIGN
Tomato plants were exposed to drought and heat stress for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To study the molecular mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance to increase the tolerance in tomato plants, transcripts of tolerant and susceptible plants at flowering stage were compared in response to heat and water stress.
