ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of basal gene expression in patient-derived xenograft cells. A panel of pediatric T-, B- and MLL-ALL xenografts was utilized to further understand the biology of leukemia

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from patient-derived xenograft cells. Array analysis was carried out on Illumina beadchip HT12

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
