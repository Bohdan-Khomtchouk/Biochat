TITLE
Effects of dual agonist of GLP1 and GCGR on animal model of NAS (MCD diet) and hepatic regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The genomic analysis of liver from mice fed with standard or methyl and choline deficient (MCD) diet and treated with dual agonist of GLP1R/GCGR during two weeks before 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) and after 2 weeks PH resulted in a set of genes regulated by diet and other set regulated differentially by treatment in MCD treated animals. These genes are apparently responsible for the reversion and prevention of NAS and improvement in hepatic regeneration induced by drug treatment

DESIGN
All microarray analyses were performed with RNA samples obtained from four independent liver from animals with different diet and drug treatmens.
