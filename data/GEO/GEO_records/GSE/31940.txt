TITLE
White adipose tissue from aP2-Pex5 knockout and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These arrays contain data from gonodal adipose tissue of aP2-Pex5 -/- male mice

DESIGN
4 arrays from gonadal adipose tissue from control mice (Swiss background) are compared with 4 arrays from gonadal adipose tissue of aP2-Pex5 knockout mice. The latter lack functional peroxisomes in adipose tissue.
