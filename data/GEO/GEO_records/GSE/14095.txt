TITLE
Gene expression signature and the prediction of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer by DNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 189 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Comparison between the sample groups allow to identify a set of discriminating genes that can be used for molecular markers for predicting liver metastasis. Keywords: repeat
