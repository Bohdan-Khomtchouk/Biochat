TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cell lines stably expressing shRNA targeting ctrl  or UHRF1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to explore  the expression profile from cells expressing wild type and UHRF1 S674A mutant. HeLa cells expressing UHRF1 WT and S674A mutant showed similar gene expression pattern without significant affecting the  transcription of DNA repari genes.

DESIGN
UHRF1 was depleted in HeLa cells by shRNA treatment. Total RNA was purified and used to determine the global gene transcription profiles by microarray assays. The UHRF1-related genes expression profiles were compared among control cells, UHRF1-depleted cells, UHRF1 WT reconstituting cells and UHRF1 S674A mutant reconstituting cells.
