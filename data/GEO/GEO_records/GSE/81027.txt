TITLE
Brg1 enables rapid growth of the early embryo by suppressing genes that regulate apoptosis and cell growth arrest

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis revealed that genes up regulated in Rosa26CreERTM; Brg1floxed/floxed embryos (Rosa26CreERTM; Brg1floxed/floxed hereafter referred as Brg1d/d that is designated for deleted Brg1floxed/floxed alleles in embryos) negatively regulate cell cycle progression, and cell growth.

DESIGN
RNA from Brg1floxed/floxed (wild type control) Day 8.5 embryos (three biological replications) and RNA from Brg1d/d (Brg1 CKO: conditional knockout) Day 8.5 embryos (three biological replications) were used for global gene expression analysis.
