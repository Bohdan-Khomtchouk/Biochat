TITLE
Gene expression profiles of TiPS generated in a defined condition, ES and T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to show the similarity among TiPS cells generated in a difined condition and ES cells and the differenced between TiPS cells and T cells.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated TiPS cells,ES cells and stimulated T cells were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
