TITLE
ChIP-seq investigation of H-NS of Escherichia coli grown in the presence and absence of an antibiotic " Bicyclomycin " , a potential inhibitior of transcription termination factor rho.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We report that inhibition of rho by treatment with bicyclomycin, a potential inhibitor of rho affects H-NS binding to chromosome across most of the binding sites. For the current study, we have flag tagged H-NS by homologous recomination method. Cells were grown in the presence and absence of antibiotic bicylomyin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed and anti flag antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated samples both from BCM- and BCM + conditions were sequenced using HiSeq 1000 model.  Input DNA was used as control for this experiment which was also sequenced. The 50-mer reads obtained were then mapped to Escherichia coli Mg1655 K-12 genome. Further analysis was carried out to calculate the ChIP signal score. We observed a drop in ChIP signal for bcm+ condition as compared to bcm-.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data generated by Hiseq 1000 model of samples with bcm+ and bcm- in biological duplicates along with Input DNA as control

PLATFORM
GPL15982 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655)
