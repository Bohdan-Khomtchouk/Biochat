TITLE
Analysis of gene expression with the Hmga2 allelic series.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we introduced a series of expression constructs into a mouse lung cancer cell line (482N1): (1) a control short hairpin RNA (shluc) plus the empty expression vector (empty); (2) an shRNA targeting Hmga2 (shHmga2) plus empty; (3) shHmga2 plus an expression vector for the full-length Hmga2 cDNA with the shRNA site mutated (shHmga2 wt); (4) shHmga2 plus the full-length shRNA-mutated Hmga2 with let-7 sites in the 3' UTR mutated (shHmga2 m7); (5) shHmga2 plus the full-length shRNA-mutated Hmga2 with the start codon mutated (shHmga2 ATG wt); and (6) shHmga2 plus the full-length shRNA-mutated Hmga2 with the start codon and let-7 sites mutated (shHmga2 ATG m7).

DESIGN
Cells were plated in triplicate, RNA was prepared using RNA-Bee as per manufacturers' instructions and RNA-seq studies were performed using standard methods. For further details on library construction and next-generation sequencing, please contact the contributor.
