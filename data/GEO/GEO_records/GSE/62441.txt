TITLE
Profiling of exome mutations associated with progression of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the mutations and gene expressions of early and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related with Hepatitis B-viral infection. Integrative analysis was performed with whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiles of the 12 cases of early and advanced HCCs and paired non-tumoral adjacent liver tissues.
