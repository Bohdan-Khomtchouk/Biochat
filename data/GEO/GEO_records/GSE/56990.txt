TITLE
DamID (LmnB1/Dam) Log2 ratios of C57Bl/6 fibroblasts and RAG2-/- pro-B cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of DamID profiles and LAD patterning across cell types reveals regions of variable LADs

DESIGN
LmnB1 interactions at the nuclear periphery of C57Bl/6 pro-B cells and fibroblasts were identified by DamID in duplicate for both pro-B and fibroblasts (4 samples total). For each sample, Dam-LmnB1/Dam-only Log2 ratios of chromosomes 11 and 12 were calculated, lifted over to mm9, duplicates were normalized and averaged together.
