TITLE
Regulation of Energy Metabolism and Mitochondrial Biogenesis Independently from the SIRT1-PGC1a Pathway in Human Skeletal Muscle during Lipid Overfeeding

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The adaptive mechanisms in response to excess energy supply are still poorly known in humans. Our aims were to define metabolic responses and changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle of healthy volunteers during fat overfeeding.

DESIGN
Healthy lean and overweight subjects were submitted to a high fat diet during 56 days. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken at Day 0 and Day 56.
