TITLE
TFIIH mutants treated with methyl methanesulfonate

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Purpose of profiling experiment was to examine effects of a mutation of a subunit of TFIIH, ssl1p, which has ubiquitin ligase activity. The whole complex has previously been shown to have both kinase and helicase activities.  We wanted to see if 1) there were general transcriptional defects with these mutations, as there are with other mutations to kinase activity, and 2) if there were transcriptional effects on DNA repair machinery when the mutants were treated with MMS, which is an alkylating agent.
