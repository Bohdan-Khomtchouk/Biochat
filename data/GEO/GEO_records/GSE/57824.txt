TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs profiles in mouse liver development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many protein-coding oncofetal genes are highly expressed in murine and human fetal liver and silenced in adult liver. The protein products of these hepatic oncofetal genes have been used as clinical markers for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and as therapeutic targets for HCC. Herein, we examined the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs found in fetal and adult liver in mice.LncRNA-mPvt1 is an oncofetal RNA that was found to promote cell proliferation, cell cycling and the expression of stem cell-like properties of murine cells. Human lncRNA-hPVT1 promotes cell proliferation, cell cycling and the acquisition of stem cell-like properties in HCC cells by stabilizing NOP2 protein. Regulation of the lncRNA-hPVT1/NOP2 pathway may have beneficial effects in the treatment of HCC.

DESIGN
We collected mouse fetal livers (E12.5, E14.5, E17.5 days), neonatal murine livers and adult murine livers (8 weeks). The total RNAs recovered from these developmental livers and were used to acquire different expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs.
