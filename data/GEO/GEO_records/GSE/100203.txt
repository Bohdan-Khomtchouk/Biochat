TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of the LEW versus BN rat, with or without T. gondii infection, in order to unravel molecular factors directing the robust and rapid early T. gondii-killing mechanisms in the LEW rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Compared to the uninfected BN rat, the uninfected LEW rat has inherently higher transcript levels of cytochrome enzymes [Cyp2d3, Cyp2d5 and Cybrd1 that catalyze generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)], with concomitant higher levels of ROS.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from fresh peritoneal cells of rats with or without T. gondii infection.
