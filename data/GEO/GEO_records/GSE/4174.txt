TITLE
Effect of Sleep Deprivation on the Whole Brain of Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the dynamic molecular processes that are altered during prolonged wakefulness and during sleep. We performed an RNA expression profiling study examining temporal changes in the brain of Drosophila in relationship to the duration of prior sleep or wakefulness.  Our experimental design allowed us to determine whether genes identified as differentially regulated between sleep and wakefulness were up- or down-regulated in these states. Because stimulation of the experimental animal during the normal sleep period is used to prolong wakefulness in most experimental paradigms, the interpretation of the effects of prolonged wakefulness is confounded by the effect of the perturbation stimulus itself on the animal’s biology.  We controlled for this effect in our experimental paradigm by examining gene expression changes in response to identical stimulation but during the animal’s normal wakefulness. The design of our study also allowed us to control for circadian variation in gene expression, since we compared sleeping and sleep deprived flies at the same diurnal time. Keywords: sleep deprivation, time course, stress response
