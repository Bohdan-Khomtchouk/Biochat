SUMMARY
PURPOSE: To evaluate frequency, biological features and clinical relevance of RUNX1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 945 patients (18 to 60 years) were analyzed for RUNX1 mutations. In a subset of cases (n=269) microarray gene expression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine RUNX1 mutations were identified in 53 of 945 (5.6%) cases, predominantly in exons 3 (n=11), 4 (n=10) and 8 (n=23). RUNX1 mutations clustered in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic group (46/640, 7.2%; cytogenetically normal, 34/538, 6.3%), they were less frequent in adverse-risk cytogenetics (5/109, 4.6%), and absent in core-binding-factor AML (0/77) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (0/61); RUNX1 mutations were associated with MLL-partial tandem duplications (p=0.0007) and IDH1/IDH2 mutations (p=0.03), inversely correlated with NPM1 (p < 0.0001) and in trend with CEBPA (p=0.10) mutations. RUNX1 mutations were characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern; this RUNX1 mutation-derived signature was not exclusive for the mutation, but also included mostly adverse-risk AML [eg, 7q-, -7, inv(3) or t(3;3)]. RUNX1 mutations predicted for resistance to chemotherapy (rates of refractory disease 30% and 19%, p=0.047, for RUNX1-mutated and wildtype patients, respectively), as well as inferior event-free survival (EFS; p < 0.0001), relapse-free survival (RFS, p=0.022), and overall survival (p=0.051). In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations were an independent prognostic marker for shorter EFS (p=0.007). Explorative subgroup analysis revealed that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a favorable impact on RFS in RUNX1-mutated patients (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: AML with RUNX1 mutations exhibit distinct biological properties and are associated with resistance to therapy and inferior outcome.

DESIGN
A total of 269 RNA samples derived from adult AML patients were provided by the German Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) [AMLSG trial AML HD98A (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00146120)]. Conventional cytogenetic banding, and FLT3, CEBPA and NPM1 mutational analysis were performed as previously described (Schlenk et al., N Engl J Med 2008). Detailed clinical, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic information are also provided in the supplementary information. Following enrichment, all samples contained at least 80% leukemic cells. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed as previously described (Bullinger et al., N Engl J Med 2004).
