TITLE
Insights into carcinogenic mechanisms of colorectal carcinoma lacking β-catenin/TCF regulated transcription.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to identify the carcinogenic mechanisms involved in RKO cell line with no evidence of activated β-catenin/TCF regulated transcription, by comparison its gene expression profile to that of group of colorectal cancer cell lines selected to be mismatch repair deficient similar to RKO and having activate Wnt signaling.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression profiles of cancer cell lines with respect to Wnt signaling status.
