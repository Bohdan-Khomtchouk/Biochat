TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of the Immune Response to Ebola Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ebola virus is the causative agent of a severe syndrome in humans with a fatality rate that can approach 90%. During infection, the host immune response is thought to become dysregulated, but the mechanisms through which this happens are not entire understood. In this study, we use microarrays to determine the host response to Ebola infection in the PBMCs of cynomolgus macaques.
