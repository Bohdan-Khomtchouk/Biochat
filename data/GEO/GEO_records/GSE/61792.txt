TITLE
Fission yeast Cactin restricts telomere transcription and elongation by promoting Rap1 pre-mRNA splicing and protein stabilization

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
RNA transcriptome analysis of S.pombe fission yeast cells deleted for cay1+/SPBC2F12.12c (cay1D) and wildtype The transcriptome of cay1+ deleted fission yeast cells was characterized and compared to wildtype yeasts to identify differentially expressed genes controlled by Cay1 on a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of wildtype and cay1D fission yeast cells were prepared in parallel. Based on poor quality array hybridization one cay1D replicate was excluded from further analysis
