TITLE
Expression profiling of immortalized mature, murine T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RNA expression profile of retrovirally immortalized mature, murine T cells was compared to the expression profile of mature naive, murine T lymphocytes and/or murine thymocytes of healthy C57BL/6 mice. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis can contribute to immortalization of mature T lymphocytes, Newrzela et al. 2011

DESIGN
Mature T lymhpocytes were retrovirally immortalized. To compare the expression profile of immortalized T cells with non-manipulated wild type cells: RNA was isolated from fresh murine T lymphocytes, thymocytes and the immortalized T-cell population (each 1x10E7 cells). For naive T lymphocytes and thymocytes we used 8 weeks old C57BL/6 wild type (WT) donor animals. Study design: Prof. Dorothee von Laer. Study design and sample preparation: Dr.Sebastian Newrzela Gene expression profiling was performed as a commercial service by Miltenyi Biotec MACS molecular, Micorarray Service/ Cologne, Germany. Responsible scientist: Alena Fitz, Silvia RÃ¼berg. Performed: March 2008
