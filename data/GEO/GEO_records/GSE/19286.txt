SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression profiling of aorta genes of APOE-deficient mice receiving atherosclerosis treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril. Hypercholesterolemic APOE-deficient mice were used as a standard model of atherosclerosis to study gene expression changes during atherosclerosis treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril. Microarray analysis was performed of whole aortas isolated from captopril-treated APOE-deficient mice relative to untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, and nontransgenic control mice. Microarray gene expression profiling revealed that captopril-mediated atherosclerosis prevention involved inhibition of aorta-infiltrating immune cells such as pro-atherogenic T lymphocytes and macrophages.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression profiling was performed of whole aortas isolated from APOE-deficient mice with atherosclerosis relative to captopril-treated APOE-deficient mice, and nontransgenic control mice. Three study groups were analyzed, i.e. 8-months-old untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, age-matched APOE-deficient mice treated for 7 months with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (20 mg/kg in drinking water), and nontransgenic control C57BL/6J mice. Two biological replicates were made of each group, and total RNA of three aortas was pooled for one gene chip.
