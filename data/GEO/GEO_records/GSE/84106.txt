TITLE
miR expression profiles of human miRs in glioma spheres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed miRNA profiles analysis of 84, 17, 20, 83, 718, 1123, 528 and 816 glioma spheres compared to normal progenitor sample (16wf) using microarray to evaluate their potential role in regulation of the biological properties of proneural and mesenchymal glioma spheres

DESIGN
miRNA profiling analysis of the 9 samples including 8 patient-derived samples including glioma sphere samples (84, 17, 20, 718, 816, 528, 83 and 1123), as well as one normal progenitor sample (16wf).

PLATFORM
GPL22124 NanoString nCounter human miRNA expression system
