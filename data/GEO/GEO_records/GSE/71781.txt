TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the prostate biopsy samples (cancer and adjacent normal tissues) from African American prostate cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PCa) tends to be more aggressive and lethal in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans (EA). To further understand the biological factors accounting for the PCa disparities observed in AA and EA patients, we performed gene profiling using Affymetrix human exon 1.0 ST arrays to identify the differentially expressed genes beween AA cancer and patient matched normal tissues.

DESIGN
40 prostate biopsy specimens (tumor and adjacent normal tissues) were collected from 20 African American prostate cancer patients. RNA samples, purified from the collected biopy specimens, were process and applied to Affymetrix human exon ST 1.0 arrays. Array data was normalized, batch-corrected and analyzed (2-way ANOVA) using Partek Genomics Suite program.
