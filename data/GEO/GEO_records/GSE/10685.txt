TITLE
Human skeletal muscle biopsies from a 3h IL-6 infusion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle has been identified as a secretory organ. We hypothesized that IL-6, a cytokine secreted from skeletal muscle during exercise, could induce production of other secreted factors in skeletal muscle. Keywords: Human skeletal muscle time course response to IL-6 infusion

DESIGN
IL-6 was infused for 3 h into healthy young males (n=7) and muscle biopsies obtained at time points 0, 3 and 6 h in these individuals. Affymetrix microarray analysis of gene expression profiling in muscle were carried out on 3 randomly chosen subjects.
