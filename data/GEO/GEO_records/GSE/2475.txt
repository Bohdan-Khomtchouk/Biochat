TITLE
SAGE Profiles of Rat Lung Tissues

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Thirty-two SD rats (male, 150 grams, 50days) were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group, asthma group, acupuncture-treated asthma group and acupuncture-treated normal group. The rat lungs were removed immediately after the rats were died. The rat lungs were conserved in liquid nitrogen. SAGE analyses were dependent on the classic protocol (Velculescu VE, et al, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression Detailed Protocol, version 1.0e, 2000) available at the SAGENET website.
