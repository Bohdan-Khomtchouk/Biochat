TITLE
Characterization of the lag-phase associated cold acclimation gene expression responses in L. monocytogenes EGD-e

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in L. monocytogenes EGDe during lag-phase associated cold acclimation were succesfully defined through expression profiling

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes EGD-e cells that underwent cold acclimation during lag phase were analyzed in a genome-wide microarray assay with a total of 2847 genes, were the resulting significantly regulated genes were splitted in two groups (up-and down-regulated)
