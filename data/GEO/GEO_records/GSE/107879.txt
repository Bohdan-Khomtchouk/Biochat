TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells treated with extracts of hawk tea vs. DMSO-treated control group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hawk tea (Litsea coreana var. lanuginose) is a traditional Chinese tea, widely cultivated and consumed in southwestern China. It has been widely used to treat gastrosis, hepatitis, and inflammatory diseases for hundreds of years. Modern pharmacological studies demonstrate that hawk tea has protective effects against liver fibrosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and inflammatory diseases . However, the molecular mechanism of hawk tea against hypercholesterolemia remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the mechanisms of hawk tea extract (HTE) to lower cholesterol. Therefore, we performed genome-wide transcriptional analysis of hawk tea extracts treated HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
Analysis used DMSO-treated RNA as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples treated with hawk tea extracts. Indirect comparisons were made across multiple arrays with raw data pulled from different channels for data analysis and comparison to the control data.
