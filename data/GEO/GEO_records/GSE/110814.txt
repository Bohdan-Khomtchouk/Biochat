TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Pancreatic Stellate Cells (PSC) and pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of Wild Type (WT) and heterozygous (HT) PSC in order to study how the heterozygosis of our gene of interest affect the gene expression pattern of this cell population. Transcriptomic analysis of pancreatic cancer cells that were previously stimulated with conditioned media from both WT and HT PSC, in order to study the effect of PSC secreted factors on cancer cells transcriptome.

DESIGN
WT and HT PSC were isolated from WT and HT mice respectively and kept in culture for two weeks until they were activated. Pancreatic cancer cells were treated for 24h with control media or with conditioned media from WT PSC or HT PSC. Once PSC were activated and cancer cells were treated, we isolated their mRNA.
