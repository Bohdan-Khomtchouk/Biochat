TITLE
Gene expression during early infection of the resistant spring wheat cultivar NuyBay with Fusarium graminearum, the major causal agent of fusarium head blight in wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease of cereal crops caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg). FHB affects the flowering heads (or spikes).  This study compare the gene expression profile in wheat spikelets from the resistant spring wheat cultivar NuyBay inoculated with water (H2O) or Fg.

DESIGN
We used the Affymetrix wheat array to compare wheat spikelets from the resistant spring wheat cultivar NuyBay inoculated with water (H) or Fg, using the point inoculation method; samplings were done at 1, 2 and 4 days (d) after inoculation, for  2 biological replicates
