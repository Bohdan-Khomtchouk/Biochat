TITLE
Murine epiSC control vs murine epiSC differentiated into dopaminergic neurons [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse embryonic, epiblast-derived, stem cells (epiSC). epiSC differentiated towards the dopaminergic phenotype were compared to control untreated epiSC. EpiSc were derived from a Pitx3-GFP mouse allowing visualization of dopaminergic (GFP+) differentiation efficiency.

DESIGN
EpiSC derived from Pitx3-GFP mice were differentiated for fourteen days. Dopaminergic diffferentiation starts at day 5 with the addition of morphogens SHH and FGF8. Control cells were growth in absence of morphogens. Samples were collected in triplicate at day 5 (before the addition of SHH/FGF) and at day 9 and day 14 for both control and treated cells.
