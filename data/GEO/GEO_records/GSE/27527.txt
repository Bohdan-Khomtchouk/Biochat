TITLE
Trip12 deficiency effect on embryonic stem cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of E14 embryonic stem cells lacking Trip12 ubiquitin ligase activity. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profiles affected by Trip12 ubiquitin ligase activity in mouse embryonic stem cell.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from wild-type and Trip12 mutant mouse embryonic stem cells and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
