TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of liver and placenta technical replicates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled DNA from liver and placenta technical replicate samples on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. There technical replicates represent a single liver and a single placenta sample.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
