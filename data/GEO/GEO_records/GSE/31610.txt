TITLE
Expression data from different samples of a single ccRCC patient: 7 primary intra-tumor samples and 2 metastatic tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have sampled several tumour regions from a single ccRCC patient after 6 weeks everolimus treatment, including both primary and metastatic site samples to investigate intra-tumour heterogeneity.

DESIGN
We selected 7 samples from the primary tumour and 2 samples from a chestwall metastatic site sample for expression analysis using microarray data. All samples were fresh frozen upon extraction.
