TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of liver and kidneys of rats chronically fed a NK603 Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize [kidney]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
There is an ongoing debate on the potential toxicity of genetically modified food. The ability of rodent feeding trials to assess the potential toxicity of these products is highly debated since a 2-year study in rats fed NK603 Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize, treated or not with Roundup during the cultivation, resulted in anatomorphological and blood/urine biochemical changes indicative of liver and kidney structure and functional pathology. We used microarrays to detail the alterations in gene expression profiles associated with the consumption of a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize (NK603) sprayed or unsprayed with a Roundup herbicide from these same animals.

DESIGN
Female rats were fed a diet containing 33% of a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize (NK603) sprayed or unsprayed with a Roundup herbicide (n=9). Control female rats were fed a diet containing 33% of the isogenic line of the same maize (n=10). Samples of kidney were taken for gene expression analysis
