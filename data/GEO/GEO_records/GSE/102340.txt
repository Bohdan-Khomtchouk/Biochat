TITLE
lncRNA profiles in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in the biology of various cancers. However, their expression patterns and biological functions in human colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore lncRNA profiles in CRC and investigate key lncRNAs involved in CRC tumourigenesis and progression.

DESIGN
6 CRC tissues and matched normal tissues

PLATFORM
GPL13825 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent-033010)
