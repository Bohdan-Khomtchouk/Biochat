TITLE
RNA-seq during MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation and upon factor knockdowns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq to examine RNA expression profiles during MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation and upon knockdowns of transcription factors

DESIGN
RNA-seq before and after MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation, and RNA-seq upon factor knockdowns after inducing cell transformation

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
