TITLE
Alteration in gene expression levels in glioblastoma cells in response to fractionated irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of alteration in gene expression levels in response to irradiation. The aim of this study was to screen genes associated with radioresistance and infiltration of glioblastoma (GBM) cells after radiotherapy. Results provide importance information of the response of GBM cells to ionizing radiation.

DESIGN
U87MG GBM cells were irradiated with 2 Gy once, twice (2 Gy/day for two days) or three times (2 Gy/day for three days). Each control counterparts (C1, C2 and C3) were cultured with same time periods. Total RAN was extracted manually using Trizol. Gene expression profiles were determined using Illumina Human HT-12 V.4 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
