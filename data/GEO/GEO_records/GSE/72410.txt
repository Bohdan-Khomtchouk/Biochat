TITLE
Assessing the mechanism of action of BTK inhibitor, G7744

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to investigate the method of action (MOA) of BTK small molecule inhibitor, G7744, in a pre-clinical mouse lupus model (NZB/W F1). Hypothesis: BTK inhibition will affect B cell and myeloid cell pathways.

DESIGN
There are 5 mice per group. Sample groups: G1: Naive G2: Ad5 IFNa TD day 21 G3: Vehicle HPMC in citrate G4: BTK SMI G7744 100 mg/kg G5: SYK SMI G955 60 mg/kg G6: Anti ragweed IgG2a G7: mBR3 IgG2a G8: Cytoxan. Animals treated for 4 weeks. Samples: Spleen and kidney RNA from groups G1-G8.
