TITLE
Human primary airway epithelial cell cultures infected with human- and swine-origin influenza viruses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cultures of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE cells) were exposed to an MDCK equivalent MOI of 0.01 of several swine- and human-origin influenza viruses and RNA was extracted at the 12, 16, and 24 hours post infection.
