TITLE
Expression data from human breast cancer cell MCF-7 and human gastric cancer cell SGC-7901

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Piper longum L. is a well-known traditional antihyperlipidemic medicine，and it has ability to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells，potassium piperate (GBK) maybe have the same effect. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
treat and untreat with GBK on MCF-7 and SGC-7901 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. And then analysis the result to compare the express level between two cells that treat or untreat with GBK.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
