TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of degU expression reveals unexpected regulatory patterns in Bacillus megaterium and discloses new targets for optimizing expression

ORGANISM
Bacillus megaterium DSM 319

SUMMARY
First whole transcriptome assessment of a Bacillus megaterium strain. The B. megaterium DegU regulon was assessed for LB batch cultures with artificially induced degU expression. DegU is a pleiotropic regulator in B. subtilis governing adaptive responses such as secretory enzyme production.
