TITLE
Genome-wide effect of conditioned media supernatant (CMS) derived from human endometrial stromal cells treated by long-acting progestin-only contraceptives (LAPCs) on Human endometrial endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression in Human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) incubated with CMS derived from human endoemtrial stromal cells (HESCs) treated by LAPCs. We tested the hypothesis that paracrine factors sectreted from HESCs treated LAPCs, etonogestrol (ETO) or medorxyprogesterone acetate (M) influence several common genes associated with survival in HEECs. Thefore, whole genome analyses were performed in HEECs treated with HESC derived CMS obtained from vehicle (estrodial (E) as control) or progesterone (P) or ETO or M incubations under hypoxia (HX) and normoxia (NX). Results provide important information of several common and unique gene expression profiles in cultured HEECs treated with  HESC CMS from P or ETO or M incubations. Among M and ETO responsive genes, up- or down-regulated survival related common genes were determined and used further confirmation and in vitro functional analyses.

DESIGN
Total RNA (n=3) obtained from cultured HEECs incubated 6h with vehicle- or P4- or ETO- or MPA- treated NX or HX conditioned HESC-derived CMS.
