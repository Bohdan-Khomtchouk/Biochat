TITLE
Expression analysis of Naegleria gruberi (strain NEG) during differentiation from the amoeba to the flagellate form

ORGANISM
Naegleria gruberi

SUMMARY
Naegleria gruberi is a single-celled eukaryote best known for its remarkable ability to form an entire microtubule cytoskeleton de novo during its metamorphosis from an amoeba into a flagellate, including two basal bodies (equivalent to centrioles), two flagella (equivalent to cilia), and a cytoplasmic microtubule array.  This full-genome transcriptional analysis, performed at 20-minute intervals throughout Naegleria differentiation, reveals vast transcriptional changes, including the differential expression of cytoskeletal, metabolism, signaling and stress response genes. Naegleria gruberi (strain NEG) was grown in association with Kleibsiella pneumoniae on solid media.  Cells were prepared and differentiated using standard protocols, and harvested at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after initiation of differentiation.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates were obtained from differentiating N. gruberi.  Each replicate series included the following timepoints: 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after initiation of differentiation.
