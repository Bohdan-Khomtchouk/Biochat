TITLE
Human adenoid cystic carcinoma vs. human normal lymphocyte

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed ten adenoid cystic carcinomas of head and neck by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) using DNA chips spotted 4,030 BAC clones. After data smoothing by the adaptive weights smoothing (AWS) procedure with the gain and loss analysis of DNA (GLAD) algorithm, a total of 89 DNA copy number aberrations (DSCNAs) were detected. The frequent (â‰¥30%) DSCNAs were loss of 6q24, 6q25, 8p23, 6q25, and 6q23 and gains of 6q23, 8p23, 9p11-13, and 22q13. High-level gain was detected on 12q12-15 including MDM2 in two cases. These two cases showed immunohistochemically positive status of MDM2 and negative status of p53 and p21. Furthermore, the total number of DSCNAs was significantly greater in ACC with loss of 6q than in other ACC, in ACC without loss of 8p23 than in other ACC, and in ACC with 8p23 gain than in ACC with 8p23 loss, respectively. Though there is a limit in the evidence, a-CGH detected several candidate chromosomal imbalances associated with DSCNA accumulation in ACC. 6q loss, 12q gain
