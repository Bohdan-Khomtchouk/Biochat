TITLE
Regulatory RNA Apela Is a Component of a Negative Feedback Loop Regulating p53-Mediated Apoptosis in Embryonic Stem Cells (I)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
p53-repressed transcripts have recently been shown to play important roles in various biological processes, such as stem cell differentiation and cancer. We identified a transcript named Apela that is repressed by p53 and highly expressed in mouse ES cells. To see which transcripts are affected by Apela knockdown, we performed gene expression microarray using Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 array. Two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apela were used to decrease the RNA levels of Apela to about 20% of the control (a shRNA target luciferase, shLuc).

DESIGN
We designed two lentivirus-based shRNAs against Apela and used shRNA against luciferase as a control. Lentiviruses were made and used to transduced mouse ES cells. For each shRNA, three repeats were done.
