TITLE
miRNA profiles in livers with different mass deficits after partial hepatectomy and miR-106b~25 cluster accelerating hepatocyte proliferation in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To query the relationship between miRNA profiles and deficits in liver mass after PH and the miRNAs linked to liver regeneration, we compared the miRNA expression profile after 2/3 PH, a standard procedure that leads to robust DNA synthesis, with that after 1/3 PH, a procedure that causes minimal replication. The patterns and dynamics of miRNA profiles after PH were featured, providing a rich resource of miRNAs underlying mechanisms of liver regeneration.

DESIGN
We generated miRNA profiles from normal and remnant livers at 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours after 1/3 or 2/3PH using microarrays. Two or three rats were used at each time.
