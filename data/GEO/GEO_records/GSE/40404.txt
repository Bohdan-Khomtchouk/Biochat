TITLE
Expression data from normal human fibroblasts expressing prelamin A or progerin, untreated or treated with farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptomes of isogenic diploid fibroblasts expressing progerin or elevated levels of wild-type prelamin A with that of wild-type fibroblasts. We subsequently used the reversion towards normal of two phenotypes, reduced cell growth and dismorphic nuclei, by treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) or overexpression of ZMPSTE24, as a filtering strategy to identify genes linked to the onset of these two phenotypes.

DESIGN
We carried out microarray analyses of gene expression profiling in isogenic fibroblasts lines to identify the subset of genes whose expression patterns are strongly altered upon expression of progerin or elevated levels of wild-type lamin A. A filtering strategy was then used to identify potential key effectors. We searched for genes whose expression was reverted towards normal by treatment  with farnesyl transferase inibitors (FTI) in both cell lines for 48 hours,  or by overexpression of ZMPSTE24 in cells with elevated levels of prelamin A, conditions that improve cell proliferation and leads to a significant decrease in nuclear membrane abnormalities.
