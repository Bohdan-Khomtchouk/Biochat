TITLE
Hepatic gene expression profiles after long-term high-fat diet feeding in wild type and Nrf2 knock-out mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the role of the transcription factor NFE2 related factor 2 like 2 ( Nrf2) in the development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and non-alcoholic HFD-induced fatty liver disease, 8 wild type (WT) and 8 Nrf2 knock-out (Nrf2-KO) C57BL6J male mice (obtained from Riken BRC, Tsukuba, Japan and originally developed by Prof. M. Yamamoto) were fed an HFD (60 kcal % fat) for 180 days. Whole genome microarray expression profiling was performed in pooled liver samples of WT and Nrf2-KO mice to identify genes that are differentially expressed between WT and Nrf2-KO mice under the stress conditions of HFD-induced obesity.

DESIGN
Liver samples were taken from 8 wild type (WT) and 8 Nrf2 knock-out (Nrf2-KO) male mice on high-fat diet (60 kcal % fat) for 180 days. Total RNA was isolated from pooled liver samples from WT or Nrf2-KO mice to produce 4 samples each using the guanidinium thiocyanate method.
