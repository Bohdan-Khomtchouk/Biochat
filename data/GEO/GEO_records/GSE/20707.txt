TITLE
Detection of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in stac mutant of zebrafish by cDNA microarray

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed a zebrafish forward genetic screen by Tol2 mediated gene-trap approach and uncovered one mutant stac (The number of the transgenic line: B55) that showed severe cell-death distributed in the various brain and trunk in the homozygote embryos. Analysis of stac homozygous embryos demonstrates typical apoptosis. So it is necessary to analyze whether the apoptosis and cell cycle regulated signaling transductions are changed in the mutant, in order to provide valuable clues to some other species. And the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the mutant compared to the WT were examined by zebrafish cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from wild-type and mutant embryos in 24hpf and 30hpf and their quality was checked by the company with LAB-ON-A –CHIP system. The reverse transcription and Biotin-labeling has been done with the RNA as template. The hybridization and elution was performed with Affymetrix GeneChip® Zebrafish Genome Array. Both the control group (wild-type) and the experimental group (mutant) have two repeats.
