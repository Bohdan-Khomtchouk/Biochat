TITLE
MNase-seq after CBP inhibition in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Nucleosome position does not change after 10 min of CBP (also known as nejire) inhibition.

DESIGN
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells were treated with control (C37) or the CBP inhibitor C646 for 10 min, fixed with formaldehyde, and digested with MNase. One percent Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin was mixed with this chromatin (spike-in).
