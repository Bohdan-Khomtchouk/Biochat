TITLE
Expression profiling of Mammary Gland Tumor epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mammary gland tumors from transgenic mice overexpressing the p110 or p75 isoform of CUX1. RNA was extracted from epithelial cells isolated using Laser-Capture Microdissection (LCM)

DESIGN
9 tumors from p75-CUX1 transgenic mice and 8 tumors from p110-CUX1 mice. Biological samples were hybridized in technical duplicates with dye swaps between duplicates against a common reference for normalization.
