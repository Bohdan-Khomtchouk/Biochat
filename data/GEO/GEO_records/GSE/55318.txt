TITLE
Transcript data affected by constitutive expression of VvMYBPAR in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Constitutive expression of VvMYBPAR in Arabidopsis was found to accumulate proanthocyanidins when the plants were grown on sucrose-supplemented media to induce anthocyanins. To identify the putative targets of VvMYBPAR, the transcriptome analysis of the transgenic lines which highly express VvMYBPAR was carried out using NimbleGen microarray.

DESIGN
Three transgenic lines in which VvMYBPAR were constitutively expressed under the control of 35S promoter vs. empty vector transformants were compared.
