TITLE
KSHV G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) induced gene transcription in HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare the gene transcription level between HUVEC-kGPCR and HUVEC-vector stable cells. The goal is to identify the genes that are affected by KSHV kGPCR expression. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
HUVEC cells were infected with kGPCR or control lentivirus and selected with puromycin to get stable cells. Then RNA was extracted from these cells and microarray analysis was performed.
