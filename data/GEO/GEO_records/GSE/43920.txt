TITLE
H3K4 demethylation by Jarid1a and Jarid1b contributes to retinoblastoma-mediated gene silencing during cellular senescence (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that involves chromatin reorganization and specific changes in gene expression that trigger an irreversible cell-cycle arrest. We have examined the effect of suppressing the histone demethylases Jarid1a and Jarid1b on the senescence-associated gene expression signatures.

DESIGN
Human fibroblast (IMR90) cells were infected with retroviral vectors expresssing shRNA targeting Jarid1a, Jarid1b or both, and triggered to undergo quiescence by removal of serum or senescence by over-expression of activated ras (Hrasv12).
