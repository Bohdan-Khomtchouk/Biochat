TITLE
Ontogenetic onset of immune-relevant genes in the common sole (Solea solea)

ORGANISM
Solea solea

SUMMARY
A microarray platform for Solea solea was employed to study gene expression profiles of common sole developmental stages.

DESIGN
Characterization of the transcriptome of S. solea, focusing on larval and juvenile stages.   Pooled samples of 10â€“5 individuals (depending on larval age) were sampled and RNA extracted at 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 24 and 33 days post-hatching (dph). The number of biological replicates was four for each sampling point. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Agilent-036353 Solea solea oligo microarray (GPL16124) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only).
