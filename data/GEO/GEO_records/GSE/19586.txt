TITLE
Expression data from the longuissimus dorsi muscle of Qinchuan cattle, Qinghai yak and Guangxi buffalo at 36 months

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Sex condition has been demonstrated to alter meat quality and sex is a major factor that affects the fatty acid composition of lipids of carcass dissectible or intramuscular depot fats. But the possible genetic molecular mechanism of gender causing meat quality differences is not well defined. Qinchuan cattle, Qinghai yak and Guangxi buffalo are three typical indigenous species of cattle in China. Obivious differences of meat quality exist among the three species of cattle. Few studies have been conducted to elucidate the muscle tissue expression of genes involved in pathways and mechanisms leading to meat quality differences beyond the phenotype properties of beef. Bovine Genome Arrays were used to construct muscle expression profiles of the longuissimus dorsi from Qinchuan cattle at 36 months and screen differentially expressed genes in the longuissimus dorsi muscle tissues among different genders of Qinchuan cattle, between Qinchuan cattle and Qinghai yak, and between Qinchuan cattle and Guangxi buffalo.
