TITLE
Breast tumors: different structures of tumor cells [cnv]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cytogenetic profiling of morphologically-distinct structures of breast tumors: tubular, alveolar, solid, trabecular structures, and discrete groups of tumor cells. The aim was to identify chromosomal aberrations which could be associated with the development of clinical relevant structures of tumor cells.

DESIGN
Five types of morphological structures from three regions of breast tumors (n=3) vs. human female DNA (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA)

PLATFORM
GPL21789 Agilent-031746 ISCA Human CGH 60K v2 (Probe Name version)
