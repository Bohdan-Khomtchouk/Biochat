TITLE
Gene expression profile of GM-CSF derived bone marrow dendritic cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GM-CSF derived bone marrow cultures contain several subsets of CD11c+MHCII+ mononuclear phagocytes Using Affymetrix microarrays we compared gene expression of the different mononuclear phagocytes within the bone marrow culture

DESIGN
The Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 arrays were used to define gene expression profiles in the different population.

PLATFORM
