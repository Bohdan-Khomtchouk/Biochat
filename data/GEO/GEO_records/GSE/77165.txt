TITLE
Genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum from field isolates

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
Comaprision of P.falciparum clinical isolates showing Uncomplicated disease with that shwoing complicated disease(Cerebral malaria) The experiment was designed to try and identify differences if any, at the genome level between P.falciparum isolates from patients with uncomplicated malaria vs. patients with complicated malaria (Cerebral malaria). The emphasis was to highlight possible amplifications/deletions in different regions of the parasite genome.
