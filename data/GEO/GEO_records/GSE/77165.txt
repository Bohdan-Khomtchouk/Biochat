TITLE
Genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum from field isolates

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Comaprision of P.falciparum clinical isolates showing Uncomplicated disease with that shwoing complicated disease(Cerebral malaria) The experiment was designed to try and identify differences if any, at the genome level between P.falciparum isolates from patients with uncomplicated malaria vs. patients with complicated malaria (Cerebral malaria). The emphasis was to highlight possible amplifications/deletions in different regions of the parasite genome.

DESIGN
Agilent two-color  experiment, Custom Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 2x400K CGH microarray (AMADID: G4124A_025327) designed on Agilent platform by Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru

PLATFORM
GPL21368 Agilent Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 2x400K CGH microarray designed by Genotypic Technology (AMADID: G4124A_025327)
