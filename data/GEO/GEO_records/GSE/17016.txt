TITLE
The profile of cellular and KSHV microRNAs in KSHV infected lymphatic endothelial cells (6 and 72 hours post infection)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognizable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. The effects of KSHV infection of LECs were assayed using Affymetrix hgu133plus2 chips at 6 and 72 hours post infection.

DESIGN
There were n=4 each of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) following 6 hours of culture, LEC following 6 hours post KSHV infection, LEC following 72 hours of culture, and LEC following 72 hours post KSHV infection.
