TITLE
Effect of AtHRE1 and AtHRE2 overexpression in normoxia and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
HRE1 and HRE2 are two ERF transcription factors induced by low oxygen. In this work we analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of HRE1 and HRE2 on the arabidopsis transcriptome in aerobic and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. While HRE1 has a moderate effect on the expression of anaerobic genes under hypoxia, HRE2 does not affect them either under aerobic or hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
We treated Arabidopsis seedling Col-0 (wt) and transgenic 35S::HRE1 and 35S::HRE2 , 7-day old, germinated in 12/12 light/dark photoperiod with: -Control (23°C, dark, 21% O2, 4h). -Hypoxia (23°C, dark, 1% O2, 4h). Two biological replicates for each condition.
