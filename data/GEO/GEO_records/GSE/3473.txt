TITLE
prp43 COLD SHIFT

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cold senstive alleles of prp43, S249A and G429A were assayed for splicing and RNA processing defects. Keywords: splicing, pre-mRNA processing

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from cold senstive alleles of prp43, S249A and G429A after cold shift to 16C for 60 mins. Cy3/Cy5 labeled RNA's were hybridized to Yeast Splicing Chip v62 using WT RNA cold shifted to 16C for 60 mins as a reference. There are 4 hybes in the series which include reciprocal dye swap experiements for each cold sensitive allele.
