TITLE
Sertoli cell specific testicular gene expression of Connexin 43 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infertility observed in adult Sertoli cell (SC)-specific Connexin 43 Knockout-mice rather seems to be an effect of the disturbed SC-Germ cell (GC) crosstalk than a direct consequence of the loss of Cx43 protein in SC with important GC specific genes being mostly affected by this deletion.
