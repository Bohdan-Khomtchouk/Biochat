TITLE
Sertoli cell specific testicular gene expression of Connexin 43 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infertility observed in adult Sertoli cell (SC)-specific Connexin 43 Knockout-mice rather seems to be an effect of the disturbed SC-Germ cell (GC) crosstalk than a direct consequence of the loss of Cx43 protein in SC with important GC specific genes being mostly affected by this deletion.

DESIGN
Identification of differentially expressed genes in testis of cx43 KO-mice at developmental stage 8 days post partum when compared with testis of WT-mice
