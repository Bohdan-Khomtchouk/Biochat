TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of several temperate Cluster N actinobacteriophages during various stages of growth.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
The goal of this sequencing project was to measure transcription levels of several Cluster N actinobacteriophages during different stages of their lifecycle, including lysogeny, early infection (30 minutes), and late infection (2 hours 30 minutes), in order to study which genes contribute to superinfection exclusion.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from cultures grown in log phase, depleted of rRNA and prepared for sequencing using a strand-specific library kit during lysogeny, early infection (30 minutes), and late infection (2 hours 30 minutes) of phages Butters, Charlie, MichelleMyBell, Panchino, Phrann, Redi, Xeno, and Xerxes A total of twelve different RNA samples were prepared
