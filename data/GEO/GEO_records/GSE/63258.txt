TITLE
Differential MicroRNAs in Microarray profile of Retinoblastoma in EpCAM silenced Y 79 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify microRNAs which are altered upon EpCAM silencing.EpCAM is over expressed molecule in Retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma Y 79 cell line was used as model to study the differential expression of microRNA in EpCAM siRNA treated cells.To validate technique we further confirmed deregulated expression of few microRNAs in Y 79 cells using Real Time PCR technique.

DESIGN
Agilent one-color experiment,Organism: Homo sapiens ,Agilent Human miRNA 8x15k Arrays AMADID: 029297
