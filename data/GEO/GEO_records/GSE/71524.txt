TITLE
Illumina HT-12 v4 expression array data for Ovarian Cancer Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to generate a new panel of comprehensively, genomically characterized high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) cell line and xenograft models. Multidimensional genomic data were generated and compared between cell lines/xenografts and the tumours they were derived from, indicating the cell lines/xenografts are highly similar to their patient-matched tumours. Cell line/xenograft data were also compared to TCGA ovarian tumours to show the cell lines are good models of clinical HGSOC.

DESIGN
Illumina HT-12 v4 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on total RNA extracted from i) tumour cells purified from ovarian tumour ascites, and ii) established cell lines. Evaluation of the similarity in copy number/methylation/gene expression/mutational profiles of cell lines/tumours/xenografts was performed.
