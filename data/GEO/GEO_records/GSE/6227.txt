TITLE
Expression data from rust or mock inoculated, fully expanded flag leaf halves

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Two sets of wheat lines near-isogenic to Lr34 were used to compare gene expression profiles of wheat: 1. with and without Lr34 gene; 2. rust and mock inoculation; 3. distal and basal portion of the flag leaves.  The two sets of wheat near-isogenic lines were used to subtract genetic background variations and to enrich Lr34-regulated gene expression profiles.  The study is aimed to better understand the mechanisms of the well-known durable leaf rust resistance gene, Lr34, mediated resistance at the transcriptome level. Keywords: Distal and basal leaf halves of near-isogenic lines

DESIGN
Wheat near-isogenic lines, Jupateco with Lr34 (JUR), Jupateco without Lr34 (JUS), Thatcher with Lr34 (THR), and Thatcher without Lr34 (THS) were used.  Thatcher lines were rust (I) or mock (M) inoculated.  Jupateco lines were mock inoculated.  Distal (T) and basal (B) half of the leaves were harvested and processed separately.  Three biological replications were applied to each treatment.
