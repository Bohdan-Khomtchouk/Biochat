TITLE
Epigenetic profiling of aorta macrophages of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia (CD11ME)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq targeting H3K9ac and H3K27me3 histone modifications was carried out on macrophages isolated from aortas of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia or room air conditions.

DESIGN
One replicate was generated for each histone mark in each condition for a total of 4 immunoprecipitated samples and no input or control sample.
