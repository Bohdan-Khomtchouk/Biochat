TITLE
The Co-regulated Genes by Ectopic Expression of MiR-371-372-373 Cluster in HepG2 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important cellular regulators and their dysfunctions are associated with various disease. miR-371/372/373 was found co-regulated in HBV-producing HepG2.2.15 cells when compared to its non-HBV producing maternal HepG2 cells. To obtain a glimpse of the potential influence of the enforced miR-371-372-373 cluster in HepG2 gene expression, a two-color Capitalbio 70-mer oligo microarray platform, which contained 21,329 well-characterized human gene probes, was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between miR-371-372-373-HepG2 and mock-HepG2 in two independent biological replicate.

DESIGN
miR-371-372-373-HepG2 vs. mock-HepG2

PLATFORM
GPL9955 Homo sapiens 22K Oligo micrarray V2.0 (Capitalbio)
