TITLE
Expression data from N/Tert-HPV E6 cells in the presence and absence of mitomycin C treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HPV E6 from the genus alpha 'high risk' types such as HPV16 recruit the ubiquitin ligase E6AP to ubiquitinate p53 and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation.  This results in the functional inactivation of p53 in HPV16-E6 expressing cells. To test what patterns in gene expression might change as a result of HPV16 E6 protein functions and to test whether HPV E6 proteins from genus beta virus types also inactivate p53, we profiled gene expression using Affymetrix arrays before and after stimulating p53 activity via DNA damage in a panel of N/Tert-E6 cell lines.

DESIGN
N/Tert-1 human keratinocyte cell lines were cultured in K-SFM (Invitrogen) and treated with 2 ug/ml mitomycin C or with vehicle control for 18 hours.  RNA isolated from frozen cell pellets was analyzed on Affymetrix arrays.  Each cell line was grown and processed on arrays in 3-5 separate experiments.
