TITLE
miRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine if miRNA expression in human airway smooth muscle cells is altered by a pro-inflammatory stimulus.   A majority of the miRNAs on the array exhibited very low signal intensity. In ASM cells exposed to IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ, none of the miRNA expressed were significantly up-regulated with cytokine treatment.  We did observe 11 miRNA down-regulated > 2-fold in both cultures with cytokine treatment. These miRNA include described human miRNA miR-23a, -23b, -25, -188, -320, -363, -489, as well as mouse and rat miRNA homologous to miR-140*, mouse miR-329 and a novel miRNA, abi-13268.
