TITLE
Expression profiling of Noto-GFP+ notochord progenitor cells sorted from E8.5 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a combination of cell sorting and microarray analysis, we identified almost 200 genes as having a high level of expression in the notochord. After whole mount in situ hybridization screening, we confirmed approximately one third of these as having a novel notochord expression pattern. Keywords: cell type comparison - embryonic Noto-GFP+ notochord progenitors versus surrounding GFP- comparator cells

DESIGN
3 biological replicates - each replicate includes an experiment cell population (Noto-GFP positive cell sort) and a comparator population (GFP negative cell sort)
