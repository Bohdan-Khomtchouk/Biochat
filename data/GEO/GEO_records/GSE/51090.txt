TITLE
DNA methylation profile in well-differentiated cancer uncoves another source of diagnostic and prognostic markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By characterizing at the genome-wide level the DNA methylation patterns of the largest series of well-differentiated thyroid tumors described to date, we provide novel insights into the biology underlying on the one hand the histological heterogeneity, and on the other differential patient outcomes of this disease. We describe distinct subtype- and mutational-specific methylation profiles as well as novel markers associated with recurrence-free survival, which could provide an improved classification of patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 83 primary thyroid tumor samples and 8 adjacent normal tissue samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
