TITLE
Beta-catenin stabilization of skin fibroblasts causes fibrotic lesions by preventing adipocyte differentiation of the reticular dermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Wnt/alpha-catenin pathway plays a central role in epidermal homeostasis and regeneration but how it affects fibroblast fate decisions is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of targeted alpha-catenin stabilization in dermal fibroblasts. Comparative gene expression profiling of Sca1- and Sca1+ neonatal fibroblasts, from upper and lower dermis respectively, confirmed that Sca1+ cells had a pre-adipocyte signature and revealed differential expression of Wnt/alpha‐catenin-associated genes. By targeting all fibroblasts or selectively targeting Dlk1+ lower dermal fibroblasts, we found that -catenin stabilization between E16.5 and P2 resulted in a reduction in the dermal adipocyte layer with a corresponding increase in dermal fibrosis and an altered hair cycle. The fibrotic phenotype correlated with a reduction in the potential of Sca1+ fibroblasts to undergo adipogenic differentiation ex vivo. Our findings indicate that Wnt/alpha-catenin signaling controls adipogenic cell fate within the lower dermis, which potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of fibrotic skin diseases.

DESIGN
The dermis was separated from back skin of PDGFRAeGFP postnatal pups (P2) by incubation with thermolysin (0.25 mg/ml) (Sigma T7902) overnight at 4° and further processed as previously described (Collins et al., 2011). Cells were labeled in PBS + 10% FBS TruStain fcX anti-mouse blocking buffer with the following antibodies: anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (Sca-1)-Alexa Fluor-700  17.  Two populations of cells were collected in triplicate.  The PDGFRaH2BeGFP/Sca1- and the PDGFRaH2BeGFP/Sca1+.  RNA was isolated and prepared for microarray analysis and hybridized to Affymetrix MG430.2A arrays.  C, digested in DMEM + 10% FBS containing 2.5 mg/mL collagenase I (Gibco 17100- 017), and further processed
