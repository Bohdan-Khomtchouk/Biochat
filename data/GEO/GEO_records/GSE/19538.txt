TITLE
Analysis of the turkey skeletal muscle transcriptome between genetic lines within a developmental stage (Experiment 2)

ORGANISM
Meleagris gallopavo

SUMMARY
The purpose of Experiment 2 was two-fold: a) to evaluate a unique set of negative, distance, and mismatch control probes on the newly designed 6K TSKMLO microarray, and b) to identify differences in gene expression between two genetic lines of turkeys that phenotypically display differences in growth. Negative and mismatch controls confirmed specific hybridization using this array, and genes identified as differentially expressed between developmental stages by microarray analysis were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Novel candidate genes and pathways were identified as playing potentially crucial roles in skeletal muscle development between 2 distinct lines of turkeys with implications for improving turkey meat quality defects and growth-induced myopathies long-term.
