TITLE
Expression data from rat androgenetic embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The rat androgenetic embryonic stem cells (RahES cells) have only 21 chromosomes. However, they express pluripotency markers, differentiate into three germ layer cells as well as contribute to the germline as the normal diploid rat ES cells. Moreover, the RahES cells can produce fertile rats after intracytoplasmic injection into oocytes, thus are capable to transmit genetic modifications to offspring. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile of RahES cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes compared with the expression of normal diploid rat ES cells.

DESIGN
Two different RahES cell lines, one diploid rat ES cell line and round sperm cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Chip.
