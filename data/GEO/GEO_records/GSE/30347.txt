TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in the Thalamus and Cerebrum of Horses Experimentally Infected with West Nile Virus

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to further our understanding of gene expression in the central nervous system (thalamus and cerebrum) after exposure to West Nile virus.   To that end, three different analyses were performed.  The first examined differences in gene expression between horses not vaccinated and exposed to WNV and normal control horses (exposure).  The second examined differences in gene expression between horses not vaccinated and exposed to WNV and horses vaccinated and exposed to WNV (survival).  And the third examined differences between the nonvaccinated cerebrum and nonvaccinated thalamus of horses exposed to WNV (location).

DESIGN
Six conditions- Gene expression in the thalamus and cerebrum of three different groups of horses (Non-vaccinated horses exposed to West Nile virus, Vaccinated horses exposed to West Nile virus, normal horses not exposed to West Nile virus).  Biological replicates- 6 normal cerebrums, 6 normal thalamus, 6 vaccinated and exposed cerebrums, 6 vaccinated and exposed thalamus, 6 non-vaccinated and exposed cerebrum, 6 non-vaccinated and exposed thalamus.
