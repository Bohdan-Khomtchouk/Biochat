TITLE
Identification of PU.1 target genes by expression profiling of PUER cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PU.1 is a key transcription factor for macrophage differentiation. Novel PU.1 target genes were identified by mRNA profiling of PU.1-deficient progenitor cells (PUER) before and after PU.1 activation. We used two different types of Affymetrix DNA-microarrays (430 2.0 arrays and ST 1.0 exon arrays) to characterize the global PU.1-regulated transcriptional program underlying the early processes of macrophage differentiation. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Uninduced and 24h 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT) induced PUER cells were cultured before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 and Mouse Exon ST 1.0 microarrays. Triplicates before (0h) and after (24h) induction of PU.1 were analyzed.
