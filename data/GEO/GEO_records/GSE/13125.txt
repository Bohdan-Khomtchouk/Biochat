TITLE
Identification of PU.1 target genes by expression profiling of PUER cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PU.1 is a key transcription factor for macrophage differentiation. Novel PU.1 target genes were identified by mRNA profiling of PU.1-deficient progenitor cells (PUER) before and after PU.1 activation. We used two different types of Affymetrix DNA-microarrays (430 2.0 arrays and ST 1.0 exon arrays) to characterize the global PU.1-regulated transcriptional program underlying the early processes of macrophage differentiation. Keywords: time course
