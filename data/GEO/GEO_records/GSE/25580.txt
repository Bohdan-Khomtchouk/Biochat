TITLE
Examination of impact of pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 upon gene expression in patient fibroblasts and HEK cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression changes due to the induction of wt or mutant Lrrk2 expression

DESIGN
For GSM628620-GSM628655: RNA from HEK cells, stably transfected with an inducable lrrk2 expression vector For GSM628657-GSM628676: RNA from patient derived fibroblast cells
