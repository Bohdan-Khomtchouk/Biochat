TITLE
Simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and DNA methylome from a single cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a new single cell sequencing method to simultaneously sequence methylome and transcriptome for mouse DRG neurons

DESIGN
Integrative analysis of transcription and methylation at single cell level
