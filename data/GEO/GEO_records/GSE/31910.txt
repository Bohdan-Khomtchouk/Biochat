TITLE
Bmi-regulated miRNA expression pattern in head and neck cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The critical role of Bmi1 in promoting stem cell properties has been shown in different type of human cancers. Here, we established four stable clones to study Bmi-regulated miRNA expression patterns in head and neck caners.

DESIGN
Bmi1-overexpressing cell lines (FaDu- Bmi1vs. FaDu-pcDNA3 cell line), and knock-down of Bmi1 cell lines (OECM1-sh-Bmi vs. OECM1-sh-Bmi1 cell lines) were established and used for analyzing miRNA expression patterms in Bmi-regulatory mechanism.
