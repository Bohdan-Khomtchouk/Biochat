TITLE
BCL6 enforces human glioblastoma growth and serves as a novel therapeutic target (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study uncovers a novel growth-promoting role of BCL6 in GBM, and provide the rationale of targeting BCL6 as a potential therapeutic approach for this deadly malignancy.

DESIGN
cDNA microarray analysis was performed in U87 cells transfected with either non-targeting siRNAs or BCL6 siRNAs. All experiments were carried out in duplicates.
