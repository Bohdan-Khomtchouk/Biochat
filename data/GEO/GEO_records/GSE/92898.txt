TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility of histone deacetylase inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of chromatin accessibility changes after prolonged exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines to low doses of Panobinostat (LBH589), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor.

DESIGN
Examination of accessible chromatin after histone deacetylase inhibition in 2 triple-negative cell lines cell types.

PLATFORM
