TITLE
Gene expression profile of cancer cells growing as a co-culture with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF)

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Molecular mechanisms of the cancer cells-carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAF) interactions growing in vitro conditions as a co-culture. The five canine mammary cancer cell lines were cultured with CAF (isolated from canine mammary cancer) for 72hrs. Then, the cancer cells and CAFs were sorted and the gene expression analysis was conducted. The control for each co-cultured cell line was the same cell line growing as a single culture.

DESIGN
Dye-swap experiment, each cell line growing in the co-culture conditions was compared to the same cell line growing as a single culture.
