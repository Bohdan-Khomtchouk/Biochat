TITLE
VEGF blockade enhances the antitumor effect of BRAFV600E inhibition (mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this work we investigated the combined effects  of the BRAF inhibition and of the VEGF blockade in a preclinical model of melanoma. The purpose of this dataset was to examine the transcriptional responses of a A375 xenograft model to PLX472 and bevacizumab, either as single agents or as combination therapy. We performed species-specific analysis of gene expression to discriminate the effects of the different therapeutic regimens on tumor cells (human) and stromal microenvironment (mouse). Here, Illumina Mouse BeadChips were used to profile the transcriptome after 12 days treatment. We reported that dispensing the dual treatment is more efficient than the single compounds and the occurrence of resistance by modifying the tumor genetic programs regulating myeloid cells recruitment and extracellular matrix remodeling.
