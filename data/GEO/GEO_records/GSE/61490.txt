TITLE
RNA-sequencing study of peripheral blood monocytes for chronic periodontitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We confirmed immune response as the key mechanism and provided solid evidence for novel genes (e.g., FCAR and CUX1) and distinct biological processes (e.g., endocytosis, cytokine production and apoptosis) as potentially new important factors/mechanisms contributing to chronic periodontitis pathogenesis.

DESIGN
We performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) study of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) in 5 non-smoking moderate to severe CP (case) subjects vs. 5 controls. We replicated the DEx transcripts/isoforms using an independent microarray dataset. We also pathway-based analysis on the identified/replicated DEx transcripts/isoforms using DAVID performed (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery).
