TITLE
Analysis of Fusarium verticillioides gene expression in response to nitric oxide

ORGANISM
Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in F. verticillioides M3125 when exposed to 1.5 mM DETA NONOate for 30 minutes.  Assessed in reference to unexposed M3125.  DETA NONOate is a nitric oxide (NO) donor with a half-life of approximately 56 hours at 27Â°C, pH 7.4, to liberate 2 moles of NO per mole of parent compound.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate control cultures of F. verticillioides M3125 in PDB buffered with 0.1 M sodium phosphate and two separate experimental cultures of M3125 grown in the same buffered PDB plus the added treatment of 1.5 mM DETA NONOate.  The cultures were incubated for 30 minutes and then harvested by vacuum filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The chips are a F. verticillioides custom 14K array based on platform GPL14669.
