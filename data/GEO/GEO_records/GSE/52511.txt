TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in wild-type Drosophila testes with tbrd-1 mutant testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression is tightly linked to histone acetylation on lysine residues that can be recognized by bromodomains. The testis-specific bromodomain protein tBRD-1 is essential for male fertility and might act as a co-factor of testis-specifc TAFs. Here, we perform microarray analyses and demonstrate that tBRD-1 selectively controls gene expression in male germ cells

DESIGN
Testes were dissected from 0-2 day old Drosophila males. The wild-type control sample was w1118. The tbrd-1 mutant is described in Leser et al., 2012 (Leser K, Awe S, Barckmann B, Renkawitz-Pohl R, Rathke C. 2012. The bromodomain-containing protein tBRD-1 is specifically expressed in spermatocytes and is essential for male fertility. Biology Open 1: 597-606)
