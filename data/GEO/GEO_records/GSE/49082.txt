TITLE
Genomic alteration in MRC5-derived induced pluripotent stem (MRC5-iPS) cell line, Tic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disease-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been used for a model to analyze pathogenesis of the disease. We generated iPS cells derived from a fibroblastic cell line of ataxia telangiectasia (AT-iPS cells). In analysis of AT-iPS cells, the human wild-type iPS cell line (MRC5-iPS) was generated and cultured in the same conditions as the diseased iPS cell lines. It is an ideal control cell line for the disease and patient-specific iPS cell lines.  Because MRC5-iPS cells exhibited considerable chromosomal abnormalities in vitro, we performed a structural alteration analysis by using a SNP genotyping array for MRC5-iPS cell line, Tic,  at passage 15,  passage 30, and  passage 37.

DESIGN
The parental MRC-5 fibroblast cells and MRC-iPS 25 (Tic)  were subjected to Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 BeadChip analysis.
