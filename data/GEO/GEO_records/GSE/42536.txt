TITLE
Transcription profiling by array of yeast single and double deletion mutants of gene-specific transcription factors

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Contains gene expression profiles of yeast single and double deletion mutants of gene-specific transcription factors. Genetic interactions were studied by comparing gene expression changes of double mutants with gene expression changes in the respective single mutants. Pairs of gene-specific transcription factors were chosen based on previous evidence for epistasis, including synthetic genetic interactions as well as common DNA binding.

DESIGN
Two channel microarrays were used. RNA isolated from a large amount of wt yeast from a single culture was used as a common reference. This common reference was used in one of the channels for each hybridization and used in the statistical analysis to obtain an average expression-profile for each deletion mutant relative to the wt. Two independent cultures were hybridized on two separate microarrays. For the first hybridization the Cy5 (red) labeled cRNA from the deletion mutant is hybridized together with the Cy3 (green) labeled cRNA from the common reference. For the replicate hybridization, the labels are swapped. Each gene is represented twice on the microarray, resulting in four measurements per mutant. Using the Erlenmeyer growth protocol up to five deletion strains were grown on a single day. In the tecan platereader, up to eleven deletion strains could be grown on a single day. Wt cultures were grown parallel to the deletion mutants to assess day-to-day variance.
