TITLE
Open chromatin maps of genetically different yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Open chromatin provides access to a wide spectrum of DNA binding proteins for DNA metabolism processes such as transcription, repair, recombination, and replication. In this regard, open chromatin profiling has been widely used to identify the location of regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, insulators, silencers, replication origins, and recombination hotspots. For a quantitative getic analysis of chromatin regulation, we generated open chromatin maps of 100 yeast samples including the parental strains (BY and RM, and two replicates for each) and their descendants by using the FAIRE-seq technique

DESIGN
Open chromatin in two parental strains and 94 segregants of their crossing

PLATFORM
