SUMMARY
The expansion, trafficking and functional effectiveness of adoptively transferred CD8+ T-cells play a critical role in mediating effective anti-tumor immunity.  However, the mechanisms which program the highly proliferative and functional state of CD8+ T-cells are not completely understood.   We hypothesized that IL-12, a cytokine commonly induced by TLR activation, could enhance T-cell priming by altering responsiveness to antigen and cytokines.   Priming of tumor specific CD8+ T-cells in the presence of IL-12 induced the acquisition of a 'polyfunctional' effector response and increased the generation of memory cells.   Moreover, IL-12 priming also promoted high levels of the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25) and robust IL-2 mediated activation of STAT5.  This sensitivity to IL-2 translated into enhanced in vivo proliferation of adoptively transferred CD8+ T-cells.  Furthermore, real-time, in vivo imaging of T-cell trafficking confirmed the ability of IL-12 priming to drive in vivo proliferation.  IL-12 priming enhanced the anti-tumor function of adoptively transferred cells by reducing established subcutaneous tumor burden, and significantly increasing survival in an established intracranial tumor model.  Finally, IL-12 priming of human PBMCs generates tumor specific T-cells phenotypically and functionally similar to IL-12 primed Pmel-1 T-cells.  These results highlight IL-12 as an important mediator of CD8+ T-cell effector function and anti-tumor immunity.

DESIGN
We primed Pmel-1 TCR transgenic CD8+ T-cells with cognate antigen and either IL-2 or IL-12 and compared their gene expression profiles.  This was used to identify pathways or genes necessary for anti-tumor activity in vivo. RNA was isolated from Pmel-1 T-cells primed with antigen and cytokine for 6 days and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.
