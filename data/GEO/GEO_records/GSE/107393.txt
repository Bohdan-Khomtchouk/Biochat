TITLE
Metabolic and Expression Regulation in Caldicellulosiruptor bescii

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor bescii

SUMMARY
Two single-gene knockout strains (ΔfapR and Δcra) and their common parent strain (JWCB005) were each grown in three conditions of elevated osmolarity which produced a moderate growth defect in all strains and relative growth phenotypes between the strains.

DESIGN
A total of 27 samples were analyzed.  All samples were sequenced on one sequencing lane.  Two single-gene knockout strains (ΔfapR and Δcra) and their common parent strain (JWCB005) were each grown in three conditions of elevated osmolarity which produced a moderate growth defect in all strains and relative growth phenotypes between the strains.  Sacrifical batch samples were taken at mid log phase of growth for RNA sequencing.
