TITLE
HNSCC samples vs. normal tonsil samples: reference design

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
transcription profiling of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples vs. normal tonsil samples using a two-color reference design experimental setting. Used to identify differentially expressed genes in tumor/normal samples, and compare the result to that of the same samples using the self-self hybridization experimental setting. Keywords: tumor/normal comparison

DESIGN
8 HNSCC tumor samples and 8 normal tonsil samples. One sample per array. Two-color reference design with a common reference sample (a modified version of the Stratagene Human Universal Reference) on each array.

PLATFORM
GPL7540 Agilent-scanner-UNC-custom-4X44K-without-Virus [Probe Name version]
