TITLE
HNSCC samples vs. normal tonsil samples: reference design

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
transcription profiling of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples vs. normal tonsil samples using a two-color reference design experimental setting. Used to identify differentially expressed genes in tumor/normal samples, and compare the result to that of the same samples using the self-self hybridization experimental setting. Keywords: tumor/normal comparison
