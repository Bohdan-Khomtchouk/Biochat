TITLE
Genetically engineering self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells into a liver bud-like tissue using Gata6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have potential for personalized and regenerative medicine. While most methods of utilizing these cells have focused on deriving homogenous populations of specialized cells, there has been modest success in producing hiPSC-derived organotypic tissues or organoids. Here we present a novel approach for generating and then co-differentiating hiPSC-derived progenitors. With a genetically engineered pulse of GATA6 expression, we initiate rapid emergence of all three germ layers as a complex function of GATA6 expression levels and tissue context. Within two weeks we obtain a complex tissue that recapitulates early developmental processes and exhibits a liver bud-like phenotype, including haematopoietic and stromal cells, as well as a neuronal niche. Our approach addresses two major issues in derivation of tissues from hiPSCs: using a single autologous hiPSCs as source and generating a range of stromal cells that co-develop with parenchymal cells to form complex tissues.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling (microarray) of iPS cells (PGP1) at X days post- doxycycline induction of mouse Gata6. Either total cells or immunomagnetic isolation of cells with specific surface markers. Three samples per group.
