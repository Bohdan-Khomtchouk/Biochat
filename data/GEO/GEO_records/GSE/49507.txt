TITLE
Quantitative proteomics analysis of signalosome dynamics in primary T cells identifies the surface receptor CD6 as a Lat adaptor-independent TCR signaling hub

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the dataset was to study on a genome-wide level the impact of Lat deficiency on gene expression in resting and activated CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
Lat+ and Lat− CD4+ T cells were isolated from lymph nodes and spleen of Latfl-dtr Tmat-Cre mice using a Dynabeads untouched mouse CD4 cells kit (Life Technology) and further purified by cell sorting. Lat+ CD4+ T cells were defined as: CD5+, hDTR+, CD8−, TCRγδ−, CD25−, CD69−, CD62L+, lineage (CD11c, CD11b, CD19, CD45R, CD161)− and Lat− CD4+ Tcells were defined as: CD5+, hDTR−, CD8−, TCRγδ−, CD25−, CD69−, CD62L+, lineage (CD11c, CD11b, CD19, CD45R, CD161)−. Sorted Lat+ or Lat−  CD4+ T cells were then kept in vitro for 4 hours without stimulation or activated for 4 hours using anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody. Cell samples corresponding to three biological replicates were analyzed and gene expression profiles were obtained from total RNA.
