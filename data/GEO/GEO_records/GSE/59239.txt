TITLE
Acquired resistance to mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 is associated with increased dependence on RAS signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare gene copy number in cell populations with acquired resistance to specified EGFR inhibitors to parental cell lines. The aim of the experiment was to determine whether gain or loss of copy number of particular genes was associated with resistance to particular EGFR inhibitors.

DESIGN
Comparing gene copy number in PC9 parental cells to gene copy number in 5 cell populations resistant to AZD9291, 2 cell populations resistant to WZ4002, 2 cell populations resistant to afatinib and 4 cell populations resistant to gefitinib.
