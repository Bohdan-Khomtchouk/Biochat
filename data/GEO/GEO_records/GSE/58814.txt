TITLE
Allergic contact dermatitis to nickel is characterized by a specific microRNA signature [skin]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our findings demonstrate that nickel-challenged skin in subjects with allergy to nickel is characterized by a specific miRNA signature compared to vehicle-challenged skin. In addition, we found that miRNA expression changes are different in allergic contact dermatitis (ACD to nickel) compared to irritant contact dermatitis (ICD).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, day 0 vs. day 11 after challenge of the skin from DPCP-sensitized subjects with DPCP. Biological replicates: 6 healthy subjects. One replicate per array. Sample 1-12 (A29-A40) Two-condition experiment, nickel vs. vehicle challenged skin. Biological replicates: 3 subjects with allergy to nickel, 3 subjects with no history of dermatitis. One replicate per array.  Sample 13-24 (A41-A52)

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
