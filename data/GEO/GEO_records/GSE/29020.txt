TITLE
Role of Ado1p in the transcriptional response associated with AICAr supplementation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of Ado1p associated with AICAr supplementation on the global transcriptome of Y3188.

DESIGN
The Y3188 strain was grown with or without AICAr. For each comparison, we made 2 biological replicates, swapping dyes.
