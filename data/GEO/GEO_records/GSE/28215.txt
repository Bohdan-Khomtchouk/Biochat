TITLE
3CB-induced gene expression of Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1 in soil (with RNA amplification)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
Genome-wide scanning of gene expression by microarray techniques was successfully performed on RNA extracted from a sterilized soil inoculated with Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1, which contains a chloroaromatic degrading plasmid, in the presence or absence of 3-chlorobenzoic acid (3CB). The genes showing significant changes in their expression in both triplicate microarray analyses using amplified RNA and single microarray analysis using unamplified RNA were investigated. Pathway analysis revealed that the benzoate degradation pathway underwent the most significant changes following treatment with 3CB. Analysis based on categorization of differentially expressed genes against 3CB revealed new findings about the cellular responses of the bacteria to 3CB, including upregulation of the genes specifically involved in transport of 3CB, and induction of a K+/H+ antiporter complex, an universal stress protein, two cytochrome P450 proteins and an efflux transporter. Downregulated expression of some genes involved in carbon metabolism and the genes belong to a prophage in the presence of 3CB was observed. This study demonstrated the applicability of the method of soil RNA extraction for microarray analysis through a proof-of-concept experiment using a sterilized soil inoculated with Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA extracted from soil cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1.  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,341 genes from the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 genome with two sets of six 60-mer probes per gene.
