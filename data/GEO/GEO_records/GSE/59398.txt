TITLE
miRNA profiles in obese and normal weight periodontitis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 microarrays were compared in gingival tissue biopsy samples from obese and normal weight patients with periodontitis

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from gingival tissue biopsies (miRVana protocol) collected from normal weight and obese individuals with periodontitis. MiRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 arrays.
