BLI_Fetal_NT

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to compare liver gene expressions in bovine fetuses derived from somatic cell nuclear transplantion (NT) with those in the liver of bovine fetuses derived from artificial insemination (AI) and in vitro fertilized (IVF) eggs. Gene expression profiles in the liver of an NT-calf was also compared with those in the liver of AI-calf. Keywords = nuclear transplantation Keywords = bovine Keywords = liver gene expression Keywords = fetus Keywords: parallel sample
