TITLE
cDNA microarray expression profile during fiber elongation between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense ; Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Sea-island cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) has superior fiber quality properties such as length, fineness and strength, while Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is characterized by high yield. To reveal features of Upland cotton and Sea-island cotton fiber cells, differential genes expression profiles during fiber cell elongation and in secondary wall deposits were established using cDNA microarray technology. This research provides a valuable genomic resource to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cotton fiber development, and may ultimately lead to improvements in cotton fiber quality and yield.

DESIGN
15 samples were prepared for microarray slides hybridized with three biological replicate samples including a swap-dye experiment for each growth stage. Each spot had a repeat in the microarray slideï¼Œtherefore, data for six replicate experiments performed with biologically independent samples.
