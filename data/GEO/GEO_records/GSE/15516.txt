Immunomodulatory function of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in experimental autoimmune type 1 diabetes

SUMMARY
Human clinical trials in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients are underway using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) without prior validation in a mouse model for the disease.  In response to this void, we characterized bone marrow-derived murine MSC for their ability to modulate immune responses in the context of T1D, as represented in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In comparison to NOD-, BALB/c-MSC express higher levels of the negative costimulatory molecule PD-L1 and promote a shift toward Th2-like responses in treated NOD mice. In addition, transfer of MSC from resistant strains (i.e. NOR or BALB/c), but not from NOD mice, conferred disease protection when administered to prediabetic NOD mice. The number of BALB/c-MSC trafficking to the pancreatic lymph nodes of NOD mice was higher than in NOD mice provided autologous NOD-MSC. Administration of BALB/c-MSC resulted in reversal of hyperglycemia in 90% of NOD mice (p=0.002). Transfer of autologous NOD-MSC imparted no such therapeutic benefit, and in fact soft tissue and visceral tumors were uniquely observed in this setting (i.e. no tumors were present with BALB/c- or NOR-MSC transfer). These data provide important preclinical data supporting the basis for further development of allogeneic MSC-based therapies for T1D and potentially, other autoimmune disorders.
