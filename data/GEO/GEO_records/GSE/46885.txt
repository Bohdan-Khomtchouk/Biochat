TITLE
Bacillithiol as Part of the Response of Staphylococcus aureus to Oxidative Stress

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Overnight cultures of wild type COL or the bshA mutant were back-diluted to an O.D.650 of 0.1 in 30 mL of TSB. The cells were grown at 37C with shaking in a 300mL flask until they reached an O.D.650 of 1.1. The cells were then equally separated into 50mL Falcon tubes, so that each tube had 10mL of culture. One tube for each strain was induced with 1 mM diamide and one with 10 mM H2O2, which we did not send for analysis. All cultures were allowed to continue growing at 37C with shaking for another 20 minutes. RNA extractions were carried out as previously described in Tamber et al., Infect Imunn, 2010.
