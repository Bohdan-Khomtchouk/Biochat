TITLE
Genome-wide sequencing of REST binding (ChIP-seq) in adult hippocampal neural stem cells in vitro a.k.a. HCN cells in quiescent (iQNP) and proliferative (TAP) conditions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of REST binding in mammalian adult hippocampal stem cells in culture (HCN cells). By obtaining 33 to 38 million single-end reads of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide REST binding state of HCN cells in induced quiescent (iQNP) and proliferating (TAP) conditions. Thereafter, we annotated the peaks to genomic regions and associated genes. We find that with +/-10kb of transcription start site of genes, REST efficiently binds neuronal genes and represses them in HCN cells in both iQNP and TAP conditions. Moreover, only in the iQNP REST also binds non-neuronal genes like DNA replication genes. This study reveals that in addition to its well known function as a neuronal repressor in non-neuronal tissue, REST can also play other diverse roles in non-neuronal tissues.
