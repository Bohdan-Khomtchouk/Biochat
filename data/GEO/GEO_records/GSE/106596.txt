TITLE
Expression data from endothelial cells induced from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with SCD1 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are of multi-differentiating potential and has been demonstrated to have the ability to differentiate into endothelial cells. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, which can convert saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids. We used lentivirus to transfected SCD1 gene into BM-MSCs and found that overexpression of SCD1 could promote the differentiation of BM-MSCs into endothelial cells. We used microarrays to detect the differential gene expression profile of endothelial induced BM-MSCs with SCD1 overexpression.

DESIGN
We transfected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with a constructed SCD1 lentivirus and detected that BM-MSCs successfully overexpressed SCD1. After 3 days of endothelial induction in the overexpression group and control group, RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays were performed.
