TITLE
Effects of fibroblast growth factors (FGF) on dissociated myelinating cultures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of three members of the FGF family (FGF1, FGF2 and FGF9) and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) on myelinating cultures generated from dissociated embryonic spinal cord. The results of both immediate (24 hours, T1 (24 hrs)) and long term treatments (10days, T2) give insights into the cumulative effects of sustained FGF and BMP mediated signal transduction in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases.

DESIGN
Dissociated myelinating cultures were generated from neurosphere derived astrocytes (generated from striata of P1 Sprague-Dawley rats) and spinal cord cells from E15.5 Sprague-Dawley(SD) embryos. The effect of recombinant human FGF9 and other soluble factors on these in vitro myelinating cultures was investigated by adding them to the culture media after 18 days in vitro (DIV). The effects of each factor were analysed using three independent cultures at two time points (19DIV and 28 DIV).
