TITLE
Expression data for haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains growing in a defined low glucose medium.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess differences in gene expression associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms occurred in three genes, PMA1, MDS3 and MKT1, as compared to a reference strain devoid of any mutations (Progenitor strain).

DESIGN
Haploid yeast strains carrying no evolved alleles (progenitor - reference strain) or different combinations of the studied evolved alleles (PMA1e, MDS3e and MKT1e) and devoid of all other evolved alleles were used. The following genotypes were studied: ancestral, MDS3e, MKT1e, MDS3e_MKT1e and PMA1e_MKT1e (2 replicates each). Cells of the studied strains were grown overnight on liquid yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium and used to inoculate defined low glucose medium.
