TITLE
Expression data for haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains growing in a defined low glucose medium.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess differences in gene expression associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms occurred in three genes, PMA1, MDS3 and MKT1, as compared to a reference strain devoid of any mutations (Progenitor strain).
