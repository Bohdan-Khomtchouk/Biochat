TITLE
ER ChIP-seq of Androstenedione treated Letrozole Resistant Breast Cancer Cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is a major clinical problem in the treatment of breast cancer. The detailed mechanisms of how tumour cells develop this resistance remain unclear. Here estrogen receptor ChIPseq analysis identifies adaptations of the ER in response to prolonged letrozole treatment.

DESIGN
Let-R cells were treated with either Androstenedione or vehicle and immunoprecipitated with anti-ER
