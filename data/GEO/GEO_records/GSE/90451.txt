TITLE
Comparison of bovine blastocysts (192 hpi) embryo transcriptome in presence of co-culture systems (BOEC or VERO) in SOF medium

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
To analyze impact of co-culture presence and type of feeder cell lines, we compared the transcriptome of bovine blastocyst (192 hpi) using a new custom bovine microarray.

DESIGN
In vitro produced putative zygotes were cultured in 500 Âµl weel (25 embryos per well) in control condition (5% O2, 5%, 3 replicates), in high level of oxygen (20% O2, 20%, 3 replicates), in presence of BOEC at 20%O2 (BOEC, 3 replicates) or in presence of VERO (VERO, 4 replicates). Embyos were sampled at 16-cell stage (96 hours post insemination).
