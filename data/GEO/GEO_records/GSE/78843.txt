TITLE
Microarray analysis to unravel the function of C-terminus domain of EBF1 by replacement approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To unravel the function of C-terminus domain of EBF1, a replacement microarray analysis was performed by transducing Ebf1wt and Ebf1DC expressing vectors intoA-MuLV transformed pro-B (Ebf1fl/fl;RERTCre) cells.

DESIGN
A-MuLV transformed Ebf1fl/fl RERTCre pro-B cells were treated with 2Î¼M 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) 24h after transduction. Five days after treatment, cells were sorted as GFP+. More than two week later, the replacement was validated by IB and the cells were used for downstream analyses. As control, mock-transduced cells were harvested four days after tamoxifen treatment before cell death was observed.
