TITLE
Vaccine-Elicited CD4 T Cells Induce Immunopathology Following Chronic LCMV Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4 T cells promote innate and adaptive immune responses, but how vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells contribute to immune protection remains unclear. Here we evaluated whether induction of virus-specific CD4 T cells by vaccination would protect mice against infection with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Immunization with vaccines that selectively induced CD4 T cell responses resulted in catastrophic inflammation and mortality following challenge with a persistent form of LCMV. Immunopathology required antigen-specific CD4 T cells and was associated with a cytokine storm, generalized inflammation, and multi-organ system failure. Virus-specific CD8 T cells or antibodies abrogated the pathology. These data demonstrate that vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells in the absence of effective antiviral immune responses can trigger lethal immunopathology.

DESIGN
Splenic GP66-specific CD4 T cells from mice immunized with either a LMwt vaccine (sham) or LMgp61 vaccine (CD4 vaccine) were purified by FACS on day 8 post-infection with LCMV clone 13
