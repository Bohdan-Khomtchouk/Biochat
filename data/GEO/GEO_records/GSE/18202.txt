TITLE
Variation in germline gene expression in cde-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
analysis of germline gene expression in wildtype and cde-1 mutant C. elegans.

DESIGN
Worms were staged, gonads were dissected in Trizol, and RNA was isolated, all using standard protocols. The series includes a young adult and an aged adult sample, and a dye swap of both. In most respects the two stages can be regarded as duplicates.
