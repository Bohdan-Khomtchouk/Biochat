TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor EGL-27::GFP Binding Regions in L1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2621 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: OP177(made_by : S Kim description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.  The resulting plasmid was used for biolistic transformation of an unc-119(ed3) strain.  The EGL-27::EGFP fusion protein is expressed in the correct egl-27 spatio-temporal expression pattern.  This strain was used for ChIP-seq experiments to map the in vivo binding sites for the EGL-27 transcription factor. tags : GFP::3xFlag mutagen : Bombard outcross : 3 genotype : unc119(ed3);wgIs177(egl-27::TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119) official name : OP177 ); Developmental Stage: fed L1; Genotype: unc119(ed3);wgIs177(egl-27::TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119); Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage fed L1; Target gene egl-27; Strain OP177(made_by : S Kim description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.
