TITLE
Catabolite repression by intracellular succinate in Campylobacter jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Bacteria have evolved different mechanisms to catabolize carbon sources from a mixture of nutrients. They first consume their preferred carbon source, before others are used. Regulatory mechanisms adapt the metabolism accordingly to maximize growth and to outcompete other organisms.   The human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is an asaccharolytic Gram-negative bacterium that catabolizes amino acids and organic acids for growth. It prefers serine and aspartate as carbon sources, however it lacks all regulators known to be involved in regulating carbon source utilization in other organisms. In which manner C. jejuni adapts its metabolism towards the presence or absence of preferred carbon sources is unknown.  In this study, we show with transcriptomic analysis and enzyme assays how C. jejuni adapts its metabolism in response to its preferred carbon source serine. In the presence of serine as well as lactate and pyruvate C. jejuni represses the utilization of other carbon sources, by repressing the expression of a number of central metabolic enzymes. The regulatory proteins RacR, Cj1000 and CsrA play a role in the regulation of these metabolic enzymes. This metabolism dependent transcriptional repression correlates with an accumulation of intracellular succinate. Hence, we propose a demand-based catabolite repression mechanism in C. jejuni, which depends on the intracellular succinate level.

DESIGN
Comparison of growth conditions, C. jejuni strain 81116 grown under microaerophilic (5% Oxygen) condition in HI broth compared to  C. jejuni strain 81116 grown in HI broth with 25mM serine, or HI broth with 25mM aspartate. Log phase and early stationary phase were examined.
