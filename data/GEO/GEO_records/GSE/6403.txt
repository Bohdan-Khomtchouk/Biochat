TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of T.rubrum treated with PHS11A

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to PHS11A, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, were determined. Keywords: treatment with fatty acid synthase inhibitor
