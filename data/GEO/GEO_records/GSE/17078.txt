TITLE
Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CADM1): A Novel Risk Factor for Venous Thrombosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protein C (PC) deficiency increases the risk of venous thrombosis (VT) among members of Kindred Vermont II, but fails to fully account for the inheritance pattern. A genome scan of the pedigree supported the presence of a prothrombotic gene on chromosome 11q23 with weaker support on chromosomes 10p12 and 18p11.2-q11. Preliminary data from Affimetrix microarray expression analysis of Blood Outgrowth Endothelial Cells of 3 members of Kindred Vermont II compared to a well established normal control group indicated that IgsF4 was decreased in patients versus controls. In addition, both statistical and pathway analysis results suggested that these genes are associated protein C.  Further studies indicated that Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CADM1), a member of the IgsF4 superfamily, may be associated with VT.

DESIGN
We obtained BOEC (blood outgrowth endothelial cells) from 3 female kindred subjects (ages 56, 61, and 74) with Protein C Deficiency. We also performed microarray analysis on BOEC from 27 normal subjects of diverse ages.
