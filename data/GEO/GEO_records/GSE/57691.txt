TITLE
Differential gene expression in human abdominal aortic aneurysm and atherosclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to assess the relative gene expression in human AAA and AOD.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression analysis of  abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortic occlusive disease (AOD) specimens obtained from 20 patients with small AAA (mean maximum aortic diameter=54.3±2.3 mm), 29 patients with large AAA (mean maximum aortic diameter=68.4±14.3 mm), and 9 AOD patients (mean maximum aortic diameter=19.6±2.6 mm). Relative aortic gene expression was compared with that of 10 control aortic specimen of organ donors.
