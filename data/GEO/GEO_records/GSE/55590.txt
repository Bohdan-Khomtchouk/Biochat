TITLE
Identification of activity-induced genes in cortical inhibitory neurons (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the activity-induced gene expression programs in inhibitory neurons, we analyzed RNA extracted from cultured E14 mouse MGE-derived neurons (DIV 10) after these cultures were membrane-depolarized for 0, 1 and 6 hrs with 55mM extracellular KCl.

DESIGN
Mouse E14 MGE-derived neurons were cultured for 9 days, quieted overnight with TTX and AP-5 and then membrane-depolarized for 0, 1 or 6 hours by raising the extracellular KCl-concentration to 55mM. RNA was then extracted and WT RNA-Seq was performed on ABi SOLiD
