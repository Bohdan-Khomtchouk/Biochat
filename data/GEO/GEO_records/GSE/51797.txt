TITLE
Hepatic expression data from 2-stage carcinogenesis study in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Hepatic gene expression profiles in 2-stage carcinogenesis study were analyzed with comprehensive DNA methylation data. Combined analysis suggested that PTEN signaling and immune response such as antigen presentation was related to one side of early heapatocarcinogenesis. We used microarrays to obtain the global gene expression profile of livers to understand the mechanism of carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Rat livers sampled at the timing of partial hepatectomy and terminal euthanasia were subjected to RN extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain hepatic gene expression data treated with various initiators and their succession. Briefly, each liver at 5w (partial hepatectomized sample) and 10w (terminal sample) from same animal were subjected to microarray analysis. MC (methylcellulose) and water mean vehicle of initiator and promoter, respectively. As an initiator, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), thioacetamide (TAA), methapyrilene (MP) and acetaminophen (APAP) were administered. As a promoter, phenobarbital (PB) was given in drinking water.
