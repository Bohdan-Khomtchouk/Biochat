TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Tuberculous Meningitis coinfected with HIV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tuberculosis co-infected with HIV may increase the risk of causing meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis co-infected with HIV associated with high mortality and severe neurological abnormalities in affected individuals. We have carried out TBM co-infected with HIV gene expression study using whole human genome microarrays. We identified 796 differentially expressed genes with fold change cut off of 2 or more than 2. Out of 796 differentially expressed genes, 398 were upregulated and 396 were downregulated. We have validated two molecules from microarray data using immunohistochemistry.
