TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Tuberculous Meningitis coinfected with HIV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tuberculosis co-infected with HIV may increase the risk of causing meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis co-infected with HIV associated with high mortality and severe neurological abnormalities in affected individuals. We have carried out TBM co-infected with HIV gene expression study using whole human genome microarrays. We identified 796 differentially expressed genes with fold change cut off of 2 or more than 2. Out of 796 differentially expressed genes, 398 were upregulated and 396 were downregulated. We have validated two molecules from microarray data using immunohistochemistry.

DESIGN
The proposed study carried out mRNA expression profiling of five samples from patients diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis coinfected with HIV and four head injury cases were used as controls. We have used 4X44K arrays from agilent platform. To validate our microarray results, we have done immunohistochemistry on 10 TBM+HIV cases and 10 control groups.
