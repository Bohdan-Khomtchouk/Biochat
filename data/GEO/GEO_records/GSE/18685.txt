TITLE
Time-course in rice leaves in the field: WT (cv.Norin8) vs. osgi mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Diurnal time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf in the field comparing a circadian clock related mutant, osgi, with the wild-type (WT).

DESIGN
Two sample experiments (WT vs. osgi) : 13 time-points (2h interval), 8 replicates (2leaves from individual plants x 4stages(each staggered by tranplanting dates with one week interval)): sampled on Aug. 12th 7:00-Aug.13th 7:00 (2008) at a paddy field in Tsukuba (Japan)

PLATFORM
GPL6864 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Feature Number version)
