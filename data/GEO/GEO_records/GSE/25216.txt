TITLE
Microarray analysis and scale-free gene networks identify candidate regulators in drought-stressed roots of loblolly pine (P. taeda L.).

ORGANISM
Pinus taeda

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) is challenging due to limited molecular tools. PtGen2, a 26,496 feature cDNA microarray, was fabricated and used to assess drought-induced gene expression in loblolly pine propagule roots. Statistical analysis of differential expression and weighted gene correlation network analysis were used to identify drought-responsive genes and further characterize the molecular basis of drought tolerance in loblolly pine.

DESIGN
Reference design. Three condition experiment, each compared to a common reference. Biological replicates: 4 well-watered (control), 4 drought-stressed, 4 drought-stressed + recovery. cDNA synthesized on three occassions (A, B, and C) and 2 replicates were performed for each synthesis for a total of 6 technical replicates for each biological replicate. 72 slides total
