TITLE
Expression of p16 and Retinoblastoma Determines Response to CDK 4/6 Inhibition in Ovarian Cancer: Ovarian cancer cell line expression data.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PD-0332991 is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6 kinases with the ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. Here we investigate the role of CDK4/6 inhibition in human ovarian cancer.  We examined the effects of PD-0332991 on proliferation, cell-cycle, apoptosis, and Rb phosphorylation using a panel of 40 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction, including p16 and Rb, were studied using gene expression profiling, Western blot, and arrayCGH. Multiple drug effect analysis was used to study interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expression of p16 and Rb was studied using immunohistochemistry in a large clinical cohort ovarian cancer patients. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of PD-0332991were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were most responsive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Copy number variations of CDKN2A, Rb, CCNE1,  and CCND1 were associated with response to PD-0332991.  CDK4/6 inhibition induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, blocked Rb phosphorylation in a concentration and time dependent manner, and enhanced the effects of chemotherapy.  Rb proficiency with low p16 expression was seen in 97/262 (37%) of ovarian cancer patients and associated with adverse clinical outcome (progression free survival, adjusted relative risk 1.49, 95%CI 0.99-2.22, p =0.054).    PD-0332991 shows promising biologic activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Assessment of Rb and p16 expression may help select patients most likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition in ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 40 individual ovarian cell lines relative to an ovarian cell line reference mix containing equal amounts of 41 ovarian cell lines (including OCC-1 which was later identified as originating from mouse).  The expression data was correllated with cell line growth response to CDK 4/6  inhibitor PD-0332991 to identify genes associated with drug sensitivity and resistance.
