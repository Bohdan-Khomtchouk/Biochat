TITLE
Detection of genes differentially expressed in radioresistant tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nu61, a radiation-resistant human tumor xenograft, was selected from a parental radiosensitive tumor SCC-61 by eight serial cycles of passage in athymic nude mice and in vivo irradiation. Obtained tumors were profiled using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Most abundant gene pattern associated with radioresistant phenotype was presented by IFN-inducible, Stat1-dependent pathway Keywords: Pair-wise comparison of radiosensitive vs radioresistant tumors

DESIGN
Obtained tumors were established as xenografts in nude mice. RNA were purified from each xenograft, normalized by concentration and three samples of RNA from each group were pooled for hybridization with each array. Three arrays were used for each group.
