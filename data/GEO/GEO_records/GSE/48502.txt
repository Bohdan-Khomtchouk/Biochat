TITLE
MiRNA Expression data from human radioresistant and radiosensitive Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most of the NPC patients suffer from local recurrences and distant metastases within 1.5 years after radiotherapy due to radioresistance. Distinct patterns of miRNa expression and signatures were found in NPC, and have been used to associate them with cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, but few miRNA expression profiling studies have been focused on the tumor radioresistance.We used miRNA expression microarray analyses to identify the difference of miRNA in radioresistant NPC CNE2-IR cells and radiosensitive CNE2 cells.

DESIGN
Radioresistant subclone of nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2-IR cell line was cultured and produced according to the experienment schedule to undergo five rounds of sublethal dose of irradiation (11 Gy),and the parent cell line CNE2 sensitive to radiotherapy as the control
