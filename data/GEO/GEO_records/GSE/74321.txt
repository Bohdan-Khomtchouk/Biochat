TITLE
Intestinal epithelial TRE-Msi1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells in the presence or absence of ectopic induction of Msi1 in vivo

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from preparations of total intestinal epithelial cells taken from the jejunum from 3 control (R26-M2rtTA +doxycycline for 24 hrs) and 3 experimental (TRE-Msi1::R26-M2rtTA +doxycycline for 24 hrs) animals and subjected to profiling on affymetrix Gene 1.0ST arrays

PLATFORM
