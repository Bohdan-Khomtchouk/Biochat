TITLE
RNAseq analyses of pathogenic Burkholderia glumae under in vitro and in vivo conditions

ORGANISM
Burkholderia glumae BGR1

SUMMARY
We analyzed B. glumae transcriptome from infected rice tissue using an RNAseq technique. To identify unique expression of B. glumae genes within rice tissues, we compared in vivo transcriptome data of B. glumae to in vitro data. To accomplish this, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified 2,906 transcripts that were significantly altered.

DESIGN
Three in vitro (culture) and three in vivo (in plant) RNAseqs in B. glumae

PLATFORM
GPL18590 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Burkholderia glumae BGR1)
