TITLE
Identifying Molecular Effects of Diet through Systems Biology: Influence of Herring Diet on Sterol Metabolism and Protein Turnover in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identifying molecular effects between herring and beef diet in Ldlr-/- mice

DESIGN
The transcriptome of the three tissues, which are liver, muscle and adipose tissue, were used for indentify the influence of diet on metabolism. Ldlr-/- mice were fed with either a beef diet or a herring diet.
