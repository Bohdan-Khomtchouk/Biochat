TITLE
Gene expression profiles in kidney of Japanese flounder injected with formalin-killed bacterial cells

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the genes induced by different bacterial cells, which may contain different types of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), high-throughput gene expression analyses using Agilent custom-oligo DNA microarray containingon 9,573 probes constructed for Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus were conducted.  A number of genes showed significant changes in mRNA levels.  However, there are no significant difference in a manner of the changes among the different bacterial cell treatments.  The genes significantly induced by the treatments included well-known immune-related genes such as granulocyte-colony stimulation factor, haptoglobin, hepcidin.

DESIGN
The kidney were isolated from the formalin killed cells (FKCs) intraperitoneal injected Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus using the four formalin-killed cells, Edwardsiella tarda  strain 54, Lactococcus garviae strain EH8706, Streptococcus iniae strain 02 and Vibrio anguillarum strain H775-3, respectively. Fishes were administered by an intraperitoneal injection using the 1.0 x 10^7 to 1.0 x 10^8 cells of FKCs. After 6 hours from a injection, fish kidney was isolated. We also isolated phosphate-bufferd seline injected fish kidney as a control. We analyzed a four samples in control. We also analyze a three samples in FKC injected fish (16 hybridization).
