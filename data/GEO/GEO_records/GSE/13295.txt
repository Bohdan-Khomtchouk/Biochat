TITLE
The effect of PLC inhibitor on cold responsive transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of genes induced with the cold via inhibition of the phospholipase C - To answer this question we chose a pharmacological approach. We decided to use molecules that are going to inhibit PLC. U73343 is an inactive homolog of U73122 (inhibitor of the phospholipase C pathway). Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
