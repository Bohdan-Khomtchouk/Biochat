TITLE
Differential expression of RNAs in E9 tuft rostrums with NTDs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Identify genes and pathways affected in tuft embryos with NTDs Results: Expression of genes associated with neural tube closure and components of non-canonical WNT signaling/PCP pathways were affected Conclusions: TET1 regulates genes associated with neural tube closure

DESIGN
RNA pooled from the rostrums of E9 (18-22 somites) tuft/tuft embryos with NTD compared with respective wildtype background strain
