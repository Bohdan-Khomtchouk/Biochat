TITLE
Functional roles of Acetylated Histone Marks at Mouse Meiotic Recombination Hotspots (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meiotic recombination is initiated by the Spo11 endonuclease, which directs DNA double strand breaks at discrete regions in the genome coined hotspots. Here we report the profiles and dynamics of histone modifications at the cores of mouse recombination hotspots in early meiotic prophase. To define the spectrum of possible regulators of histone methylation and acetylation at all stages of meiosis I, expression analyses of histone acetylases/deacetylases (HATs/HDACs) and and HMTs/HDMTs genes when comparing those expressed in spermatogonia, pre-leptotene and leptotene/zygotene versus pachytene meiotic stages.

DESIGN
Wild-type meiotic samples design is described in GSE21447. To collect Spo11-/- meiotic samples, 10 to 16 weeks old male Spo11-/- testes were used for sorting multiple meiotic fractions.  Spermatogonia, pre-Leptotene and Leptotene/Zygotene sorted meiotic fractions were collected twice from total 4 and 3 Spo11-/- mice testes respectively .  These combined samples were used for subsequent RNA purification, labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
