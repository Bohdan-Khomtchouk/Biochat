TITLE
miR-875-5p overexpression in DU145 prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of miR-875-5p in prostate cancer was functionally investigated by overexpressing the miRNA in DU145 prostate cancer cells and by analyzing gene expression profiles

DESIGN
gene expression profiles of DU145 cells transfected with miR-875-5p synthetic mimic (triplicate) were compared to those of DU145 cells transfected with a mock molecule (triplicate)
