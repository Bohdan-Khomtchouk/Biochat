TITLE
Gene expression profiling of murine incisor pulp following resection of the inferior alveolar nerve

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to investigate the contribution of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) towards cellular mechanisms required for regeneration of the murine incisor. Here, we conducted gene expression profiling of adult murine incisor dental mesenchyme tissue following two weeks after unilateral resection of the IAN from both the denerved and contralateral incisor of five wild-type mice.

DESIGN
To investigate the mechanism of murine incisor regeneration dependent on innervation, we analyzed incisor dental mesenchyme of adult wild-type mice two weeks after unilateral resection of the IAN. We performed microarray analyses of incisor dental mesenchyme of wild-type mice from both the denerved and contralateral lower incisor at postnatal day P60 (n=5 mice) to examine the genes potentially regulated by factors contributed to the incisor mesenchyme by innervation.
