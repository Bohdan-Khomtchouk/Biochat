TITLE
aCGH study of iPS cells from two normal subjects and two Parkinson's disease patients with parkin mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons and can be caused by monogenic mutations of genes such as parkin. The lack of phenotype in parkin knockout mice suggests that human nigral DA neurons have unique vulnerabilities. Here we generate induced pluripotent stem cells from normal subjects and PD patients with parkin mutations. We demonstrate that loss of parkin in human midbrain DA neurons greatly increases the transcription of monoamine oxidases and oxidative stress, significantly reduces DA uptake and increases spontaneous DA release. Lentiviral expression of parkin, but not its PD-linked mutant, rescues these phenotypes. The results suggest that parkin controls dopamine utilization in human midbrain DA neurons by enhancing the precision of DA neurotransmission and suppressing dopamine oxidation. Thus, the study provides novel targets and a physiologically relevant screening platform for disease-modifying therapies of PD.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from each of the four lines of iPSCs and labeled with Cy5. Pooled sex mismatched normal human genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3. Both samples are hybridized together on RPCI 21K BAC aCGH array.
