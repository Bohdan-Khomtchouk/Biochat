TITLE
Expression data from B6 mouse miR-142 KO and WT T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cells are critical for modulating immune responses. miRNAs are  small, noncoding RNAs and play a significant role in T cell responses. miR-142 is a hematopoietic specific miRNA. To explore the potential role of miR-142  in regulating T cell responses, we generated mutant mice bearing a targeted deletion of the miR-142 gene. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the profile changes between miR-142 KO and WT T cell and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
miR-142 KO mice and WT littermates (biological triplicates) matched with age and sex were selected. T cells were purified from spleens by negative selection and processed for RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
