TITLE
Gene expression data from healthy, adjacent normal and tumor colon cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of paired normal adjacent mucosa and tumor samples from 98 individuals and 50 healthy colon mucosae, were obtained through Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Arrays. This dataset is in the context of the COLONOMICS project and to query additional information you can visit the project website www.colonomics.org.

DESIGN
Colon tumor and adjacent paired normal mucosa tissues samples used in this study were selected from a series of cases with a new diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma histologically confirmed. Included cases were from a homogenous series of patients with more than three years of follow up, early stage (II), without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and microsatellite stable colon cancer. Additionally, samples of colon mucosa from 50 healthy donors without colonic lesions were obtained during colonoscopy.
