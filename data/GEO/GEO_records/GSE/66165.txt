TITLE
NanoString assays of miRNA in MCF7 and MCF10A cells and in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from these cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify unique miRNA profiles of EVs from MCF7 and MCF10A cells that distinguish their cellular origin.

DESIGN
654 human mature miRNAs were analyzed in NanoString assays to identify miRNA with high abundance in MCF7 EVs and the greatest fold change for MCF7 EVs relative to MCF10A EVs.
