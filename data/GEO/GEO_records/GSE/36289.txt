TITLE
Comparison of the gene expression profiles between MEF, MEF treated with n-Butylenephthalide (BP) 10 and 40ug/ml.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray analysis was used for comparing the gene expression profiles between MEF, MEF treated with n-Butylenephthalide (BP) 10 and 40ug/ml.

DESIGN
The total RNA extracted from MEF, MEF treated with n-Butylenephthalide (BP) 10 and 40ug/ml was used for the microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles.
