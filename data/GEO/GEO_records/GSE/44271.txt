TITLE
Myeloma in African Americans: Myeloma gDNA vs. Control gDNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epidemiological data have suggested that African Americans (AA) are twice as likely to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) as compared to European Americans (EA).  Here, we have analyzed a set of cytogenetic and genomic data derived from AA and EA MM patients.  We have compared the frequency of IgH translocations in a series of data from 115 AA patients from three studies and EA patients from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies E4A03 and E9487.  We have also interrogated tumors from 45 AA and 196 EA MM patients for somatic copy number abnormalities associated with poor outcome.  In addition, 35 AA and 178 EA patients were investigated for a transcriptional profile associated with high-risk disease.  Overall, based on this cohort, genetic profiles were similar except for a significantly lower frequency of IgH translocations (40% vs. 52%; p=0.032) in AA patients.  Frequency differences of somatic copy number aberrations were not significant after correction for multiple testing. There was also no significant difference in the frequency of high-risk disease based upon gene expression profiling.  Our study represents the first comprehensive comparisons of the frequency and distribution of molecular alterations in MM tumors between AA and EA patients.

DESIGN
This submission contains 27 of the 45 African American cases analyzed by aCGH. In addition, 196 samples from European American myeloma patients were also analyzed and compared to the 45 African American patients.
