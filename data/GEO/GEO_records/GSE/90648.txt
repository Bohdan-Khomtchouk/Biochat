TITLE
A gene expression database for retinal neuron subtypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to define gene expression patterns of two mouse retinal ganglion cell subsets, labeled by expression of fluorescent proteins in Hb9-GFP and Drd4-GFP mice, all retinal ganglion cells labeled by anti-Thy1 antibody staining.

DESIGN
Neurons expressing GFP or labeled by fluorescent protein conjugated anti-Thy1 antibody were purified by flow cytometry. Two biological replicates, origniating from different litters, were collected for each cell type. RNA was extracted from sorted cells and prepared for hybridization to Affrymetrix microarrays.
