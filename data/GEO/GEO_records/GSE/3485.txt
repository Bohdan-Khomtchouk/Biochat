TITLE
Identification of LEDGF-regulated genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The LEDGF transcript from the PSIP1 gene was knocked down using RNAi technology. The resulting 293T derived cell line (293TsiLL) was compared to a control cell line (293TsiScram) using microarray analysis. Genes identified as being modulated by LEDGF were preferential targets of HIV integration. Keywords: gene knockdown effects

DESIGN
2 cell lines were used, 293TsiLL (experimental) and 293TsiScram (control). 4 independent cultures of each cell line were used for independent RNA extractions, labeling reactions and array hybridizations.
