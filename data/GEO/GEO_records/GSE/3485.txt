TITLE
Identification of LEDGF-regulated genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The LEDGF transcript from the PSIP1 gene was knocked down using RNAi technology. The resulting 293T derived cell line (293TsiLL) was compared to a control cell line (293TsiScram) using microarray analysis. Genes identified as being modulated by LEDGF were preferential targets of HIV integration. Keywords: gene knockdown effects
