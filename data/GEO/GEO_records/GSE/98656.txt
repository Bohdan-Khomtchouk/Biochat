TITLE
Expression data from C6 glioma and small molecule induced cells (SMiN)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we show that malignant glioma can be converted into fully differentiated neurons with no malignant characteristics through the combined action of two small molecules. Gene ontology and gene expression profiles related to cell division, gliogenesis, and angiogenesis were significantly down-regulated in SMiNs.

DESIGN
We investigated the various changes involving gene expression, cell-specific marker expression, signalling pathways, physiological characterization, and morphology in glioma after combination treatment with two small molecules (GSK3 inhibitor and cAMP activator).
