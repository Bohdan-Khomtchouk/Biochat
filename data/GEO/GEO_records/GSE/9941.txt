TITLE
Gene expression profiles after lentiviral transduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were transduced using lentivirus containing the  the triple fusion reporter gene fluc-mrfp-ttk. Microarray studies of hMSCs after transduction with the triple reporter genes using lentivirus were performed to study the effects of transduction on stem cell properties using an oligonucleotide human microarray. Transduced cells were sorted by FACS. Cells with high and low signals were ftacrtionated, and gene expression profiles were determined. Keywords: comparative study
