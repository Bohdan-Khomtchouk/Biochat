TITLE
Modulation of the cancer cell transcriptome by culture media formulations and cell density

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated how varying the composition of cell culture formulations and growing cancer cells at different densities might affect tumor cells genotype.  Specifically, we compared gene expression profiles generated by human MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells cultured in different media (MEM, DMEM, or RPMI 1640) containing different concentrations of fetal bovine serum (FBS) or different sera (equine or bovine) that were grown at different cell densities.

DESIGN
We have 6 different group (1. MDA-MB-231; MEM-10% FBS-90% confluence (MEM-1 and MEM-2). 2. MDA-MB-231; DMEM-10% FBS-90% confluence (DMEM-1 and DMEM-2). 3. MDA-MB-231; RPMI1640-10% FBS-90% confluence (RPMI-1 and RPMI-2) 4. MDA-MB-231; MEM-10% Horse serum-90% confluence (Horse-1 and Horse-2). 5. MDA-MB-231; MEM-0.1% FBS-90% confluence (FBS0.1-1 and FBS0.1-2). 6. MDA-MB-231; MEM-10% FBS-50% confluence (Con50-1 and Con50-2). Each group has duplicated. We analyzed; 1. Cell density (90% vs 50% confluence). 2. FBS concentration (10% FBS vs 0.1% FBS). 3. Sera (10% FBS vs 10% Horse serum). 4. Media (MEM vs DMEM vs RPMI1640)
