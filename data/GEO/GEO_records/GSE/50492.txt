TITLE
Late lag phase Inhibitor tolerant NRRL Y-50049 vs WT Y-12632 against furfural and HMF challenge

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Adapted tolerant yeast strain Y-50049 is able to in situ detoxify furfural and HMF while the wild type control Y-12632 repressed to loss function under challenges of 20 mM each of furfural and HMF

DESIGN
A time course study during the lag phase with cells harvested at 18, 24, 28, and 42 h after 20 mM furfural and 20 mM HMF treatment

PLATFORM
GPL17665 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 70-mer oligo DNA microarray
