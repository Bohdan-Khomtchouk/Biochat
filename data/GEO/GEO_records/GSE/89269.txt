TITLE
Post-infectious time-series DNA methylation analysis in gastric epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-series comprehensive DNA methylation analysis after EBV infection in the immortalised normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES1, and low methylation gastric cancer cell line, MKN7. Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 485,577 CpG sites. Samples included 9 GES1 with and without EBV infection, 5 MKN7 with and without EBV infection, EBV+ gastric cancer cell and xenograft, SNU719 and KT, 2 normal gastric mucosae, 2 low-methylation gastric cancer cases, and 2 high-methylation gastric cancer cases.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 20 samples were hybridised to the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
