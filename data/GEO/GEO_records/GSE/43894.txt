TITLE
Expression analysis of 3T3 cells that express Arabidopsis-derived Diaminopimelate Decarboxylase (DDC) in response to growth on meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) versus L-Lysine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed to investigate whether cells that express the L-Lysine-producing enzyme DDC exhibit any mRNA changes when grown on precursor DAP relative to L-Lysine.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from DDC-expressing 3T3 cells after 3 days in culture with amino acid precursor DAP, L-Lysine, or starved of both.
