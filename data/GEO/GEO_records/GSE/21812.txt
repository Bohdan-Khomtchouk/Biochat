TITLE
Hoxc9 ChIP-seq in differentiating motor neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of v5-tagged Hoxc9 is induced and ChIP-seq is used to profile genome-wide occupancy in differentiating motor neurons

DESIGN
The differentiation of ventral motor neurons is induced by treating embryonic stem cell cultures with retinoic acid and hedgehog signaling. Here, ChIP-seq is used to profile the genome-wide occupancy of Hoxc9 after five days of differentiation.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
