TITLE
Integrated genomics identifies a new AT/RT-like yet INI1-positive brain tumor subtype among primary pediatric embryonal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric embryonal brain tumor (PEBT), which includes medulloblastoma (MB), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), is the second most prevalent pediatric tumor type among brain tumors of childhood. AT/RT is highly malignant and is often misdiagnosed as MB and PNET. Distinguishing AT/RT from PNET/MB is of clinical significance since the survival rate of AT/RT patients is much lower. The diagnosis of AT/RT relies primarily on the morphologic assessment and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on a few known markers such as the lack of INI1 protein expression. However, in our clinical practice we observed several AT/RT-like tumors, which fulfilled histopathologic and all other biomarker criteria for AT/RT diagnosis, still showed retained INI1 immunoreactivity. Recent studies also reported retained INI1 immunoreactivity among certain diagnosed AT/RTs. It is therefore necessary to re-evaluate INI1(+), AT/RT-like cases. Sanger sequencing, array CGH and mRNA microarray analyses were performed on PEBT samples for studying their genomics landscapes. AT/RT and INI(+) AT/RT-like patients had similar survival rate, and global array CGH analysis and INI1 gene sequencing showed there is no differential chromosomal aberration marker between INI1(-) AT/RT and INI(+) AT/RT-like cases. We did not misdiagnose MB or PNET as AT/RT-like cases since transcriptome profiling revealed that not only AT/RT and INI(+) AT/RT-like cases expressed distinct mRNA and microRNA profiles, and their gene expression patterns were different from those of MBs and PNETs. AT/RTs shared the closest transcriptome profile to embryonic stem cells, INI1(+) AT/RT-like tumors were more similar to somatic neural stem cell, while MBs were closer to fetal brain. Novel biomarkers were identified to distinguish INI1(-) AT/RTs, INI1(+) AT/RT-like cases and MBs. Our studies disclosed a novel INI1(+) ATRT-like subtype among Taiwanese pediatric cases. New diagnostic biomarkers, as well as new therapeutic tactics, can be developed according to the transcriptome information unveiled in this work.

DESIGN
2 AT/RT-like cases and 7 AT/RT cases are subjected to transcriptome analysis.
