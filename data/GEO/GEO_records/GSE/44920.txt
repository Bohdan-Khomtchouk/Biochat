TITLE
Gene epxression profiling in murine bone marrow Lin- cells transduced with BCR-ABL and/or IRF8 followed by Flt3L culture for 5 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of BCR-ABL and IRF8 on gene expression pattern during in vitro dendritic cell differentiation, microarry analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow Lin- cells were transduced with retroviruses carrying human BCR-ABL cDNA and/or mouse Irf8 cDNA, and then cultured with Flt3L for 5 days. Two independent experiments were performed.
