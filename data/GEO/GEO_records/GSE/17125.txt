TITLE
DNA methylome of familial breast cancer identifies distinct profiles defined by mutation status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is now well understood that epigenetic alterations occur frequently in sporadic breast carcinogenesis, but little is known about the epigenetic alterations associated with familial breast tumors. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on familial breast cancers (n=33) to identify patterns of methylation specific to the different mutation groups (BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAx) or intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (basal, luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and normal-like). We used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (meDIP) on Affymetrix human promoter chips to interrogate methylation profiles across 25,500 distinct transcripts.

DESIGN
MeDIP of familial breast tumor DNA ( " b " =MeC antibody bound) compared to input DNA ( " i " = input) for each sample
