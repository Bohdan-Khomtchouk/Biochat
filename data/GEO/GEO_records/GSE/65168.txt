TITLE
Cellular and molecular characterization of the altered metabolism in RCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RCC cells (786-O) were transfected with VHL. The parental cell line should be compared to the transfectant (+Â VHL) under nomoxia as well as under hypoxia conditions. We want to distinct the VHL-mediated gene expression from the hypoxia-mediated and study the influence of both on the cellular metabolism.

DESIGN
RNA of VHL-negative 786-O RCC cell line and VHL-transfectants incubated during normoxia and hypoxia conditions were analysed by cDNA microarray.
