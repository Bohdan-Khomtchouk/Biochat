TITLE
Molecular effects of EtOH and Nicotine on normal human oral keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed gene expression microarry analysis to profile molecular alterations in normal human oral keratinocytes that are induced by EtOH and/or nicotine. Our goal is to examine molecular signatures that are dysregulated by EtOH or nicotine and define the effects of co-use of alcohol and nicotine on normal oral epithelial cells and potentially on carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary normal human oral keratinocytes were cultured and treated with various dose of EtOH (0, 20 and 50 mM) and cotreated with various dose of nicotine (0, 0.5 and 1uM) for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to gene expression microarray analysis using Affymetrix Human Genome 2.0 plus.
