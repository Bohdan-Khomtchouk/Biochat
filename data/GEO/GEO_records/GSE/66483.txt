TITLE
Expression data from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells wild type and lacking functional Pax7 gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myogenic differentiation relies on Pax7 function. We used embryonic stem cells lacking functional Pax7 to follow its role in derivation of skeletal myoblasts. Microarray analysis allowed us to compare transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiating embryonic stem cells of two genotypes, i.e. Pax7+/+ and Pax7-/- at day 7 and 21 of culture.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, embryiod bodies at day 7, and embryoid body outgrowths at day 21 of differentiation  were collected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
