TITLE
Utilizing single-cell variations to reveal environment-dependent tuning of network connectivity in human macrophages (RNA-Seq, CAGE and ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through analysis of gene expression and chromatin state, this study examines human monocyte-derived macrophages activated in vitro by various stimuli such as cytokines or microbial products

DESIGN
Macrophages, differentiated for 6 days from human blood monocytes using M-CSF (100ng/mL) cultured in X-vivo 15, were treated with stimuli for 18 or 24 hours and RNA and Chromatin collected for RNAseq (Illumina Truseq Ribo Zero stranded and mRNA unstranded protocols), ChIPseq (H3K27ac), and ATACseq.
