TITLE
Leukocyte accumulation in graft blood vessels during self-limiting acute rejection of rat kidneys Immunobiology

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Acute rejection episodes trigger chronic renal allograft vasculopathy. Numerous leukocytes, predominantly monocytes, accumulate in graft blood vessels during reversible acute rejection preceding chronic rejection of rat kidneys. We speculate that they contribute to transplant vasculopathy and set out to characterize them. Allogeneic renal transplantation was performed in the Fischer 344 to Lewis rat strain combination, Lewis isografts served as controls. Leukocytes were harvested by intensive perfusion of graft blood vessels and subjected to flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR and genome-wide transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
Kidneys of LEW and F344 rats were transplanted in LEW rats. Five biological replicates were performed for both isogenic and allogenic transplantation. Transcriptomes of allogenics were compared to isogenics on 5 dual-color hybridizations.
