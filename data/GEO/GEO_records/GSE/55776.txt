TITLE
Transcriptional response to stress in serum deprived mouse fibroblasts [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed gene expression profiling in order to identify targets of transcriptional response to stress in resting mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, either untreated (control) or treated with anisomycin to induce the p38/MAP kinase pathway.

DESIGN
Serum starved (72 h 0.2% FCS) mouse 3T3 cells were treated with anisomycin (188.5 nM) for 1 h (in duplicates). Untreated, serum-starved cells were used as a control. RNA was collected and gene expression profiling using strand-specific RNA-seq was performed.

PLATFORM
