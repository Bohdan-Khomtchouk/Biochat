TITLE
Effect of ligase on T7 based RNA linear amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification Table 3 This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of ligase used in the second strand cDNA synthesis on the fidelity of T7 based RNA linear amplification. BC2 total RNA was amplified with or without ligase using Affymetrix protocol. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
