TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of C. elegans - ets-4 Mutant Animals Vs Wild-type

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of WT (N2) C. elegans were compared to that of ets-4(ok165) and ets-4(uz1) mutant animals

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from L4 larval stage WT, ets-4(ok165) and ets-4(uz1) worms and used to detect the differences in gene expression profiles of ets-4 mutant animals from WT

PLATFORM
