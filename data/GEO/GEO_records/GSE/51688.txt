TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of ovarian cancer cell lines and normal cells. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles for approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples included 46 ovarian cancer cell lines, 4 normal counterparts and 8 controls.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 58 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
