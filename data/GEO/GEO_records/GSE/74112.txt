TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone marks, Sox2, Oct4 and PARP-1 in mES cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed to analyze genome-wide distribution of PARP-1 and histone marks H3K4me3, H3K27me3 in mES cells, and examine the effect of PARP-1 knockout on Sox2 and Oct4 genome-wide distribution in ES cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of  transcription factors were performed in WT or Parp-1-/- mESCs in duplicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2000
