TITLE
Estrogen Receptor Alpha Signaling in Cervical Cancer Associated Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are crucial in the genesis and progression of tumors. Cervical CAFs (C-CAFs) are less well characterized. Estrogen (E2) is considered a cofactor in cervical carcinogenesis. We studied the molecular signature of exvivo cultured C-CAFs from 4 early International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO, IB2) and 2 late (IIIA) stage disease using gene expression microarray. We found C-CAFs to be both pro-tumorigenic and moderately inflammatory; late stage C-CAFs were more actively metabolizing, and cycling, but expressed fewer genes related to immune function. We investigated the expression of ERα in exvivo cultured C-CAFs and studied the role of E2 in their biology by gene expression microarray in the presence of two ERα antagonists: ICI 182,780 and Methyl Piperidino Pyrazole (MPP). Both modulated C-CAF function by down regulating genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism, affecting angiogenesis and cancer progression, though their transcriptomes differed. MPP also down regulated genes involved in Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition. Thus, canonical ERα signaling is vital for C-CAF functioning. Interfering with paracrine signaling through fibroblast ERα may be worth exploiting as a targeted therapy in cervical cancer.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarray profiling of 4 early-stage E2 (estrogen) treated, 2 late-stage E2 treated, 2 early-stage ICI (ER-alpha antagonist) treated, 2 late-stage ICI treated and 2 early-stage MPP (ER-alpha antagonist) treated cervical cancer CAFs. E2 treated C-CAFs served as control.
