TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in YT and NK92 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNA expression profiles of of EBV-infected YT and NK92 cells are compared. YT cells have weaker expression of T-bet and IFNg than NK92 cells.  It was found that the EBV-encoded miR-BART20-5p inhibits the expression of T-bet and IFNg in YT cells.

DESIGN
Approximately 100 ng total RNAs from YT and NK92 cells  were used as the input. The GeneChip miRNA 2.0 array from Affymetrix, including probes for 44 EBV-encoded miRNAs and 1105 human miRNAs, was used. The experiments were performed in the microarray core laboratory of National Health Research Institute, Taiwan.
