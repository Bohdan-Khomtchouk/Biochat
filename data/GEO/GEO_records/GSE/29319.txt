TITLE
The effect of iron limitation on the transcriptome and proteome of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5: iron(II) chloride

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 comparing iron(II) chloride supplemented grown culture against non-iron treated grown culture in M9 minimal media

DESIGN
