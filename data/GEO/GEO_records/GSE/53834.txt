TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the liver of AIM+/+ and AIM-/- mice fed a high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of genes related to fibrosis was assessed in the liver of AIM+/+ and AM-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for various period. Overall, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of expression of fibrosis-related genes during the steatosis progression.

DESIGN
AIM+/+ and AIM-/- mice were fed an HFD for 0, 12 or 20 weeks. Liver samples were homogenized with Trizol, and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray experiments were performed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix).
