TITLE
Osmotic stress in Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b strain F2365 grown in BHI medium and BHI medium with 1.2% NaCl

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes strain F2365 to osmotic stress was examined. Based on a log2 scale, four and 24 genes were upregulated and downregulated by the stress, respectively.The expression level of ATP-binding cassette superfamily and ribosomal protein L2 genes were increased, whereas genes associated with PTS system, its metabolic enzymes, pathogenesis, and hypothetical protein were downregulated.

DESIGN
To examine the gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes grown in the medium added with or without 1.2% NaCl , L. monocytogenes strains 4b F2365 aminosilane-coated cDNA microarray slide was used. Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were used for cDNA labelling. Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). Each biological replicate included a flip dye assay.

PLATFORM
GPL9904 JCVI PFGRC Listeria monocytogenes 21K vt3a array designed primarily based on strain 4b F2365
