TITLE
Baseline Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors in the HCC1806 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immortalized human breast cancer cell line, HCC1806, was analyzed via RT-qPCR for transcript expression of selected cytokines and cytokine receptors associated with promotion of tumor vasculature and breast cancer metastasis

DESIGN
An array of inflammatory cytokines and matching receptors that have been associated with the promotion of tumor vasculature and breast cancer metastasis were identified based on literature and clinical data. Using this array, we screened normal breast tissue and seven breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF7, ZR-75, HCC1806, MDA-MB-231, HCC1954, SUM149), representing a range of breast cancer types. These results can be analyzed individually or used to compare the expression differences in normal breast tissue to breast cancer cell lines to identify potential mediators of autocrine or paracrine promotion of tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Each cell line is published separately in GEO.
