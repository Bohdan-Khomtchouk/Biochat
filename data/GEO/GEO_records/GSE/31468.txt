TITLE
Caulobacter strains ET163 and ET166 vs. CB15N (wild-type)

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides ; Caulobacter crescentus CB15

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the expression profiles of inversion strains ET163 and ET166 to that of wild-type.  To this end we performed transcriptional profiling of Caulobacter crescentus swarmer cells from strains ET163, ET166, and CB15N (WT).

DESIGN
Two strain experiment.  ET163 vs. WT and ET166 vs. WT.  Biological replicates: 2 ET163, 2 ET166, and 3 Wild-type

PLATFORM
GPL14163 Agilent-016938 MIT/Laub-Caulobacter-44k-v1.0
