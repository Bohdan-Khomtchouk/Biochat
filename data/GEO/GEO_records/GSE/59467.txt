TITLE
Cytochromes Associated with Fe(III) Oxide Reduction in the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Ferroglobus placidus

ORGANISM
Ferroglobus placidus

SUMMARY
Differential expression of electron transfer genes during growth with insoluble iron provided as an electron acceptor compared to soluble iron.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown with 10 mM acetate provided as electron donor and insoluble iron hydroxide provided as electron acceptor (experimental condition) and two separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown on 10 mM acetate with soluble iron citrate provided as electron acceptor (control condition).  Each chip measures the expression level of 2613 genes from Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 with nine 45-60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
