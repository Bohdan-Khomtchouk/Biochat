TITLE
Effects of (E)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (BF8) on E. coli RP437 persister cells (two biological replicates)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Eighteen genes in RP437 persister cells were consistently induced/decreased by treatment with 5 Âµg/mL BF8 for 1 h.

DESIGN
Persister cells were isolated from RP437 overnight cultures and treated with and without BF8 for microarray analysis.
