TITLE
Quality evaluation of Methyl Binding Domain based kits for enrichment DNA-methylation sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: to compare different Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) based kits for DNA-methylation sequencing using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) data for validation, and to determine whether data quality can also be derived from inherent sequence data characteristics

DESIGN
MBD-seq using 5 different kits (MethylCap, MethylCollector, MethylCollector Ultra, MethylMiner, MethylMagnet) was applied on 3 commonly used cell lines (DU145, HCT15, PC3), for which also RRBS data were generated.
