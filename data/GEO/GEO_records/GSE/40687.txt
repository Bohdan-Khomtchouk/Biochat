TITLE
The effect of TRPM2-AS depletion in human prostate carcinoma PC3 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is overwhelming evidence indicating that human cancer is a genetic disease caused by sequential accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, it is also increasingly apparent that cancer depends not only on mutations in these coding genes, but also on alterations in the large class of the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Here, we report that one such long ncRNA, TRPM2-AS, an antisense transcript in respect to TRPM2, a gene encoding for a ion channel activated by oxidative stress, is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer. High expression levels of either TRPM2-AS or of a related gene signature are linked to poor clinical outcome, with the related gene signature working also independently of the patient's Gleason score. Moreover, TRPM2-AS knock-out leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, with transcriptional profiling indicating an unbearable increase of cellular stress in dying cells, coupled to the down-regulation of several already known oncological targets. Considering that TRPM2-AS transcripts are barely detectable in healthy cells, these data strongly suggest that it, beside being a novel prognostic marker, is also a suitable therapeutic target in prostate cancer and establish a strong rationale for developing agents targeting either its expression or the expression of molecules in its pathway.

DESIGN
PC3 cells were transfeted  either a non-specific siRNA or with a TRPM2-AS siRNA in replicates. Cells were grown for 48 hours, then were harvested and RNA was isolated
