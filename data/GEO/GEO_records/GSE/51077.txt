TITLE
The tissue is the issue: Improved methylome analysis from paraffin-embedded tissues by application of the HOPE-technique

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of DNA  samples obtained from normal lung tissue and lung carcinoma, either fixed by formalin (FFPE), HOPE (paraffin embedded) or cryo-preserved. Illumina's HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450.000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 36 samples were hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
