TITLE
Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are associated with DNA hypermethylation in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the DNA methylation profiles of 12 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas harboring mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1 and IDH2, with 28 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas without these mutations. We profiled these samples with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and characterized over 2,000 genes that were hypermethylated in tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from fresh frozen tumors was bisulfite converted with the Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation kit, then hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
