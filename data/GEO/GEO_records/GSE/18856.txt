TITLE
Lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction by the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

SUMMARY
The ideal microorganism for consolidated biomass processing to biofuels has the ability to breakdown of lignocellulose. This issue was examined for the H2-producing, extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus growing on lignocellulose samples as well as model hemicellulose components. Identification of the enzymes utilized by the cell in lignocellulose saccharification was done using whole-genome transcriptional response analysis and comparative genomics.

DESIGN
C. saccharolyticus was subcultured (overnight) seven times on the substrate of interest in modified DSMZ 640 medium before inoculating a 1-liter batch containing 0.5 gram substrate per liter. Cells were grown at 70 °C until mid-logarithmic phase (3-5*107) and harvested by rapid cooling to 4 °C and centrifugation and then stored at -80 °C. To elucidate the transporters plus the central carbon metabolic pathways and their regulation utilized on the different sugars, transcriptome analysis was performed after growth on switchgrass, poplar, glucose and xylose.
