TITLE
Testing the effect of coordinate overexpression of the lovK-lovR two component system on the Caulobacter transcriptome

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
This experiment is testing the effects of coordinate overexpression of the lovK-lovR two-component system on gene expression in Caulobacter crescentus relative to an empty vector control strain.

DESIGN
Transcription in two independent cultures of a lovK-lovR overexpression strain (FC438) are compared to two independent cultures of an empty vector control strain (FC423)
