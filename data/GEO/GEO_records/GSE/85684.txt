TITLE
Gene expression signatures for miR-26a over-expression and negative control in hela cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to microRNA-26a over-expression, we have employed whole mRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform. Hela cells at 70–80% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Negative control mimics or miR-26a mimics (100nM) were transfected in each well. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, total RNA was checked for a RIN number to inspect RNA integration by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).
