TITLE
Cse4 ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In order to take an unbiased approach and discover all the locations of Cse4 in the genome, we utilized formaldehyde crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA microarrays. We analyzed the location of Cse4 in three different strains; one in which the endogenous Cse4 is tagged with 12Myc epitopes (Cse4-12Myc), and one which contained both the endogenous Cse4 (untagged) and an ectopic copy of Cse4-12Myc expressed from the GAL1-10 promoter (pGAL1-10-Cse4-12Myc), and one in which Cse4 is tagged with 3HA epitopes (Cse4-3HA).

DESIGN
ChIP-chip was performed using custom microarrays, to look at the genome-wide localization of the centromeric histone variant Cse4.  Biological replicates were performed for each Cse4 epitope-tagged strain
