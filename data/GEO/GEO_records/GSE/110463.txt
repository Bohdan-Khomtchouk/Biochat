TITLE
Transcriptional profile analysis of C. dubliniensis tlo mutants complemented with C. albicans TLO genes with and without peroxide

ORGANISM
Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
The ability of C. albicans TLO genes to mediate oxidative stress responses was characterised by expressing CaTLO1 and CaTLO4 in a C. dubliniensis TLO null mutant. Each complemented strain was grown with and without peroxide. The transcript profile of peroxide vs no peroxide cultures was analysed in 4 biological replicates for both CaTLO1 and CaTLO4.

DESIGN
1 experiemental parameter was analysed in quadruplicate in two complemented mutants (∆∆tlo::TLO1 and ∆∆tlo::TLO4)
