TITLE
Transcription profile of an azole resistant mutant of Mycobacterium truberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to detect differentially expresses genes in a spontaneous mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv resistant to azoles. We identified three adjacent upregulated genes encoding a transcription regulatory protein and two membrane proteins belonging to the family of RND efflux transporters.
