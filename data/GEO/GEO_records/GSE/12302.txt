TITLE
Transcription profile of an azole resistant mutant of Mycobacterium truberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to detect differentially expresses genes in a spontaneous mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv resistant to azoles. We identified three adjacent upregulated genes encoding a transcription regulatory protein and two membrane proteins belonging to the family of RND efflux transporters.

DESIGN
Hybridization were performed using RNA extracted from three different biological samples coming from cultures grown in mid-exponential phase.
