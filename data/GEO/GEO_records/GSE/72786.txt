TITLE
Brdt KO mice: Wild-type vs. Mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse pituitary tissue comparing WT with Brdt KO mice. Goal was to determine the effects of Brdt absence on pituitary gene expression.

DESIGN
Four pools each of total RNA (three mice per pool) extracted from Brdt-/- and wild-type mice. Biological replicates: 2 WT replicates, 2 Brdt KO replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL20889 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Gene Name version)
