TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis reveals major roles for protein quality control, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species scavenging during the acquisition of desiccation tolerance in the resurrection plant Boea hygrometrica

ORGANISM
Dorcoceras hygrometricum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of resurrection plant Boea hygrometrica comparing control untreated plants with plants treated with dehydration. Goal was to determine the different effects of desiccation with different rates, and drought acclimation on global gene expression in Boea hygrometrica .

DESIGN
8 conditions comparison: untreated plants vs. plants treated with rapid dehydration for 2h (RWC~80%) and 48h (RWC < 10%), untreated plants vs.plants treated with slow dehydration for 5d (RWC~80%) and 14d (RWC < 10%), untreated plants vs. drought acclimated plants treated with rapid dehydration for 2h (RWC~80%) and 48h (RWC < 10%). Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 treated replicates.

PLATFORM
