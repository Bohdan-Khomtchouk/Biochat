TITLE
Effect of in utero undernutrition on skeletal muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In utero undernutrition is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, although its effect on skeletal muscle remains poorly defined. We report that, in mice, adult offspring from undernourished dams have decreased energy expenditure, decreased skeletal muscle mitochondrial content, and altered energetics in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized muscle fibers. Strikingly, when these mice are put on a 40% calorie restricted diet they lose half as much weight as calorie restricted controls.  Our results reveal for the first time that in utero undernutrition alters metabolic physiology having a profound effect on skeletal muscle energetics and response to calorie restriction in adulthood.

DESIGN
We have used a mouse model of low birth weight generated through 50% food restriction of mouse dams during the third week of gestation. We have studied in utero food restricted offspring and control offspring that were not food restricted in utero in both the ad libitum and calorie restricted states. Gene expression profiling was performed on tibialis anterior muscle from 8 mice per group, pooled in pairs.
