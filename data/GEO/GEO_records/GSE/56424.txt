TITLE
MicroRNA expressions in human hepatocarcinoma cells in response to HBV X protein expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling of human Hep3B and HepG2 HCC cells comparing parental cancer cells with stable HBx-transfectants

DESIGN
In this study,two pairs of control and HBx-overexpressing HCC cells were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of microRNA.  miRNA microarray analysis was performed with mirVana miRNA Bioarrays V1 (Ambion) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions

PLATFORM
GPL18513 mirVANA miRNA Bioarray V1
