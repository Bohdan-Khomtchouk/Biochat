TITLE
Biological function of Pip3

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of bacterial wilt. Arabidopsis thaliana monogenic resistance to the strain GMI1000 is conferred by the RRS1-R gene, present in the resistant ecotype ND-1 and absent in the susceptible ecotype Col-0. The corresponding protein is recognized by the avirulence protein PopP2 of R. solanacearum. In order to identify the plant proteins involved in the PopP2/RRS1-R perception complex, the screening of a root cDNA library in yeast was performed using PopP2 as bait. One interactor found was called Pip3, and we would like to better understand its biological function. Thereby we choose to compare two RNAi lines with their wild type Nd-1 background, and one KO line with its wild type Col-0 background. Also, two overexpressor lines will be compared with their wilt type Nd-1 background and two with their Col-0 background.

DESIGN
27 samples were used in this experiment.
