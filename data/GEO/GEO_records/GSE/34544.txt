TITLE
Expression data from Porcine alveolar macrophages of piglets experimentally infected with Haemophilus parasuis serotype 4 (HPS4) for 28 days

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) play impoartant role in innate immunity. Haemophilus parasuis is the etiological agent of Glasser’s disease in pigs. Haemophilus parasuis is the etiological agent of Glasser’s disease in pigs. We used microarrays to study the transcriptome of PAMs infection with HPS4.

DESIGN
Healthy Pigs were inoculated intranasally with 2 ml of  4.5×108CFU/ml colony forming units of HPS4 strain MD0322. And the PAMs were isolated at 28 dpi. RNA extraction were extracted from PAMs that obtained from infection pigs and control pigs and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
