TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Vancomycin resistance in Stapyloccoccus aureus strains: 2275, 2279, 2276, 2277, 2278, and 2283.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Understanding novel mechanism bacteria ustilize in the clinics to become resistant to antibiotics is critical. The study aims to identify genes associated with Vancomycin resistance. Clinical isolates from a single patient with increasing resistance to vancomycin were grown in the presence and absence of vancomycin.Staphylococcus aureus strain 2275 is the reference for this series.

DESIGN
S. aureus isolates from a single patient were grown in the presence and absence of vancomycin over a 2 hour time course.  RNA samples were extracted at 30, 60 90 and 120 minutes post exposure to antibiotic.  Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos comparing mock treated and treated cells to the first strain isolated in the lineage. Differnetial gene expression patterns were determined.

PLATFORM
GPL10597 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 16K v9 array designed primarily based on strain USA300
