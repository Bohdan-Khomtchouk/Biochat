TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression by E2F3 L430Q knock-in mutation in MEF cells in normal proliferation and serum starvation conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of E2F3 L430Q knock-in mutation in gene expression level. The hypothesis tested was gain-of-function of E2F3 L430Q mutation would induce particular gene expression. Results help to identify novel E2F3 targeted genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from E2F3 L430Q MEF cells compared to wild type MEF cells in proliferation or serum starvation conditions.
