TITLE
cdc15 block-release

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cells were blocked in telophase using a cdc15-2 temperature senstive mutant at restrictive temperature. The culture was then shifted to permissive temperature (25oC), and released into the cell cycle. Samples were then taken during the course of almost three full cell cycles. This study is described in more detail in Spellman PT et al.(1998) Mol Biol Cell 9:3273-97 Keywords: time-course
