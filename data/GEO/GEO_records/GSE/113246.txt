TITLE
De novo transcriptome characterization of Nitraria sibirica Pall. under salt stress

ORGANISM
Nitraria sibirica

SUMMARY
We will use high-throughput sequencing technology to study gene expression under NaCl treatment, screen for differential expressed genes, and then analyze the gene regulation features. Nitraria sibirica Pall. seedlings were treated by 0, 100 and 400 mM NaCl with 3 replicatesï¼Œand the leaves were harvested after treated 3 days. Extracting total RNA of leaves and then sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. Our study provides a basis for the study of salt-tolerant gene resources in Nitraria sibirica Pall.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from Nitraria sibirica Pall. leaves which treated by 0, 100 and 400 mM NaCl for 3 days with 3 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL24900 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Nitraria sibirica)
