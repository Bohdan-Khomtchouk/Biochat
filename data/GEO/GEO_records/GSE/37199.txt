TITLE
Blood mRNA expression signatures derived from unsupervised analyses identify prostate cancers with poor outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Inter-patient prostate cancer (PrCa) heterogeneity results in highly variable patient outcomes. Multi-purpose biomarkers to dissect this heterogeneity are urgently required to improve treatment and accelerate drug development in PrCa. Circulating biomarkers are most practical for evaluating this disease. We pursued the analytical validation and clinical qualification of blood mRNA expression arrays. Methods: Whole blood samples were collected into PaxGeneTM tubes from PrCa patients: 31 good prognosis patients selected for active surveillance (AS) and 63 advanced castration resistant PrCa (CRPC) patients. RNA was extracted, amplified, biotinylated, and hybridised to Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays and analysis of genome-wide expression profiles were analysed using Bayesian Latent Process Decomposition (LPD). Findings: LPD analysis of the mRNA expression data divided the evaluable patients (n=94) into 4 separate groups. LPD1 and LPD2 consisted almost entirely of CRPC patients (14/14; 17/18); LPD3 (15/31) and LDP4 (12/21) comprised both AS and CRPC. Ten patients were unclassifiable by LPD analysis. LPD1 CRPC patients had significantly poorer overall survival (median 10.7 months, CI-95% 4.2-17.2) than CRPC patients in LPD2 to 4 (median 26.5 months, CI-95% 18.1-34.9, p=0.00007). LPD 1 membership remained the strongest prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (HR 5.0, CI-95% 2.1-11.9, p=0.0002). Gene signatures in the poor prognosis LPD group 1 were associated with increased CD71+ early erythroid cells and decreased B-cell and T-cell immune response. A 9-gene signature, that was validated by RT-PCR studies, classified patients as group LPD 1 with a very low misclassification rate (1.2%). Interpretation: Poor PrCa outcome can be predicted using gene expression signatures from whole blood and merits further evaluation in predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarker studies for novel anticancer drugs including immune therapies.

DESIGN
107 blood samples were collected in paxgene tubes from 94 prostate cancer patients (31 good prognosis & 63 advanced castration resistant PrCa). Replicates include 9 biological replicates and four technical replicates
