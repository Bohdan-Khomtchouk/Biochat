TITLE
Comparison of the gene expression of periimplantitis affected peri-implant tissue and healthy peri-implant tissue in vivo in human.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we want to ascertain the differences and similarities of infected and inflammated peri implant tissue versus healthy peri implant tissue at the mRNA level.

DESIGN
Six of the patients where affected by periimplantitis. In situ dental implants where explanted because of inflammation and non-integration. From two patients, implants were explanted because of wrong placement. They where classified as implants with healthy periimplant tissue.
