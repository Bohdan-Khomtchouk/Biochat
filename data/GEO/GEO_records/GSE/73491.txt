TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of Huh7 and JMJD5KO Huh7 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the roles of JMJD5 in liver cells, we performed DNA microarray analysis by using JMJD5KO Huh7 cells. We noticed that several transcriptional factors involved in differentiation to hepatocytes were down-regulated in JMJD5KO Huh7 cells compared to parent Huh7 cells..

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis was performed by one-color experiments.
