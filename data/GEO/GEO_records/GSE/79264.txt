TITLE
Global gene transcriptional profiles of  RAW 264.7 cells following the infection with Brucella abortus wild and mutant strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We focused on whether transposon mutagenesis in Brucella abortus could induce difference in the trascriptional responses of RAW 264.7 cell infection model compared to the wild strain infected RAW 264.7 cells. The function of genes in Brucella abortus was analyzed through the identified differences in gene expression between RAW 264.7 cell infected with wild and mutant strains.

DESIGN
We analyzed altered transcription in RAW 264.7 cells at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h following the infection with 10 MOI of Brucella abortus wild and mutant strains.
