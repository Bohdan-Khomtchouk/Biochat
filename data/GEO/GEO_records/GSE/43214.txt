TITLE
Plasma cells from spleen were FACS sorted using Blmp1 and CD138 expression and gene expression compared to na√Øve B cells, FACS sorted using B220 and IgD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA extracted from plasma cells purified from spleens  were examined by Illumina microarray for gene expression. This was correlated with location and stage of differentiation using Blimp1 expression as a divider. All plasma cell samples were then compared to resting follicular B cells.

DESIGN
Two plasma cell populations were sorted from pools of 5 - 10 animals. Arrays used in Peperzak et al., 2013, Figure 3d
