TITLE
Effect of Bach2 overexpression in BCL6+/+ and -/- BCR-ABL1 transformed pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim was to investigate how BCL6 genotype affects Bach2 dependent gene expression changes.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profiles of BCL6+/+ and BCL6-/- BCR-ABL1 transformed pre-B cells after inducible overexpression of Bach2.
