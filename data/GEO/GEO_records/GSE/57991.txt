TITLE
miRNAs involed in lactation of cow mammary gland

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We investigated miRNA expression in Holstein dairy cow of mammary gland with different producing quality milk using high-throughput sequence and qRT-PCR techniques. miRNA libraries were constructed from mammary gland tissues taken from a high producing quality milk and a low producing quality milk Holstein dairy cow, the small RNA digitalization analysis based on HiSeq high-throughput sequencing takes the SBS-sequencing by synthesis.The libraries included 4732 miRNAs. A total of 124 miRNAs in the high producing quality milk mammary gland showed significant differences in expression compared to low producing quality milk mammary gland (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study provides a broad view of the bovine mammary gland small RNA expression profile characteristics. Differences in types and expression levels of miRNAs were observed between high producing quality milk and a low producing quality milk Holstein dairy cow

DESIGN
Examination of 3 group of different producing quality milk mammary gland of Holstein dairy cow,each group has 3 sample

PLATFORM
GPL15749 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Bos taurus)
