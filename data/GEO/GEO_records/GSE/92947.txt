TITLE
Gene expression signatures for lens in Msx2CKO mice and wildtype mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For a deeper understanding of the possible mechanism, we performed RNA microarray analysis with lens isolated from Msx2WT and Msx2CKO mice of P1.The results showed there were 3412 DEGs with more than 2 fold expression change in the Msx2CKO lens, 1815 genes were  up-regulated and 1597 genes were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from lens isolated from Msx2cko and Msx2wt mice at P1 using RNeasy micro kit (Cat#74004,  QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany), and Msx2wt lens were used as control. Total RNA was amplified and labeled by Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, One-Color (Cat.# 5190-2305, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Labeled cRNA were purified by RNeasy mini kit (Cat.# 74106, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany).The microarrays were carried out by Shanghai  biotechnology corporation using One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, and subsequent analyses conducted  using SAS statistical software online ( http://sas.ebioservice.com/ ).
