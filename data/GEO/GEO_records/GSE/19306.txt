TITLE
Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in mice transduced in utero with feline immunodeficiency virus-based vectors (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fetal mice (16 days gestation) were administered feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based lentiviral viral particles containing the gene encoding GFP.  Six liver tumors developed in three mice between the ages of 273 and 484 days, each mouse developed 2 tumors. These tumors and non-tumorous liver tissue from the same animals and animals that did not develop tumors and untransduced controls were harvested and microarrays were performed on total RNA extracted from these samples. We were interested in investigating the link between lentiviral integration and gene expression. Keywords: Comparison of HCC with non-tumorous liver tissue adjacent to tumor.

DESIGN
Fourteen samples were analyzed in total: Two tumors from each of three mice (6 samples); surrounding non-tumorous liver tissue from each of these three mice (3 samples); two female mice and one male mouse that were transduced and did not develop tumors (3 samples); one female and one male untransduced mouse (2 samples). The samples were performed in two runs: one containing the samples from female mice and the second containing samples from male mice.
