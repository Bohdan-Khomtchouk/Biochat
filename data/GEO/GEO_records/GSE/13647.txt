TITLE
Identification of MucR regulatory targets

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis bv. 1 str. 16M

SUMMARY
The transcriptional regulator MucR was identified as highly attenuated in a mutagenesis screen conducted by this laboratory.  MucR has been described as a key regulator of exopolysaccharide synthesis in closely related Rhizobials soil symbionts.  The goal of this study was to apply custom Brucella melitensis oligonucleotide microarrays to identify the regulatory targets of MucR.  These studies revealed that MucR's regulation of exopolysaccharide synthesis is also conserved in Brucella melitensis and is also a key regulator of iron sequestering/storage and denitrification. Keywords: Microarray comparison of a genetically modified organism compared to wild type.

DESIGN
There are 3 biological replicates isolated from Brucella melitensis wild type 16M and from 16Mâˆ†mucR.

PLATFORM
GPL7612 ASU Brucella melitensis 13K oligo array v1.0
