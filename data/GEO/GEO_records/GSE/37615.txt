TITLE
Amniocytes (AM) vs. Immortalized AM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of AM (amniocytes) vs. three different immortalized AM-derived cell lines. Immortalization of AM-derived cell lines by lentiviral vector with hTERT and E6-E7.

DESIGN
Different experimental conditions: AM (amniocytes) vs. MePR-0A (immortalized AM-derived epitheloid cell line), MePR-2B (immortalized AM-derived fibroblastoid cell line) and MePR-3A (immortalized AM-derived fibroblastoid cell line). Biological replicates: 2 for each sample, independently grown and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
