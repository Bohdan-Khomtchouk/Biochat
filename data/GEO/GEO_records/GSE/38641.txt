TITLE
Expression of small RNA in Aphis gossypii and its potential role in the resistance interaction with melon

ORGANISM
Aphis gossypii

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify the sRNAs in Aphis gossypii (cotton-melon aphid) during Vat-mediated resistance in teraction with melon

DESIGN
Methods: Whole insects were collected from susceptible (Vat-) and resistant (Vat+) plants after 48 hours of feeding. Total RNA was extracted from the aphids and enriched for LMW RNA and small RNA libraries were constructed using standard protocols and deep sequenced using Illumina GAII analyzer.

PLATFORM
GPL15685 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Aphis gossypii)
