TITLE
Targets of FGFR2-IIIb signalling in the hair follicle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
rationale: comparison of gene expression profiles in wildtype and Foxn1::dnFGFR2-IIIb transgenic hair follicles; identification of targets that mediate the effects seen in transgenic hair follicles results: as already suggested by the phenotype, the molecular abnormalities appear to be restricted to the hair shaft medulla; Igfbp5 is an important mediator of transgene-dependent effects Keywords: ordered
