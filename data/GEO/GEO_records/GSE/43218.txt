TITLE
Gene expression profile changes in HDAC6 knockdown HT1080 cells cells after TLR3 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TLR3 stimulation by extracellular dsRNA (e.g. polyIC) induces expression of numerous genes. The knockdown of HDAC6 prior to TLR3 stimulation leads to an ablation of expression of IRF-3-dependent genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from HT1080 cells expressing control-shRNA or HDAC6-shRNA, after 6 h of treatment with dsRNA (polyIC), compared to untreated controls
