TITLE
Interaction effects of knockdown of PML and TNFalpha treatment in HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the interaction effects between promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene knockdown and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we transfected control or two independent PML siRNAs into HUVEC cells without or with 20 ng/mL TNFalpha treatment for 20 h. The total RNA was extracted for gene expression microarray analyses.

DESIGN
The experiment is a 3x2 two-factor design. One factor is siRNA and it has three levels (siCtrl, siPML1, siPML2). siCtrl is RISC-inducing non-targeting control siRNA. siPML1 and siPML2 designate two independent siRNAs against the PML gene. Two independent siRNAs were used to eliminate the off-target effects of siRNA. The other factor is TNFalpha treatment (20 ng/mL for 20 h) and it has two levels: Untreated (U) or Treated (T). Each sample has technical duplicates.
