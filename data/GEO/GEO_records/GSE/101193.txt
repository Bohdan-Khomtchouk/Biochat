TITLE
Identify the expression of lncRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of lncRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have not been well researched. Therefore, we identified the lncRNA expression profiles in PBMCs from female patients with RA and explored the possible role of the abundantly expressed lncRNAs in RA.

DESIGN
3 pairs of samples were mixed with equivalent PBMCs from 27 female RA patients and 27 corresponding healthy controls, which were randomly divided into three groups according to age.
