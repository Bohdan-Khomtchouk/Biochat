TITLE
Genome-wide maps of HSF1 and HSF2 binding sites in cycling and mitotic human K562 cells in optimal growth conditions and upon heat stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide characterization of binding sites for heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF2 in freely cycling and mitotic K562 cells in optimal growth conditions and upon 30 min heat stress at 42C

DESIGN
Examination of HSF1 and HSF2 target loci in non-treated and heat treated K562 cells that are either unsynchronized (cycling) or synchronized to mitosis (mitotic). Input serves as background control, IgG is used as negative antibody control.

PLATFORM
