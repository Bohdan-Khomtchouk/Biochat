TITLE
Gene level expression profiling of colorectal cancer tissue samples (test sample series)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series is part of a larger series (GSE24549) of colorectal cancer tissue samples analyzed for global gene expression. The expression measures were used to develope a gene signature for prediction of prognosis in stage II and III colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of colorectal cancer tissue samples for prognosis prediction.
