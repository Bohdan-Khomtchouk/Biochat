TITLE
Exosomal miRNAs released by neural stem/progenitor cells versus astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An Affymetrix microRNA (miRNA) Array was used to compare exosomal miRNAs released by hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells (htNSC), hippocampal NSC (hippoNSC) and astrocytes in primary culture. This assay is to provide preliminary information on the general profile of exosomal miRNAs released by these cells, while to study any particular miRNA species should require further quantitative analyses such as qPCR based on enough sample sizes.

DESIGN
Exosomal RNAs were obtained from the culture media of htNSC, hippoNSC and astrocytes, adjusted to the same amount  and run through an Affymetrix miRNA Array chip.
