TITLE
Developmental time-course study of Drosophila melanogaster, D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. sim x D.s sec hybrids

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to test the hypothesis that adult hybrid misexpression results from the cascading effect of earlier-expressed developmentally important improperly regulated genes, as well as address whether Von Baer’s 3rd law (suggesting that earlier stages of development should be more similar between species than later stages) holds at the level of gene expression, we conducted whole-transcriptome Drosophila melanogaster cDNA microarray-based expression profiling of males of D. melanogaster, D. sechellia, and D. simulans, at four synchronized developmental time-points (3rd instar larval [larval], early pupal, late pupal, and newly-emerged adult [adult]). D. simulans and D. sechellia shared a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) ~0.5 to 1.0 million years ago (MYA) and form a clade that shared an MRCA with D. melanogaster approximately 5.4 MYA. In addition, we also performed the same analysis on the male interspecific F1 hybrids of the D. simulans (♀) × D. sechellia (♂) cross.
