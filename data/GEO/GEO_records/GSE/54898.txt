TITLE
OSLN Reprogramming cells: empty vector vs. HIF2α over-expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Oct4, Sox2, Lin28 and Nanog (OSLN) reprogramming cell of empty vector compared to HIF2α over-expression at the early stage (day 12) and the late stage(day 30) using fibroblasts MRC5 and IMR90

DESIGN
Eight-condition experiment, empty vector vs. HIF2α over-expression cells, at early stage vs. late stage, and fibroblasts MRC5 vs. IMR90

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
