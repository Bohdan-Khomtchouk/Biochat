TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of High Altitude Polycythemia in Han Chinese migrated to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long term-exposed to high altitude, the increased numbers of red blood cells tend to stabilize to a certain extend in most people, but someone will occur over-increasing in number of red blood cells, which cause a serious of clinical symptoms and signs, and this is high altitude polycythemia. EPO-EPOR system may be the main reasons for erythroid progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in early exposion to plateau, but, in the late, there may be other factors involved in the regulation of erythropoiesis in bone marrow, multiple factors working together lead to excessive red blood cell proliferation. We compared gene expression profiling of leukocytes in peripheral blood from high altitude polycythemia patients with those from matched controls.

DESIGN
Subjects consisting of 5 masculine Han Chinese patients with HAPC (diagnosed according to international consensus statement on HAPC) and 5 matched controls, were migrants at River of TUOTUO area (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, 4550 m). Each of the five HAPC patients was matched to each of the control: gender, nationality, birthplace, duration migrating to plateau, height of location, work intensity. Peripheral blood samples were obtained at 4550m plateau from above subjects. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes. The gene expression profilings were analysed by Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
