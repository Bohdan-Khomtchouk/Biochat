TITLE
Mechanism for Fe(III) Reduction in Pelobacter carbinolicus

ORGANISM
Pelobacter carbinolicus

SUMMARY
Pelobacter carbinolicus is phylogenetically intertwined with the Geobacteraceae, a family of deltaproteobacteria which couple oxidation of organic compounds to Fe(III) reduction.  Whereas Geobacter species completely oxidize organic compounds to CO2, Pelobacter species either ferment or oxidize short chain alcohols to acetate.  Pelobacter species also contain far fewer c-type cytochromes, proteins which play a role in electron transfer during Fe(III) respiration,  compared to their Geobacter counterparts. Keywords: two-condition comparison

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were hybridized in duplicate.  Experimental (FeIII) was labeled with cy5, control (acetoin) was labeled with cy3.
