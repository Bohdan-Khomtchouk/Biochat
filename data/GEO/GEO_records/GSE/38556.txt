TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of monocytes in LTNPs and Chronic HIV patients (CHI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We extracted total RNA from monocytes in 3 different patient groups, LTNPs, CHIs and Healthy Controls (HCs) in order to determine differentially expressed miRNA between these groups and to compare the results to a previous study on the same patients CD4+ T cells (GSE24022).

DESIGN
In this study total RNA was extracted from 8 LTNPs, 8 CHIs and 8 HCs before being run on an agilent miRNA microarray
