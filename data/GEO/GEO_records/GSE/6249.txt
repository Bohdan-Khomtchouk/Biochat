TITLE
Expression data from adrenal glands from normoxic and hypoxic neonatal rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that changes in adrenal gene expression mediate the increased plasma corticosterone and steroidogenesis in rat pups exposed to hypoxia from birth. Keywords: effects of hypoxia on adrenal steroidogenesis in the neonatal rat

DESIGN
In the current study, rat pups (with their dams) were exposed to hypoxia from birth and compared to pups from normoxic dams fed ad libitum.  Adrenal glands were collected from normoxic and hypoxic pups at PD7and pooled (N=24/sample; 4 samples per treatment group) for total RNA extraction.  Microarray analysis was performed, followed by verification with real-time PCR.  Furthermore, the expression of selected genes involved in adrenal function was analyzed by real-time PCR, regardless of microarray results.
