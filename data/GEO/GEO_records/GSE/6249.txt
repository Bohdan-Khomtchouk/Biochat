TITLE
Expression data from adrenal glands from normoxic and hypoxic neonatal rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that changes in adrenal gene expression mediate the increased plasma corticosterone and steroidogenesis in rat pups exposed to hypoxia from birth. Keywords: effects of hypoxia on adrenal steroidogenesis in the neonatal rat
