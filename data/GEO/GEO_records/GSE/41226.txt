TITLE
Expression data from G9a knockdown ovarian cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G9a depleted SKCO3 cells were used to identify genes regulated by G9a-dependent epigenetic regulations We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying paritoneal dissemination and identified distinct classes of G9a-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cells receiving G9a-specific shRNAs were analyzed compare to cells receiving control shRNA
