TITLE
Distinct human stem cell populations in small and large intestine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The intestine is composed of an epithelial layer, containing rapidly proliferating cells that mature into two distinct anatomic regions, the small and the large intestine. Although previous studies have identified stem cells as the cell-of-origin for the whole intestine, no studies have compared stem cells derived from the small and large intestine. Here, we report intrinsic differences between these two populations of cells.  Primary epithelial cells isolated from human fetal small and large intestine and expanded with Wnt agonist, R-spondin 2, displayed differential expression of stem cell markers and separate hierarchical clustering of gene expression involved in differentiation, proliferation and disease pathways. Using a three-dimensional in vitro differentiation assay, single cells derived from small and large intestine formed distinct organoid architecture with cellular hierarchy similar to that found in primary tissue. Our characterization of human fetal intestinal stem cells defies the classical definition proposed by most where small and large intestine are repopulated by an identical epithelial stem cell and raises the question of the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic cues in the development of intestinal diseases. 

DESIGN
12 samples were analyzed. They consisted of human fetal small and large intestine (SI; n=6 and LI; n=6) stem cells, expanded with Wnt agonist and R-spondin 2. Differential expression of genes in epithelial cells from both the large and small intestine were observed.
