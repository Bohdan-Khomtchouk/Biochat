TITLE
RT quantitative PCR analysis of Rosveratrol plus N-acetylcysteine of oxidative stress and inflammation genes in rat choclea.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Two month-old male Wistar rats received either resveratrol (10 mg/kg) plus N-acetylcysteine (400 mg/kg) or vehicle during 5 consecutive days. The second day of treatment, a concentrated solution of kanamycin and furosemide was placed on the round window of the right ears of rats receiving treatment or vehicle. Hearing was assessed by recording auditory brainstem responses before and 5, 16 and 23 days after starting the treatment with resveratrol and N-acetylcysteine. Cochlear samples were taken at the end of the treatment (5 days) and once the treatment had been suspended (23 days) to study cochlear cytoarchitecture and the evolution of the expression of oxidative stress, antioxidant defense and inflammation genes by using PCR arrays and RT-qPCR.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Cochlea samples from 3-6 animals per group were analised.  The expression of genes related to oxidative stress, antioxidant defense, and inflammation was studied at 5 and 23 days after the initiation of the 5 days treatment with resveratrol plus NAC.

PLATFORM
GPL22246 Rat oxidative stress and antioxidant defense RT2 profiler PCR array
