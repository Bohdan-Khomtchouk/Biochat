TITLE
Whole-transcriptome profiling analysis of first trimester placental villi in Indian women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-transcriptome profiles of individual human placental villi samples from twenty-five (25) Indian women with normal pregnancies during 6- to 8-weeks of gestation were examined using human whole genome expression arrays (NimbleGen 135K).

DESIGN
The present study focused on the whole-transcriptome profiling using NimbleGen135K (070925_HG18_exp__12X135K) human whole genome expression arrays of individual human placental villi samples obtained from twenty-five (25) proven-fertile women bearing normal pregnancies voluntarily terminated between 6- and 8-weeks of gestation. Gestational age was estimated from menstrual history, physical and ultrasonographic evaluation. No case of complicated pregnancy from infection, and other significant fetal and maternal clinical indications was included. These twenty five (25) samples include biological replicates of 6, 7 and 8 weeks placental villi samples.
