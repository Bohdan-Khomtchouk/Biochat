TITLE
3 quorum sensing signals add in microarray comparison in Yersinia pestis at 30°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
The quorum-sensing system has been linked to diverse phenotypes and regulatory changes in pathogenic bacteria. In strain CO92, the AI-2 signal is produced in a luxS-dependent manner, reaching maximal levels of 2.5 μM in late logarithmic growth, and both wild type and pigmentation mutant strains made equivalent levels of AI-2. Yersinia pestis CO92 possesses a chromosomal lsr locus encoding factors involved in the binding and import of AI-2, and confirming this assignment, an lsr deletion increased extracellular pools of AI-2. To assess the functional role of 3 quorum sensing singlas in Y. pestis, microarray study was conducted comparing the 3 quorum sensing signals added in to control at 30°C to mimic the flea gut. Here, the ΔPgm (pigmentation-negative) R88 strain was used. The three signals are one AI-2 and two AHLs (N-(3-Oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-Hexanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone).The control consisted of cells grown and treated under the same conditions without added signals.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from 3 signals add in cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from control cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. A dye-swap design was used to remove the Cy5 and Cy3 dye bias.
