TITLE
Role of IgD in B cell anergy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define the global landscape of mRNA changes in anergic B cells, and how this affected by surface IgD, mature CD93-CD23+ HEL-binding B cells were sorted from spleens of independent transgenic mice of the following genotypes: MD4, na√Øve B cells coexpressing IgM and IgD; MD4:ML5, anergic B cells coexpressing IgM and IgD; MM4, naive B cells expressing only IgM; MM4:ML5, anergic B cells expressing only IgM; DD6, naive B cells expressing only IgD; DD6:ML5, anergic B cells expressing only IgD.

DESIGN
Spleen cells from independent mice of each genotype were sorted on each of three sorting days (sort 1, 2, 3) and frozen. RNA was isolated from all frozen samples as a single batch and labelled and hybridized as a single experiment.
