TITLE
Stem cell factor Sox2 regulates the tumorigenic potential in human gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is still one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide, which is mainly attributable to late diagnosis and poor treatment options. Infection with H. pylori, different environmental factors and genetic alterations are known to influence the risk of developing gastric tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis are still not fully understood, making it difficult to design targeted therapeutic approaches. Aberrant expression of the specific gastric differentiation marker Sox2 (sry-related HMG box 2) has been observed in stomach cancer. However, the role of Sox2 in gastric tumors has not been well established to date. To elucidate the role of Sox2 in gastric tumorigenesis, Sox2 transcriptional activity was blocked in AZ521 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of Sox2 reduced cell proliferation and migration, increased apoptosis and induced changes in cell cycle. Blocking of Sox2 also reduced the tumorigenic potential of AZ521 cells in vivo. In addition, correlation of Sox2 expression and proliferation was observed in a subset of human gastric tumours. Finally, target genes of Sox2 were for the first time identified by RNA microarray in gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that Sox2 controls several aspects related to gastric cancer development and progression by regulating the expression of members of important signalling pathways. These findings could provide new therapeutic options for a subset of gastric cancers exhibiting Sox2 deregulation.
