TITLE
Functional analysis of HSFB transcription factors [32Â°C]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify biological function of HSFB transcriptional repressor, we subjected hsfb1 hsfb2b double mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis plant under heat condition (32 Celsius degree) and did microarray experiment. The microarray experiment under non-heated condition is described in GSE14702. We found expression of many heat-shock proteins (HSPs) is not fully enhanced in the double mutant when compared to wild-type plant. This data suggest that the inhibition of expression of HSPs in non-heated condition is important for fully heat-stress response in plant.

DESIGN
hsfb1 hsfb2b double mutant vs. wild-type seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana subjected under heat condition (32 Celsius degree). Biological replicates: 4  replicates.
