TITLE
Cytokine interactome alterations promote oropharyngeal Epstien-barr virus (EBV) replication and shedding during HIV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proteomic analysis of cytokines in unstimulated oropharyngeal secretions. Epstein-barr virus (EBV) is a type 1 carcinogen which causes many cancers in humans. Here we explored the cytokine involvement of the EBV replication process in the oropharynx. Cytokine interactomic profiles were geneerated to understand the involved signalling pathways in HIV infected group and the healthy group. Proteome profilers were used to understand the major cytokine expression levels that are related to infection and immune regulation.

DESIGN
We analyzed unstimulated oropharyngeal samples (UOPS) from 42 healthy subjects and 72 HIV positive subjects using the R & D Proteome Profiler array panels. No techinical replicates were performed. 14 samples in HIV group without therapy (NHAART group); 58 HIV patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group); 42 samples in healthy group
