TITLE
Catalogue of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs following activation of human and mouse innate immunity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Despite increasing evidence to indicate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel regulators of immunity, there has been no systematic attempt to identify and characterise the lncRNAs whose expression are changed following the induction of the innate immune response. To address this issue, we have employed next generation sequencing data to determine the changes in the lncRNA profile in LPS-stimulated human macrophages, IL1beta-stimulated human airway A549 epithelial cells and and LPS-stimulated mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed in human macrophages (Ribozero isolated), human alveolar A549 epithelial cells (polyA+ isolated) and mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages (polyA+ isolated) at 4h following exposure to media (control) or LPS (human macrophages and mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages) or IL1beta (human epithelial A549 cells)

PLATFORM
