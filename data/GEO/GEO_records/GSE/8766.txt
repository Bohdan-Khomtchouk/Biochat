TITLE
Early embryoid body differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem (ES) cells, when grown in suspension culture without feeders, spontaneously form round structures known as embryoid bodies. Given the appropriate conditions, these cells can differentiate over time into precursors of all three germ layers. Embryoid bodies, in a disorganized way, mimic early embryonic development to a certain extent and can be used as a synchronously differentiating large scale source of tissue for the study of biological determinants of early differentiation. Embryoid bodies have been used as a source for most early protocols that derive specific differentiated cell types from undifferentiated ES cells, although some protocols, notably those that derive neurons from ES cells, have moved on from EBs as a result of varying replicability and yield. We have decided to look at the transcriptomic profiles of embryoid bodies during the initial stages of embryoid body formation and differentiation, in order to pinpoint novel determinants of key developmental stages. Keywords: time course
