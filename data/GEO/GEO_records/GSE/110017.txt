TITLE
A novel CD4 T cell population expanded in SLE blood provides B cell help through IL10 and succinate [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ATAC-seq analysis of CD4 T cell populations obtained in blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The overall goal of this study was to determine chromatin accessibility profiles in Tfh cells and CXCR3+ PD1hi CD4+ T cells obtained from blood of SLE donors.

DESIGN
CXCR3+ PD1hi CD4+ T cells and Tfh cells were sorted by flow cytometry and ATAC-seq was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
