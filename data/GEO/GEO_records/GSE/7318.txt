TITLE
Overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative form of tao-1

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Tao-1 is a member of evolutionarily conserved family of ste20-related serine/threonine kinases that regulate fundamental cellular processes including apoptosis. Drosophila tao-1 is expressed in pole cells during embryogenesis. To identify genes that act downstream of tao-1 in the pathway within pole cells, we compared the gene expression profiles of pole cells expressing dominant-negative form Tao-1 (D168A) and wild-type Tao-1 (D168D) by microarray analysis. Keywords: wild type v.s. dominant-genative form
