TITLE
Overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative form of tao-1

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Tao-1 is a member of evolutionarily conserved family of ste20-related serine/threonine kinases that regulate fundamental cellular processes including apoptosis. Drosophila tao-1 is expressed in pole cells during embryogenesis. To identify genes that act downstream of tao-1 in the pathway within pole cells, we compared the gene expression profiles of pole cells expressing dominant-negative form Tao-1 (D168A) and wild-type Tao-1 (D168D) by microarray analysis. Keywords: wild type v.s. dominant-genative form

DESIGN
The following embryos were used as source material: E1 and R1, Stage 8-14 embryos derived from nosGal4:VP16/nosGal4:VP16 females (E1) and yw females (R1) mated with UAS-tao-1(D168A); EGFP-Vas males;E2 and R2, Stage 8-14 embryos derived from nosGal4:VP16/nosGal4:VP16 females (E2) and yw females (R2) mated with UAS-tao-1(D168D); EGFP-Vas males. Pole cells were isolated from these embryos by using FACS. We compared gene expression profiles between E1 and R1 pole cells, and between E2 and R2 pole cells.
