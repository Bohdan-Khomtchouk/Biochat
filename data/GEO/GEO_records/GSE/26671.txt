TITLE
Expression data of murine model of cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An initial cellular change in the pathogenesis of heart failure is cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, characterized by increased cell size, enhanced protein synthesis and reactivation of fetal genes. In addition to mechanical stresses, several neurohumoral factors have been identified as potent hypertrophic agents, including angiotensin II, endothelin, and catecholamines. We used microarrays to study the gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Balb/c mice (6-8w) were treated with TAC, ATII infusion, and myocardial infarction. TAC model: The transverse aorta (TAC) was constricted at the upper left sternal border by ligation with a 7-silk surgical thread and 27-gauge needle, which was removed thereafter.  Sham-operated controls underwent an identical procedure without TAC. At 1 week and 1month after the procedure, LV was harvested. Ang II model.: Ang II was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at concentrations sufficient to allow an infusion rate of 2.0 mg/kg/day, known to produce hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.  Control mice received a vehicle (saline) via an osmotic minipump. At 1 week after the procedure, LV was harvested. MI model: The proximal portion of the left coronary artery was ligated using an 8-0 nylon thread. Myocardial ischemia was confirmed by the discoloration of the heart and typical ECG changes. After 30 min occlusion, the left coronary artery was reperfused by loosening the ligature. In sham-operated mice (SHAM), the pericardium was opened, but the coronary artery was not ligated. At 1 day, 1week, and 1 month after the procedure, LV was harvested.
