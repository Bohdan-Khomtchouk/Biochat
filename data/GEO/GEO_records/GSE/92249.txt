TITLE
Gene expression profile of small intestine tissue from C57BL/6 mice with or without faecal microbiota transplantation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further decipher the alteration of gene expression profile of irradiated mice with or without faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), we performed FMT for 10 days following total body irradiaton (6.5 Gy gamma ray). Twenty-one days after irradiation, the mice were euthanized and the small intestine tissues excised.

DESIGN
The male (and female) mice were separated into four groups randomly, The mice in Group A were treated with saline as negative control; the mice in Group B were treated with sex-matched FMT; the mice in Group C were treated with sex-mismatched FMT and the mice in Group D were sex-mixed (the weight of male and female stool was 1:1) FMT. FMTs were performed for 10 days following total body irradiaton (6.5 Gy gamma ray ). Twenty-one days after irradiation, the mice were euthanized and the small intestine tissues excised.
