TITLE
Expression data from human subsets of PBMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human PBMC, there are major T, B, Dc, Basophil, Eosinophil and Neutrophil subsets with typical biological functions. The characteristic behavior of each subset was determined by its unique gene expression and regulation. Difference between each subset or different treatment to the same subset will induce huge amount different gene expression. This will provide the basic evidence of understanding why and how each subset cells functions properly. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in each subsets of human PBMC and identified distinctly up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Each subset of human PBMC was purified by cell sorting through its unique surface markers. After stimulation, total RNA were extracted and applied for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain unique expression profiles of each subset cells. In the mean time, stimuli at each condition regulates the temporal resolution of expression profiles. We found many unique molecules relate to their major biological function of the subsets. *** Raw data no longer available ***
