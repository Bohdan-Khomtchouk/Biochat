TITLE
Impact of E2 ubiquitin conjugating activity of MUC1 on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a novel E2 ubiquitin conjugating activity within the C-terminus domain of MUC1.  To determine if E2 ubiquitin conjugating activity of MUC1 is responsible for regulating expression of oncogenic genes we isolated RNA from vector control cells, MUC1 wildtype overexpression cells, and cells that express a serine mutant lacking E2 activity.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from each of the 3 cell lines, S2013.Neo, S2013.MUC1-WT, and S2013.MUC1-Ser. Gene expression was analyzed by spotted microarray and the differences in gene expression were calculated between the cell lines
