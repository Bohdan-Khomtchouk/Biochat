TITLE
Expression data from primary bone marrow-derived wild-type C57BL/6 and bcl6 knockout macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare gene expression changes in macrophages caused by deletion of bcl6. Keywords: BCL6 deletion compared to wild-type

DESIGN
Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice transplanted and reconstituted with wild type or bcl6 knockout bone marrow.
