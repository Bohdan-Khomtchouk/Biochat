TITLE
Expression data from LNCaP and abl cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a key role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer. We investigated  AR-induced gene expression in prostate cancer cells LNCaP and abl by transfecting siAR / siControl or treating cells  with androgen (DHT) over a time course. Keywords: siRNA transfection and androgen stimulation time course

DESIGN
We hybridized RNA to Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
