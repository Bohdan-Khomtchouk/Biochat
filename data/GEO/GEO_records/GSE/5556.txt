TITLE
Treatment of cultured human aortic endothelial cells with oligomeric procyanidins extracts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human aortic endothelial cells were grown in culture until confluent. In three experiments using cells derived from three separate donors confluent cultures were incubated for 6 h with contol medium, or medium containing either extracts of oligomeric procyanidins from cranberry juice or red wine, or a procyanidin-rich grape seed extract. At the end of the 6 h treatment period conditioned media samples were retained for immunoassay of secreted peptides and proteins, and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Keywords: Comparative analysis of procyandins on vascular endothelial gene expression
