TITLE
Expression Profiling in Selenite-induced Proliferation of HuH7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experimental studies confirmed that seleium induced a global change of gene expression in HuH7 cells. Several novally induced secretory growth factors may contribute to the autocrine mode of growth elicited by selenium treatment. Keywords: Treatment
