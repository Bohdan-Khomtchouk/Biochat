TITLE
Expression Profiling in Selenite-induced Proliferation of HuH7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experimental studies confirmed that seleium induced a global change of gene expression in HuH7 cells. Several novally induced secretory growth factors may contribute to the autocrine mode of growth elicited by selenium treatment. Keywords: Treatment

DESIGN
HuH7 were cultured in 0.1 μM sodium selenite-containing medium for 15 passages (SELT) or in serum-free medium for 30 h (SF30) or in the regular complete medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum (HUH7) for 30 h. The total RNA were reverse transcried and hybridized to Human 8K-1 (Egenomix Technology Corp., Taiwan). The hybridization time and temperature was 16 h and 62℃, respectively. SELT and HUH7 samples were labeled with Cy5 while SF30 sample was labeled with Cy3. Local background correction and interchip global normalization were accomplished by GenePix Pro 5.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ).  Genes with differential up- or down-regulation by 1.5 fold with respect to the SF30 cells were obtained using GeneSpring software 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Agilent Technologies).
