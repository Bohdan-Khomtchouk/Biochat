TITLE
Whole genome analysis regulation in HepG2 cells exposed to cadmium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cadmium (Cd) is a metal present in working and living environments known to be toxic and carcinogenic, but its mechanism of action remains still unclear.  We investigated the gene expression modulation in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 after exposure to 2 µm and 10 µm cadmium using Agilent Whole human genome expression microarray.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were treated for 24 hours with 2 μM and 10 μM Cd and normal medium as control. Three independent replicates were used for the each type of stimuli.
