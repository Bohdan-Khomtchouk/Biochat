TITLE
Elucidating the role of UCP1 and FGF21 for metabolic homeostasis in the cold

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global RNA sequencing  analysis of the hypothalamus, BAT, inguinal WAT and muscle of long-term cold exposed WT, FGF21 KO, UCP1 KO and UCP1/FGF21 double KO mice

DESIGN
The experiment was performed in homozygous, male WT, FGF21 KO, UCP1 KO and UCP1/FGF12 double KO (dKO) mice. All mice were bred, born and weaned at 30째C. At the age of 10 to 12 weeks, mice were transferred to a temperature-controlled (+/- 0.5째C) climate chamber and kept for 12 days at 18째C followed by 3 weeks at 5째C. Afterwards, mice were euthanized after 2-3 hours food withdrawal, and serum and tissue samples were collected.
