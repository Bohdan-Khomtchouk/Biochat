TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 cells: control or tuberin-depleted

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the expression profiles of MCF7 cells transduced with a control shRNA and an TSC2-targeted shRNA (leading to tuberin depletion).

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were cultured in standard conditions, transduced, selected with puromycin (pLKO.1 shRNA vectors) and processed for expression profiling.
