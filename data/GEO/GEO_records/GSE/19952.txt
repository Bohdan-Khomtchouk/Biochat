TITLE
Expression data from batch cultivations of Aspergillus niger wild type and adrA, facB and creA deletion mutants

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Expression data from batch cultivations of Aspergillus niger wild type strain ATCC 1015 and adrA, facB and creA deletion mutants constructed on ATCC 1015 background strain with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes either affected directly or indirectly by each transcription factor investigated during growth on a repressing or a derepressing carbon source. For this purpose, batch cultivations under well-controlled conditions were performed with Aspergillus niger wild type strain ATCC 1015 and the three deletion mutants of the corresponding transcription factors AdrA, FacB and CreA. Samples for RNA extraction were collected and further processed for hybridization in custom-designed Affymetrix microarrays containing probes for three Aspergillus species, including A. niger.

DESIGN
Triplicate batch fermentations of each of the four Aspergillus niger strains used, the wild type A. niger strain ATCC 1015 and three gene deletion mutants, were carried out using glucose or glycerol as carbon source, and transcriptome analysis was performed. Biomass from each batch cultivation was harvested in the exponential phase of growth and further processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
