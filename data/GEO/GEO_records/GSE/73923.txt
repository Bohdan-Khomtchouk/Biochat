TITLE
mTOR inhibitors suppress homologous recombination repair and synergize with PARP inhibitors via regulating SUV39H1 in BRCA-proficient triple-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This analysis was used to search for genes that were differentially expressed between cells treated with DMSO and those treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells subjected to 48 hours treatment of everolimus (10uM) compared to DMSO.
