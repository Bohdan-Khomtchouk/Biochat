TITLE
A stage-specific induction system reveals that the oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma, SS18-SSX, is a cellular context-dependent epigenetic modifier

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the effects of cellular context on the function of the synovial sarcoma-specific fusion protein, SS18-SSX, using human pluripotent stem cells containing the drug-inducible SS18-SSX gene. To investigate the cell-type-dependent effecfts of SS18-SSX, we performed gene expression profiling experiments.

DESIGN
Comparison of global gene expressions of hPSCs, hPSC-NCCs, and hPSC-MSCs with or without the inductuion of SS18-SSX2
