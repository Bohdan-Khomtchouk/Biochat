TITLE
ERK1/2 in Ovarian Granulosa Cells are Essential for Female Fertility

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful reproduction in mammals. Since the signaling molecules RAS and ERK1/2 are activated by a LH surge in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, we disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse granulosa cells and provide in vivo evidence that these kinases are necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption of the Cebpb gene in granulosa cells demonstrate that C/EBP  is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. These mouse models provide in vivo systems in which to define the context specific and molecular mechanisms by which granulosa cells respond to LH and these mechanisms are relevant to the regulation of human fertility and infertility.

DESIGN
Immature wild type or ERK1/2 conditonal knock-out mice were injected with 5IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-48h followed by 5 IU hCG injection. The ovarian granulosa cells were collected at hCG 0h, 2.5h, or 4h and the gene expression pforiles were compared by microarray method.
