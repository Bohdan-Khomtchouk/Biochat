TITLE
Whole-genome analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine at base resolution in the human brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is particularly abundant in mammalian brains with yetto be revealed functions. Here, we present genome-wide and single-base-resolutionmaps of hmC and mC in the human brain. We demonstrated that hmCs increasemarkedly from the fetal to the adult stage, and in the adult brain, 13.4% of all CpGs arehighly hydroxymethylated with strong enrichment at genic regions and distal regulatoryelements. Notably, hmC peaks were identified at the 5' splicing sites at the exon-intronboundary, suggesting a mechanistic link between hmC and splicing. We also report asurprising transcription-correlated hmC bias toward the sense strand and an mC biastoward the antisense strand of gene bodies. Furthermore, hmC is negatively correlatedwith H3K27me3-marked repressive genomic regions, and is more enriched in poisedenhancers than active enhancers. Our results provide insights into understanding themultiple potential functions of hmC in the human brain.
