TITLE
Transcriptome profile of HepG2-expressing ATP7B-H1069Q (liver hepatocellular cells) exposed to JNK or p38 Inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of JNK inhibitor or p38 Inhibitor on the transcriptome of ATP7B H1069Q-overexpressing liver cells, we performed RNAseq experiments

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of the hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B H1069Q, compared with hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B WT. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells; RNA extracted from hepatocytes overexpressing ATP7B WT was used as control.
