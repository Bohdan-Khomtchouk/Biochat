TITLE
Integrative array-based approach identifies MZB1 as a frequently methylated putative tumor-suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was profiled using a 4x44K Human Whole Genome Ver. 2.0 gene expression array (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol ver. 5.0.1, Agilent Technologies)

DESIGN
Total RNAs extracted from Hep3B, HepG2, and HuH-7 cell lines and from these cell lines treated with 10 Î¼M 5-aza-dCyd for 5 days were used for conventional and pharmacological unmasking analyses, respectively.  Total RNAs from two normal livers (C20 and C40) were used as controls.

PLATFORM
