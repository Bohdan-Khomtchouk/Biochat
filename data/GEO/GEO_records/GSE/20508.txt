TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human monocytic cells (THP-1) exposure to Streptococcus suis serotype 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Streptococcus suis is an important zoonosis pathogen that causes significant economic losses worldwide characterized by meningitis, septicaemia, arthritis, bronchopneumonia endocarditis. Streptcoccus suis 2 strain SC19 was isolated in Sichuan province in China, during the outbreak in 2005. Septicemia is most popular symptoms for SC19 infection, and mortality is high. We used human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) infected SC19 to analysis the pathomechanism of septicemia in SS2 infection.

DESIGN
Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells were stimulated with Streptcoccus suis 2 (SS2) strain SC19. We added SS2 to THP-1 cells at a MOI of 1:1 (bacteria/cells). Uninfected control cells were incubated with PBS only. After 3 hours incubation, cells were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. A total of 4 samples were challenged, and 4 samples were used as controls. 4 microarrays were used in this experiment.
