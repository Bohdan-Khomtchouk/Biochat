TITLE
Hsp70 protects from stroke in atrial fibrillation patients by preventing thrombosis with no increased bleeding risk

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke. Anticoagulant drugs are effective in preventing AF-related stroke. However, the high frequency of anticoagulant-associated major bleeding is a major concern particularly when antiplatelet treatment is simultaneously administered. Here, microarray analysis in peripheral blood cells in eight patients with AF and stroke and eight AF subjects without stroke identified a stroke related gene expression pattern. HSPA1B, which encodes for heat-shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70), was the most differentially expressed gene. This gene was downregulated in stroke subjects, a finding confirmed further in an independent AF cohort of 200 individuals. Hsp70 knock-out (KO) mice subjected to different thrombotic challenges developed thrombosis significantly earlier than their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In WT mice, Hsp70 inducers (TRC051384, or tubastatin A) delayed thrombus formation. Remarkably, Hsp70 inducers did not increase the bleeding risk even when aspirin was concomitantly administered. Hsp70 induction was associated with an increased vascular thrombomodulin expression, higher circulating levels of activated protein C (APC) upon thrombotic stimulus and increased protection against endothelial apoptosis. Thus, Hsp70 induction is a novel approach to delay thrombus formation with minimal bleeding risk, being especially promising in situations where there is a major bleeding hazard.
