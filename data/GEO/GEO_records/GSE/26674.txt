TITLE
SNP array analysis on Maffucci tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we have used four enchondromas and two chondrosarcomas of Maffucci patients. We also had one normal sample available for paired analysis in one of the chondrosarcoma II. We did not find any LOH or coomon copy number variation in all Maffucci enchondromas while chondrosarcomas are genetically unstable.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array was performed using 4 EC and 2CS of Maffucci patients. Illumina expression v3 array was possible to perform using only 1 EC and 2 CS due to rarity of the disease. For SNP array, we used 29 control samples submitted previously (GSE22965) to creat baseline.
