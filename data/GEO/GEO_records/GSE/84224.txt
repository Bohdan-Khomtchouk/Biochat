TITLE
microRNA expression profiles in CD44- and CD44+ hepatocellular carcinoma HuH7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the significance of CD44+ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HuH7 cells, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of CD44-positive HuH7, CD44-negative HuH7, and human nomal hepatocyes were analyzed. Results provide the insight into the significance of CD44-positive HCC cells as the liver CSCs.

DESIGN
CD44-positive and CD44-negative HuH7 cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Total RNA were extracted from CD44-positive HuH7, CD44-negative HuH7 cells, and human normal hepatocytes. Total RNA isolated from each cell labeled using 3D-Gene miRNA labeling kit (TORAY) and hybridized onto the 3D-Gene human miRNA V20 (TORAY).
