TITLE
Wild Type 11168 versus LuxS01 Mutant Cultured in MHB and MEM- α media

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 wild type versus LuxS01 mutant strain grown in a minimal culture medium (MEM- α ) versus complex culture medium (MHB).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, the parent versus the mutant 11168 strains were grown in 2 types of culture medium for comparison. Control microarrays included comparing wild type vs wild type in the same culture medium. 4 biological replicates for each test microarray and 2 biological replicates for each control microarray, independently grown and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL4869 Campylobacter NCTC 11168 ORF-based array printed at IFR (third type) GPL9346 Campylobacter NCTC 11168 ORF-based array printed at IFR (second type)
