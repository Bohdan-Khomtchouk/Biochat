TITLE
Differential gene expression in a Cryptococcus neoformans ccr4Delta mutant during host-temperature adaptation

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans

SUMMARY
Analysis of ccr4 Delta vs. wild type shifted from 30oC to 37oC for 10 minutes To determine the effect of ccr4 deletion on temperature stress-responsive changes in gene expression in C. neoformans
