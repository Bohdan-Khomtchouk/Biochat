TITLE
Differential gene expression in a Cryptococcus neoformans ccr4Delta mutant during host-temperature adaptation

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Analysis of ccr4 Delta vs. wild type shifted from 30oC to 37oC for 10 minutes To determine the effect of ccr4 deletion on temperature stress-responsive changes in gene expression in C. neoformans

DESIGN
Replicate cultures of the wild type (Control) and ccr4Delta mutant were grown to mid log phase at 30oC, harvested and resuspended in 37oC pre-warmed medium for 10 minutes. Pooled biological replicate cultures were hybridized in duplicate (2 slides, 2 arrays/slide)

PLATFORM
GPL4009 UBC/MSL C. neoformans serotype D 70K
