TITLE
hnRNP Q1 targeting RNA in colorectal cancer cell line SW480

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to study the potential targeting RNA of hnRNP Q1 in colorectal cancer, RNA immunoprecipitation were used for collecting hnRNP Q1-associated RNA.

DESIGN
GFP-tag hnRNP Q1 were overexpressed in SW480 cells, then the cytoplasmic lysate was harvested for RNA immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP antibody. Total RNA was extracted from immunoprecipitate and submitted for RNA-seq.
