TITLE
SGK1 REGULATION BY miR-466g IN CORTICAL COLLECTING DUCT CELLS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effects of aldosterone on miRNA in the kidney cortical collecting duct, polarized mpkCCDc14 cell were treated with aldosterone or vehicle. A putative target for miR-466g was identified, the effect of modulating miR-466g levels on SGK1 levels was examined

DESIGN
In this dataset we include paired vehicle or aldosterone-treated samples

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
