TITLE
Serum microRNA profile of Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Some HER2 positive breast cancer  patients are refractory to trastuzumab therapy. MicroRNAs have been used to predict therapeutic effects for various cancers, and our study suggests that the serum-based miRNA signature can effectively distinguish HER2+ MBC patients who are sensitive to trastuzumab from those are resistant.

DESIGN
We collected the serum samples of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients before receiving first-line chemotherapy with trastuzumab for miRNA analysis, then we used miRNA microarray to obtain microRNA profile from 103 patients randomly selected from 254 patients as the training group, with 61 of them responding to the treatment while the rest 42 were resistant.
