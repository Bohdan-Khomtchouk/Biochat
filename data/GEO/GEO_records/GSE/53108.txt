TITLE
Expression data of control (F/F) and Snai1 knockout (KO) Flk1+/- cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Snai1 is a master factor of epithelial to mesenchymal transitioin (EMT), however, its role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and lineage commitment remains undefined. We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression between control and Snai1 knockout Flk1+ and Flk1- cells sorted from 4 day EBs.

DESIGN
Control and Snai1 knockout ESCs were cultured as embryoid bodies in spotaneous differentiation media, 4 days EBs were dissociated and sorted by anti-Flk1 antibody to separated Flk1+ and Flk1- cells, total RNA were collected for Affymetrix microarrays
