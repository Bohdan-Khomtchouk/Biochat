TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in Early Stages Uterine Serous Carcinomas in comparison to G3 and G1 Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between uterine serouscarcinoma (USC) vs. early stages high/low grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC).

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 33 cancer samples were analyzed (EAC-G1=11, EAC-G3=11, USC-G3=11) using the human genome wide illumina bead microarrays.
