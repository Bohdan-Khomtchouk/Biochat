TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of wild brown trout chronically exposed to metals using RNA-seq in a Illumina GAII platform

ORGANISM
Salmo trutta

SUMMARY
To investigate mechanisms of metal tolerance in the gill, gut, kidney and liver of brown trout inhabiting the river Hayle (highly metal contaminated) compared with a control population from the river Teign.

DESIGN
mRNA samples were sequenced (Illumina GAII) from a pooled embryonic sample and 12 multiplexed samples of different tissues from the the Hayle and Teign populations (pooled from 5 and 10 individuals respectively) and used to generate a transcriptome assembly. Expression profiling was then conducted for the gill, gut, kidney and liver samples.  Expression profiling results are presented in this Series.

PLATFORM
GPL16932 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Salmo trutta)
