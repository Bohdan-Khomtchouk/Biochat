TITLE
The histone acetyl transferase GcnE (GCN5) is essential to activate asexual development in Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
It was reported that deletion of gcnE in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans results in minor defects in primary metabolism and major defects in development and secondary metabolism. Here we unveil the role of GcnE in development.

DESIGN
The A. nidulans strains used in this study were the wild type FGSC26 (biA1 veA1) and the ∆gcnE mutant. Strains were grown in complete liquid medium for 18 h at 37 ºC and then conidiation was induced by transferring the vegetative cultures to complete solid media.
