TITLE
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of EpCAM+ cells from P3.25 mouse fetal livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed marker-free single-cell RNA-Seq to characterize comprehensive transcriptional profiles of 52 EpCAM+ cells from postnatal day 3.25 mouse fetal livers. These cells show characters of cholangiocytes. Combined with our previous single cell data of E11.5~P2.5 mouse fetal livers, our data depict the dynamic trajectories with transcriptional profiles at single-cell resolution during mouse liver development, and provide insights into the fate decision and transcriptional control of self-renewal, differentiation and maturation of liver stem/progenitor cells.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of EpCAM+ single cells from P3.25 mouse livers were analyzed in this study. ERCC Spike-ins were included in each sample as control. We analyzed 52 single cells from pooled sibling livers. All single cell samples were processed on the C1 microfluidic system.

PLATFORM
