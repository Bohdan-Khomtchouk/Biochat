TITLE
Expression data of enterotoxigenic (ETEC) isolate E24377A

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O139:H28 str. E24377A

SUMMARY
ETEC is an important human pathogen.  Although the mechanism of diarrhea is known in ETEC, the regulatory networks are less understood.  This study was conducted to understand the global expression of ETEC isolate E24377A under different growth and environemental conditions. ETEC isolate E24377A was grown in the presence of several chemical signals, including bile salts, glucose, and pre-conditioned media (PCM) from other enteric pathogens.  E24377A was also grown to different densities, to see if a quorum sensing mechanism was in place

DESIGN
The isolate was grown in different types of media, with different ammendments, and at different growth densities.  The overall goal was to determine how expression gene expression changes in the presence of chemical signals; a special emphasis was placed on the expression of known and suspected virulence and colonization factors
