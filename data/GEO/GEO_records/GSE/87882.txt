TITLE
Zeb2 regulates commitment to plasmacytoid dendritic cell and monocyte fate (part 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have identified Zeb2 as a transcription factor important for the final maturation of natural killer cells and effector CD8+ T cells. We show that Zeb2 is required for the development of two myeloid cell types, the monocyte and the plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and clarify that this factor is not required for the development of classical dendritic cells.

DESIGN
CD24+ classical dendritic cells (cDCs) were isolated by FACS from the spleen of Zeb2-sufficient mice, and CD172a+ cDCs were isolated by FACS from the spleen of Zeb2-sufficient and CD11c-Cre-driven Zeb2-deficient mice.
