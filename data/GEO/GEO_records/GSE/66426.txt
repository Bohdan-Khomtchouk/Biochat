TITLE
New molecular insights into modulation of platelet reactivity in aspirin-treated patients using a network-based approach [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelet reactivity (PR) in cardiovascular (CV) patients is variable between individuals and modulates clinical outcome. However, the determinants of platelet reactivity are largely unknown. Integration of data derived from high-throughput omics technologies may yield novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern platelet reactivity. The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes modulating platelet reactivity in aspirin-treated cardiovascular patients PR was assessed in 110 CV patients treated with aspirin 100mg/d by aggregometry using several agonists. 12 CV patients with extreme high or low PR were selected for transcriptomics, proteomics and miRNA analysis.

DESIGN
2 extreme patient groups, 6 samples per group
