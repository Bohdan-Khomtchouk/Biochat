TITLE
Effects of a 6h-long treatment with 90 mM sucrose to 4-d old, dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Columbia gl1) were grown in the dark at 23°C for 4 days before adding 90 mM sucrose for 6h. Keywords: Response to nutrients; sugar sensing

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra (gl1-1) was used in this study. Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10 min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsing and washing thoroughly in sterile water), and incubated in 2.5 ml liquid growing medium [Murashige-Skoog (MS) half strength solution] in 6-well plates (fully aerobic, with shaking). Plates were incubated in the darkness at 4°C for 2 days and finally transferred to 23°C for 4 days before the sugar treatments (with 90 mM sucrose, lasting 6h). Two independent, replicated experiments were performed for sucrose treatments. Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.
