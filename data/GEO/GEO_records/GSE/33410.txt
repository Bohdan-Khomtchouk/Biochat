SUMMARY
Experimental design:  2 genotypes: PI230970 (resistant USDA Plant Introduction (PI) line containing SBR Rpp2 resistance gene) & Embrapa-48 (susceptible Brazilian cultivar)  2 treatments: Soybean rust challenge & mock infection   3 replications  10 time points: 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168hai  TOTAL: 120 Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Soybean Genome Arrays   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Martijn van de Mortel.  The equivalent experiment is GM2 at PLEXdb.]
