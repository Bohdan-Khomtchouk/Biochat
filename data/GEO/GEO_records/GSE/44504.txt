SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3892 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-chip. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: Su(var) 3-9 06 17 mutant(official name : Su(var)3-9^06/Su(var)3-9^17 genotype : Su(var)3-9^06/Su(var)3-9^17 outcross : n/a transgene : n/a tags : X-ray tag : GFP description : Stocks with the Su(var)3-9^06 and Su(var)3-9^17 alleles were maintained as heterozygous stocks over a third chromosome balancer.  To generate the transheterozygotes description : individuals from the heterozygous stocks were crossed together.  The F1 individuals lacking the balancer chromosome were used for these experiments. made_by : Stocks were obtained from Gary Karpen ); Developmental Stage: 3rd Instar Larvae; Genotype: Su(var)3-9^06/Su(var)3-9^17; Transgene: n/a;  NUMBER OF REPLICATES: 4;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Strain Su(var) 3-9 06 17 mutant(official name : Su(var)3-9^06/Su(var)3-9^17 genotype : Su(var)3-9^06/Su(var)3-9^17 outcross : n/a transgene : n/a tags : X-ray tag : GFP description : Stocks with the Su(var)3-9^06 and Su(var)3-9^17 alleles were maintained as heterozygous stocks over a third chromosome balancer.  To generate the transheterozygotes description : individuals from the heterozygous stocks were crossed together.  The F1 individuals lacking the balancer chromosome were used for these experiments. made_by : Stocks were obtained from Gary Karpen ); Antibody HP1 wa191 (target is HP1a); Developmental Stage 3rd Instar Larvae
