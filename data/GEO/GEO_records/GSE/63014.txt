TITLE
Gene expression profiling in wild-type, Irf5-KO, Lyn-KO and Lyn/Irf5-DKO BMDCs unstimulated or stimulated with CpG-B ODN

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the relationship between IRF5 and Lyn in innate immune responses at a genome-wide scale, we performed gene expression microarray analysis for wild-type (WT), Irf5-KO, Lyn-KO and Lyn/Irf5-DKO bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with or without 6 h-stimulation with 150 nM CpG-B ODN. We extracted the transcripts that were upregulated by CpG-B ODN in WT BMDCs, further upregulated in Lyn-KO BMDCs and then downregulated in Lyn/Irf5-DKO BMDCs (fold change â‰¥ 2, false discovery rate < 0.05). When these 79 transcripts were sorted by their expression levels in Lyn-KO BMDCs, most of the top 20 genes (13 out of 20) were those encoding type I interferons (IFNs), indicating that Lyn particularly suppresses IRF5 induction of type I IFNs.

DESIGN
BMDCs from WT, Irf5-KO, Lyn-KO and Lyn/Irf5-DKO mice in a C57BL/6 background were unstimulated or stimulated with CpG-B ODN. Biological triplicate for each genotype were analyzed (24 samples in total).
