TITLE
Human melanoma cells over-express Extracellular Matrix 1 (ECM1) which is regulated in part by TFAP2C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extracellular Matrix 1(ECM1) expression is increased in multiple tumor cell lines and primary cancers. Activator protein 2C (TFAP2C) is a potent regulator of ECM1 transcription. TFAP2C may contribute to the increased ECM1 expression noted in many cancers. This is the first report identifying the minimal promoter region of the human ECM1 gene and its regulation by TFAP2C

DESIGN
Human A375 melanoma cells were assessed for mRNA and protein expression of ECM1. A mininal promoter region for ECM1 transactivation was identified. ECM1 expression was regulated in part by TFAP2C, and in ChIP-Seq experiments, TFAP2C was found to bind directly to the ECM1 gene in A375 melanoma cells and in MCF7 breast cancer cells.
