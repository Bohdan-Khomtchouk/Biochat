TITLE
Modulation of NKG2D ligand expression and metastasis in tumors by spironolactone via RXR-gamma activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor metastasis and lack of NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) expression are associated with poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer. Here we found that spironolactone (SPIR), an FDA-approved diuretic drug with a long-term safety profile, can upregulate NKG2DL expression in multiple colon cancer cell lines by activating the ATM-Chk2-mediated checkpoint pathway, which in turn enhances tumor elimination by natural killer cells. SPIR can also upregulate the expression of metastasis-suppressor genes TIMP2 and TIMP3, thereby reducing tumor cell invasiveness. Although SPIR is an aldosterone antagonist, its anti-tumor effects are independent of the mineralocorticoid receptor pathway. Instead, by screening the human nuclear hormone receptor siRNA library, we identify retinoid X receptor gamma (RXR gamma) as being indispensable for the anti-tumor functions of SPIR. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of SPIR or other RXR gamma-agonists with minimal side effects for colon cancer prevention and therapy.
