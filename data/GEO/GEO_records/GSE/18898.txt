TITLE
A native chromatin purification system for epigenomic profiling in C. elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We describe an in vivo chromatin purification system for genome-wide epigenetic profiling in C. elegans. In this system, we coexpressed the E. coli biotin ligase enzyme (BirA), together with the C. elegans H3.3 gene fused to BioTag, a 23-amino acid peptide serving as a biotinylation substrate for BirA, in vivo in worms. We developed methods to isolate chromatin under different salt extraction conditions, followed by affinity purification of biotinylated chromatin with streptavidin and genome-wide profiling with microarrays.
