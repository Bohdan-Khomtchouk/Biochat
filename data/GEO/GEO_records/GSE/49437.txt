TITLE
Impact of NRT1.1 point mutants on gene expression under high NH4NO3 supply

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
NRT1.1 is a nitrate transceptor involved in many nitrate responses including the regulation of gene expression through (i) the Primary Nitrate Response (PNR) and (ii) the regulation the NRT2.1 gene under continuous high NH4NO3 conditions. Phosphorylation of NRT1.1â€™s T101 residue is involved in the modulation of the PNR whereas nitrate transport by NRT1.1 is not. Here we used various NRT1.1 point mutants to study the impact of NRT1.1 on the whole transcriptome under high NH4NO3 supply. Col is the WT control, chl1-5 and chl1-12 are KO mutants, chl1-9 is defective in nitrate transport but not in PNR induction, T101D and T101A mimick the phosphorylated and not phosphorylated forms of NRT1.1 respectively.

DESIGN
This work studies the impact of various NRT1.1 mutations on the transcriptome under 10mM NH4N03 supply.
