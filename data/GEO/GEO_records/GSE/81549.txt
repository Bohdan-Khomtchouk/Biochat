TITLE
Forced Expression of MIST1 in Parietal Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MIST1 over-expression has not been analyzed in a cell type that does not express endogenous MIST1.  Here, we force-express ectopic MIST1 in the parietal cells of mouse stomachs.  We extracted whole corpus stomach mRNA and compared gene expression levels between MIST1-expressing mouse stomachs to controls.

DESIGN
One stomach from each condition (MIST1-expressing and control) was taken from mice 12 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Whole stomachs were used.
