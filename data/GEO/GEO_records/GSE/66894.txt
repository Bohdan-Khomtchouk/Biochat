TITLE
Identification of JMJD1A and JMJD2B Target Genes in Hypoxic Ovarian Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Hypoxia-Inducible Factors induce the expression of the histone demethylases JMJD1A (KDM3A) and JMJD2B (KDM4B), linking the hypoxic tumor microenvironment to epigenetic mechanisms that may foster tumor progression. Using transcript profiling, we have identified genes that are regulated by JMJD1A and JMJD2B in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in SKOV3ip.1 ovarian cancer cells. This dataset includes expression data obtained from exposing ovarian cancer cells to hypoxia in combination with siRNA-mediated knockdown of the hypoxia-inducible histone demethylases JMJD1A and JMJD2B. These data were used to both identify functional overlap between each histone demethylase, as well as identify effectors of tumor growth mediated by JMJD2B (KDM4B) in normoxia and hypoxia.

DESIGN
18 samples were analyzed. The log2-transformed normalized signal intensities were used for downstream pairwise comparisons (using Partek Genomic Suite): SiControl-Normoxia > SiD1A-Normoxia; SiD1A-Normoxia > SiControl-Normoxia; SiControl-Normoxia > SiD2B-Normoxia; SiD2B-Normoxia > SiControl-Normoxia; SiControl-Hypoxia > SiControl-Normoxia; SiControl-Normoxia > SiControl-Hypoxia; SiControl-Hypoxia > SiD1A-Hypoxia; SiD1A-Hypoxia > SiControl-Hypoxia; SiControl-Hypoxia > SiD2B-Hypoxia; SiD2B-Hypoxia > SiControl-Hypoxia.
