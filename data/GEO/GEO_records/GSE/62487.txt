TITLE
Expression data from wild-type (WT) and lrrc19 gene knockout (KO) mice intestines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LRRC19 (Leucine repeat receptor containing 19) is a newfound Toll-like receptor without definite function reported. We have detected that the lrrc19 gene had a high expression level in both human and mouse intestines and concentrated on the effect of this immune receptor in mediating the process of enteritis and intestinal cancer. To have a systematic understanding on the influence of this gene on the intracelluar environment of intestinal cell, we have conducted a microarray experiment to compare the transcriptomes of the WT and KO mice intestines under the same experimental condition.

DESIGN
Gut epithelial cells of WT and KO mice of the same physiological and maintaining condition were isolated and then total RNAs were extracted from them, which could reflect the respective transcription profile of WT and KO mice. These RNAs were detected by microarray and the influence of lrrc19 gene on intestine could be revealed to some extent.
