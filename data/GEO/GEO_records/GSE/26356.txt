TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in Arabidopsis under abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNA and NAT-siRNAs that are associated with abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis, we generated small RNA sequences from adult Arabidopsis plants under control and under dought, salt, and cold stress treatments. Over 23 million reads were generated.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNAs in Arabidopsis under control, drought, salt, and cold stress conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
