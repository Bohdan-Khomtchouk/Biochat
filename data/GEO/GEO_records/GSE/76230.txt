TITLE
The WOPR protein Ros1 is a master regulator of sporogenesis and effector gene expression in the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
Goals: characterization of the transcription factor Ros1 in Ustilago maydis Methods: generation of deletion mutants, microscopic observations, ectopic expression of ros1, identification of Ros1 regulated genes by RNAseq and ChIP sequencing Results:  Ros1 is not involved in plant colonization but is essential to trigger sporogenesis during late stages of infection. Premature expression of ros1 revealed that Ros1 counteracts the b-dependent filamentation program and induces morphological alterations resembling the early steps of sporogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP seq analyses revealed that Ros1 affects the expression of about 30 % of all U. maydis genes with 40% being direct targets. Cell wall remodeling and plasma membrane modifications are among the processes affected by Ros1 dependent regulation. Interestingly a large number of b-dependent genes including transcription factors and effector genes involved in biotrophy establishment were downregulated by Ros1 while a subset of novel “late effectors” were upregulated. Taken together our results indicate that Ros1 is a master regulator of sporogenesis in U. maydis and that the switch to sporogenesis is accompanied by the differential regulation of 75% of the effector genes.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed in triplicate. The first two samples correspond to input and output DNA obtained from ChIP carried out on plant material infected with U. maydis strains expressing  Ros1 with an HA tag. The other two other samples correspond to input and output DNA from ChIP carried out on plant material infected with U. maydis strains expressing Ros1 without a tag (control samples).
