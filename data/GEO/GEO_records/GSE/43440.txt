TITLE
Coordinated regulation of synthesis and stability of RNA during the acute TNF-induced proinflammatory response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Steady-state gene expression is a coordination of synthesis and decay of RNA through epigenetic regulation, transcription factors, miRNAs, and RNA-binding proteins. Here, we present Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq to assess genome-wide changes to RNA synthesis and stability in human fibroblasts at homeostasis and after exposure to the proinflammatory TNF. The inflammatory response in human cells involves rapid and dramatic changes in gene expression, and the Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq techniques revealed a coordinated and complex regulation of gene expression both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The combinatory analysis of both RNA synthesis and stability using Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq allows for a much deeper understanding of mechanisms of gene regulation than afforded by the analysis of steadystate total RNA and should be useful in many biological settings.

DESIGN
Analysis of the effect of TNF exposure in nascent gene expression and in transcript stability
