TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of S. pyogenes strains MGAS2221 and 2221ΔFasX following exposure to human plasma

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
The fasX gene encodes a small regulatory RNA in the group A Streptococcus (GAS).  To determine the FasX regulon during GAS exposure to human plasma we compared parental strain MGAS2221 with isogenic fasX mutant strain 2221ΔFasX.  Gene expression was analyzed 0, 15, and 60 minutes post-plasma exposure.

DESIGN
GAS strains were grown in THY broth to mid-exponential phase, corresponding to an O.D.600 of 0.5.  Two 16ml aliquots of each GAS culture were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant removed.  Each GAS cell pellet was resuspended in 16ml of pre-warmed human plasma.  Thus, four GAS-plasma suspensions were created, two each for each of the GAS strains, with one of the two using plasma from person A, and the other two using plasma from person B.  Aliquots were recovered from each of the four GAS-plasma suspensions at T = 0, 15, and 60 mins.  For the first two time-points 4.5ml of GAS-plasma suspension were added to 9ml of RNAprotect (Qiagen Inc.).  For the final time-point, 4ml was added to 8ml of RNAprotect.  Following addition of RNAprotect, samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 mins before centrifuging.  Supernatant was removed and the pellets quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until ready to use.  RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and use of our custom Affymetrix microarray was as previously described (Perez et al., 2009)
