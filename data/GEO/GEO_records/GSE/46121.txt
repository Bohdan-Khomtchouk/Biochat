TITLE
Changes in DNaseI hypersensitivity upon co-treatment of cells with Dex and E2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report changes in DNaseI accessibility genome-wide upon co-treatment with Dex and E2 when compared to Dex or E2 treatments alone.

DESIGN
We examine ER and GR binding under four different treatments (unt, Dex, E2, and Dex + E2).
