TITLE
Identification of FOXP3-dependent transcripts in human FOXP3 expressing Jurkat T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor (TF) Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) is constitutively expressed in high levels in natural occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (nTreg) and is not only the most accepted marker for that cell population, but is considered lineage determinative. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of transcription factors in combination with genomic tiling microarray analysis (ChIP-on-Chip) has been shown to be an appropriate tool to identify FOXP3 transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) on a genome-wide scale. In combination with microarray expression analysis the ChIP-on-Chip technique allows to identify direct FOXP3 target genes. This dataset shows expression data of resting and mitogen stimulated (PMA / ionomycin) retrovirally transduced Jurkat T cells either expressing FOXP3(Î”2) (J-FOXP3) or an empty vector control (J-GFP).

DESIGN
Expression profile of resting and PMA/ionomycin stimulated J-GFP and J-FOXP3 cells was analyzed (one microarray per condition).
