TITLE
Modest static pressure suppresses columnar epithelial cell proliferation in association with cell shape and cytoskeletal modifications

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Evidence is provided that columnar epithelial cells are growth suppressed by pressure load as low as 30 cmH2O, in association with cell shape flattening and cytoskeletal alterations.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in MDCK cells between 2- and 50-cm-high medium cultures

PLATFORM
GPL20988 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Canis lupus familiaris)
