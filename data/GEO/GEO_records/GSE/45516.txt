TITLE
Expression data from human Huntington fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile comparison from fibroblasts of Huntington individuals and normal ones We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of fibroblasts from Huntington patients

DESIGN
Comparison between six Huntington human fibroblasts and three normal controls. All individuals were aged and sex matched. In fact they are all males with the subsequent ages: 28, 48, 57 for the controls and 38, 63, 57, 47, 38, 37 for the HD patients. The average age is comparable.
