TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from brainstem gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gliomas arising in the brainstem are rare tumours worldwide that are difficult to surgically resect, and the involved miRNAs and signaling pathways associated with brainstem gliomas (BSGs) are largely unclear. Tumours in the control nervous system owned a WHO classification, which are of great significance to guide the treatment and to evaluate prognosis. To determine grade-associated miRNAs in BSGs, this study performed microarray of 10 low-grade and 15 high grade BSGs.

DESIGN
Brainstem gliomas tissues were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain  grade-associated miRNAs in BSGs. To that end, we selected brainstem gliomas tissues according to WHO classification: grade I,grade II,grade III and grade IV
