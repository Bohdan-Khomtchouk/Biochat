TITLE
Growth factor stimulation of cardiomyocytes induces changes in the transcriptional contents of secreted exosomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study if the transcriptional content in exosomes derived from unntreated and growth factor treated cultured cardiomyocytes (HL-1)  differ and if so, can this difference be explained.This is results for the cells.The exosome reults can be find at GSE40503.

DESIGN
4 control untreated samples, 4 TFG-beta2 cardiomyocyte treated samples and 4 PDGF BB cardiomyocyte were studied., this reults are from the corresponding cells (that released the exosomes), used for data filtering of the exsomedata. The exosome reults can be find at GSE40503.
