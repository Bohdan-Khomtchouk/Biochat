TITLE
GAS M49: wild type vs Δralp3 mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes M49 591

SUMMARY
GAS is a highly virulent Gram-positive bacterium. For the successful infection GAS express many virulence factors, which are clustered together with transcriptional regulators in distinct genomic regions. Ralp3 is a central regulator of the ERES region. In this study, we investigated the role of Ralp3 in GAS pathogenesis. To characterize the Ralp3 regulatory function on the whole genome level, GAS M49 wild type and Äralp3 mutant strains were comprehensively compared by two colour microarray analysis. Samples were taken from cultures in the transition phase.

DESIGN
One condition experiment, wild type vs Δralp3. Biological replicates: 4 wild type and 4 mutant replicates per array.
