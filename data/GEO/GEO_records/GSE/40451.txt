TITLE
Hrp3 controls nucleosome positioning to suppress non-coding transcription in eu- and heterochromatin [MNase-Seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We report that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CHD remodeler, Hrp3, is a global regulator that drives higher-order chromatin structure and genomic stability. The loss of Hrp3 resulted in nucleosome perturbation across the chromosome, and the production of antisense transcripts in the hrp3âˆ† cells emphasized the importance of nucleosome architecture for proper transcription

DESIGN
Examination of nucleosome positions in wild-type and mutants using the MNase-seq method
