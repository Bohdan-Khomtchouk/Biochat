TITLE
Genome-wide transcription start site determination of Geobacter sulfurreducens under multiple growth conditions

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA

SUMMARY
Determine the transcription start sites at 1-bp resolution across the entire G. sulfurreducens genome in multiple growth conditions, including fresh water acetate-fumarate (FWAF) medium, nitrogen limitation and growth on electrode.

DESIGN
Special capture of the 5' end of primary transcripts in G. sulfurreducens and sequencing with Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
