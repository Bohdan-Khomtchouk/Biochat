TITLE
Plant Leaves: Pinellia pedatisecta vs Pinellia ternata

ORGANISM
Pinellia pedatisecta

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling of Pinellia pedatisecta leaves comparing Pinellia ternata leaves in the same condition. Then we compared the accumulation of known miRNA families using microarray signals to identify further the differential miRNA expression between Pinellia pedatisecta and Pinellia ternata.

DESIGN
Pinellia pedatisecta vs Pinellia ternata, independently grown and harvested. Each sample are mixed. One replicate per array.
