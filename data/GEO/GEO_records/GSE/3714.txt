TITLE
Expression data from WT, H1c/H1d/H1e triple null ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix expression profiling of wild-type and H1c, H1d, H1e triple null mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that loss of three linker histone subtypes (H1c, H1d and H1e) results in specific changes in gene regulation. Keywords: cell comparison
