TITLE
Differential gene expression in thrombus-derived white blood cells of patients with acute coronary syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory mechanisms and immune cells are involved in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and may lead to acute plaque rupture. However, the local expression of the different genes potentially involved is largely unknown. We therefore performed an Affymetrix analysis of genes expressed in white blood cells obtained from an occluding coronary thrombus or peripheral blood of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

DESIGN
Thrombi of ACS patients were harvested from the site of coronary occlusion. Leukocytes were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were treated in a similar fashion and mRNA was extracted from both cells.
