TITLE
SOX9 overexpression in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX9 is generally not expressed in melanomas with a high proliferative capacity but is expressed in melanomas with a high invasive capacity. Here we overexpress full length SOX9 in M010817, a melanoma cell culture with high proliferative capacity but low invasive capacity.

DESIGN
3x Control vector. 3x SOX9 overexpression

PLATFORM
