TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of transcriptome changes upon Erk knockout, or Mek inhibition in WT and Erk KO ESCs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq were performed with six samples, WT KH2 ESCs treated with or without PD0325901 for 48 hours (KH2_PD and KH2, respectively), iErk1; Erk KO ESCs cultured in the presence Dox (P0), 48 and 96 hours after Dox withdrawal (P1 and P2, respectively), and iErk1; Erk KO ESCs cultured without Dox for 96 hours, and treated with PD0325901 in the last 48 hours (P2_PD).  iErk1; Erk KO ESCs cultured without Dox does not express Erk, thus mimicking Erk KO.

DESIGN
Paired comparisons of KH2+PD and KH2, P2+PD and P2, and P1 and P0, allow us to analyzed the effects of Mek inhibition in WT ESCs, Mek inhibition in Erk KO ESCs, and Erk KO in ESCs, respectively.
