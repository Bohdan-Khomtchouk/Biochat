TITLE
Prevalent p53 gain-of-function mutants co-opt epigenetic pathways to drive cancer growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the genomewide binding pattern of prevalent p53 gain-of-function (GOF) mutants by ChIP-seq, in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We assessed the genomewide changes of H3K4me3 upon GOF p53 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells bearing the p53 R273H mutation.

DESIGN
This study uses ChIP-seq of H3K4me3 and histone H3 in wild-type or p53 R172H knock-in MEFs.  Additionally, this study examines the transcriptome of wild-type or p53 R172H knock-in MEFs using polyA+ RNA-seq.
