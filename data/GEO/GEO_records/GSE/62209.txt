TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Host Immune Responses in rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239 or deglycosylated live-attenuated SIV

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To find the differences in innate immune response between nonpathogenic  and pathogenic SIV infection, we examined transcriptome in PBMCs from macaques infected with pathogenic or nonpathogenic SIV.

DESIGN
Juvenile macaques were intavenousy infected with SIVmac239 or âˆ†5G. Blood samples were collected at 1 week and 3 weeks pi. Total RNA from the PBMCs were used for the microarray analysis. cRNA was hybridized to a rhesus microarray (Agilent ver.2). The data were normalized per chip to the 75 th percentile expression level, then subjected to per gene to normalization to the median expression of uninfected animals.

PLATFORM
GPL16027 Agilent-026806 M. mulatta (Rhesus) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name Version)
