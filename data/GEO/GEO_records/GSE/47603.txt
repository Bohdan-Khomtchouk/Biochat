TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of complex regional pain syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we successfully identified pain-related genes through genome-wide expression profiling in blood from CRPS patients. We found that 80 genes were differentially expressed between 4 CRPS patients (2 CRPS I and 2 CRPS II) and 5 controls (cut-off value: 1.5-fold change and p < 0.05). Most of those genes were associated with signal transduction, developmental processes, cell structure and motility, and immunity and defense. The expression levels of 12 genes selected from the microarray were confirmed in 24 CRPS patients and 18 controls by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We focused on matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) that showed statistically significant difference from controls and the highest relative fold change in CRPS II patients to controls by qPCR validation (6.4 Â± 2.47 times and p = 0.001).

DESIGN
Identification of pain-related genes in peripheral blood of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) using cDNA microarray. Comparative gene expression profiles in peripheral blood of 5 healthy controls and 4 CRPS patients.
