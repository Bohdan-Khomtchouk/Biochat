TITLE
Molecular reprogramming of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) clusters upon induction of BCR/ABL oncogene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNA Seq and bioinformatic analysis are used to study what processes are important for the molecular reprogramming of GMPs once mice develop chronic myelogenous leukemia-like (CML-like) myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) upon induction of BCR/ABL oncogene.

DESIGN
Single cell RNA sequencing of GMP cells from mice upon induction of BCR/ABL oncogene
