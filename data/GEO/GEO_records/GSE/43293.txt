TITLE
Genome-scale methylome profiling of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation was analyzed in a cohort of paragangliomas to identify DNA methylation changes.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from 22 fresh frozen paragangliomas and 2 normal adrenal medulla samples were hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
