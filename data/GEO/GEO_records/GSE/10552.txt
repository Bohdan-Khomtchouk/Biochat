TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis in AtT-20 cells following Dnmt1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Efficient and sustained knockdown of DNMT1 transcript and protein was achieved using a consecutive transfection protocol in the mouse pituitary adenoma cell line, AtT-20.  Genome wide microarray analysis identified 91 transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed relative to cells treated with a non-targeting control. Keywords: Differential expression

DESIGN
AtT-20 cells were repeatedly treated with 20 nM siRNA (siDNMT1 or siNT) over an eight day period.  After eight days total RNA was extracted and prepared for microarray analysis.  The procedure was repeated three times independently.
