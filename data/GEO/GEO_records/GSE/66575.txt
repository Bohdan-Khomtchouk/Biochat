TITLE
Molecular characterization of diabetic heart of akita (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular profile of diabetic heart in animal model of type 1 diabeties Akita, we performed RNA sequencing of heart tissue (male) at the 12 week to understand systemic changes.

DESIGN
There were two groups. Wlid type and Akita (Ins2+/-). Both have same genetic background and akita has mutation in Insulin 2 gene.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
