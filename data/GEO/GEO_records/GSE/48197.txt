TITLE
Different DNA methylation between hypothalamus paraventricular (PVH) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to compare the DNA methylation patterns between ARH and PVH to examine to what extent DNA methylation is region specific in genome scale.

DESIGN
ARH and PVH were micro-dissected from mice brains. Each 7 pieces of ARH or PVH were pooled and used for DNA methylation comparison by methylation specific amplification microarray (MSAM). As a brief description of the MSAM: 500ng of genomic DNA was serially digested with SmaI and XmaI followed by an adaptor ligation and adaptor mediated PCR amplification and then cohybridization. Two-color cohybridizations were performed as paired comparison of PVH vs. ARH with two biological replicates including dye swap.
