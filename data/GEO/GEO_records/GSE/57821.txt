TITLE
Transcriptional dysregulation of synaptic genes in a human iPSC model of major mental disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders are postulated to be developmental disorders resulting from synapse dysfunction. How susceptibility genes for major mental disorders could lead to synaptic deficits in humans is not well-understood. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from four members of a family in which a frame-shift mutation of Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) co-segregated with psychiatric disorders and further produced different isogenic iPSC lines via genetic editing. We showed that mutant DISC1 causes synaptic vesicle release deficits in iPSC-derived forebrain neurons. Mechanistically, mutant DISC1 dysregulates the expression of many genes related to synapses and psychiatric disorders and depletes wild-type DISC1 and the NCoR1 transcription co-repressor complex. Furthermore, mechanism-guided pharmacological inhibition of phosphodiesterases rescues synaptic defects in mutant neurons. Our study uncovers a novel gain-of-function mechanism through which the psychiatric disorder-relevant mutation affects synaptic functions via transcriptional dysregulation and provides insight into the molecular and synaptic etiopathology of psychiatric disorders.

DESIGN
Two patient derived iPSC lines carrying heterozygous 4bp deletion in DISC1 gene and 1 related control were analyzed in biological triplicate
