TITLE
Gene expression patterns in the head horns, thoracic horns, and legs of the horned beetles Onthophagus taurus

ORGANISM
Onthophagus taurus

SUMMARY
This series examines gene expression patterns in the head horns, thoracic horns, and legs of the horned beetles Onthophagus taurus.  Expression in each of these tissues was compared to that in common non-appendage reference - abdominal epithelium.

DESIGN
The series consists of three pair-wise comparisons: head horn versus abdominal epithelium, thoracic horn versus abdominal epithelium and legs versus abdominal epithelium.  Each tissue sample was obtained by pooling tissue dissected from four pupae.  Samples compared on the same array were derived from tissues dissected from the same four animals.  Five independent biological replicates were performed for each comparison with dye flips (three in one direction and two in the opposite direction).

PLATFORM
