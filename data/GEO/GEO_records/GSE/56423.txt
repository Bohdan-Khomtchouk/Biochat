TITLE
Estradiol Induced Transcriptional Profile of EAAE DNA Binding Deficient ERa Uterus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the ability of a DNA binding deficient ERa to mediate transcriptional responses in the mouse uterus, ovariectomized mice were injected with 100 ul of saline or 250 ng of estradiol (E2) in 100 ul saline, uterine tissue was collected 2 hours filllowing the injection, and RNA was isolated

DESIGN
3 mice each, WT saline, WT E2 2h, EAAE saline, EAAE 2h E2

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
