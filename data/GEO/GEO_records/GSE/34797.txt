TITLE
[E-MTAB-684] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch IV

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing. This is batch IV, based on chromosome 3, 4 and 5 annotations from Gencode 4 (January 2010). The sequences in this submission were obtained from two different RNA amplifications of the same original RNA for each tissue (called cdna1 and cdna2 in the assay names). In addition testis cDNA1 and lung cDNA2 were sequenced twice (rep1, rep2), and sequences originated from a new dilution of brain and testis cDNA1 (newdil) have also been included.
