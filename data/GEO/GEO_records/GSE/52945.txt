TITLE
Epigenomic profiling of Acute myeloid leukemia subtypes from primary tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we used Illumina NGS for high-throughput profiling of the DNA methylome(ERRBS) and hydroxymethylome(hMe-Seal) of primary tumor samples with Acute Myeloid Leukemia(AML). The data can be used to compare hydroxymethylation and methylation patterns from different AML subtypes and normal bone marrow samples.

DESIGN
We have sequenced 4 subtypes of AML with hydroxymethylation decrease and 1 subtype with no decrease. We have sequenced 2-5 primary tumor samples for each subtype, and comprated the epigenomic profiles ( ERRBS and hMe-Seal ) of hydroxymethylation deficient subtypes to the control subtype and normal bone marrow samples.
