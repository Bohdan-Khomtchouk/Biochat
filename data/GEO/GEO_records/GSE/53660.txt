TITLE
Miniature pigs tooth germ tissue: four different types of teeth in three different developing stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression profile of three different types of teeth include deciduous incisor (QY), deciduous canine (JY) , deciduous premolar (QMY) ,and deciduous molar (MY) in three typical stages of tooth development embryonic day 40 , 50, and 60, which cover the major morphological and physiological changes in pig tooth germ growth and development throughout pregnancy including the bud, cap, and bell stages.

DESIGN
twelve-condition experiment, QY40 vs.QY50 vs.QY60 vs. JY40 vs. JY50vs. JY60 vs.QMY40 vs.QMY50 vs.QMY60  vs.MY40.vs.MY50.vs.MY60. Biological replicates: 1 , independently removed under a microscope. Four replicate per array.

PLATFORM
