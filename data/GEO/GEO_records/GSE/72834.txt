TITLE
Skeletal muscle derived stem cell implantation therapy in a rat model of erectile dysfunction

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Muscle derived stem cells were isolated from Zucker Obese rats and implanted into the penises of diabetic rats. Rats were analyzed for potential therapeutic benefit. The skeletal muscle derived stem cells were grown in culture and analyzed by DNA microarray analysis for gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit and tested using the Affymetrix rat gene 1.0 ST microarray (GPL6247).

PLATFORM
GPL6247 [RaGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
