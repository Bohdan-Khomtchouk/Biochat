TITLE
Gene profiling of quiescent and activated skeletal muscle satellite cells by an in vivo approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The satellite cell of skeletal muscle provides a paradigm for quiescent and activated tissue stem cell states. We have carried out transcriptome analyses by comparing satellite cells from adult skeletal muscles, where they are mainly quiescent, with cells from growing muscles, regenerating (mdx) muscles, or with cells in culture, where they are activated. Our study gives new insights into the satellite cell biology during activation and in respect with its niche. We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression underlying adult satellite cell quiescence compared to activation states and to identify distinct classes of up-regulated genes in these two different states

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated by flow cytrometry using the GFP fluorescence marker from Pax3GFP/+ mice skeletal muscle. The transcriptome of quiescent satellite cells from adult Pax3GFP/+ muscle was compared to the transcriptome of activated satellite cells obtained from three different samples: 1) regenerating Pax3GFP/+:mdx/mdx muscle (Ad.mdx) , 2) growing 1 week old Pax3GFP/+ muscle (1wk), and 3) adult Pax3GFP/+ cells after 3 days in culture (Ad.cult).
