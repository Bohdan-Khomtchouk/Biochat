TITLE
Comparison and analysis of gene expression between cattle and buffalo after infection with schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Bos taurus ; Bubalus bubalis

SUMMARY
The microarray analysis of gene expression difference between cattle and buffalo, provide us a profiling as a new platform to discover the difference between their compatibility with schistosoma japonicum.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood were collected from the cattle and buffalo before and after they infected at 49d (7weeks) with schistosoma japonicum. Three animals were perfused for each host.

PLATFORM
GPL11648 Agilent-023647 B. taurus (Bovine) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
