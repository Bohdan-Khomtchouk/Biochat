TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa in response to salt and osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa

SUMMARY
The global transcriptional response of the phytopathogenic bacterium X. fastidiosa to a sudden increase in salinity and osmolarity of the medium was investigated using DNA microarrays. Time-course experiments were carried out by exposing bacterial cells to high salinity (250 mM NaCl) and high osmolarity (300 mM sucrose) conditions revealing 142 upregulated genes under both stresses, including pathogenicity related genes, genes encoding transcriptional regulators, as well as genes related to DNA metabolism and mobile genetic elements. In addition, 38 genes were downregulated under both conditions, most of them related to ribosomal and heat shock proteins. A total of 192 genes were upregulated exclusively in the presence of NaCl, including genes encoding transporters, genes involved in oxidative-stress response and genes related to cell structure. A smaller number of genes (44 genes) were induced only in the presence of sucrose, most of them encoding hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins. Interestingly, 57% of the genes differentially expressed under both stress conditions have no putative function assigned, emphasizing the importance of high-throughput experiments to start the characterization of these genes in X. fastidiosa. Keywords: stress response, osmotic and salt stress

DESIGN
Direct comparison between osmotic or salt stress condition and control (29oC) condition. Some hybridizations are dye-swaped. There are at least 3 biological replicates (independent harvest) and 2 technical replicates of each array (L - left and R - right).

PLATFORM
GPL2708 Xylella USP microarray v2 (Koide et al. 2004 J.Bact.)
