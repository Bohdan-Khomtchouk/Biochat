TITLE
Expression analysis of the gene in microRNA-155 knockout mice and wildtype mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in four microRNA-155 knockout mice comparing with 4 wildtype mice We found some gene expression level are different in two groups.

DESIGN
A eight chip study using total RNA  from four separate wild-type mouse speens  and four separate microRNA-155 knockout mice speens

PLATFORM
