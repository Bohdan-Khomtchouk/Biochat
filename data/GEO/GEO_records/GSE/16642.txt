TITLE
Illumina mRNA-Seq of control and hnRNP H knockdown in 293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated through combinatorial activity of RNA motifs including splice sites and splicing regulatory elements (SREs).  Here, we show that the activity of a major class of mammalian SREs is highly sensitive to the strength of the adjacent 5' splice site (5'ss) sequence, and that this has important functional and evolutionary implications.  Activity of G-run SREs was higher for intermediate strength 5'ss by ~4-fold relative to weak 5'ss, and by ~1.3-fold relative to strong 5'ss.  The dependence on 5'ss strength was supported both by comparative genomics and by microarray and Illumina mRNA-Seq analyses of splicing changes following RNAi against the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H, which binds G-runs.  This dependence implies that the responsiveness of exons to changes in hnRNP H levels is a bivariate function of both SRE abundance and 5'ss strength; this relationship may hold also for other splicing factors.  This pattern of activity enables G-runs and hnRNP H to buffer the effects of 5'ss mutations, augmenting both the frequency of 5'ss polymorphism and the evolution of new splicing patterns.
