TITLE
Correlation between expression levels of different tumors measured by poly(A)+RNA and aRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification Table 7 This experiment was designed to determine the correlation between expression levels of defferent tumors (BC2 and BC91) measured by poly(A)+RNA and aRNA for each tumor. Total RNA was amplified using the Jeffrey lab protocol with G50 cleanup. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
