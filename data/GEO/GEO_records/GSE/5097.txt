TITLE
Genomic responses to ectopic expression of DHR96 in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
DHR96 plays a role in regulating xenobiotic responses in Drosophila. Using a gain-of-function approach we test whether DHR96 is sufficient to affect detoxification genes in the absence of a xenobiotic insult. Keywords: gain-of-function
