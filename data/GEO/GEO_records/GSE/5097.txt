TITLE
Genomic responses to ectopic expression of DHR96 in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
DHR96 plays a role in regulating xenobiotic responses in Drosophila. Using a gain-of-function approach we test whether DHR96 is sufficient to affect detoxification genes in the absence of a xenobiotic insult. Keywords: gain-of-function

DESIGN
A transgenic line that expresses a full-length DHR96 cDNA under heat-shock control was generated by standard P-element-mediated transformation, using w1118 as a host strain. Control flies are therefore w1118 without any transgene. Larvae were staged at the molt from L2 to L3, and heat-treated after 3 hours for one hour at 37.5 degrees (in vials). Finally, RNA was extracted 4 hours later.
