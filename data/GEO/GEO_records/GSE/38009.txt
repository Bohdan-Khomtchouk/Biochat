TITLE
Expression data from E14.5 mouse agonadal urogential ridges

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed global mRNA expression in urogenital ridges of embryos that were either heterozygous for the Müllerian Inhibiting Substance type II receptor or homozygously deleted to study the genes regulated by MIS during Müllerian duct regression.

DESIGN
Approximately 200 mosue embryos were sorted for heterozygous or homozygous deletion of the MISR2, urogenital ridges were collected and the gonads were discarded.  mRNA was prepared from pooled ridges and sent for Affymetrix analysis.
