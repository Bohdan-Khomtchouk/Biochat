TITLE
The role of vitamin D in the transcriptional program of human pregnancy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral whole blood transcriptome profiles of pregnant women enrolled in the “Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial” (VDAART) at enrollment during early pregnancy, and again at 32-38 weeks of gestation. Mothers were enrolled in 2 treatment groups: Intervention group with 4400 IU vitamin D supplementation and Control group with 400 IU vitamin D supplementation. Comparing the whole blood (PAXgene) transcriptome profile of 30 mothers at enrollment during early pregnancy versus their matching individual profile at 32-38 weeks of gestation.

DESIGN
Whole blood transcriptome, dose response, time course, matched pair analysis
