TITLE
The effect of THADA knockdown on Huh7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use lentivirus carrying shRNA for THADA to evaluate the efect of THADA knockdown in Huh7 cells.

DESIGN
The pGIPZ shRNA plasmid specific to human THADA (clone ID V3LHS_318037 Open Biosystems, Inc.) or the pGIPZ non-silencing shRNAmir lentiviral plasmid (as a control) was cotransfected with the pPACKH1 plasmid mix in HEK 293 cells. Stable clones of Huh7 cells with THADA knockdown were routinely maintained in a medium containing of puromycin (500ng/ml)
