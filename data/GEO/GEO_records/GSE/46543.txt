TITLE
Expression profiling of E. coli rpoS knock-out strain during stationary phase in M9 minimal media with 0.2% glucose

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level in E. coli rpoS knock-out strain grown up to stationary phase in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose

DESIGN
E. coli rpoS deletion mutant grown up to OD600nm 1.5 (stationary phase) in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 371,034 oligonucleotide. Data for wild type controls are GSM389302, GSM389303, and GSM389304.
