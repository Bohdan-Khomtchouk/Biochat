TITLE
Seed transcriptome of xrn4-5 and vcs-8 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au14-08_xrn_vcs - seed transcriptome of xrn4-5 and vcs-8 mutants. - Role of RNA degradation in seed dormancy. - Study of the seeds regulation by the RNA-decay. Comparison between Col0 total RNA and mutants xrn4-5 and vcs-8 RNA, affected in the dormancy and in RNA metabolism.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - gene knock out
