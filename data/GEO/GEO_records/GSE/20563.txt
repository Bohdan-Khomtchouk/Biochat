TITLE
Knockdown of PHF8 in HeLa S3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PHF8 is an H3K9me2 demethylase, interacts with H3K4me3 and RNA Polymerase II, is enriched at thousands of transcription start sites and can act as a transcriptional co-activator. In the following experiment we wanted to analyze the impact of PHF8-knockdown on transcript levels in HeLa cells.

DESIGN
Three independent replicate knockdown experiments with PHF8-shA and control NT-sh were performed (6 samples in total). The two samples of each replicate experiment were hybridized in two color dye swap experiments (6 arrays in total).
