TITLE
Expression data from porcine cells infected with TGEV wild-type (rTGEV-wt) or mutant (rTGEV-delta7) coronaviruses

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense resulting, in most cases, in pathogen clearance with minimal clinical consequences. Viruses have developed diverse strategies to evade innate immune response and to ensure their survival. Using transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as a model, we previously reported that accessory gene 7 counteracts host antiviral response by its association with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c). A transcriptomic analysis was performed to further investigate the effect of gene 7 absence on the host cell.

DESIGN
A recombinant TGEV virus lacking gene 7 expression (rTGEV-delta7) was previously generated in our laboratory. Porcine ST cells were mock infected or infected with wild type (rTGEV-wt) or mutant (rTGEV-delta7) virus. Gene expression was analyzed at 6 and 12 hours post infection (hpi) by using porcine Affymetrix microarray. Three biological replicates were made for each sample type.
