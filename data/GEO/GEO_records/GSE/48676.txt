TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis leavs 10 min after wounding.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Rapid responses to biotic and abiotic insults are crucial for plant survival. We examined the very early (10 min) wound transcriptome in order to increase our understanding regarding this critical intial phase of the plant response to stress. Our analysis revealed a rapid induction of stress-related transcripts that was distinct from the long term events which are dominated by jasmonic pathway responses. The transcriptome showed high correlation between the early wound response and other early but not late responses to innate immune interactions and other abiotic stresses. In addition those early responses were correlated with transcriptomes of response to singlet oxygen as displayed in the flu mutant. Singlet oxygen appears to be a signaling intermediate in the plant response to multiple stresses.

DESIGN
6 samples were analysed in total with 2 replicates from each type of treatment; control (unwounded plants), local (woundedd plants) and systemic (unwounded leaves from wounded plants).
