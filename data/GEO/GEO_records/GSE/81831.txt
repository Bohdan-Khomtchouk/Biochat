TITLE
Gene expression signatures for entecavir treated HepG2.2.15 cells compared to entecavir untreated HepG2.2.15 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further analyze the gene expression profile regulated by entecavir, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the differentially expressed genes. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2.2.15 cells were treated for 48 hr with 10 μmol/L entecavir or 0μmol/L entecavir(control samples) in vitro. The differentially expressed genes including all detected and normalized signal more than 8 were selected and 30 upregulated- and downregulated- genes  were identified between 10μmol/L dose and control samples.Afterwards, the differentially-expressed genes were analyzed using KEGG database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) and none of 30 genes were related to HBV infection-related molecular interaction network were identified.

DESIGN
Entecavir-regulated genes in HepG2.2.15 cells was measured at 48 hours after exposure to doses of 0 μmol/L, 10 μmol/L.
