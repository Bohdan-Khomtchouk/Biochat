TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in c2c12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proteosome inhibitors such as bortezomib (BTZ) have been used to treat muscle wasting in animal models. However, direct effect of BTZ on skeletal muscle cells has not been reported. In the present study, our data showed that C2C12 cells exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in response to increasing concentrations of BTZ. We used microarrays to detail the differentially expressed genes in c2c12 myoblasts with different culture conditions.

DESIGN
c2c12 cells cultured with different conditions were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Culture conditions: 10C(cultured with 10%FBS);10B(cultured with 10%FBS,treated with 10 nM BTZ for 24h);10T(cultured with 10%FBS,treated with 50ng/ml TNF-α for 24h);2C(cultured with 10%FBS,then add 2% differentiation medium, harvest at 5th day);2B(cultured with 10%FBS,then add 2% differentiation medium, treated with 10 nM BTZ at 4th day, harvest at 5th day);2T(cultured with 10%FBS,then add 2% differentiation medium, treated with 50ng/ml TNF-α at 4th day, harvest at 5th day)
