TITLE
H2ABbd ChIP-seq and MeDIP sequence result

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H2ABbd is a unique histone H2A variant that shares only 40 ~ 50 % sequence identity with canonical H2A. It has only been identified in mammals and has quickly evolved with remarkable sequence diversity among different species. H2ABbd is ubiquitously expressed in most cells and tissues. It is mainly deposited in gene body region.The localization of H2ABbd is associated with methylated CpG islands in mouse ES cells.H2ABbd facilitates transcription elongation to go through methylated CpG islands in the gene bodies. One typical example is that H2ABbd regulates transcription elongation at imprinted loci.

DESIGN
We found H2ABbd enriched in some methylated loci. Using ChIP-seq and MeDIP-seq, we test the correlation of H2ABbd and DNA methylation.
