polyA mRNA RNA-seq from SK-N-DZ (ENCSR255NYQ)

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a neuroblastoma immortalized cell line SK-N-DZ derived from a metastatic site in the bone marrow of a 2 year old female. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
