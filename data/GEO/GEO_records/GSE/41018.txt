TITLE
Rapamycin extends life span, but has limited effects on aging in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rapamycin extends life span in mice, but it remains unclear if this compound also delays mammalian aging. Here, we present results from a comprehensive large-scale assessment of a wide rage of structural and functional aging phenotypes in mice. Rapamycin extended life span but showed few effects on a large number of systemic aging phenotypes, suggesting that rapamycin's effects on aging are largely limited to the regulation of age-related mortality and carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 2-4 male mice of each analysed group (25 weeks old controls, 25 month old controls, 25 month old rapamycin treated)

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
