TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq Reveals Unique Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypes in Culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background.  Heterogeneity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been classically defined with a small set of predefined markers.  Single cell genomics provides a unique unbiased approach to evaluate VSMC phenotypes. Objectives. The goal of this study was to define the heterogeneity of primary murine VSMCs grown in culture. VSMCs grown in culture are routinely used as a model of VSMCs in the vessel wall.  We wanted to better understand the assumptions of this model.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on single aortic VSMCs from 3-4 month old male mice at passages 1 and 2 (P1 and P2). Single cell contractility measurements were performed using Traction Force microscopy.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
