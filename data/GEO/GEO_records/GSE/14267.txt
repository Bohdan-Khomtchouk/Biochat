TITLE
microRNA profiling of myocardial infarction on a PI3K setting in mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure, and is induced either by physiological stimuli eg postnatal development, chronic exrcise training or pathological stimuli eg pressure or volume overload. This data set looks at microRNA profiles in mouse models to examine whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p110 alpha isoform) activity is critical for the maintenance of cardiac function and long term survival in a seeting of heart failure (myocardial infarction). The significance and expected outcome are to recognise genes involved in models of heart failure and attempt to examine underlying regulator pathways involved in possible cardica maintenance in the PI3K mouse model. The matching mRNA gene expression profile (GSE7487) is examined to look for mRNA and microRNA interactions. miRNA expression correlates directly with cardiac function. PI3K regulon ameliorates cardiac stress. Keywords: microRNA profiling, regulatory pathway discovery, genotype comparison
