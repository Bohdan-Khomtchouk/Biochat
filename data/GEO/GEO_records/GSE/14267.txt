TITLE
microRNA profiling of myocardial infarction on a PI3K setting in mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure, and is induced either by physiological stimuli eg postnatal development, chronic exrcise training or pathological stimuli eg pressure or volume overload. This data set looks at microRNA profiles in mouse models to examine whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p110 alpha isoform) activity is critical for the maintenance of cardiac function and long term survival in a seeting of heart failure (myocardial infarction). The significance and expected outcome are to recognise genes involved in models of heart failure and attempt to examine underlying regulator pathways involved in possible cardica maintenance in the PI3K mouse model. The matching mRNA gene expression profile (GSE7487) is examined to look for mRNA and microRNA interactions. miRNA expression correlates directly with cardiac function. PI3K regulon ameliorates cardiac stress. Keywords: microRNA profiling, regulatory pathway discovery, genotype comparison

DESIGN
Ntg (non-transgenics), dnPI3K (cardiac-specific transgenic model with reduced PI3K activity) and caPI3K (transgenic mice with increased PI3K activity) mice at 3-4 months of age were used. Mice were then subjected to myocardial infarction (occlusion of the left anterior descending aorta) and sham (open heart surgery) for 8 weeks. Left ventricles were harvested. The resulting 6 experimental models were profiled accordingly. The assignment of the mouse models is as follows: caPI3K Sham, Ntg Sham, dnPI3K Sham, caPI3K MI (myocardial infarction), Ntg MI and dnPI3K MI with n = 4 in each group.
