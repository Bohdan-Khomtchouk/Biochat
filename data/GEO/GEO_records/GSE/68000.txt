TITLE
Transcriptome of human liver cells and culture-activated hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular determinants of a healthy human liver cell phenotype remain largely uncharacterized. In addition, the gene expression changes associated with activation of primary human hepatic stellate cells, a key event during fibrogenesis, remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide the transriptomic profile underpinning the healthy phenotype of human hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and quiescent hepatic stellate cells (qHSCs) as well as activated HSCs (aHSCs) We assess the transcriptome for purified, non-cultured human hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and quiescent hepatic stellate cells (qHSCs) as well as culture-activated HSCs (aHSCs).

DESIGN
Hepatocytes (n=2 donors), LSECs (n=3), qHSCs (n=3) and in vitro activated HSCs (n=3; from the same donors as the qHSCs and LSECs) were used for this study.
