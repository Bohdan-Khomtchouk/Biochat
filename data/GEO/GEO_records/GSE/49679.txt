TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Neurospora crassa conidia undergoing a time-course: Δpp-1 vs WT

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa OR74A

SUMMARY
To study the consequences of transcription factor pp-1 deletion during vegetative cell fusion, we performed whole genome microarrays of WT and Δpp-1 conidia during their initial growth period (3h - 8h).

DESIGN
The WT (FGSC2489) and Δpp1 strains were analyzed at five different timepoints. Cy3 and Cy5 dye swaps were performed.
