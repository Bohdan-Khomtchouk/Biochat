TITLE
Gene expression and synergistic interactions induced by CpG ODN and/or poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bioinformatic analysis of microarray data was used to identify the regulatory patterns underlying changes in gene expression induced when RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated via TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) and/or via TLR3 by poly (I:C). While the genes activated by each ligand mediated similar functions, poly (I:C) elicited a larger and more diverse change in gene expression. Co-stimulation with both ligands accelerated gene expression and synergistically activated genes primarily associated with immune function. This is the first work to compare global changes in gene regulation triggered by distinct TLR pathways and clarify their impact on gene expression.

DESIGN
RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 1mM sodium pyruvate at 37C in a 5% CO2 in air incubator. Cells were washed, transferred into new flasks, and rested for 16 hr before being stimulated with 3.2 ug/ml CpG ODN and/or 32 ug/ml poly(I:C) for 4 - 12 hr. All experiments were independently repeated three times, and data from all experiments combined for analysis. Control samples included RAW 264.7 cells that were unstimulated and collected at 4 and 12 hours. All arrays used reverse transcribed mRNA from stimulted and unstimulated RAW cells as well as Universal Mouse Reference RNA purchased from Stratagene, La Holla, CA.
