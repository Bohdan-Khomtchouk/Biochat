TITLE
Gene expression and synergistic interactions induced by CpG ODN and/or poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bioinformatic analysis of microarray data was used to identify the regulatory patterns underlying changes in gene expression induced when RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated via TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) and/or via TLR3 by poly (I:C). While the genes activated by each ligand mediated similar functions, poly (I:C) elicited a larger and more diverse change in gene expression. Co-stimulation with both ligands accelerated gene expression and synergistically activated genes primarily associated with immune function. This is the first work to compare global changes in gene regulation triggered by distinct TLR pathways and clarify their impact on gene expression.
