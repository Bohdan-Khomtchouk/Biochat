TITLE
Systems biology of immunity to MF59-adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines in early childhood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in ninety 14-24 month old healthy children.

DESIGN
This study was a phase II, open labeled randomized control trial to describe immune & transcriptomic responses to trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV, Imuvac®, Abbott Healthcare Products Ltd) and MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV, Fluad®, Novartis Vaccines) in 14-26 month old, healthy children (n=90). Subjects within each vaccine arm were randomized to three cohorts: A, B and C. All subjects received two vaccinations at D0 and D28. Blood samples were obtained from all subjects at D0 (pre-vacciantion baseline) and D56. Additionally, blood samples were obtained at D29 (cohort A), D31 (Cohort B) and D35 (Cohort C) (D1, 3, and 7 post boost respectively). Staggered cohort design allowed to obtain 5 blood samples while liniting the number of blood draws for each subject to 3.
