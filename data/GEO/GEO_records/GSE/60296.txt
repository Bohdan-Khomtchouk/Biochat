TITLE
Comparison of total and cytoplasmic mRNA reveals global regulation by nuclear retention and miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We extracted RNA from whole cells and RNA from the cytoplasm and performed RNA sequening to compare differences in gene expression level and investigate what is the most appropriate estimate of the amount of mRNA present in a given cell population. The study was based on three human cell lines.

DESIGN
Analyze of transcriptome in 3 human cell lines (U-2 OS, A-431, U-251MG). Each cell line was prepared with four biological replicates for total RNA and four for cytoplasmic RNA.

PLATFORM
