TITLE
Transgenic expression of miR-32 in mouse dorsolateral prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of dorsolateral prostate of mice with prostate-specific transgenic expression of miR-32 compared with wild type mice.

DESIGN
RNA pool of 6 wild type mice was compared with RNA pool of 6 miR-32 transgenic mice at 6 months of age.
