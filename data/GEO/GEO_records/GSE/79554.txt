TITLE
Targets of FRUITFULL in the pistil/silique [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To learn more about the role of FRUITFULL (FUL), in pistil/silique development, we performed a ChIP-seq experiment to identify direct targets of FUL in the pistil/silique.

DESIGN
We used a pFUL:FUL-GFP line to conduct chromatin immuno-precipitation experiments with GFP-specific antibodies followed by deep-sequencing (ChIP-seq) in order to determine FUL binding sites on a genome-wide scale. For the samples, pistils/siliques from flower stages 12-16 were harvested, fixed for 15-30â€™ and the immunoprecipitation was performed according to Kaufmann et al., 2010 (doi: 10.1038/ nprot.2009.244.).  Experiments were done in two biological replicates with the according input samples as controls.
