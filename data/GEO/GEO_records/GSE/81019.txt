TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in control bam-Gal4 and control undriven tbrd-2RNAi Drosophila testes with tbrd-2 knockdown testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression is tightly linked to histone acetylation on lysine residues that can be recognized by bromodomains. The testis-specific bromodomain protein tBRD-2 is essential for male fertility, interacts with tBRD-1 and might act as a co-factor of testis-specifc TAFs. Here, we perform microarray analyses and demonstrate that tBRD-2 selectively controls gene expression in male germ cells.

DESIGN
Testes were dissected from 0-2 day old Drosophila males. The control samples were bam-Gal4 and undriven tbrd-2 RNAi. In addition testes from tbrd-2 knockdown males were used.
