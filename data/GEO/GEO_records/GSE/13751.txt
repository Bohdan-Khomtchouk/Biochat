TITLE
DIP-chip from Cbf1, Leu3, Pho2, Pho4, Rap1, Rox1, and Swi5

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA Immunoprecipitation was performed using purified, naked, genomic DNA and purified recombinant DNA binding domains for S. cerevisiae transcription factors (Cbf1, Leu3, Pho2, Pho4, Rap1, Rox1, and Swi5) and then competitively hybridized against input DNA on NimbleGen 385k whole-genome, 32bp, tiling arrays to identify the consensus sequence for each transcription factor as a whole in the genome.
