TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium transcription profiles in space flight

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
Salmonella transcription profiles were obtained from samples flown on space shuttle mission STS-115, and compared to profiles from Salmonella grown under identical conditions on the ground. Keywords: stress response, transcriptional profile

DESIGN
Triplicate experimental samples were hybridized to slides that contain three identical Salmonella ORF arrays. Each hybridization was performed with Cy3 labeled total RNA  and Cy5 labeled gDNA as control.
