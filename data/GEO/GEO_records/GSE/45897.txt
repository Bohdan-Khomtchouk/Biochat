TITLE
Gene expression in the islets of 12 wk old Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice and healthy control NOD.B10 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the islets of NOD and NOD.B10 mice at 12 weeks of age, prior to the onset of destructive insulitis.

DESIGN
The pancreata of NOD and NOD.B10 mice (n=6) were frozen and islets were isolated by laser capture microdissection.  Cryosections (8 μm) were cut and stained using the Arcturus HistoGene Frozen Section Staining kit (Applied Biosystems) and laser dissection was performed using the Leica AS LMD and the Leica IM 1000 Image Manager Basic software. Sections from at least 40 individual islets were collected and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Pico Reagent Kit (Agilent). Samples were preamplified using the TrueLabeling-PicoAMP kit (SA Biosciences), post-labeled with Cy5 and run against a Cy3-labeled mouse Universal RNA control (SA Biosciences). Microarrays were performed using the Whole Mouse Genome Microarray Kit, 4×44K 2-color arrays (Agilent Technologies).
