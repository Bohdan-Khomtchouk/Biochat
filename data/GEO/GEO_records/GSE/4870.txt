TITLE
Expression data from T65H translocation mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-specific comparison of gene expression levels in T65H translocation mice, either with or without uniparental duplications of Chrs 7 & 11. Identification of highly differentially expressed transcripts. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Pairwise array comparative analyses were performed using MAS5/GCOS where sample age and tissue were matched, while the sample genotype varied between the compared arrays: matUpDp Chr 7 prox T65H vs either patUpDp Chr 7 prox T65H or normal (T65H translocation mouse w/o uniparental duplications), and matUpDp Chr 7 dist T65H vs normal.
