TITLE
FSHD Muscle Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to contractions of the D4Z4 repeat array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. By comparing genome-wide gene expression data from muscle biopsies of patients with FSHD to those of 11 other neuromuscular disorders, we intend to identify disease-specific changes which are more likely to be involved in the early stages of the disease progression.  The data will help to identify pathological mechanisms involved in FSHD. Keywords: Differentiation design

DESIGN
Comparison of the profiles of FSHD to 13 other conditions for disease-specific changes.  The 13 conditions are NHM (Normal healthy muscle) n=15; JDM (Juvenile dermatomyositis) n=25; HSP (Human spastic paraplegia) n=4; FSHD (facioscapulohumeral dystrophy) unaffected n=5, affected n=9; FKRP (Fukutin related protein deficiency) n=7; ED-L (Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, lamin A/C deficiency) n=4; ED-E (Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, emerin deficiency) n=4; DYSF (dysferlinopathy) n=10; DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) n=10; CALP (Calpain-3 deficiency) n=10; BMD (Becker Muscular Dystrophy) n=5; AQM (Acute quadriplegic myopathy) n=5; ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) n=9.
