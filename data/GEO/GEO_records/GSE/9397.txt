FSHD Muscle Profiles

SUMMARY
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to contractions of the D4Z4 repeat array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. By comparing genome-wide gene expression data from muscle biopsies of patients with FSHD to those of 11 other neuromuscular disorders, we intend to identify disease-specific changes which are more likely to be involved in the early stages of the disease progression.  The data will help to identify pathological mechanisms involved in FSHD. Keywords: Differentiation design
