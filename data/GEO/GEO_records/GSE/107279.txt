TITLE
Global microRNA profiling in human bone marrow skeletal (stromal or mesenchymal) stem cells revealed candidates for bone tissue engineering

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed small RNA sequencing on telomerized human bone marrow skeletal (stromal or mesenchymal) stem cells (hMSC-TERT) at various timepoints during differentiated into osteoblasts

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing of undifferentiated (day 0) mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and various time points (6 hour, 12 hour, 24 hour, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, 13 days) after start of differentiation protocol. Sequencing libraries are prepared with Illumina TruSeq small RNA sample preparation kit

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
