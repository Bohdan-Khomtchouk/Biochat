TITLE
Interferon-alpha signaling promotes AGM HSC maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interferon-alpha promotes engraftment of mid-gestation hematopoietic stem cells by promoting competitiveness and restore the hematopoietic defect of Arid3a knockout embryos We used microarray to response of AGM HSCs (VE+CD45+) to IFNa (0.5ng/ml) treatment for 4 hours

DESIGN
Isolated VE+CD45+ cells from E11.5 AGM were treated with IFNa (0.5ng/ml) in 10% FBS/IMDM for 4 horus before RNA isolation. RNA was NuGen amplified.
