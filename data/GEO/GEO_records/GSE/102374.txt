TITLE
RNA transcriptome analysis of floral buds of male-fertile and male-sterile tomato

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To compare the global gene expression between male sterile line (ms1035) and fertile line (T-1082), RNA-seq was performed using different tstages of floral buds. A strand-specific RNA-seq library was constructed and sequence using Illumina Hiseq 2500. Differentailly expressed genes were identified using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0 and DESeq tool of R.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of 3 developmental stages of floral buds.

PLATFORM
GPL19694 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Solanum lycopersicum)
