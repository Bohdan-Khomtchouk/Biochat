TITLE
Mapping DNA methylation across development, genotype, and schizophrenia in the human frontal cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation (DNAm) is important in brain development, and potentially in schizophrenia. We characterized DNAm in prefrontal cortex from 335 non-psychiatric controls across the lifespan and 191 patients with schizophrenia, and identified widespread changes in the transition from prenatal to postnatal life. These DNAm changes manifest in the transcriptome, correlate strongly with a shifting cellular landscape, and overlap regions of genetic risk for schizophrenia. A quarter of published GWAS-suggestive loci (4,208/15,930, p < 10-20) manifest as significant methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), including 59.6% of GWAS-positive schizophrenia loci. We identified 2,104 CpGs that differ between schizophrenia patients and controls, enriched for genes related to development and neurodifferentiation. The schizophrenia-associated CpGs strongly correlate with changes related to the prenatal-postnatal transition and show slight enrichment for GWAS risk loci, while not corresponding to CpGs differentiating adolescence from later adult life.  These data implicate an epigenetic component to the developmental origins of this disorder.

DESIGN
DNA methylation data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 335 controls and 191 patients with schizophrenia. Some samples were run multiple times. The `BrNum` column delineates individual subjects and the `bestQC` column below indicates which samples to use to result in one array per subject.
