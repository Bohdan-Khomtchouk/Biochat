TITLE
Genome-wide maps of DNase I sensitivity in normoxic and hypoxic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide maps of DNase I sensitivity in normoxic and hypoxic cells to provide information on changes in chromatin status in response to oxygen availability.

DESIGN
Examination of 1 cell type (neuroblastoma) under 3 different oxygen conditions.

PLATFORM
