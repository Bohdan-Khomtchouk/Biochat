TITLE
miRNA expression in Blimp-1-deficient dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of Blimp-1 was specifically deleted in dendritic cells (DCs) by breeding Blimp-1 flox and CD11c-CRE mice. MiRNA expression was evaluated and compared from DCs, CD4+ T cells and total B cells from spleens of control and Blimp-1 KO mice.

DESIGN
Age-matched (6-10 weeks old) female mice from control and Blimp-1 KO mice were sacrificed and spleens were collected. CD11chi/MHCIIhi DCs, CD4+TCRb+ T cells and B220+ B cells were sorted by FACSaria. MiRNA was measured from the total RNA preparation.
