TITLE
5-hydroxytryptamine synthesized in the Aorta-Gonad-Mesonephros regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell survival

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole-genome gene expression analysis was performed using the AGMs from two littermate pairs of tph2+/+, tph2+/- or tph2-/- at E11.5. The total RNA was extracted using TRNzol  (Tiangen, Beijing) and cDNA samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq3000 (RiboBio Co. Ltd, Guangzhou). The reference Mus musculus genome and gene information were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Database (NCBI: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ).

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression levels in the AGMs of tph2+/+, tph2+/- or tph2-/- at E11.5

PLATFORM
