TITLE
Global changes in gene expression of grapefruit peel tissue in response to the yeast biocontrol agent M. fructicola

ORGANISM
Citrus x paradisi

SUMMARY
This work explores the biochemical responses of surface wonds of fruit to yeast pathogens. Results indicate that significant expression changes occur following wounding and yeast application compared to wounded controls. These changes included a range of defense-related oxidative, signalling and secondary metabolism genes.

DESIGN
Three reps each of control (grapefruit peel) and grapefruit peel following Metschnikowia fructicola treatment.
