TITLE
In vitro activation of Btnl-1 transduced MODE-K cells with different stimuli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to assess how intestinal epithelial cells respond to different soluble factors produced by intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and how this response is altered when the epithelial cells express Btnl1.

DESIGN
Total RNA of MODE-K cells transduced with Btnl1-GFP or GFP alone and stimulated with TNF+IL-1_ in comparison to medium and with supernatant from anti-CD3-activated IEL in comparison to supernatant from unstimulated IEL
