TITLE
microRNA expression data from pediatric primary intracranial germ cell tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intracranial pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs) have different histological differentiations, prognosis and clinical behaviors. Prognosis of patients with germinoma and mature teratoma is good, while patients with other types of GCTs, termed as nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NGMGCTs), require more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimen. The mechanisms underlying different prognosis of various GCT subgroups remain elusive. We presented the first miRNA profile of pediatric primary intracranial GCTs.

DESIGN
12 central nervous system GCT cases with different histological subtypes are subjected to miRNA expression analysis. The histological subtypes are germinoma, mixed GCT of germinoma and mature teratoma , immature teratoma , mixed GCTs of NGMGCTs category,  yolk sac tumor, immature teratoma, and embryonal carcinoma.
