TITLE
BRG1 recruitment by transcription factors MITF and SOX10 defines a specific configuration of regulatory elements in the melanocyte lineage (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is the master regulator of the melanocyte lineage. By tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we present a comprehensive characterisation of the MITF interactome comprising multiple novel cofactors involved in transcription, DNA replication and repair and chromatin organisation, including a BRG1 chromatin remodelling complex comprising CHD7. BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. MITF, SOX10 and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a combinatorial signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of MAREs. Nevertheless, BRG1 silencing enhances MITF occupancy at MAREs showing that BRG1 acts to promote dynamic MITF interactions with chromatin.

DESIGN
19 samples corresponding to mRNA profiles of 501Mel and Hermes3A after MITF, BRG1 or control shRNA-mediated knockdown were generated by deep sequencing in triplicate (in duplicate for 501_shMITF and corresponding control 501_shSCR2), using HiSeq2500.
