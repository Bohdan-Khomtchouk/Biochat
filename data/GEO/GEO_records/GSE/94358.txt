TITLE
Expression data from ovarian cancer cells grown in different culture condtions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells grown in culture conditions that enrich for cancer stem cells are more tumoigenic and have higher resistance to chemotherapy. We used Affymetric microarrays to understand the global gene expression patterns that are suppressed or enhanced to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance and tumorigenecity

DESIGN
Ovarian cancer cells were grown in various conditions for three days before collection of cells for RNA extraction, purification and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays. The experiment was performed three for each condition leading to three independent biological replicates.
