TITLE
TNFa-stimulation of XIAP -/- MEF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
XIAP (X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; ILP, BIRC4) is involved not only in apoptosis, but also in signal tranduction in the NF-kappaB, TGF-beta, bone morphogenic protein, and JNK signalling pathways. We have analyzed whether XIAP deletion leads to changes in gene expression, particularly after inflammatory stimulation. Keywords: genetic modification, inflammatory response

DESIGN
Fibroblasts from wild-type and XIAP knockout mice were analyzed with and without TNFa stimulation (4 hours) using Affymetrix U74Av2 arrays.
