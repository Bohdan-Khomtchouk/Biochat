TITLE
Expression analysis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (5-8F and 6-10B)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line 5-8F expression patterns against low metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line 6-10B.

DESIGN
This study was done to screen genes related with metastasis in NPC. The microarray analyses were done in a same batch. 6-10B cells are cultured and harvested at three different time points.
