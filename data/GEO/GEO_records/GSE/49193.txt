TITLE
Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks and genomic contacts of human rDNA units are involved in epigenetic regulation [rDNA units]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
4C procedure was used for analysis of genomic contacts of rDNA units in HEK 293T cells. The primers for 4C were selected inside IGS. Our data indicate that mostly rDNA units exhibit close proximity with pericentromeric regions in different chromosomes. We also detected the contacts within a rDNA unit and between rDNA units.

DESIGN
Examination of rDNA genome-wide contacts in HEK 293T cells using 4C approach.
