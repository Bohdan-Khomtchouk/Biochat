TITLE
Expression analysis of Acacia koa in response to mechanical stimuli

ORGANISM
Acacia koa

SUMMARY
The genes induced by mechanical stimuli may be also involved in disease resistance and wood formation and development in Acacia koa.  If so, mechanically stressed A. koa may be used as a model to study disease resistance and wood formation and development. Microarray analysis was performed to determine expression levels of 4,000 genes related to disease resistance and wood development in Acacia koa in response to mechanical stimuli (touch).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from two groups of A. koa seedlings, (1) mechanically stressed and (2) unstressed koa seedlings. Each group had two biological replicates (n=2), where n represents pools of approcimately 20 individuals.
