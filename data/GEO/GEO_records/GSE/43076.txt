TITLE
Human lymphoblastoid cell lines: controls vs. patients with autism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are relatively common neurodevelopmental conditions whose biological basis has been incompletely determined. We analyzed the metabolic profile of lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with ASDs and normal individuals, using the Biolog Phenotype plates. To validate our metabolic findings, we utilized the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray to evaluate the level of gene expression in the tested cell lines. As a comparison for gene expression profiles in cells of patients with ASDs, we also performed microarray analysis for lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with intellectual disability (ID). Two independent experiments were performed for each sample. To maximize the contrast between samples, we implemented a loop experimental design.

DESIGN
Loop design for maximal contrast.
