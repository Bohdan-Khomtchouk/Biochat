TITLE
Heterologous Microarray Hybridization Between Vesicomyid Symbionts

ORGANISM
Calyptogena magnifica symbiont ; Calyptogena kilmeri gill symbiont ; Calyptogena pacifica gill symbiont

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to use heterologous microarray hybridization to determine genomic content shared among different vesicomyid symbionts.  These symbionts are closely related and can be thought of as different strains of bacteria, facilitating the use of heterologous microarray hybridization to determine genomic content. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Microarrays were built off the Ruthia magnifica genome and two replicate hybridizations to this organism were used as a baseline for comparisons. Genomic DNA from two other vesicomyid symbionts (Calyptogena kilmeri and C. pacifica symbionts) was also hybridized to the array with three biological replicates for each sample.
