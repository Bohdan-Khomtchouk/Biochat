TITLE
Genome-wide map of regulatory interactions in the human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated a genome-wide interaction map of regulatory elements in human cells (K562, GM12878) using Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) experiments targeting six broadly distributed factors. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to https://www.encodeproject.org/about/data-use-policy

DESIGN
Chromatin interactions identified by ChIA-PET for 4 different histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac), RAD21 and RNAPII in the K562 cell line, two biological replicates each. Additionally, chromatin interactions were identified by ChIA-PET in the GM12878 cell line for RAD21.
