Atr maintains chromosomal integrity during postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis [Affymetrix]

SUMMARY
Microcephaly and medulloblastoma result from mutations that compromise genomic stability. We report that Atr, which is mutated in the microcephalic disorder Seckel syndrome, is required to maintain chromosomal integrity during postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis. Atr deletion in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) induced proliferation-associated DNA damage, p53 activation, apoptosis, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Co-deletions of either Bax and Bak or p53 prevented apoptosis in Atr-deleted CGNPs, but failed to fully rescue cerebellar growth. Atr-deficient CGNPs showed impaired cell cycle checkpoint function and continued to proliferate, accumulating chromosomal abnormalities. RNA-Seq demonstrated that the transcriptional response to Atr-deficient proliferation was p53-driven. Acute Atr inhibition in vivo by nanoparticle-formulated VE-822 reproduced the disruptions seen with Atr deletion. Our data show that p53-driven apoptosis and senescence, and non-apoptotic cell death redundantly limit growth in Atr-deficient progenitors. These overlapping mechanisms that suppress growth in Atr-disrupted CGNPs may be exploited for treatment of CGNP-derived medulloblastoma using Atr inhibition.
