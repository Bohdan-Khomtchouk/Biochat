TITLE
Effect of Exportin-5 expression on Mouse fibroblasts in cell cycle re-entry phase

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the effect of Exportin-5 expression on the MEF cells in cell cycle re-entry phase, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling on the MEF cells in cell cycle re-entry phase with and without down regulation of Exportin-5 gene.

DESIGN
Mouse MEF cells were transfected with 60nM of siRNA targeting either Exportin-5 or negative control, and incubated for 12 hours. After incubation, cells were starved with DMEM containing 0.2% FCS for 48 hours and re-fed with DMEM containing 20%FCS for 24 hours, along with second siRNA transfection. Two independant expreiments were preformed.
