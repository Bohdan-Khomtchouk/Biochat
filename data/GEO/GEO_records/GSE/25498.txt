TITLE
Effect of Exportin-5 expression on Mouse fibroblasts in cell cycle re-entry phase

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the effect of Exportin-5 expression on the MEF cells in cell cycle re-entry phase, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling on the MEF cells in cell cycle re-entry phase with and without down regulation of Exportin-5 gene.
