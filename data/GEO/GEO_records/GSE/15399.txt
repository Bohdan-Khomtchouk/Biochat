TITLE
Global analysis of differential polyadenylation of mRNAs during mitotic cell cycle: S phase versus G2/M phase.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the poly(A) tail length status of mRNAs of HeLa cells between two phases of the mitotic cell cycle: S and G2/M phases. Hundreds of mRNAs were found to be regulated by changes in their poly(A) tail length during mitotic cell cycle in a phase specific manner. Many of these differentially polyadenylated mRNAs encode proteins related to cell death, cell cycle and cellular growth and proliferation.   HeLa cells were synchronized with double thymidine blockade (12 hours with 2 mM thymidine, 12 hours release, and 12 hours with 2 mM thymidine),  and samples were taken after 2 hours release (S phase) and 8 hours release (G2/M phase). For each condition total RNA was purified by two different procedures: poly(U) chromatography and oligo(dT)-chromatography. Poly(U)-chromatography (Jacobson, 1987): 100 μg of total RNA were bound to poly(U)-sepharose (Sigma) and eluted at 35ºC to isolate mRNAs with short poly(A) tail ( < 30As, SHORT fraction). Oligo(dT) chromatography: mRNAs were purified independently of their poly(A) tail length with Ambion Poly(A)Purist kit from 20 μg total RNA (ALL fraction).  Jacobson, A.

DESIGN
Comparison of ALL fraction mRNAs and SHORT fraction mRNAs measured after 2 hours (S phase) and 8 hours release (G2/M) from double thymidine blockade; 3 biological replicates at each of the two time points; two technical replicates with dye swapping per comparison.
