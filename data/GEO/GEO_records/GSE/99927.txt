TITLE
Generation and characterization of a mouse line for monitoring translation in dopaminergic neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a mouse line targeting midbrain dopamine neurons for Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP).  Here, we briefly report on the basic characterization of this mouse line including confirmation of expression of the transgene in midbrain dopamine neurons and validation of its effectiveness in capturing mRNA from these cells.  We also report a translational profile of these neurons which may be of use to investigators studying the gene expression of these cells.  Finally, we have donated the line to Jackson Laboratories for distribution and use in future studies.

DESIGN
Replicate pools of 5 mixed sex adult mice from the Slc6a3 JD1640 TRAP line were analyzed.
