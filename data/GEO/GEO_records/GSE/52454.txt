TITLE
Functional analysis of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 in keratinocytes: Identification of Nrf2-regulated miRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrf2-regulated mRNAs are known; however, no Nrf2-regulated miRs have been identified miR microarray analysis from total RNA samples was performed to test which miRs are regulated by Nrf2

DESIGN
Total RNA from skin of mice with constitutively active Nrf2 (CMV-caNrf2), dominant-negative Nrf2 (dnNrf2), and correcponding control littermates (K5Cre(wt) for CMV-caNrf2 and wt for dnNrf2)

PLATFORM
GPL15547 Agilent-035430 mouse miRNA array (miRBase release 17 miRNA ID version)
