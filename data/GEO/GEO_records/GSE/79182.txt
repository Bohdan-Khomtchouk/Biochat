TITLE
Deficiency of myeloid-related proteins 8 and 14 (Mrp8/Mrp14) does not block inflammaging but prevents steatosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Mrp8 and Mrp14 proteins (calprotectin) accumulate within tissues during aging and may contribute to chronic inflammation. To address this possibility, we evaluated calprotectin-deficient Mrp14-KO and wild-type (WT) mice at 5 and 24 months of age. However, there was no evidence that age-related inflammation is blunted in KO mice. Inflammation makers were in fact elevated in livers from old KO mice, and microarray analysis revealed more consistent elevation of genes specifically expressed by B-cells and T-cells. Adipose-specific genes, however, were less consistently elevated in aged KO mice, suggesting an anti-steatosis effect of Mrp8/14 deficiency. Consistent with this, genes decreased by the anti-steatosis agent SRT1720 were decreased in old KO compared to old WT mice. Expression of lipid metabolism genes was altered in KO mice at 5 months of age, along with genes associated with development, biosynthesis and immunity. These early-age effects of Mrp8/14 deficiency, in the absence of any external stressor, were unexpected. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a pro-steatosis rather than pro-inflammatory role of calprotectin within the aging liver. This appears to reflect a developmental-metabolic phenotype of Mrp14-KO mice that is manifest at a young age in the absence of pro-inflammatory stimuli.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between Mrp14-KO and wild-type (WT) mice at young and old ages (5 and 24 months, respectively). Expression was profiled in 5-8 mice per group (young-WT: n = 5; young-KO: n = 5; old-WT: n = 6; old-KO: n = 8)
