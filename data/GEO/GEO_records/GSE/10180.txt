TITLE
High-throughput pyrosequencing of endogenous small RNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and polIV mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of the endogenous small RNA content of Arabidopsis flower bud tissue: wild type vs. mutants in polIV pathways Keywords: High throughput 454 small RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts was ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to 454 high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.454.com for details of the sequencing technology.
