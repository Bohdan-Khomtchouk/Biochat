TITLE
Using FlyAtlas to identify better Drosophila models of human disease

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A new online resource (flyatlas.org) provides the most comprehensive view yet of expression in multiple tissues of Drosophila. Meta-analysis of the data reveals that a significant fraction ofthe genome is expressed with great tissue specificity in the adult, demonstrating the need for the functional genomic community to embrace a wider range of functional phenotypes. Well-known developmental genes are often re-used in surprising tissues in the adult, suggesting new functions. The homologues of many human genetic disease loci show selective expression in  Drosophila tissues with function analogous to the affected tissues in the cognate human disease, providing a useful filter for potential candidate genes.

DESIGN
FlyAtlas is composed of data so far covering 31 distinct adult and larval tissues with 4 replicates on run using Affymetrix Dros Genome 2 chips, and compared with a matched whole-fly sample. The resource is continuosly extended with the funding secured until 2010.
