TITLE
Expression data of Intracranial aneurysm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intracranial aneurysm is a cerebrovascular disorder in which degeneration of intima and internal elastic lamina of a cerebral artery or vein causes a localized dilation or ballooning of the blood vessel. Different molecular mechanisms are involved in sIA formation in patients. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of intracranial aneurysm.

DESIGN
Intracranial aneurysm and matched superficial temporal artery were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared intracranial aneurysm (IA) wall tissues with control superficial temporal artery walls
