TITLE
HepG2-MEK Inhibition with PD98059

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcripts (mRNA) during amino acid limitation after MEK was inhibited were analyzed.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were pretreated with MEK inhibitor, PD98059 for 1 hour, then incubated in complete medium and a medium depleted for Histidine for 8 hours. For Inhibitor treated cells, PD98059 was included in the medium during the following 8 hours-incubation.
