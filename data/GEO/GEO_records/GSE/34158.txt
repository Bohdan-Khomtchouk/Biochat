TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood  - blood draws at Pre and Post time points of Allergen inhalation challenge (PAX.GR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detecting differential changes in the peripheral whole-blood transcriptome, post-challenge compared to pre-challenge; using globin reduced PAXgene (PAX.GR) tubes

DESIGN
Blood was collected immediately prior to, and two hours after challenge Blood samples from 4 subjects were used to study the effects of globin reduction on differential gene expression Preprocessing and filtering were applied to the PAX.GR dataset using the Factor Analysis for Robust MicroArray Summarization (farms) package in R The Linear Models for MicroArrays (limma) package in R was used to determine differential gene expression using a Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 5%.

PLATFORM
