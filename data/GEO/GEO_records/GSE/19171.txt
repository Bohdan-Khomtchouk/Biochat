TITLE
Genome wide analysis of L1mAb treated SKOV3ip tumors in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent work has indentified L1-CAM as a novel marker for human carcinoma progression. Functionally, L1-CAM promotes tumor cell invasion and motility, augments tumor growth in nude mice and facilitates experimental tumor metastasis. These functional features qualify L1 as an interesting target molecule for tumor therapy. Here we generated a series of novel mAbs to the L1-CAM ectodomain. Among the novel mAbs, L1-9.3 was selected and its therapeutic potential was analyzed in various isotype variants in a model of SKOV3ip cells growing intraperitoneally in CD1 nude mice. Therapy with the IgG2a variant efficiently prolonged survival and reduced tumor burden. This was accompanied by an increased infiltration of F4/80 positive monocytic cells. Expression profiling of tumor derived mRNA revealed that L1-9.3-IgG2a therapy induced altered expression of cellular genes associated with apoptosis and tumor growth. Our results establish that L1 mAb therapy acts via immunological and non-immunological effector mechanism to block tumor growth.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from SKOV3ip tumors isolated from L1 9.3/IgG2a or control treated Balb/c nude mice
