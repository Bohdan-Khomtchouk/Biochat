TITLE
Global hepatic transcript data from LRH-1 WT and LRH-1 K289R jejunums

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from LRH-1 WT and LRH-1 K289R jejunums from mice fed ad libitum and sacrificed at 7 am We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying jejunal function in ad libitum fed mice.

DESIGN
19-21-week-old mice were fed ad libitum, sacrificed at 7 am, and jejunums snap-frozen in liquid nitorgen for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
