TITLE
Bioadhesive black rasberry gel effect on gene expression and proinflammatory proteins in human premalignant oral lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This portion of the study evaluated the effects of topical 10% black raspberry gel application on gene expression profiles of premalignant oral lesions. Topical application of the bioadhesive black rasberry gel was observed to modulate gene expression and reduce proinflammatory proteins in human premalignant oral lesions. Keywords: Human oral tissues treated with 10% berry gfel

DESIGN
Each patient served as their own internal control.  A pretreatment specimen of the premalignant lesion was obtained for baseline parameters.  Following six weeks of treatment, the treated lesional tissue was removed.  All tissue samples were immediately placed in RNA later and placed in a -80 degree freezer until sample preparation.
