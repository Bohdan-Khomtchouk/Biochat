TITLE
C-Myb+ erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived fetal monocytes give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although classified as hematopoietic cells, tissue-resident macrophages are selfrenewing and maintained independently of adult hematopoiesis. While most macrophages originate from embryonic precursors that seed tissues prior to birth, their exact origin is unknown. Using an in utero macrophage depletion strategy and fatemapping of yolk sac (YS) and fetal liver (FL) hematopoiesis, we found that YS macrophages are the main precursors of microglia, while most other macrophages derive from fetal monocytes. Both YS macrophages and fetal monocytes arise from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) generated in the YS. In the YS, EMP gave rise to macrophages without monocytic intermediates, while EMP seeding the FL upon the establishment of blood circulation acquired c-Myb expression and gave rise to fetal monocytes that then seed embryonic tissues to differentiate into macrophages. Thus, adult tissue-resident macrophages established from HSC-independent embryonic precursors arise from two different developmental programs.

DESIGN
12 samples of progenitors, monocytes or macrophages are analyzed from 2 to 4 replicate. Each replicate derived from at least 5 embryos or adult mice
