TITLE
mRNA expression profile in mouse lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA and mRNA profiling over a 7-point time course, encompassing all recognized stages of lung development and explore dynamically regulated miRNAs and potential miRNA-mRNA interaction networks specific to mouse lung development

DESIGN
replicated time course of mouse lung development in 7 time points
