TITLE
Cell specific deletion of PGC-1α from medium spiny neurons causes transcriptional alterations and age related motor impairment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray data of RNA collected from wild type and PGC-1α null medium spiny neurons prior to apperance of vacuoles to understand affects on transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from striatum collected from age matched (P30) wild type and PGC-1α null mice

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
