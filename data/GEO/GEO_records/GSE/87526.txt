TITLE
Global expression analysis of the trabecular meshwork, cornea, sclera and trabecular meshwork-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TM-MSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray study comparing the trabecular meshwork (TM) with TM-MSC, corneal and scleral tissues

DESIGN
Illumina humanRef-8 v3.0 expression beadchip was used to transcriptionally profile 3 biological replicates each of the TM, cornea, sclera and cultured TM-MSC.
