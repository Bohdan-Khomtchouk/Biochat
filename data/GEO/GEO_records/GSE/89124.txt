TITLE
Effects of Wnt3A on the transcriptome of CCD-18Co human colon fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpouse: To compare the transriptome of CCD-18Co human colon fibroblasts treated with vehicle or Wnt3A. Methods: We treated triplicate plates of CCD-18Co cells with vehicle or Wnt3A during 24 h. Afterwards, we obtained total RNA and used it in RNA-seq experiments. Results: Our analysis rendered a total of 1136 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05), of which 662 were up-regulated and 474 were downregulated in response to Wnt3A. Conclusions: Wnt3A regulates a wide set of genes in CCD-18Co human colon fibroblasts

DESIGN
