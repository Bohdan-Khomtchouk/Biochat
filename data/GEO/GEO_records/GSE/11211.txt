TITLE
Individual Stress Vulnerability Is Predicted by Short-Term Memory and AMPA Receptor Subunit Ratio in the Hippocampus

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic stress is a key risk factor for a variety of diseases, but the determinants of individual stress susceptibility are still unclear. Using a recently developed paradigm for chronic social stress in mice we identified animals that were resistant or susceptible to the persistent effects of chronic stress exposure. Gene expression analysis in laser-microdissected hippocampal subfields of both groups revealed differentially regulated AMPA receptor subunits, which might affect the susceptibility of an individual to chronic social stress. To test this hypothesis, animals were treated with the AMPA receptor potentiator LY451646 or vehicle during the last 4 weeks of chronic stress exposure. Enhanced AMPA receptor function in chronically stressed animals ameliorated the lasting effects of the chronic stress exposure on physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioural parameters. Our data suggest that differences in AMPA receptor function may underlie individual stress susceptibility and support AMPA receptor potentiators as potential medication in stress-related diseases.
