TITLE
Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening: Primary Patient AML Blasts, Normal Neutrophils, and Normal Monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a general approach to small molecule library screeening called GE-HTS (Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states and applied it to the identification of compounds inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we identified 8 that reliably induced the differentiation signature, and furthermore yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation. This data set contains 3 primary patient AML samples, 3 normal human neutrophil and 3 normal human monocyte samples. This data set was used to identify the genes that distinguish AML cells from normal human myeloid cells for the purpose of selecting marker genes for the screen. Keywords = AML Keywords = neutrophil Keywords = monocyte Keywords = chemical genomics Keywords: repeat sample
