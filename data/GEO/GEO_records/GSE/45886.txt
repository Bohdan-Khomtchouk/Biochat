synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To investigate the suitable  normalization for  miRNA arrays from samples with global miRNA decrease. Our comparisons of five preprocess steps performed at the probe level demonstrated that the use of cyclic loess relying on non-miRNA small RNAs present on the Affymetrix platform significantly improved specificity and sensitivity of detection of decreased miRNAs.
