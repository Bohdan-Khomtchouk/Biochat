TITLE
Bone gene expression profiles after ovariectomy in multiple inbred strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The peri- and postmenopausal periods in women are associated with decreases in circulating estrogen levels, marked acceleration of age-related bone loss and increased risk of fracture.  However, despite the clinical importance of postmenopausal bone loss, our molecular understanding of this process is incomplete.  Here, we used co-expression network analysis to gain novel insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, a model of human menopause.  Expression profiles from intact and OVX mice from a panel of inbred strains were used to generate a co-expression network consisting of 29 modules.  Genes in network module 25 were decreased by OVX in all strains.  Module 25 was enriched for genes involved in the response to oxidative stress, a process known to be an upstream causal factor for OVX-induced bone loss.  It was also found that module 25 homologs were co-expressed in human bone marrow and were enriched for genes with evidence of genetic association with bone mineral density (BMD) in women.  Alpha synuclein (Snca) was the most highly connected “hub” genes in module 25 and its in vivo knockout resulted in a 40% reduction in OVX-induced bone loss.  Furthermore, protection was associated with the targeted alteration of genes in specific network modules, including module 10.  Our results identify a gene module associated with OVX-induced bone loss and demonstrate that Snca regulates ovariectomy-induced bone loss by controlling bone network dynamics.

DESIGN
Lumbar verebrae (L5) were isolated from three inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ and BALB/cJ) four-weeks post SHAM surgery or ovariectomies (OVX).  A total of 23 samples were profiled (N=3-4 strain/surgical group).
