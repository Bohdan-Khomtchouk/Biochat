TITLE
IL-4 stimulation of Dicer deficient bone-marrow derived macrophages in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages were derived from the bone-marrow of 3 x fl/+ Dicer LysCre +/- (wild-type) and 3 x fl/fl Dicer  LysCre +/- mice and stimulated with IL-4 (50ng/mL) for 72h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by gene array.

DESIGN
In this experiment, we derived Dicer deficient bone-marrow macrophages using Dicer fl/+ LysM-Cre by Dicer fl/+ crossed mice to obtain Dicer fl/fl LysM-cre  progeny (and Dicer deficient macrophages). Next, we studied the effects of IL-4 stimulation in macrophage with a deficiency in Dicer/microRNAs.
