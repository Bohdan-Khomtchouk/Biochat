TITLE
EGFR and MEK pathway signature RNA-Seq datasets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR and MEK pathways were activated alone or in combination in human mammary epithelial cells. We profiled the pathway gene expression signatures using RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
mRNA was extracted from human mammary epithelial cells overexpressing EGFR gene, MEK gene, or EGFR and MEK genes in combination (or GFP control) for RNA-Seq analysis. Experiment was performed in six replicates per condition.
