TITLE
Real- time quantiative PCR analysis of HSC derived from sleep deprived mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HSC were derived from mice sleep deprived for 4 hours and compared to mice that slept for 4 hours during the same circadian time.  5 mice were pooled for each sample and bones from femur, tibia and spine were crushed and stained to lineage deplete and enrich for ckit+, sca-1+,Flk-,CD150+, CD34-

DESIGN
qpcr miRNA profiling from approximately 50ng total RNA extracted from HSC FACS sorted into Trizol.

PLATFORM
GPL14646 TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA A Array v2.0
