TITLE
Expression profiling of EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells overexpressing the AP-1 transcription factor component Fra1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA of control mouse mammary epithelial cells (EpH4 control) and corresponding fra1 overexpressing cells (EpH4fra1 cl1 and EpH4fra1 cl2) was hybridized onto an 53MM chip and differentially expressed targets were further analysed. For each sample hybridization was performed in technical triplicate

DESIGN
By comparison of the gene expression profiles of these samples, genes with significantly altered expression levels will be selected and further characterized.
