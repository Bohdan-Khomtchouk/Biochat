TITLE
Endocytic and signalling function of stabilin-1 in tumor associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stabilin-1 is a scavenger/sorting receptor expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells, alternatively-activated and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in several types of human cancer and mouse tumor models. We have found abundant expression of stabilin-1 on TAM in mouse model of mammary adenocarcinoma (TS/A) We performed microarrays with TAM isolated from wild type (wt) and stabilin-1 knock out (ko) mice in order to examine if stabilin-1 affects gene expression in TAM using mouse model of TS/A mammary adenocarcinoma

DESIGN
Balb/c Wt and stabilin-1 ko female mice (8-12 weeks old) were inoculated s.c. with 5x10e6 TS/A cells. TAM were isolated from TS/A tumors 21 days after tumor challenge using CD11b MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec), lysed for RNA and used for microarrays. Samples from 3 wt and 3 stabilin-1 ko mice were analyzed.
