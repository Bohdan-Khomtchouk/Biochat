TITLE
Effect of adiponectin deficiency on pulmonary responses to subacute ozone exposure in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adiponectin is an adipose-derived hormone with anti-inflammatory activity.  Following subacute ozone exposure (0.3 ppm for 24-72 h), pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation is augmented in adiponectin deficient mice.  The purpose of this study was to use microarrays to examine the impact of adiponectin deficiency on changes in pulmonary gene expression induced by ozone, a common air pollutant.

DESIGN
Lungs were harvested from wildtype and mice that were genetically deficient in adiponectin.  Mice were exposed either to room air or to ozone (0.3 ppm) for 72 h.  RNA was extracted and microarray analysis of gene expression performed. Both male and female mice were used.
