TITLE
The CtsR and HrcA regulon of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 at normal and elevated temperature  Nov 01, 2011   approved

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles of control Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 cells were compared with ctsR, hrcA, and ctsR-hrcA deletion mutants grown in MRS media at 28 and 40 degrees Celcius.

DESIGN
Continuous cultures were performed in duplo on MRS media and whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed on the WCFS1 (WT), NZ3410CM (harboring a chlooramphenicol resistance marker (cat) replacement mutation in ctsR, dc), NZ3425CM (harboring a cat replacement mutation in hrcA, dh), and NZ3423 (harboring deletion mutation in ctsR and a cat replacement mutation inhrcA, dcdh) strains.

PLATFORM
GPL13984 Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 15K 60-mer array, Version 3.1, our ID LPAG3.1_8
