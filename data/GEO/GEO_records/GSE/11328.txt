TITLE
MGAS5005 vs MGAS5005∆ccpA

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the extent of the CcpA regulon in the M1 serotype MGAS5005. Kinkel and McIver, 2008 Infection and Immunity Keywords: group A streptococcus, CcpA

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of MGAS5005 and the isogenic ∆ccpA strain were grown, and RNA was isolated independently 3 times.  The RNA was converted to cDNA and labeled with with either Cy3 or Cy5 using the GE Healthcare CyScribe Post-labelling kit.  The arrays were scanned with GenePix 6.1 and analyzed with Acuity 4.0.
