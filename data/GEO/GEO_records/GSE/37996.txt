TITLE
Tissue-specific differentiation of a circulating CCR9- pDC-like common dendritic cell precursor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Committed precursors of conventional dendritic cells (pre-cDCs) derived from the common DC progenitor which differentiate into cDC subpopulations in peripheral tissues have been identified, but committed precursors for plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have not been found. Here we show that CDP-derived â€˜CCR9- MHCIIlow BST2+ Siglec-H+ pDCs from murine bone marrow which enter the circulation and peripheral tissues have a common DC precursor function in vivo in the steady state. Upon adoptive transfer the fate of CCR9- pDC-like precursors is governed by the tissues they enter. In the bone marrow and liver most transferred CCR9- pDC-like precursors differentiate into CCR9+ pDCs, whereas in peripheral lymphoid organs, lung and intestine they can give rise to CCR9+ pDCs and cDCs. Thus, CCR9- pDC-like cells are novel CDP-derived circulating DC precursors with pDC and cDC potential, whose final differentiation depends on tissue-specific factors allowing adaptation to local requirements.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CCR9- pDC-like common DC progenitors and CCR9+ pDCs was compared for differential gene expression. 3 independent isolations were performed for the 2 samples. 6 arrays were run in total.
