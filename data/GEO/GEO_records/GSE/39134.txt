TITLE
Gene expression profiling of microdissected HRS cells is correlated with primary treatment outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hodgkin lymphoma is derived from germinal center / post-germinal center B cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profilies of micodissected Hodkin Reed Sternberg cells (n=29) were dichotomized into primary treatment failure (n=14) and primary treatment succeses (n=15). Treament failure was defined as refractory disease or progression at any time after ABVD chemotherapy.
