TITLE
Human liver gene expression data from subjects of varying ages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N=134 human liver samples from morbidly obese patients and healthy controls were analysed by array-based mRNA expression profiling. Liver messenger RNA expression datasets from the German patients were generated on the HuGene 1.1 ST gene array The purpose of the study was to correlate these gene expression data with body mass index and with an epigenetic measure of age acceleration based on DNA methylation data.

DESIGN
The liver samples come from subjects whose body mass index ranged from 14.8 to 70.2.  Ages varied between 10 and 85.
