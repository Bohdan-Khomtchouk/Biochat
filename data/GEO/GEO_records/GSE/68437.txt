TITLE
The Arabidopsis GAGA-binding factor BPC6 recruits PRC1 component LHP1 to GAGA DNA-motifs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant BBR/BPC transcription factors contain the conserved Basic-Pentacystein (BPC) DNA-binding domain. Arabidopsis group II BBR/BPC proteins interact with PRC1 component LHP1 in vivo. Microarray experiments with Arabidopsis bpc4 bpc6, lhp1-4 and lhp1-4 bpc4 bpc6 suggest an importance of this interaction in the concerted repression of homeotic genes. In this study, we used the ATH1 GeneChip microarray to investigate transcript abundance in different Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Columbia) were grown in the greenhouse under constant temperature of 20Â°C, 35% humidity and a 18-h light period. 18 days old plants were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six individual plants were pooled per replicate.
