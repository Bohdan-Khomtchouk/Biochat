TITLE
Expression analysis of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 grown on different carbohydrates

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression levels in Clostridium acetobutylicum strain 824 grown individually on starch, galactose, lactose, mannose, fructose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, cellobiose, maltose, sucrose

DESIGN
A 33 array study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum 824 grown on each of the following sugars: starch, galactose, lactose, mannose, fructose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, cellobiose, maltose, sucrose.  RNA extraction, cDNA production, and labeling were performed independently on three separate cultures for each carbohydrate.  Each independent sample was hybridized to one array equating to one technical replicate for each biological sample and three biological replicates for each condition tested.  Each array contains 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum 824 genome.
