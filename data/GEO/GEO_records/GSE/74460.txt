ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of basal gene expression in patient-derived xenograft cells. A panel of pediatric ALL xenografts was utilized to further understand the biology of leukemia.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from patient-derived xenograft cells. Array analysis was carried out on Illumina beadchip HT12.
