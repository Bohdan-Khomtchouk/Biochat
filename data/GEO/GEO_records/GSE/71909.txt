TITLE
Bromodomain inhibition of the transcriptional coactivators CBP/EP300 as a therapeutic strategy to target the IRF4 network in multiple myeloma (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pharmacological inhibition of chromatin co-regulatory factors represents a clinically validated strategy to modulate oncogenic signaling through selective attenuation of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Phenotypic effects are preceded by the direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4 and the subsequent down-regulation of the IRF4 transcriptional program. Ectopic expression of IRF4 antagonizes the phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition and prevents the suppression of the IRF4 target c-MYC. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.

DESIGN
A total of 13 ChIP-seq samples were sequenced.  Samples were treated with control (DMSO) or test compound (2.5 uM SGC-CBP30 or 0.25uM CPI267203) for 6 hours.  Signal from input samples was included to subtract background signal from each ChIP-seq sample.  Antibodies used were against p300, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, or BRD4.
