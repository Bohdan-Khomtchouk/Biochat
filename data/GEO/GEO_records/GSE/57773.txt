TITLE
Discovery of ethanol responsive small RNAs in Zymomonas mobilis

ORGANISM
Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 = ATCC 31821

SUMMARY
This study is aimed for the identification of novel small RNAs under different ethanol producing conditions. We have applied transcriptome analysis to facilitate identification and validation of 15 novel sRNAs in Zymomonas mobilis. We furthermore characterize their expression in the context of high and low levels of intracellular ethanol. Here, we report that 3 of the sRNAs (Zms2, Zms4 and Zms6) are differentially expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, when low and high ethanol productions are observed respectively. These data suggests that in this organism regulatory RNAs can be associated with metabolic functions involved in ethanol stress responses.

DESIGN
Z. mobilis was grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions which showed low and high ethanol production, respectively. Each samples were sequenced for identification of small RNA candidates and differentially expressed candidates between two conditions.
