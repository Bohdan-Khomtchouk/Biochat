TITLE
RNA-sequencing based transcriptome-wide expression profiling of Cynomolgus monkey and human IPSCs in vitro differentiated into endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a macaque in vitro endothelial cell system using induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) from Cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Based on a protocol adapted for human IPSCs we directly differentiated macaque IPSCs into endothelial cells under chemically defined conditions. The resulting endothelial cells can be enriched using magnetic cell sorting and display endothelial marker expression and function. RNA sequencing revealed that the differentiation process closely resembled vasculogenesis. Moreover, we show that endothelial cells derived from macaque and human IPSCs are highly similar regarding gene expression patterns and key endothelial functions such as inflammatory responses. These data demonstrate the power of IPSC differentiation technology to generate defined cell types such as endothelial cells as translational in vitro model to compare cell type specific responses across species.
