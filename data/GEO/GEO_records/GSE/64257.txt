SUMMARY
Introduction: The potential of expression profiling using microarray analysis as a tool to predict the prognosis for different types of cancer has been realized. This study aimed to identify a novel biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC).  Experimental design: The expression profiles of cancer cells in 153 patients with CRC were examined using laser microdissection and oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Overexpression in CRC cells, especially in patients with distant metastases, was a prerequisite to select candidate genes. We analyzed the protein expression and localization of the candidate gene by immunohistochemical study and investigated the relationship between protein expression and clinicopathologic features in 271 CRC patients.  Results: Using microarray analysis, we identified 11 candidate genes related to distant metastases in CRC patients. Among these genes, Traf2- and Nck- interacting kinase (TNIK) was known to be associated with aggressiveness in CRC through Wnt signaling.  Absence of overexpression of TNIK protein was associated with significantly better overall survival (p < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (p < 0.001). Moreover, overexpression of TNIK protein was an independent risk factor for CRC recurrence (p = 0.009).  Conclusion: Overexpression of TNIK might be a predictive biomarker of CRC recurrence.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis was performed using LCM samples of 125 colorectal cancer patients by GeneChip Human Mapping 250k Sty arrays. Non-tumor tissues obtained from 47 patients were used as unpaired reference samples.
