TITLE
Extensive translation of small Open Reading Frames revealed by Poly-Ribo-Seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We present a genome-wide assessment of small open reading frames (smORF) translation by ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in Drosophila S2 cell. In this way, mRNAs bound by multiple ribosomes and hence actively translated can be isolated and distinguished from mRNAs bound by sporadic, putatively non-productive single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits.

DESIGN
Ribosomal profiling of large and small polysomal fractions in Drosophila S2 cells to assess translation of smORFs
