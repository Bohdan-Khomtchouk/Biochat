TITLE
Epigenome analysis of the human subqutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were obtained from severely obese individuals that underwent bariatric surgery. The goal of this study was to identify tissue specific methylation QTLs. Whole-transcriptome subcutaneous adipose tissue methylation levels were determined in 71 individuals with a BMI > 35 kg/m2.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 71 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
