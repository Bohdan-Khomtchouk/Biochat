TITLE
Expression data from rice 10DAF developing seeds from wildtype and strains with high lysine levels

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying seed developing and lysine metabolism.

DESIGN
Rice developing seeds were selected at 15DAF for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the relationship between seed developing and lysine metabolism. To that end, we selected 15DAF developing seeds of wild type and related transgenic plants to analyze the differentially expressed genes.
