TITLE
Genome-Wide Small RNA Profiling of a Soybean Seed Compartment-Cotyledon Stage

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We performed small-RNA profiling of soybean seed regions and sub-regions, to gain new insights into the regulatory processes required for seed differentiation.

DESIGN
Eight subregions of the Cotyledon stage of the soybean seeds were analyzed. Two biological replicates were collected for each subregions.

PLATFORM
GPL15008 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Glycine max)
