TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Glycine max Cotyledons and Trifoliate Leaves to Determine Genes Associated with Senescence

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We use RNA sequencing technology in a time course study to measure transcript abundance from three developmental stages in cotyledons and five stages in the trifoliate leaf of Glycine max to identify genes with distinct temporal patterns of expression during leaf or cotyledon development.  We also examine the diffrences between these two photosynthetic tissues.

DESIGN
Timecourse Expression analysis of Cotyledon Development and Leaf Development using RNAseq on distinct timepoints. 3 stages of the cotyledon were sequenced with 3 biological replicates in each stage. Five stages of the leaf were sequenced with 3 biological replicates for each stage.
