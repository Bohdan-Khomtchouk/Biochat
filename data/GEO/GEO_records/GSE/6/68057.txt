TITLE
Microarray based gene expression for invasive lobular cancer samples (RATHER)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of the RATHER (RAtional THERapy for breast cancer: individualized treatment for difficult-to-treat breast cancer subtypes) consortium, expression profiling of 144 untreated primary invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) breast cancer tissues and 15 ILC cell lines was performed using microarray.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 144 ILC breast cancers and 15 ILC cell lines
