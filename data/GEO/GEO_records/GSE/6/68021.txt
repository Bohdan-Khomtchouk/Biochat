TITLE
Expression data of human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) in response to n-LDL and ox-LDL.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early transcriptomic response to n-LDL and ox-LDL in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC). We used microarrays with the aim of assessing early molecular changes that induce a response in the VSMC using native and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (n-LDL and ox-LDL).

DESIGN
For each LDL internalization experiment, three biological replicates were used and the samples pooled with the aim of obtain three technical replicates (three arrays for condition).
