TITLE
FinHER trial : Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)â€“positive breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The FinHER trial is a multicentre phase 3 randomised adjuvant breast cancer trial that enrolled 1010 patients. The women were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of docetaxel or vinorelbine, followed by three cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.

DESIGN
Of the available Finher HER2 samples, gene mRNA expression data was produced from 202 samples. All samples were re-evaluated to ensure tumour was present in the specimen. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary breast tumour tissue.
