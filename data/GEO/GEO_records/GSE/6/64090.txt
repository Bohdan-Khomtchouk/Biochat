TITLE
Mapping of dsRNA in yeast using reconstituted RNAi pathway

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Small RNA produced by Dicer (Dcr1) are used to map dsRNA in wild-type strain and a xrn1-delta mutant of S. cerevisiae, inactivated for the cytoplasmic 5'-3' RNA decay pathway.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing in wild-type and xrn1-delta strains of S. cerevisiae, with or without reconstituted RNAi pathway.
