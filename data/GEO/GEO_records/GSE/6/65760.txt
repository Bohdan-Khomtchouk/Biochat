ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Malaysian Node of the Human Variome Project Database (MyHVPDb) is a country specific database of human variant and gene mutation that was established in 2011. This ethnic specific mutation and variation databases are being continuously updated, recording extensive information over the genetic heterogeneity of the Malaysian ethnic groups. The database comprises of SNP Database and Mutation Database. The SNP database has stored 291718 SNPs that was obtained by genotyping the SNPs of 101 healthy individuals from six Malay sub-ethnic groups which consist of Malay Kelantan, Malay Banjar, Malay Kedah, Malay Jawa, Malay Bugis and Malay Champa.
