TITLE
Deciphering a functional gene network underlying robustness to protein overproduction

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We systematically investigated the impact of genetic variation and the environment on protein overproduction costs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae To identify genes mediating protein overproduction costs, genetic perturbations were applied. The yEVenus overexpression plasmid was crossed into gene deletion backgound. The generation of double mutant strains enabled us to investigate the transcriptional response of the cells under two different internal stress: deletion of a given gene, plus the overexpression of a gratuitous protein
