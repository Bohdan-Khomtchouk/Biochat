TITLE
Comparing two intestinal porcine epithelial cell lines (IPECs): global expression patterns to characterise a in vitro model of intestinal physiology

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The intestinal epithelial cell lines 1 and J2 (IPEC-1, IPEC-J2) - spontaneously immortalised cell lines from the porcine intestine - are important tools for studying intestinal function. Microarrays (GeneChip Porcine Genome Array) were used to compare the expression pattern at basal in vitro conditions. Expression analyses complemented by morphological, functional and biochemical analyses revealed that IPEC-J2 is a morphologically and functionally more differentiated cell line in comparison to IPEC-1. In addition, IPEC-2 cells are a preferential tool for in vitro studies with the focus on metabolism.

DESIGN
We compared the genome wide gene expression of untreated and IPEC 1 an dIPEC-J2 cells by the GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Array of Affymetrix.
