TITLE
Microarray gene-expression profiles of 69 pancreatic tumors and 61 adjacent non-tumor tissue from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify biologically relevant tumor markers , we  analyzed gene expression profiling of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from PDAC cases. We compared the microarray gene-expression profiles of MIF-high and MIF low expressing tumors as detrmined by qRT-PCR. Affymetrix gene-expression analysis was done in two sets. Affymetrix data from sample number 1-90 were earlier submited by us as GEO accession#: GSE28735. The batch effect between the two sets of data was removed using Partek Genomic Suite and this normalized data was submitted to GEO in this submission. All the analysis was performed using the merged data set.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profile of 69 pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays to identify microRNA targets associated with MIF signaling. Using Partek, we peformed ANOVA and Cox-regression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes that were also associated with survival. The list of genes was then subjected to pathway and biomarker analyses using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA).
