TITLE
Prospective derivation of a 'Living Organoid Biobank' of colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In Rspondin-based 3D cultures, Lgr5 stem cells from multiple organs form ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain their tissue identity. We report the establishment of tumor organoid cultures from 20 consecutive colorectal (CRC) patients. For most, organoids were also generated from adjacent normal tissue. The organoids closely resemble the original tumor. The spectrum of genetic changes observed within the 'living biobank' agrees well with previous large-scale mutational analyses of CRC. Gene expression analysis indicates that the major CRC molecular subtypes are represented. Tumor organoids are amenable to robotized, high-throughput drug screens allowing detection of gene-drug associations. As an example, a single organoid culture was exquisitely sensitive to Wnt secretion (porcupine) inhibitors and carried a mutation in the negative Wnt feedback regulator RNF43 (rather than in APC). Organoid technology may fill the gap between cancer genetics and patient trials, complement cell line- and xenograft-based drug studies and allow personalized therapy design.

DESIGN
We generated organoids from healthy tissue and coloncarcinoma tissue. The organoids were trypsinized, plated in matrigel and overlaid with medium.  After three days, RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy. Medium conditions are the same for all organoids, irrespective of their origin.
