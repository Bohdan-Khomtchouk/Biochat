TITLE
Transcriptome changes for Arabidopsis thaliana in response to lead exposure

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Experiments were achieved on Arabidopsis thaliana. Transcriptional profiling of roots and shoots from plants treated with lead were compared to plants treated in similar conditions without lead. Four weeks old A. thaliana seedlings were treated in hydroponic cultures with Pb during 3 days, by adding or not 40 ÂµM Pb(NO3)2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, lead treated vs. untreated. Biological replicates: 3
