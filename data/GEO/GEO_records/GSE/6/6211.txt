TITLE
Gene Transcription Profile of Local Innate and Adaptive Immunity during Early Phase of IBV Infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanistic basis of local innate and adaptive immunity against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at the molecular level, we examined the gene transcription profile of tracheal epithelial layers at 3 days after infection of chickens with an attenuated IBV-Massachusetts strain. Keywords: Disease State Analysis, Early mucosal immune response, FHCRC 13k chicken array
