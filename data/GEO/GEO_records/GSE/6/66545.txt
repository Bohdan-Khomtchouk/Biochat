TITLE
Gene expression analysis in mesenteric arteries and veins in Crohn's disease compared to controls from nonIBD samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histology in the mesentery pointed to altered blood vessels. This experiment was designed to define the differences in gene expression in vessels from Crohn's disease versus controls. Crohn's disease was separately evaluated in inflamed (central disease) areas and in adjacent noninflamed areas.

DESIGN
Laser capture microdissection was carried out on Carnoy's fixed mesenteric samples, comparing normal arteries or veins with Crohn's inflamed or nonifnlamed arteries or veins.
