TITLE
Prokaryotic expression profiling analysis for single or combined chaperones deletion

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Chaperones have essential role in assist nascent peptides folding, prevent proteins aggregation and maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Considering spatial and temporal features of chaperones regulating in vivo, changes in single or combined chaperone-depleted E.coli strain is needed to be put into understand at transcriptional level. Here, we utilized expression microarrays to investigate global transcriptional response upon deletion of single or multiple chaperones in E. coli for understanding the transcriptional network affected by chaperones. To identify prokaryotic expression profiles in deletion of chaperones, several E.coli mutants were constructed in the following: Z116 (△tig 37℃), Z125(△dnaK37℃), Z625(△tig△dnaK 37℃ or 30℃), Z629(△tig△dnaK 30℃), NM (C-domain of tig was deleted 37℃), MC (N-domain of tig was deleted 37℃), NC (M-domain of tig was deleted 37℃). Two types of cDNA mixtures containing Cy3-labeled (or Cy5-labeled) control DNA (from BW25113) and Cy5-labeled (or Cy3-labeled) DNA targets (from mutant strain) were hybridized with E.coli microarrays in a dye-swap strategy.

DESIGN
E.coli gene expression data of the deletants compared control WT (BW25113). Please note that other mutant microarray data will be added in the future.
