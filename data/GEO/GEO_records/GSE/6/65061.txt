TITLE
A Novel miRNA-Based Predictive Model for Biochemical Failure Following Post-Prostatectomy Salvage Radiation Therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radical prostatectomy remains one of the more widely-used treatment options for men with prostate cancer. However, few molecular biomarkers have been established to predict patients who are at high risk of biochemical failure. To our knowledge, this is the first such report on miRNA profiling in radical prostatectomy tissue using Nanostring. In addition, this is the first report to look at the prognostic value of miRNAs in the setting of biochemical failure and salvage radiation therapy post-radical prostatectomy.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from tumor-enriched 1mm cores from 43 radical prostatectomy paraffin tissue blocks. 800 miRNAs were profiled using the NanoString nCounter human miRNA assay. mirNAs were then correlated to clinical outcomes.
