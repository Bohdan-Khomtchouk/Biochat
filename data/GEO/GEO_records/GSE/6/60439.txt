TITLE
Expression data from rats esophagi

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This microarray study was performed to investigate the molecular events in esophageal SCC carcinogenesis in NMBA induced rat esophageal SCC models.

DESIGN
Rats were housed 3 per cage under standard conditions: 20 ± 2ºC, 50±10% relative humidity, and 12 hours light/dark cycles. After two weeks of acclimation to the animal facility, the rats were administered s.c. injections of 0.2 ml of either NMBA (0.3 mg/kg body weight) or a 1:4 mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO):H2O (the solvent for NMBA) 3 times per week for 5 weeks.
