TITLE
Gene expression profiling on C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts during their myogenic conversion in case of Six4 ablation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we used C3H/10T1/2 cells, a well known model of myogenic conversion, to study the effect of Six4 knockdown on the expression of genes during fibroblasts to myocytes conversion induced by ectopic expression of MyoD

DESIGN
We established C3H/10T1/2 cell line with stable Six4 knockdown  by short hairpin RNA (shSix4) vs a control cell line (shLuc) and converted these cells into myogenic lineage by retroviral transduction of plasmid encoding Flag-MyoD-myc (pBABE-MyoD) or empty plasmid (pBABE). Cells were then induced to differentiate for 24 hours before RNA extraction.
