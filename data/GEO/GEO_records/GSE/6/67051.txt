TITLE
Gene expression analysis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells treated with erlotinib versus DMSO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to detect genes differentially expressed in 2uM erlotinib treatment versus DMSO treatment and to identify differential gene set enrichments.

DESIGN
PC9 or HCC827 cells were seeded in 150cm2 flasks and treated for 8 days with DMSO or 2uM Erlotinib.
