TITLE
Uncovering the abilities of Agaricus bisporus to degrade plant biomass throughout its life cycle

ORGANISM
Agaricus bisporus

SUMMARY
The common edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus is a basidiomycete that thrives on decaying plant material in the forests and grasslands of North America and Europe. It is adapted to forest litter and contributes to global carbon recycling, degrading cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in plant biomass to oligomers and monomers. A. bisporus is also an edible mushroom that is widely cultivated and economically important. However, relatively little is known about how A. bisporus grows in this controlled environment and utilizes its substrate. Using transcriptomics and proteomics, we showed that changes in plant biomass degradation by A. bisporus occur throughout its life cycle. Ligninolytic genes were highly expressed during the spawning stage day 16 and had low expression during all the other growth stages which could indicate that lignin is not modified after the spawning stage. Our results also revealed differences in gene expression involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation between the first and second flushes. This could partially explain the reduction in the number of mushrooms during the second flush.

DESIGN
This study compares the gene expression of A. bisporus A15 at different stages of its life cycle using the controlled environment of indoor commercial cultivation. The samples were taken at the spawning stage,  primordial stage, first flush, after first flush, second flush and after second flush, respectively
