TITLE
GeoChip data of soil microbial communities in the maize rhizosphere and bulk soils

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
Microbial communities in the rhizosphere make significant contributions to crop health and nutrient cycling. However, their ability to perform important biogeochemical processes remains uncharacterized. Important functional genes, which characterize the rhizosphere microbial community, were identified to understand metabolic capabilities in the maize rhizosphere using GeoChip 3.0-based functional gene array method.
