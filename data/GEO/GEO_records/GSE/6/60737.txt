TITLE
Gene expression alteration in chondrocyte by HES1 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate target molecules of HES1, we transduced GFP or HES1 into mouse chondrocyte cell line ATDC5, and performed the microarray analysis. HES1 overexpression increased inflammation-related genes including Il6 and Il1rl1.

DESIGN
We established stable ATDC5 cells overexpressing GFP or HES1 by lentiviral transduction. We harvested mRNA from these cells, and performed microarray analysis.
