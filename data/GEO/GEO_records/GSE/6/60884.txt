TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis for miRNA in mouse CD8+ pMel-1 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse CD8+ pMel-1 transgenic T cells were primed by either splenic B cells or LPS-matured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells for 3 days in vitro. CD8+TCRb+ cells were then sorted for miRNA expression profiling by RT-qPCR.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling.
