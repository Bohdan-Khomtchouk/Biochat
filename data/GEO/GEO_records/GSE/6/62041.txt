TITLE
Characterization of changes in global genes expression in the distal colon of loperamide-induced constipation SD rats in response to the laxative effects of Liriope platyphylla

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to characterize the changes in global gene expression in the distal colon of constipated SD rats in response to the laxative effects induced by aqueous extract of Liriope platyphylla (AEtLP) including isoflavone, saponin, oligosaccharide, succinic acid and hydroxyproline, total RNA extracted from the distal colon of AEtLP-treated constipation rats was hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays.Overall, 581 genes were up-regulated and 216 genes were down-regulated by constipation induced by loperamide, while 67 genes were up-regulated and 421 genes were down-regulated by AEtLP treatment in constipated rats compared to controls. Among the transcripts up-regulated by constipation, 89 were significantly down-regulated and 20 were recovered to normal levels by AEtLP treatment. The major genes in the down-regulated categories included Slc9a5, klk10, Fgf15 and Alpi, while the major genes in the recovered categories were Cyp2b2, Ace, G6pc and Setbp1. However, nine of these genes that were down-regulated by constipation were significantly up-regulated and four were recovered to normal levels by AEtLP treatment. The major genes in the up-regulated categories included Serpina3n, Lcn2 and Slc5a81, while the major genes in the recovered categories were Tmem45a, Rerg and Rgc32.

DESIGN
Constipation was induced in SD rats by subcutaneous injection of loperamide for 3 days. At 15 hr after the final treatment of loperamide, each animal were received a consistent volume of water or 15 uL/g body weight of AEtLP (1,000 mg/kg weight) via oral administration for once at 9 AM.
