TITLE
Somatic Primary piRNA Biogenesis Driven by Cis-Acting RNA Elements and Trans- Acting Yb

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Primary piRNAs in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells arise from piRNA cluster transcripts and the 3′ UTRs of a subset of mRNAs, including Traffic jam (Tj) mRNA. However, it is unclear how these RNAs are determined as primary piRNA sources. Here, we identify a cis-acting 100-nt fragment in the Tj 3′ UTR that is sufficient for producing artificial piRNAs from unintegrated DNA. These artificial piRNAs were effective in endogenous gene transcriptional silencing. Yb, a core component of primary piRNA biogenesis center Yb bodies, directly bound the Tj-cis-element. Disruption of this interaction markedly reduced piRNA production. Thus, Yb is the trans-acting partner of the Tj-cis-element. Yb-CLIP revealed that Yb-binding correlated with somatic piRNA production but Tj-cis-element downstream sequences produced few artificial piRNAs. Thus, Yb determines primary piRNA sources by two modes of action; primary binding to cis-elements to specify substrates, and secondary binding to downstream regions to increase diversity in piRNA populations.

DESIGN
HITS-CLIP of Yb in OSCs (Ovarian Somatic Cells) depleted for tj cis-element, and small RNA sequencing of Piwi-piRNAs in OSCs depleted for tj cis-element.
