TITLE
Gene expression data from human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell-lines; OSC19 and OSC20

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, OSC19 and OSC20, presented aggressive proliferation in vitro but displayed discrete cellular phenotypes and lymphangiogenic activity when transplanted into tongues of nude mice. We thus aimed to explore the molecular factors responsible for their malignant properties.

DESIGN
To overview the genetic diversity in relation to the cellular behavior and susceptibility to a stromal impact upon transplantation, genes differentially expressed between pre-transplantation (culture cells in vitro) and post-transplantation (developed tumor in vivo) were analyzed by microarray.
