TITLE
Rapid, high efficiency isolation of pancreatic ß-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability to isolate pure pancreatic ß-cells would greatly aid multiple areas of diabetes research. We developed an exendin-4-like neopeptide conjugate for the rapid purification and isolation of functional pancreatic ß-cells. By targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, ß-cells were isolated within an hour and were > 99% pure. These studies were confirmed by immunostaining, confocal microscopy and microarray analysis on isolated cells. Gene expression profiling studies of the cytofluorometrically sorted ß-cells provided new insights into the genetic programs at play of different ages and stages during type-1 diabetes development. The described isolation method should have broad applicability to the ß-cell field.

DESIGN
Microarray profile of beta cells from isolated islets from 4 and 12 week old NOD mice. Cells were stained with 50 nM Ex4+ probe and sorted on FACS ARIA. DAPI and CD45+ cells were excluded.
