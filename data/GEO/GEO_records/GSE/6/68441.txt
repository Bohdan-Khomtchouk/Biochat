TITLE
Muscle-specific gene expression changes in normal and high-fat diet in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pattern of gene expression changes were analyzed in the skeletal muscle of knock-in mouse models of SBMA fed either a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD).

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed in 180-day-old mice (wild type-NCD, wild type-HFD, AR113Q-NCD, and AR113Q-HFD).
