TITLE
E. coli MG1655 transcriptome inferred from a tiled microarray

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
These data were used to infer transcription fragments (transfrags) for the study " The transition between transcriptional initiation and elongation in E. coli is highly variable and often rate-limiting " (Reppas et al. 2006). This study analyzes transfrags with respect to the ChIP profile of the sigma70 and the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. Keywords: Tiled analysis of mRNA expression; ChIP-chip
