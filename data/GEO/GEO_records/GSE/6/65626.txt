TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma tissue and matched adjacent normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignancy of the central nervous system in adult. In order to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of GBM, the details of molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and development needs to be clarified. This is a nalysis of glioblastoma tissues and matched adjacent normal brain tissues from 3 patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the non-coding and coding genes interactions in glioblastoma. 3 human GBM tissues and the matched adjacent normal brain tissues were analyzed using microarray. The aberrant lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs between the 2 groups were detected.
