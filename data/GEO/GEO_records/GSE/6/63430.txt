TITLE
Comparison of CD8+ memory T-cells from fresh and high density precultured PBMC.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High density cultured CD8+ memory T-cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were found to be more sensitive towards antigenic stimulation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences in the cell density of human PBMC and identified genes that are significantly up- or downregulated dependent on the cell density of PBMC.

DESIGN
Paired analysis of CD8+ memory T-cells from fresh and high density precultured PBMC from three healthy donors.
