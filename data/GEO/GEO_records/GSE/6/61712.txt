TITLE
Estrogen-Related Receptor-a Coordinates Transcriptional Programs Essential for Exercise Tolerance and Muscle Fitness

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms involved in the coordinate regulation of the metabolic and structural determinants of muscle endurance are still poorly characterized. To help elucidate the role of ERRa in this process, gene expression arrays were employed resulting in the identification of ERRa-dependent genes involved in metabolic processes, oxidative stress response, maintenance of muscle fiber integrity and neovascularization.

DESIGN
Gastrocnemius (n=3) isolated from 2-3 month old WT and ERRa-null mice under pre-exercise (sedentary) and post-exercise (2 h following acute exhaustion on a treadmill) were used for gene expression studies using Affymetrix mouse 2.0 gene ST arrays.
