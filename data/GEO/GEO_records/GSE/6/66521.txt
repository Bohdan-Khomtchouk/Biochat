TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in mixed-culture wine fermentation with Hanseniaspora guilliermondii

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Natural grape-juice fermentations involve the sequential development of different yeast species which strongly influence the chemical and sensorial traits of the final product.   In the present study,we aimed to examine the transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the presence of Hanseniaspora guilliermondii wine fermentation.
