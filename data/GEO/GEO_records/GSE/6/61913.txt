TITLE
Expression data from 36 KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas from the BATTLE-2 clinical trial.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include expression data from 36 KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas from Stage 1 of the BATTLE-2 trial, reflecting patients whose disease has relapsed or progresses following at least one front-line metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Tumor biopsy was performed following informed consent and prior to randomisation to one of the four possible treatment arms.

DESIGN
