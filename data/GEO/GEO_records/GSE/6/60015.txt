TITLE
aCGH: Human SUM149-Luc triple-negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer cell line versus its metabolically adaptable variants MA1 and MA2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CGH array of MA1 and MA2 variant cells as compared to the parental SUM149-Luc breast cancer cell line. The MA1 and MA2 variants were isolated based on the ability of rare cancer cells to survive and grow without adding glutamine in culture medium. To gain insight into the characteristic of metabolically adaptable MA cells that enables them to survive severe metabolic challenge, i.e., prolonged lack of glutamine and other challenges [Singh et al., PLoS ONE 7: e36510, 2012], we analyzed CGH array to compare these cells with the parental SUM149-Luc (luciferase-transfected) cells. We analyzed two independently selected cell populations, one from 0.5 million parental cells (designated MA1) and one from 1 million parental cells (designated MA2).

DESIGN
Comparing the MA1 and MA2 variants to the common parental SUM149-Luc cell line. One sample each.
