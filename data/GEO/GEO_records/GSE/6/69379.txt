TITLE
Development of gene expression for an INH-responsive transcriptional regulator InbR

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG

SUMMARY
To further determine the gene expression profile of InbR, encoded by Rv0275c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whole genome microarray analysises were applied to inbR-overexpressing strain and wild type Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Comparison of the gene expression pattern of logarithmic growth phase wild-type M. bovis BCG and that of the inbR-overexpression strain revealed a total of 142 genes that were significantly up-regulated (2-fold to 187-fold, p < 0.05) and 200 that were down-regulated (2-fold to 113-fold, p < 0.05). Strikingly, most of the genes in the regulon were predicted to function as molecular chaperones, heat shock proteins, or transcription factors.
