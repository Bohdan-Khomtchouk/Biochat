TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of H. polymorpha in response to Cd exposure.

ORGANISM
Ogataea angusta

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the basic mechanism of Cd detoxification in the methylotrophic yeast, H. polymorpha, we analyzed temporal changes in transcriptional profiles in response to Cd exposure. We used H. polymorpha whole-genome cDNA microarrays, which contain 98% of all H. polymorpha ORFs in duplicate or triplicate. Keywords: time course, cadmium
