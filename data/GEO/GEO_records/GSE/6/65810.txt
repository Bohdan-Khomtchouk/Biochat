TITLE
miRNA profile of macrophage from different TB patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
the microRNA profiles of the host macrophages were studied by microarray in a small cohort with active MTB disease, latent infection (LTBI), and from healthy controls.

DESIGN
From each individual in the three cohorts: the healthy (n=3), the latent (n=4), and the active TB patients (n=3), whole blood specimens were collected for monocytes isolation. Monocytes were induced into macrophage in vitro and total RNA were extracted for miRNA profiles analysis.
