TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of hyperplasias, primary endometrial cancer and metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs in a total of 96 samples, including  8 hyperplasias, 33 endometrial cancers and 53 metastases, as well as 2 cell-lines.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 96 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
