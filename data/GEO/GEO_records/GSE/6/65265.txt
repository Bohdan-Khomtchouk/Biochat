TITLE
Macrophage gene expression associated with remodeling of the prepartum rat cervix: Microarray and pathway analyses

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
As the critical gatekeeper for birth, prepartum remodeling of the cervix is associated with increased resident macrophages (Mφ), proinflammatory processes, and extracellular matrix degradation. This study tested the hypothesis that expression of genes unique to Mφs characterizes the prepartum from unremodeled nonpregnant cervix. Perfused cervix from prepartum day 21 postbreeding (D21) or nonpregnant (NP) rats, with or without Mφs, had RNA extracted and whole genome microarray analysis performed.  By subtractive analyses, expression of 194 and 120 genes related to Mφs in the cervix from D21 rats were increased and decreased, respectively.  In both D21 and NP groups, 158 and 57 Mφ genes were also more or less up- or down-regulated, respectively.

DESIGN
Gene expression from four groups: D21 pregnant or non-pregnant rat cervix, with or without macrophages. Comparing the with and without macrophage groups can show genes that are expressed only in macrophages.
