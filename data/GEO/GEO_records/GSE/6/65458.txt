TITLE
Proteasome machinery is instrumental in a common gain-of-function program of the p53 missense mutants in cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutant p53 proteins, resulting from the missense mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, possess gain-of-function activities and are among the most robust oncoproteins in human tumors. They are potentially important therapeutic targets. No studies to date have distinguished common, therapeutically relevant mutant p53 gain-of-function effects from effects specific to different mutant variants and cell backgrounds. here we perform the analysis of transcriptomes,rRegardless of the cell background, of different mutant p53s.

DESIGN
Four different cell lines were transfected with control or p53 siRNA.So The study comprises four experimental cell lines, each in triplicate.
