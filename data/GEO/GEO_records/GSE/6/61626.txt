TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of bronchosphere cultures of primary human bronchiolar epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were transduced with control or hYAP(S127A) lentivirus in sphere forming conditions. Bronchospheres were harvested on day 18-20 for RNAseq analysis

DESIGN
Passage 1 Primary HBECs from 2 independent donors were transduced with control or hYAP lentivirus. 48 hours post infection, cells were plated on transwell inserts in a 50-50 mixture of ALI medium-Cultrex BME reduced growth factor (RGF) to form spheres. Well differentiated bronchospheres were harvested for RNA-seq analysis on day 18-20 by combining 3 wells of each group for each donor.
