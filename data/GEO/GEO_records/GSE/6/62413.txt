TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of transgenic plants with ectopic expression (driven by 35S promoter) of At14a-Like1 (AFL1, At3g28270) YFP fusion protein.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed in transgenic plants expressing At14a-Like1 (AFL1, At3g28270)) YFP fusion protein compared to wild type.  Transcriptome analysis was performed using seedlings grown under either control conditions or low water potential stress with the objective of identifying genes associated with the increased growth caused by AFL1 overexpression under stress.   The analysis identified 172 genes up-regulated and 525 genes down regulated in 35S:AFL1-YFP relative to wild type in control condtions.  In the stress treatment 398 genes were up regulated and 722 down regulated in 35S:AFL1-YFP plants relative to wild type.  The criteria used to identify up and down regulated genes was fold change greater than 1.5 and corrected p value â‰¤0.05.

DESIGN
Wild type (Col-0) or transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were germinated on agar plates and after seven days of growth, seedlings were transferred either to fresh plates of control media or to low water potential (-1.2 MPa) stress plates.  Samples were collected 10 h after transfer.
