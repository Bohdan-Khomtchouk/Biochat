TITLE
Gene expression profile associated with loss of IFNAR signaling or loss of LTβR singlaing in spleen marginal zone macrophages (MZM) in autoimmune BXD2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of the interactions between lymphotoxin and its receptor was associated with MZM apoptotic cell clearance defects in BXD2 mice whereas loss of IFNAR in BXD2 mice normalized the function of MZMs. The analysis also intended to use MZMs isolated from BXD2-Ifnar-/- mice and BXD2 mice treated with sLTbR-Fc to identify the common pathways regulating the MZM function in these mice.

DESIGN
Samples were derived from MZMs of the spleen of BXD2 mice which exhibit spontaneous defects in MZMs, BXD2-Ifnar-/- mice which exhibit normalized MZMs, and BXD2 mice administered sLTβR-Fc which exhibit further defects in MZMs
