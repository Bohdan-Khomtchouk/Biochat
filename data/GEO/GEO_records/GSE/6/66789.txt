TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of control and Myc-induced U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to examine the effect of Myc activation on U2OS cells transcriptome. We also examined these effects in the presence of Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR

DESIGN
We measure gene expression profiles in U2OS cells containing an inducible Myc expression vector that were induced or mock-treated in duplicates for 36 hours. In addition, we repeated the experiments in the presence of Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR.
