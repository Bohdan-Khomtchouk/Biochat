TITLE
Effects of Trbp deletion on gene expession in mice hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated the cardiac-specific knockout of Trbp (Trbp-cKO) in mice. We profiled the transcriptome in both wild-type and Trbp-cKO hearts, and found numerous genes were deregulated by deletion of Trbp. We also profiled miRNA expression both wild-type and Trbp-cKO hearts, and found expression of a subset of miRNA species was altered in Trbp-cKO hearts.

DESIGN
Examine expression of mRNAs and miRNAs in wild-type and Trbp-cKO hearts
