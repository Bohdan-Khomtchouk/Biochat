TITLE
Gene expression profiling of FDCPmix sub-fractions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse bone marrow cell line FDCPmix was fractionated on the basis of surface detection of c-Kit, Sca-1, and Gr1 antigens. Four compartments were profiled Gr1+ cells (myeloid-committed compartment = MCP); kit-Gr1- cells (erythroid-committed compartment = ECP); kit+Gr1- cells (self-renewing cells = SR) further sub-divided as the lowest and highest 20% of Sca-1 expression (SR Sca1-lo and SR Sca1-hi, respectively). Bulk (unfractionated) FDCPmix cells were included as controls.

DESIGN
Bulk cultures or their respective fractions were sorted for RNA extraction and processed for microarray hybridisation as biological replicates: 2 for bulk; 3 for the remaining samples.
