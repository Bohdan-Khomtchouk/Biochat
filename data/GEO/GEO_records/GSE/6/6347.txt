TITLE
Genomic Analysis of effect of bufalin on HL60 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bufalin, a natural toxin isolated from the Chinese toad venom preparation Chan â€™su, has been used in leukemia therapy in the mainland China by inducing human leukemia cells to differentiation and apoptosis. In the present study, oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess profiles of target gene regulation at several points at a 48h period by bufalin at an appropriate concentration in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Data from the gene expression profiles indicated that bufalin altered the expression of 1206 genes which are distributed in multiple profiles of regulation. Results are consistent with bufalin regulating HL60 cells proliferation and differentiation as well as apoptosis. Keywords: time course
