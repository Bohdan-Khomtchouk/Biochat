TITLE
Macrophage Gene Expression Upon Infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum in the Presence and Absence of the Tick Salivary Protein SL2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously, we observed that a tick salivary protein named sialostatin L2 (SL2) mitigates caspase 1-mediated inflammation upon Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection. Here we are performing next-generation sequencing to determine the global effect of SL2 upon A. phagocytophilum infection of macrophages.

DESIGN
BMDMs were treated by 4 different conditions (including non-treated, treated by SL2, treated by Anaplasma, and by Anaplasma and SL2, each treatment was performed in triplicate) followed by the extraction of total RNA and deep sequencing by Illumina
