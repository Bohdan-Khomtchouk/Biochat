TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of  TRA (tissue restricted antigen)-specific co-expression groups  in mouse medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene co-expression patterns in TRA-specific medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) subsets. The whole genome gene signatures of purified mTEC subsets respectively positive for the TRAs Gp2, Pdpn, Cea1, Gad1, Ins2, Tspan8 were compared to their corresponding TRA-negative mTEC subset control. Results provide the enriched and depleted gene expressions in the different subsets.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from FACS isolated mTECs positive for the respective TRAs were compared to their TRA-negative mTEC subsets using specific antibodies (Pdpn, Gp2, Cea1, Tspan8) or reporter mice (Gad1, Ins2).
