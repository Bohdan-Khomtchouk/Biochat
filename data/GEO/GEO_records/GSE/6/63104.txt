TITLE
Gene expression profiling of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exlore whether candidate target genes of certain miRNAs are differentially expressed in high-risk versus low-risk IPMN tissue.

DESIGN
Through a pilot project, we identified miRNAs that differentiated between pathologically confirmed high-risk (invasive and high-grade) and low-risk (low- and moderate-grade) IPMN tissue.  Using the current dataset, we explored the expression of gene targets that have been shown to be regulated by  the identified miRNAs by integrating microarray expresssion data from 23 IPMNs (17 high-risk; 6 low-risk).
