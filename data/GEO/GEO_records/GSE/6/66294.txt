TITLE
A DNA Hypomethylation Signature Predicts Novel Anti-Tumor Activity of LSD1 Inhibitors in SCLC (microarray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important mechanism in cancer.  Alterations in epigenetic machinery have become a major focus for new targeted therapies.  The current report describes the discovery and biological activity of a cyclopropylamine containing inhibitor of Lysine Demethylase 1 (LSD1), GSK2879552.  This small molecule is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of LSD1.  A proliferation screen of cell lines representing a number of tumor types indicated that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is sensitive to LSD1 inhibition.  The subset of SCLC lines and primary samples that undergo growth inhibition in response to GSK2879552 exhibit DNA hypomethylation of a signature set of probes suggesting this may be used as a predictive biomarker of activity.  The targeted mechanism coupled with a novel predictive biomarker make LSD1 inhibition an exciting potential therapy for SCLC, a highly prevalent, rarely cured, tumor type representing approximately 15% of all lung cancers.

DESIGN
To gain insight into the mechanism of LSD1 inhibition in inhibiting growth in SCLC cell lines, the effect of GSK2879552 on gene expression was evaluated in 6 SCLC lines, three sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of GSK2879552 and three resistant. Expression was measured on Affy HG-U133_PLUS_2 microarrays at three time points (2, 4, and 7 days) with replicates.
