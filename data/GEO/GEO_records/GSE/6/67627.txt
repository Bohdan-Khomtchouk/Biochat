TITLE
Gene expression of normal and ASCC1-mutant skin fibroblasts after serum starvation and serum challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the genes that might be regulated by the activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex we performed an expression analysis using the GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix) Since ASC-1 was predicted to have an influence on the transcription regulation by the serum response factor (SRF), we investigated gene expression after serum starvation and subsequent serum challenge.

DESIGN
Investigation of 4 skin fibroblast control lines and of 2 of patient fibroblast lines that carried a mutation in the ASCC1 (activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 1) gene. Semiconfluent skin fibroblast cultures were serum starved for 24 hour and rech-challenged with 15% FBS for 30 and for 60 minutes. stress: serum starvation: MS_61_Co_1_00W stress: serum starvation: MS_64_Co_2_00W stress: serum starvation: MS_67_Co_3_00W stress: serum starvation: MS_70_Co_4_00W stress: serum starvation: MS_73_Pat_1_00W stress: serum starvation: MS_76_Pat_2_00W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_62_Co_1_30W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_65_Co_2_30W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_68_Co_3_30W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_71_Co_4_30W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_74_Pat_1_30W stress: serum challenge 30 minutes: MS_77_Pat_2_30W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_63_Co_1_60W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_66_Co_2_60W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_69_Co_3_60W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_72_Co_4_60W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_75_Pat_1_60W stress: serum challenge 60 minutes: MS_78_Pat_2_60W disease state: healthy control: MS_61_Co_1_00W disease state: healthy control: MS_62_Co_1_30W disease state: healthy control: MS_63_Co_1_60W disease state: healthy control: MS_64_Co_2_00W disease state: healthy control: MS_65_Co_2_30W disease state: healthy control: MS_66_Co_2_60W disease state: healthy control: MS_67_Co_3_00W disease state: healthy control: MS_68_Co_3_30W disease state: healthy control: MS_69_Co_3_60W disease state: healthy control: MS_70_Co_4_00W disease state: healthy control: MS_71_Co_4_30W disease state: healthy control: MS_72_Co_4_60W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_73_Pat_1_00W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_74_Pat_1_30W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_75_Pat_1_60W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_76_Pat_2_00W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_77_Pat_2_30W disease state: homozygous ASCC1 mutation carrier: MS_78_Pat_2_60W
