TITLE
Identification of new full length Arabidopsis genes - pilot arrays

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of new and unpredicted full length Arabidopsis genes. Examination of cRNA prepared from  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia light grown 7-day old seedlings, light grown 7-day old seedlings treated at 4 degrees C for 24hrs, and etiolated 7-day old seedlings using pilot genome tiling arrays. Total RNA was isolated from seedlings with the TRIzol reagent procedure of Invitrogen, then poly(A)+ RNA was purified with Qiagen oligotex. One microgram poly(A)+ RNA was converted into ds-cDNA using T7-oligo(dT) primers. Biotin-labeled cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription reactions using ENZO labeling kit, fragmented and then 20 micrograms of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to the arrays according to Affymetrix instructions.
