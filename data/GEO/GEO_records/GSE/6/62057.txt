TITLE
EZH2 inhibitor efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not require suppression of H3K27 mono-methylation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the discovery of highly potent and selective EZH2 small molecule inhibitors, their validation by a cellular thermal shift assay, their application across a large lymphoma cell panel and their efficacy in GCBDLBCL xenograft models.

DESIGN
Baseline ChIP-seq measurement of KARPAS-422 cell line H3K27me3 levels, without treatment. Two samples -- H3K27me3 and Input included as control.
