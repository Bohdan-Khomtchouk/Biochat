TITLE
Analysis of SOX2 overexpression in hESCs undergoing cardiac differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX2 downregulation is a pre-requisite for proper cardiac differentiation. This study was performed to reveal the neagtive effects of SOX2 on cardiac differentiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated  in a time course manner, from differentiating in-vitro samples: (i) no doxycycline treated cells differentiated under standard cardiac differentiation conditions (II) 0.2ug/ml doxycycline treated cells differentiated under standard cardiac differentiation conditions
