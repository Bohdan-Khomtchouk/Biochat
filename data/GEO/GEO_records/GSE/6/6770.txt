TITLE
Gene Expression Data in HDAC2 KO Myocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cardiac development by HDAC2 and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: Genetic Modification
