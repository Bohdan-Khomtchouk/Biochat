TITLE
Expression profile of human breast cancer cells with CEBPB overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CEBPB contributes to the migration of breast cancer cells. We used microarrays to detail the mechanism of CEBPB with downstream targets that drive breast cancer cell migration.

DESIGN
CEBPB were overexpressed in MDA-MB231 cell for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays. We sought to obtain the mechanisms of CEBPB with downstream proteins that drive breast cancer cell migration.
