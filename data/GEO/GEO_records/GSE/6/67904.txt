TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of duodenum from wild type and VDR-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As duodenum is an important Vitamin D target organ, transcriptomic analyses were performed in this tissue.

DESIGN
We analysed RNA extracted from duodenum of three 10 week-old wild-type and VDR-null mice using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST.
