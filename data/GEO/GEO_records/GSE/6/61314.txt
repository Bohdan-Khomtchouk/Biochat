TITLE
Cell population kinetics of collagen scaffolds in ex vivo oral wound repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study sought to provide a novel ex vivo model for analyzing healing kinetics and gene expression of primary human gingival fibroblasts (hGF) within collagen scaffolds. Sponge type and gel type scaffolds with and without platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) were assessed in an hGF containing matrix.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed; gel w/ and w/o PDGF and scaffold w/ and w/o PDGF
