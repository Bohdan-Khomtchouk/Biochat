TITLE
MicroRNA signature in skeletal muscle in type 2 Diabetes [human]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study aimed to address the hypothesis that programmed expression of key miRNAs in skeletal muscle mediates the development of insulin resistance, and consequently long-term health. We thus examined microRNA signatures in skeletal muscle of unmedicated newly diagnosed human pre-diabetics and type 2 diabetics.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis from males with pre-diabetes (PD, n=5) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n=6) along with age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (H, n=5). Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (UNSW, sydney, Australia)
