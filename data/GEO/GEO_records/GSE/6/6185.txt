TITLE
Stress response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to exposure to natural product pyocyanin.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Pyocyanin has been shown to engage in redox transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen to generate superoxide radicals.  Transcriptional response to oxygen stress has been characterized in yeast and should be observable upon exposure to pyocyanin if this is the true mode of action. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression induced in the stress response to pyocyanin. Keywords: stress response
