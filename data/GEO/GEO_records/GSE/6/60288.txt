TITLE
Single-base resolution DNA methylation maps of rice cultivars under control and stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we aim to generate genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at single-base resolution in different rice cultivars (IR64, Nagina 22 and Pokkali) under control and stress conditions. Using high-throughput whole genome bisulfite Sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering the vast majority of cytosines in the rice genome. More than 152 million high quality reads were obtained for each tissue sample using Illumina platform. We discovered extensive DNA methylation in rice cultivars, identified the context and level of methylation at each site.Numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among different cultivars under control and stress conditions were identified and many of them were associated with differential gene expression. The high resolution methylome maps of different rice genotypes and differentially methylated regions will serve as reference for understanding the epigenetic regulation of stress responses in plants.

DESIGN
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of seven control/stressed samples from three rice cultivars (IR64, N22 and Pokkali)
