TITLE
The NAD+-Dependent SIRT1 Deacetylase Translates a Metabolic Switch into Regulatory Epigenetics in Skeletal Muscle Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Selective genetic ablation of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain in skeletal muscle results in increased H4K16 acetylation and deregulated activation of the myogenic program in satellite cells

DESIGN
To establish the role of the deacetylase SIRT1 in skeletal muscle we examined the genome wide distribution of H4K16ac  in quiescent (FI) and proliferating (Cul) satellite cells isolated from WT mice (C57Bl/6 background) and SIRT1mKO (generated via breeding of Pax7cre/+ knock-in mice with mice containing the floxed exon 4 SIRT1 allele). We also analyzed the distribution of SIRT1 in quiescent and proliferating FACS isolated WT satellite cells (two replicates).   We generated the mRNA profiles (at least two replicate for each experiment) of FACS isolated quiescent, proliferating and differentiating (1 day in differentiation medium) satellite cells of WT mice and SIRT1mKO. The selective genetic ablation of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain in skeletal muscle results in increased H4K16 acetylation and deregulated activation of the myogenic program.
