TITLE
Piwi proteins and piRNAs in mammalian oocytes and early embryos

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Germ cells of most animals critically depend on piRNAs and Piwi proteins. Surprisingly, piRNAs in mouse oocytes are relatively rare and dispensable. We present compelling evidence for strong Piwi-piRNA expression in oocytes of other mammals. Human fetal oocytes express PIWIL2 and transposon-enriched piRNAs. Oocytes in adult human ovary express PIWIL1 and PIWIL2, while those in bovine ovary just express PIWIL1. In human, macaque and bovine ovaries we find piRNAs that resemble testis-borne pachytene piRNAs. Isolated bovine follicular oocytes were shown to contain abundant, relatively short piRNAs that preferentially target transposable elements. Using label-free quantitative proteome analysis we show that these maturing oocytes strongly and specifically express the thus-far uncharacterized PIWIL3 protein, alongside other known piRNA-pathway components. In bovine early embryos these piRNAs are still abundant, revealing a potential impact of piRNAs on mammalian embryogenesis. Our results reveal unexpected, highly dynamic piRNA pathways in mammalian oocytes and early embryos.

DESIGN
Analyses of multiple small RNA libraries obtained from fetal/adult oocytes, cumulus cells, ovary, testis and 2-4 cell stage ivf embryos of multiple mammalian species.
