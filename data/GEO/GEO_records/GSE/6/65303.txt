TITLE
Comprehensive genomic analysis of relapse neuroblastoma [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Relapse neuroblastoma were characterized by sequencing, gene expression, arrayCGH and genome-wide methylation. Here we describe the expression data.

DESIGN
Array from tumours at relapse were compared to pretreatment tumours and corresponding normal samples.
