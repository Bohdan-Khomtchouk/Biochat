TITLE
Changes in gene expression after epigentic targeted therapy in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic therapy overcame alemtuzumab resistance in patients with relapsed T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and induced the expression of treatment related genes. Method:  patient PBMCs from Ficoll, normal patient PBMCS enriched for CD3+/CD8+ or CD3+/CD8+/CD45RA+/CCR7- were extracted in Trizol.  Conclusion:  Gene expression profiles were changed by epigenetic therapy, likely activating treatment response genes silenced by carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from patient Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)  or from normal negatively enriched CD3+/CD8+/CCR7-/CD45RA+(CD45RO-) blood
