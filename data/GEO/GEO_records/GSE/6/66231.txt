TITLE
Effect of pharmacological inhibition of ASBT on bile composition and sclerosing cholangitis in mdr2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the effect of a potent pharmacological inhibition of ASBT in mdr2 -/- mice, compared to genetic and treatment controls using RNA-sequencing.  Through quantification of mRNA in liver samples, we found significant upregulation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic gene signatures in mdr2-/- mice. Additionally, we report downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes invovled in leukocyte recruitment.

DESIGN
Mdr2 knockout mice (female, 30 day old) were fed high fat-chow diet containing a potent inhibitor of ASBT for 14 days.  Genotypic and dietary controls were included. RNA-sequencing was performed on liver samples taken from the caudate lobe.
