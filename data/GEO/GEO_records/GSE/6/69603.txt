TITLE
Gene expression profiles of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and skin fibroblasts from orangutans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Orangutans are an endangered species whose natural habitats are restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra. For potential species conservation and functional genomics studies, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from cryopreserved skin fibroblasts obtained from captive orangutans. We report the gene expression profiles of iPSCs and skin fibroblasts derived from orangtuans.
