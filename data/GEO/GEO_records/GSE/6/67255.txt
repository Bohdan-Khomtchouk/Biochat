TITLE
Effects of Systemically Administered Hydrocortisone on the Human Immunome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Corticosteroids have been prescribed for decades to modulate inflammation, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans.  We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or “immunome,” in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. We observed declines in specific B and T cell subsets, and an increase in natural killer cell subsets  4-8 hours after HC.  Whole transcriptome profiling revealed a gene expression signature that preceded lymphocyte population changes. We observed decreases in inflammatory cytokines after HC administration. Our study provides insights into the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome.

DESIGN
According to CHI protocols 11-H-0092, 18 healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone at either 50 mg or 250 mg concentrations. PBMC samples were collected immediately prior to receiving the drug (0 hours), then after 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours.
