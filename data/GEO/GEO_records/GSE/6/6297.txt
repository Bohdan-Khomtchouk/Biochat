TITLE
Expression data from livers of mice fed four different diets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Beyond the DNA sequence difference between humans and closely related apes, there are large differences in the environments that these species experience. One prominent example for this is diet. The human diet diverges from those of other primates in various aspects, such as having a high calorie and protein content, as well as being cooked. Here, we used a laboratory mouse model to identify gene expression differences related to dietary differences. Keywords: diet
