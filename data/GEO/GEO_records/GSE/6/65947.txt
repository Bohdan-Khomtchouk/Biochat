TITLE
Microarray gene expression analysis of thyroid hormone receptor in mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression was performed on mouse livers. Gene expression profiles were studies on 3 PTU treated and 3 PTU followed by T3 treated mice.

DESIGN
Comparing gene expression profiles between 3 PTU treated mice and T3 stimulated mice
