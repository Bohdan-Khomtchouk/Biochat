TITLE
Innate lymphoid cell development requires TOX-dependent generation of a common ILC  progenitor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Subtypes of innate lymphoid cells (ILC), defined by effector function and transcription factor  expression, have recently been identified. In the adult, ILC derive from common lymphoid  progenitors in bone marrow, although transcriptional regulation of the developmental  pathways involved remains poorly defined. TOX is required for development of lymphoid  tissue inducer cells, a type of ILC3 required for lymph node organogenesis, and NK cells, a  type of ILC1. We show here that production of multiple ILC lineages requires TOX, as a result  of TOX-dependent development of common ILC progenitors. Comparative transcriptome  analysis demonstrated failure to induce various aspects of the ILC gene program in the  absence of TOX, implicating this nuclear factor as a key early determinant of ILC lineage  specification.

DESIGN
TOX KO vs. wild tyype
