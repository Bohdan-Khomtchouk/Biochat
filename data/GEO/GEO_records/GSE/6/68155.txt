TITLE
Investigating GPR34 expression regulation using whole transcriptome sequencing of spleens and dendritic cells from wildtype and GPR34 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naive spleens as well as naive and LPS-treated dendritic cells from wildtype and GPR34-/- mice were sequenced to integrate expression profiles with protein interaction networks and find functional modules that are affected by GPR34

DESIGN
Expression profiles of dendritic cells and whole spleens were generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500/ Illumina HiScan
