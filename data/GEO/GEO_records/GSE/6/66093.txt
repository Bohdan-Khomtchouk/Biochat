Myc and N-myc induce distinct medulloblastoma subgroups via Miz1

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medulloblastomas (MBs) are cerebellar tumors that can be classified into molecularly distinct subgroups that differ in pathology and prognosis. The mechanisms that underlie subgroup specification are largely unknown. While human SHH MBs express MYCN, Group3 (G3) MBs are associated with c-MYC (MYC) overexpression and often show metastasis that confers a poor prognosis. Although MYC proteins are thought to be functionally exchangeable, ectopic expression of Myc or N-myc in Trp53-/-;Cdkn2c-/- cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) induces G3 and SHH MBs, respectively, demonstrating that each Myc protein has distinct biological properties. We now show that Myc and N-myc differ in their affinity to Miz1 and that Myc, but not N-myc, effectively recruits Miz1 to its target sites on chromatin. The interaction of Myc with Miz1 is required for the genesis of G3 MB.  Myc suppresses ciliogenesis and “reprograms” the transcriptome of SHH-dependent GNPs to stem-like cells by repressing genes highly expressed in SHH MB via Miz1. Consistently, target genes of Myc/Miz1 are repressed in human G3 MBs but not in other MB subgroups.  Collectively, the data show that the interaction of Myc with Miz1 is a defining hallmark of G3 MB development.

DESIGN
In this study, we show that Myc and N-myc differ in their affinity for Miz1, and Myc/Miz1 interaction is required for Group3 medulloblastoma (MB). The gene expression profiles of these tumors were compared to our previously published Group3 MB model as well as SHH model of MB (Kawachi et al., 2012, Cancer Cell). Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) [dka220-222] from postnatal (P) 6 Math1-GFP;Trp53-/-;Cdkn2c-/-. For SHH medulloblastomas, [dka204-206] and [blm015-017 or dka050-dka051], spontaneous medulloblastomas from Cdkn2c-/-;Trp53Fl/Fl;Nestin-Cre (Kawachi et al., 2012, Cancer Cell) and Ptch1+/-;Cdkn2c-/- (Uziel et al., 2005, Genes Dev) were used, respectively. Myc- [dka201-203] and MycV394D (termed MycVD thereafter)- [bvo017-bvo023] tumors were from Trp53-/-;Cdkn2c-/- cerebella of P6-P7 pups. Myc/ΔPOZ tumors [bvo002-bvo006] were obtained from Trp5Fl/Fl;Miz1ΔPOZ/POZ;Nestin-Cre cerebella of P6-P7 pups.
