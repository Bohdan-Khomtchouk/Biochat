TITLE
Effect of ferulic acid on Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 transcriptome

ORGANISM
Clostridium beijerinckii

SUMMARY
The impacts of ferulic acid, a phenolic compound commonly found in lignin hydrolysates, on the growth, solvent production and transcriptional responses of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 were determined. Addition of ferulic acid to growing cultures resulted in a decrease in the growth and solvent production by 30 and 25%, respectively, when compared to the control cultures. To better understand the toxicity of this compound, microarray analyses were performed using samples taken from these cultures at three different growth states. Several gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways were identified showing significant change at each status, including ABC transporters, two component system and oxidoreductase activity. Moreover, genes related with efflux systems and heat shock proteins were also strongly up- regulated. Among these, expression of the groESL operon was induced by more than 4-fold and was consequently selected for overexpression to improve C. beijerinckii tolerance to ferulic acid.
