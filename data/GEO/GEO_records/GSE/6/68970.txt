TITLE
Identification of microRNAs involved in cold stress response in grapevine.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Two small RNA libraries were generated from micropropagated ‘Muscat Hamburg’ (Vitis vinifera) plantlets under normal and low temperatures (4 °C). A total of 163 known miRNAs and 299 putative novel miRNAs were detected from two small RNA libraries by Solexa sequencing. Forty-four cold-inducible miRNAs were identified through differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) analysis; among which, 13 belonged to upregulated DEMs while 31 belonged downregulated DEMs. This study indicated that a diverse set of miRNAs in V. vinifera are cold-inducible and may play an important role in cold stress response.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA populations in grapevine under cold treatment and none cold treatment.
