TITLE
Genome wide maps of replicative polymerase contributions to the fully replicated yeast genome

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the application of high through-put tag sequencing to measure the location  and strand of DNA embedded ribonucleotides in the yeast genome. Mutations in the catalytic subunits of the  polymerases (pol1-L868M, pol2-M644G and pol3-L612M) lead to the increased incorporation of ribonucleotides during DNA replication, providing an in vivo label with which to track the contribution of each polymerase to the fully replicated genome. Yeast strains used in this study are deleted for rnh201, encoding the catalytic subunit of the RNase H2 gene so that embedded ribonucleotides are not rapidly removed by ribonucleotide excision repair following DNA replication. Analysis of this data demonstrates that polymerase alpha contributes to the fully replicated genome.

DESIGN
Sequencing of DNA embedded ribonucleotides in S. cerevisiae strains to map the contribution of replicative polymerases to the fully replicated genome.
