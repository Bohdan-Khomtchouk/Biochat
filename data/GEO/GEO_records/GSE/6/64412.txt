TITLE
Loss of MEN1 activates DNMT1 implicating DNA hypermethylation as a driver of MEN1 tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is the result of mutations in the MEN1 gene and results in tumor formation via mechanisms that are not well understood. Using a novel genome-wide methylation analysis, we studied tissues from patients with MEN1-parathyroid tumors, tissues from Men1 knockout (KO) mouse models, and Men1 null mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines. We demonstrated that the inactivation of menin (the protein product of MEN1) results in increased activity of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by retinoblastoma-binding protein 5 (Rbbp5) activation in MEN1 tumor tissues. The increased activity of DNMT1 mediated global DNA hypermethylation, which in turn resulted in aberrant activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway through inactivation of Sox regulatory genes. Our study provides important insights into the possible regulatory role of menin in DNA methylation and its impact on the pathogenesis of MEN1 tumor development.

DESIGN
Global DNA methylation in tissues from patients with MEN1-parathyroid tumors. Thirty-eight human parathyroid specimens were used: 13 sporadic (non-MEN1) parathyroid adenomas, 12 MEN1-parathyroid tumors, 4 parathyroid carcinomas, and 9 normal parathyroids.
