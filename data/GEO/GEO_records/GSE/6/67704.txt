TITLE
G72 overexpression in U87 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G72 is a susceptible gene for schizophrenia. No matter genetic variation or serum levels, G72 has been recognized as a biomarker for schizophrenia. In some reports, G72 genetic variation also related with bipolar disorder. Although G72 has been studied for 15 years, the protein function is still unclear. This study aims for predicting the biological function of G72 and hope to elucidate its biological role.

DESIGN
two independent control (U87 cells transfected with empty vector) and two experiements (U87 cells transfected with G72 overexpression plasmid).
