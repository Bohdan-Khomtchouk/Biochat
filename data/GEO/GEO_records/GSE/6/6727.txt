TITLE
TGFb/Smad4 targets promter in IOSE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unlike ovarian cancer, normal ovarian epithelium response to TGFb1 induced growth inhibition. This study tried to idenify promoters that showed Smad4 binding after additionof TGFb1 in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (IOSE) which is derived from normal ovarian epithelial cells Keywords: ChIP-chip
