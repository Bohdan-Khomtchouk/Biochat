SUMMARY
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most frequent histological breast cancer subtype after invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), accounting for 5-15% of all breast cancers. Although clinical outcomes of ILC and IDC seem similar, the molecular processes underlying ILC are still largely unknown. To explore this, we have performed a comprehensive proteomics analysis of a large ILC patient cohort. These data are generated in the context of the RATHER consortium ( )

DESIGN
Fresh frozen tissue sections from 118 ILCs with a median clinical follow-up of 6.8 years were lysed and printed on protein arrays. Each sample was printed in 5 serial dilutions and each dilution was printed twice on the arrays. Arrays were hybridized with 168 specific primary antibodies against the kinome and cancer-related proteins.
