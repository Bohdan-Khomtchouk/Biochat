TITLE
Intestinal microbiota composition modulates choline bioavailability from diet and accumulation of the pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide

ORGANISM
mouse metagenome

SUMMARY
Choline is a water-soluble nutrient essential for human life. Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice, and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in human. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut; the extent to which host factors, e.g., genotype and diet, affect TMA production and colonization of these microbes; as well as the effects TMA-producing microbes have on bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 78 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified eight strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of colonization of TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest the TMA producing status of the gut microbiota should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans.

DESIGN
Examination of community composition and host (gender and strain)/environmental (diet) factors on TMAO accumulation in gnotobiotic mice.
