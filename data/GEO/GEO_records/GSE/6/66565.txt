TITLE
Microarray analysis of committed cDC progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage-specific gene expression in Zbtb46GFP/+ pre-CD8 DCs, pre-CD4 DCs, CD24 cDCs and CD172a cDCs

DESIGN
Bone Marrow and Splenocytes were harvested from 8-10 littermate Zbtb46GFP/+ mice and sorted to > 95% purity on the FACS AriaFusion.
