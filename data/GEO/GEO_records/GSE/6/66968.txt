TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of pediatric medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main cause of death in medulloblastoma is recurrence associated with leptomeningeal dissemination. Although the molecular basis of medulloblastoma has received considerable attention over the past decade, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the acquisition of metastatic phenotype remains poorly understood. This study aimed to identify miRNA involved in leptomeningeal dissemination and to elucidate its target mechanisms. We analyzed miRNA expression profiles of 29 medulloblastomas according to the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seeding. The differential expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were validated on 29 medulloblastoma tissues and three medulloblastoma cells. The biological function of the selected miRNA was evaluated using in vitro studies. A total of 12 DEmiRNAs were identified including miRNA-192 in medulloblastoma with seeding. The reduced expression of miRNA-192 was confirmed in tumor seeding group and the medulloblastoma cells. Overexpression of miRNA-192 inhibited cellular proliferation targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). MiRNA-192 decreased cellular anchoring via repression of integrin subunits (αV, β1, and β3) and CD47. Medulloblastoma with seeding showed specific DEmiRNAs compared with those without seeding. MicroRNA-192 suppresses leptomeningeal dissemination of medulloblastoma through modulating cell proliferation and anchoring ability.
