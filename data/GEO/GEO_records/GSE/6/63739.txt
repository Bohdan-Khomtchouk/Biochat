TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow neutrophils with or without LPS stimulation in wild type and miR-125a deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neutrophil activation plays a critical role in the inflammatory response to gram-negative bacterial infections. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacterial has been shown to be a major mediator of neutrophil activation to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and ROS which are important to tissue damage in LPS induced septic shock. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of neutrophils from miR-125a+/+ and miR-125a-/- mice after LPS stimulation.

DESIGN
Bone marrow neutrophils from miR-125a deficient and wild type mice were enriched by magnetic beads, then stimulated without or with LPS for 3 hours and harvested in Trizol . Extracted RNAs from three independent experiments were pooled for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
