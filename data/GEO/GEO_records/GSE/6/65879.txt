TITLE
The effect of SubAB treatment on Wnt-High and Wnt-Low sorted human colon cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of ER-stress and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response was investigated in colon cancer stem cells and more differentiated colon cancer cells

DESIGN
Human colon cancer derived spheroid cultures with a TCF/LEF driven GFP reporter for Wnt signaling activity were treated for 24 hours with SubAB or protease-dead SubABco (1Âµg/ml) Treated spheroid cultures were sorted into colon-cancer stem cell fraction (highest 10% Wnt-GFP) and differentiated colon cancer fraction (10% Lowest(Wnt Low) for micro array
