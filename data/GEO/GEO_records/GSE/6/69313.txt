TITLE
Effect of siRNA knock-down of FTO on 3T3-L1 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with control siRNA and two siRNA to FTO: siFTO-1 and siFTO-2. 24 hours after transfection, cells were induced to differentiation with MDI cocktail. RNA were collected from non-treated cells, and those treated with control siRNA, siFTO-1 or siFTO-2 at 0, 6, 24 and 72 hours post induction. Three replicates were done for each data point.

DESIGN
Time series of treatment and control
