TITLE
Differential gene expression in spinal cords from WT mice during uninfected (baseline) conditions and after (2 days post) infection with Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously, we reported that mice made transgenic for a picornaviral RdRP – the 3Dpol protein of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) – suppress infection by diverse viral families. How the picornaviral RdRP transgene exerted antiviral protection in vivo was not known. To investigate the molecular mechanism, we determined gene expression profiles in spinal cords of WT and RdRP transgenic mice prior to (baseline) and after (2 days) infection with Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV).

DESIGN
Spinal cords from adult age-matched, sex-matched WT mice were harvested prior to (baseline) and after (2 days post) EMCV viral infection. Total RNA was isolated (Qiagen RNeasy kit) and used as a template to synthesize biotinylated cRNA which was then hybridized to the HT Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip Array (Affymetrix).
