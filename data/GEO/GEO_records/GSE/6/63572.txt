TITLE
Transcription factor Runx1 cooperates with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate the balance of myoblast proliferation/differentiation [ChIP-Seq Histone]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx1 is expressed in regenrating muscle, specifically in the muscle adult stem cells- the satellite cells. Its exact role and target genes were yet to be identified. We report here the genome wide histone modification using an active enhancer pattern of H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac).

DESIGN
Examination of genome wide chromatin binding of several TFs in primary myoblasts (PM)
