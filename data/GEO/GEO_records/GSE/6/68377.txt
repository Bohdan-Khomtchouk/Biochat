TITLE
microRNA and snoRNA expression profile in the solitary colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We evaluated the profile of miRNA and snoRNA expression in 7 solitary CRC and matched normal colorectal tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0 array. We found that global dysregulated miRNAs and snoRNAs between cancer tissue and normal mucosa in solitary CRC. Our findings firstly implicates that dysregulation of snoRNAs and miRNA may play important role in the cancinogenesis and present therapeutic targets for solitary CRC.
