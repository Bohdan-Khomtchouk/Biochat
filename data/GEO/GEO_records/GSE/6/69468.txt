TITLE
Small RNA profile of pelo1/+ and peloPB60/1 ovaries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare overall small RNA profile in control and pelo mutant ovaries.

DESIGN
The small RNA profiles of 3-5 days old pelo1/+ and peloPB60/1 female ovaries were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAâ…¡.
