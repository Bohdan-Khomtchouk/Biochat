TITLE
Expression data from 5CC7 T cells stimulated in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine how the quality and quantity of peptide-MHC impact TCR-induced gene expression in vivo.

DESIGN
Adoptively transferred 5CC7 T cells were stimulated in vivo with different doses if two peptides: MCC peptide is a strong agonist and 102S peptide is a weak agonist for the 5CC7 TCR. After 48hours later, T cells were purified and gene expression was assessed using microarray.
