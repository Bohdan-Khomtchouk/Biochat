TITLE
Mouse Tracheal Epithelial Cell Air-Liquid Interface Primary Culture Time Course (ALI d0, d2, d7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse tracheal epithelial cells were cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), RNA was harvested at days 0, 2, and 7 post-ALI, and hybridized to two-channel MEEBO arrays. The experiment was designed to allow investigators to identify genes differentially expressed during airway epithelial cell differentiation and development, including ciliogenesis.

DESIGN
Mouse tracheal epithelial cells were cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), RNA was harvested at days 0, 2, and 7 post-ALI, and hybridized to two-channel MEEBO arrays.
