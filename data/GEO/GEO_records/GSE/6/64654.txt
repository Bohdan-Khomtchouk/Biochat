TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of the Corynebacterium glutamicum strains adapted to supraoptimal growth temperatures

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum R

SUMMARY
C. glutamicum strains adapted to higher growth temperatures were obtained through an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment. To elucidate molecular basis for thermotolerance acquired by the evolved strains, we examined transcriptional responses of the evolved and parental strains to thermal stress using microarray technology.
