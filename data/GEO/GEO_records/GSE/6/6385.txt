TITLE
High-throughput Mapping of the Chromatin Structure of Human Promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding how chromatin structure affects cellular functions such as transcription and replication in human cells has been limited by a lack of sufficient nucleosome positioning data. We describe a high-resolution microarray approach combined with a novel analysis algorithm to examine the translational nucleosome positions in 3,692 promoters within seven human cell lines. Unlike unexpressed genes without transcription pre-initiation complexes at their promoters, expressed genes or genes containing pre-initiation complexes exhibit characteristic nucleosome-free regions at their transcription start sites. Coupling these data to ChIP-chip analyses reveals that the melanocyte master transcriptional regulator MITF binds predominantly to nucleosome-free regions, supporting the model that nucleosomes limit sequence accessibility. This study thus presents the first global view of human nucleosome positioning and provides a high-throughput tool for analyzing chromatin structure in development and disease. Keywords: Nucleosome positions, MNase digestion, cell type comparison
