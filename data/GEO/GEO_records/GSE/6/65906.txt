TITLE
Aspartoacylase-dependent transcriptome changes in immortalized brown adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we investigated the effect of stable knock-down of the NAA-catabolizing enzyme, Aspartoacylase (Aspa), on global gene expression in a brown adipocyte cell line.

DESIGN
Immortalized brown adipogenic cells (iBACs) with stable Aspa knock-down and control cells were grown until confluence and then differentiated. Cells were harvested on day 7. Experiment was done in triplicates with three different passages.
