TITLE
Identification of time-dependent biomarkers and effects of exposure to volatile organic compounds using high-throughput analysis (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined the effects of VOCs exposure in humans on gene expression using microarray analysis. We recruited participants who had short-term exposure, long-term exposure, or no exposure. We then analyzed changes in gene expression in blood samples from these participants. A total of 866 genes were upregulated, while 366 genes were downregulated in the short-term exposure group. Similarly, in the long-term exposure group, a total of 852 and 480 genes were up- or downregulated, respectively. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to divide the clustered genes into nine clusters to investigate the expression of variations in accordance with the exposure period. Further research is required to determine the time-dependent effects of VOCs on epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mRNA in human blood samples (IRB #AS 14039) divided into three groups: control (unexposed workers; n = 12), short-term exposure (workers exposed to VOCs for less than 10 years; n = 12), and long-term exposure (workers exposed to VOCs for more than 10 years; n = 12) was experimented by microarray analysis after exposure to VOCs
