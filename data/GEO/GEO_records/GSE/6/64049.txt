TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of WT, ∆EZL1 and ∆DCL1 cells in conjugation 3, 6 and 10 (C3, C6 anc C10) hours of Tetrahymena thermophila

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
The goals of this study to find the switching between ncRNA and mRNA production underlies transcription silencing and reactivation of TE-related sequences inTetrahymena thermophila.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing data generated in WT, EZL1KO, DCL1KO cells at C3, C6 anc C10. Small RNA expression were analyzed in IES and the EZL1KO and DCL1KO induced non-MDS loci.
