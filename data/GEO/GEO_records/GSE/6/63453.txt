TITLE
Differences of miRNA expression profiling between GIST and leiomyoma tissue samples acquired by Tunneling Bloc Biopsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling between GIST and leiomyoma specimens taken by Tunneling Bloc Biopsy

DESIGN
Nine GIST patients and seven gastric leiomyoma patients underwent endoscopic biopsy called Tunnel Block Biopsy. MiRNAs were extracted from the tissues, then.
