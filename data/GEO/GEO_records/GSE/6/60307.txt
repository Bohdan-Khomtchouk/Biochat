TITLE
RNA Sequencing Analysis of Mouse Bone Marrow Derived Dendritic Cells Transcriptomes During Maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The purpose of this study is to detect activated or silenced genes during LPS-induced dendritic cell maturation. Gene expression differences between two samples could be found using transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) analysis. Methods:Mouse dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow cells in  RPMI-1640 medium with recombinant mouse GM-CSF and IL-4, mature DCs were obtained after LPS induced maturation. Immature DCs and mature DCs were sorted respectively based on maturation marker CD86 and Iab(MHCII) using flowcytrometer. DC mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing,using Illumina Results: We mapped about 10 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome, identified 1,300 upregulated genes and 1,475 dow regulated genes during dendritic cell maturation.

DESIGN
DC mRNA profiles immature and mature moouse BMDCs were generated by deep sequencing
