TITLE
In situ Staphylococcus aureus gene expression in a human prosthetic joint infection

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Little is known about regulation of gene activity of the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus during actual human infection. Here we characterize the transcriptome using deep RNA sequencing and the metabolome using NMR of S. aureus infected joint fluid derived from an acute human prosthetic joint infection, and compare them with the genome, transcriptome and metabolome of an isolate obtained from the sample grown in vitro (LB medium). The transcriptome indicated that the bacterial infection sustained on a versatile human-cell-based diet consisting of amino acids, glycans and nucleosides, since significant upregulation of genes involved in the catabolic degradation pathways of these compounds were observed in situ. This is consistent with metabolite analysis of the infected joint fluid and of S. aureus culture supernatants where the concentration of most amino acids and some amino sugars were found to be higher in the joint fluid, whereas the concentration of glucose was higher in culture supernatant. Furthermore, presumably because of oxygen limitations in the joint fluid, transcriptomic evidence for fermentation was observed, consistent with the presence of fermentation products (ethanol) in situ. Moreover, many, but not all, of the known virulence factor genes were upregulated in situ as well as the nine genes encoding the iron uptaking siderophore synthesis system.

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus differential gene expression between growth in situ (infected prosthetic joint fluid, single sample) and in vitro (LB medium, triplicate)
