TITLE
Aberrant haematopoiesis in Dnmt2 mutant mice [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow samples from Dnmt2-/- and wildtype mice were used to identify potential mRNA substrates of Dnmt2

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow of 8 day-old Dnmt2 and wildtype femora mice.The RNAs  were arrayed on Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip chips.
