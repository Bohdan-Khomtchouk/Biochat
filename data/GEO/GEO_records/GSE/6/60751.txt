TITLE
The in vivo responses elicited by Clostridium difficile in response to the gut commensal B. thetaiotaomicron and diet

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343

SUMMARY
Analysis of Clostridium difficile (Cd) from the cecal contents of germ-free mice or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt)-monocolonized mice on a standard, polysaccharide rich diet or polysaccharide deficient diet 5 days after infection. Results identify genes that are involved in the Cd response to diet, in vivo colonization and in interactions with Bt.
