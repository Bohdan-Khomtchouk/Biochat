TITLE
Gene expressions of CD4+ T cells in each developmental stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of T cells has been characterized as taking place over three stages: na√Øve (Tn), central memory (Tcm), and effector memory (Tem) cells. Recently, stem cell memory T cells (Tscm) were found to be the least-developed memory subset. We performed detailed analysis of the gene expression of human CD4+ T cells with clear distinction of the Tn, Tscm, Tcm, and Tem stages.

DESIGN
We sorted Tn, Tscm, Tcm, and Tem CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood of six healthy volunteers to see the differences of gene expression between each developmental stage.
