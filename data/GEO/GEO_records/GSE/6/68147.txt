TITLE
Anterior Heart Field (AHF)-conditional Mef2c Knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed conditional inactivation of mef2c in the anterior heart field (AHF) of mice and observed a phenotypic spectrum of outflow tract anomalies in the conditional mutant hearts.  In an effort to identify misregulated genes in the outflow tracts of the mutants, we have performed RNA-Seq on outflow tract samples dissected from E10.5 mutant and wild-type embryos.

DESIGN
There are four wild-type samples and four mutant samples.
