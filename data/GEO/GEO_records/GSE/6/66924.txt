TITLE
Expression data for C2C12 differentiation disrupted by Lrrfip1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C2C12 myoblasts differentiation is a precise controlled process. Splicing of many genes changes during the differentiation process. Some muscle-specific splicing isoforms play important role in myogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying defect of lrrfip1a, a muscle specific splicing isoform of Lrrfip1.

DESIGN
Differentiated C2C12 myoblasts shLUCI or shLrrfip1a were collected and extracted RNA, then hybridizated on Affymetrix. We sought to obtain the different expressed genes between shLUCI and shLrrfip1a samples.
