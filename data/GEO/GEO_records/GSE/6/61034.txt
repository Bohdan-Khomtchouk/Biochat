TITLE
H3K27ac ChIP in Dicer KO/WT [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-Seq of H3K27ac in duplicate in both WT and KO mesenchymal stem cells to evaluate global transcriptional changes between the new cells. We identified putative transcription factor binding sites using GEM v1.1 in K27ac data as well as in p MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulates development and disease but induce only moderate repression of directs mRNA targets, suggesting that they coordinate with other modes ofs cellular regulation to effect large changes in gene expression. Ins this work we decouple direct effects of global miRNA loss froms transcriptional changes downstream in a pair of isogenic murines fibroblast cell lines with and without Dicer expression. Wes demonstrate how effects on direct miRNA targets are amplified bys transcription machinery through the construction of a network models that identifies specific transcription factors that cause changes ins mRNA expression upon Dicer loss. Through transcription factors over-expression, we delineate miRNA-mediated transcriptional programss and identify miRNA-mediated coherent and incoherent feed-forwards loops, suggesting a functional role of the interaction between miRNAss and transcription factors.   In total, our results indicate thats miRNAs tightly control transcription factors within a denses interconnected network to modulate gene expression.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to mimic the previously captured ChIP-Seq with two replicates in both WT and KO MSCs
