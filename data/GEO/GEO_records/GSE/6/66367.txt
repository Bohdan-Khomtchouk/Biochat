TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells nucleosome occupancy data after simulation by heat killed Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The innate immune response is among the strongest genomic responses and is conserved across all metazoa.  Although transcription during the innate immune response has been well studied, the associated chromatin reorganizations are largely uncharacterized.  Here we show that Drosophila S2 cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus display a dynamic change in genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and sensitivity. We found a widespread and transient nucleosomal loss peaking at 30 minutes post stimulation, and we demonstrated that the regulatory potentials of nucleosomes differ following stimulation. In addition, we identified differentially sensitive nucleosomes with response-specific potentials. Our results provide high-resolution nucleosome-distribution maps of the fly genome, revealing chromatin's role in: the innate immune response to Gram-positive bacteria, response-specific regulatory-factor binding, and nucleosome sensitivity. We identify functional chromatin regulatory features associated with immune response, and lay a foundation for a framework linking general and locus-specific roles for nucleosomes in immune regulation.

DESIGN
Drsophila S2 cells at 0hr, 30minutes, 1hr and 4hr post heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus stimulation
