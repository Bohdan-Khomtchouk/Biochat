TITLE
Multi-platform Characterization of Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma (mRNA expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset is the mRNA expression for Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma and non-tumor adjacent tissues also characterized by Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from tumor and matching adjacent non-tumor lung and hybridized to Illumina HumanRef-8 v3 Expression Beadchip arrays.
