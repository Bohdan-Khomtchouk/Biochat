TITLE
Expression data from the Lateral Habenula (LHb) and the Medial Habenula (MHb) of the mouse (C57BL/6) brain after nicotine self-administration (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After intarvenouse catheter surgery, nicotine self-administration using an operant self-administration chamber, was conducted for 44 days with various doses of nicotine solution. Age-matched mice were used for control. After the self-administration, the Lateral Habenual (LHb) and the Medial Habenula (MHb) of the mouse brain were collected.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the mRNA expression profile of the Lateral Habenual (LHb) and the Medial Habenula (MHb) after the nicotine self-administration.
