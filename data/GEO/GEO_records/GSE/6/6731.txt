Genome-wide gene expression differences between Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis from endoscopic pinch biopsies:

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with variable, overlapping clinical features and complex pathophysiologies. To identify pathogenic processes underlying these disease subtypes, using single endoscopic pinch biopsies to estabolish 36 expression profiles, we elucidated gene expression patterns of active and inactive areas of UC and CD, and compared these to infectious colitis and healthy controls.
