TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed upon knockdown of CRISP-3 in human prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was stably transfected with a construct expressing shRNA against CRISP-3 gene. Knockdown of CRISP-3 was confirmed at RNA and protein level in the selected stable clones at three different passages. In order to identify the possible signalling pathways regulated by CRISP-3, one of the knockdown clones was subjected to microarray analysis. Global gene expression profile of the CRISP-3 knockdown clone was compared to that of the emprty vector clone. It was observed that Kallikrein 3 was significantly downregulated upon CRISP-3 knockdown whereas Annexin A1 and Vimentin were one of the highly upregulated genes.
