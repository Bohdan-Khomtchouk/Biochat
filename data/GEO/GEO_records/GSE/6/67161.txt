TITLE
Expression data from spontaneous highly maligant murine pre B cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In 20% of IRF4 deficient mice older than 150 days, spontaneous highly malignant pre B cell lymphomas emerge.  A change in the expression profile of genes involved in tumor progession and malignancy is sought for by microarray analyses. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying tumor development and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and downregulated genes in the spontaneous highly malignant pre B cell lymphoma.

DESIGN
Tumor mouse cells, control mouse B cells lacking IRF4 and control wildtype mouse B cells were purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  We sought to obtain the different expression levels of genes in tumor cells vs. control cells in order to find specific tumor regulated genes.  To that end, we used cells from murine tumors, control mouse B cells lacking IRF4 from bone marrow and sorted accourding to CD19+, sIgM- (control mice IRF4 Knockout ), and control wildtype mouse B cells from bone marrow sorted accourding to CD19+, CD25+, sIgM- (control mice wildtype C57Bl6).
