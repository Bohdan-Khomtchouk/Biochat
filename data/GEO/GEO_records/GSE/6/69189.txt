TITLE
Gene expression analysis of breast cancer cell lines treated with PI3K and PDK1 inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we demonstrate the differential gene expression of two breast cancer cell lines treated with PI3K and PDK1 inhibitors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated after 4h of treatment from breast cancer cell lines JIMT1 and HCC1954 from three biological replicates. Treatments were DMSO (0.1%), BYL719 (PI3K alpha inhibitor) 1 uM, GSK2334470 (PDK1 inhibitor) 1uM, and the combination of both agents. Samples for each group in triplicate were processed for Illumina BeadArrays (Illumina HT-12) by the MSKCC genomics core facility according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
