TITLE
SAGE: gene expression in pigs of two commercial lines at the 3 and  9 months og age

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Muscle development is associated with a modification of mass, composition and function that in productive animals are considered responsible of meat characteristics. In this study, SAGE was employed to describe gene expression in pigs of two commercial lines at the 3 and  9 months og age. The aim was to obtained a full gene expression profile that would assist in identifying genes differentially expressed in the muscle Longissimum dorsi during normal growth. The pattern of expression between lines and ages will help to elucidate the metabolic pathways modulated by these genes during muscle development. Keywords: SAGE, muscle, swine, age comparison, swine comparison
