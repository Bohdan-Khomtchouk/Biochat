TITLE
Response of Candida glabrata to environmental iron availability

ORGANISM
Candida glabrata CBS 138

SUMMARY
To examine the response of Candida glabrata cells to iron-depleted and iron-repleted environmental conditions, transcriptional profiling analysis was carried out on wild-type and Cghog1âˆ† cells grown either in presence of BPS or ferric chloride. Genes involved in iron transport and homeostasis, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolic process and chromatin silencing were found to be differentially regulated.

DESIGN
