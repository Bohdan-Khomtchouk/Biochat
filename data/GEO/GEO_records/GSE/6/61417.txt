TITLE
Testis expression in Mus musculus domesticus x Mus musculus musculus hybrid zone mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We collected whole genome testis expression data from hybrid zone mice. We integrated GWAS mapping of testis expression traits and low testis weight to gain insight into the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility.
