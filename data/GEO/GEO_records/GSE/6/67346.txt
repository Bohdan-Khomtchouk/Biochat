TITLE
The ChIP-Sequence data of STAT92E in Drosophila adult intestines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
JAK/STAT pathway plays important roles in controlling Drosophila intestinal homeostasis and regulating the ISC proliferation and differentiation. However,the downstream targets of its transcription factor-STAT92E remain largely unknown.To further identify the regualtory mechanisms of the JAK/STAT pathway in controlling intestinal homeostasis,we performed the ChIP-Seq assay with mouse raised STAT92E antibody using JAK/STAT signaling highly activated adult intestines.Through the ChIP assay, we have identified over 1000 significant peaks (p < 0.01) around the putative targets.The well-characterized JAK/STAT downstream targets including Domeless,Socs36E,STAT92E and chinmo were identified in our ChIP assay,indicating that our experiment is workable to identify novel JAK/STAT downstream targets in adult intestines.This work will provide insights into our understanding of regulatory mechanisms of JAK/STAT signaling during Drosophila intestinal development.

DESIGN
Identify the ChIP peaks of STAT92E antibody using JAK/STAT signaling highly actived Drosophila adult intestines, compared with input libaray as the control
