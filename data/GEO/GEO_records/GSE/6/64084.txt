TITLE
Gene expression regulated by HBV mRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HBV mRNAs harboring miR-122 response elements were found to bind and sequester endogenous miR-122. This microarray experiment was carried out to find out differentially expressed genes in Huh7 cells expressing HBV mRNAs.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from Huh7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing HBV mRNA with wild type (WT) or mutant (Mut) miR-122 response elements in its 3â€™-UTR or the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (3.1) as a mock. Total RNA was then extracted and processed on Affymetrix microarrays in biological duplicate.
