TITLE
Quantitative transcriptomics of pheromone biosynthetic midgut and fat body tissues in the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderoase Hopkins

ORGANISM
Dendroctonus ponderosae

SUMMARY
Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) are pests of many forests around the world.  The mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a significant pest of western North American pine forests.  The MPB is able to overcome the defences of pine trees through pheromone-assisted aggregation that results in a mass attack of host trees.  These pheromones, both male and female produced, are believed to be biosynthesized in the midgut and/or fat body of these insects.  We have used transcriptomics (RNA-seq) to identify transcripts differentially expressed between sexes and between tissues, with juvenile hormone III treatment, which is known to induce pheromone biosynthesis.

DESIGN
Anterior midgut and fat body mRNA profiles of emerged beetles of both sexes 8 h after juvenile hormone III or acetone control treatment were generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplicate, using Illumina paired-end sequencing.
