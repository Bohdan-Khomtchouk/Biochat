TITLE
miRNA expression in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) treated with or without whole β-glucan particles (WGP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine MDSCs isolated from the spleens of Lewis lung carcinoma mice were treated with or without WGP, and then miRNA array was used to analyze the differentailly expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
Murine MDSCs were isolated from the spleens of Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice, and the sorted MDSCs were stimulated with or without 100 µg/ml WGP for 24 h. Then, the total RNA was extracted to perform miRNA array to analyze the differentially expressed miRNAs in MDSCs treated with or without WGP
