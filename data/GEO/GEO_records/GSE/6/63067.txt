TITLE
Expression data from human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns of 2 human steatosis and 9 human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) together with their respective control patterns were analyzed to define the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression molecular characteristics and to define NASH early markers from steatosis.

DESIGN
Human liver samples of steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
