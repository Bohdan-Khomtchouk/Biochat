TITLE
Mechanosensitive proteins are sensitized in myelinated afferents following in vivo inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we identified two populations of myelinated sensory neurons that display markedly different phenotypes in terms of their action potential characteristics and responses to mechanical stimuli based on their expression of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Myelinated neurons that did not express CGRP responded to mechanical stimuli with significantly larger currents during whole-cell voltage clamp recordings than their CGRP-positive counterparts, regardless of whether these neurons projected to the dorsal hindpaw skin or the gastrocnemius muscle. Importantly, this discrepancy could not be explained by a differential expression of mechanosensitive or mechanically-gated proteins like Stoml3 or Piezo2. Following inflammation of the skin or muscle, myelinated neurons demonstrated a sensitization to mechanical stimuli characterized by increased current amplitudes. Interestingly, myelinated neurons expressing CGRP are sensitized to mechanical stimuli following cutaneous inflammation of the paw, while myelinated neurons that do not express CGRP are sensitized to mechanical stimuli following inflammation of the gastrocnemius muscle. Microarray data was obtained from these populations by first using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to separate the populations of interest.

DESIGN
15 different samples were analyzed, 3 biological replicates for each group (5 groups: saline paw-injected, CFA paw-injected, saline muscle-injected, acid muscle-injected, and CFA muscle-injected). The saline injected groups (paw and muscle) are considered controls.
