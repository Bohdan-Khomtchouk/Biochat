TITLE
Mouse-human experimental epigenetic analysis unmasks dietary targets and genetic liability for diabetic phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a functional approach to investigate the epigenetics of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), we combine three lines of evidence – diet-induced epigenetic dysregulation in mouse, epigenetic conservation in humans, and T2D clinical risk evidence – to identify genes implicated in T2D pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity. Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. We then replicate these results in adipose samples from lean and obese patients pre- and post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, identifying regions where both the location and direction of methylation change is conserved. These regions overlap with 27 genetic T2D risk loci, only one of which was deemed significant by GWAS alone. Functional analysis of genes associated with these regions revealed four genes with roles in insulin resistance, demonstrating the potential general utility of this approach for complementing conventional human genetic studies by integrating cross-species epigenomics and clinical genetic risk.

DESIGN
Data for 57 mouse samples and 29 human samples are included. Mouse samples are split into groups high-fat and low-fat groups for each of five different tissues. Human samples are split into three groups - lean, obese pre-RYGB and post-RYGB.
