TITLE
Genomewide measurements of whole embryo mRNA decay in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
whole embryo (all tissues) measurement of mRNA decay by 4-thiouridine pulse-chase

DESIGN
These TU-Decay microarrays analyze mRNA levels at three timepoints: a one hour pulse, one hour chase, and three hour chase.  Measurements with or without transcription inhibition by actinomycin D (ActD) were compared.
