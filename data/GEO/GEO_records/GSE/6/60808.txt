TITLE
Jarid2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function by acting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) has been shown to play a key role in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function. Analyses of mouse mutants harboring deletions of core components have implicated PRC2 in fine-tuning multiple pathways that instruct HSPC behavior, yet how PRC2 is targeted to specific genomic loci within HSPCs remains unknown. Here we use shRNA-mediated knockdown to survey the function of known PRC2 accessory factors in HSPCs by testing the competitive reconstitution capacity of transduced murine fetal liver cells. We find that similar to the phenotype observed upon depletion of core subunit Suz12, depleting Jarid2 enhances the competitive transplantation capacity of both fetal and adult, mouse and human HSPCs. Gene expression profiling revealed common Suz12 and Jarid2 target genes that are enriched for the H3K27me3 mark established by PRC2. These data implicate Jarid2 as an important component of PRC2 that has a central role in coordinating HSPC function.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of jarid knockdown, suz knockdown and control from HSPC in 16 week old mice.
