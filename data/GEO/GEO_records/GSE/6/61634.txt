TITLE
Stability analysis of B25MOL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stability of B25MOL cells was proven by comparative transcriptome analysis. Expression profile (mRNA) was determined for cells of different age (4 time points) indicated by passage number.

DESIGN
Cells from primary tumor of human kidney were propagated for 20, 28, 29, 36, and 40 rounds of seeding/growth/harvest and subjected to mRNA isolation.
