TITLE
WRKY33-dependent expression of Arabidopsis genes upon Botrytis cinerea 2100 inoculation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana mutant wrky33 is highly susceptible to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Comparing the expression profiles of B. cinerea-infected wrky33 and WT plants we identified 2765 differentially expressed genes dependent on WRKY33, of which 1675 were up-regulated in the mutant (termed WRKY33-repressed genes) and 1090 were down-regulated in the mutant. Combined with ChIP-seq data 318 genes were identified as direct functional targets of WRKY33 at 14 h post inoculation with spores of Botrytis cinerea 2100.

DESIGN
Comparison of altered gene expression in Arabidopsis WT and wrky33 mutant plants 14 hours post inoculation with Botrytis cinerea 2100.
