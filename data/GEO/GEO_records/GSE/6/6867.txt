TITLE
Expression data in the absence of Notch1 in hair follicles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch1 deficient hair matrix keratinocytes have lower mitotic rates, resulting in smaller follicles with fewer cells. In addition, the ratio of melanocytes to keratinocytes is greatly reduced. Microarray was performed to study downstream mechanism of Notch1-deficiency Keywords: genetic modification
