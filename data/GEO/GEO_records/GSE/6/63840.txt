TITLE
RNA profiling of PDX1+ pancreatic progenitors before or after co-culture with different types of cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of Pdx-EGFP1+ pancreatic progenitors before or after co-culture at mRNA level. The hypothesis tested in the study was that the overall gene expression in Pdx1-EGFP+ does not alter after co-culture with endothelial cells. The result supported our hypothesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from Pdx1-EGFP+ progenitors from the Pdx1-EGFP HUES8 cell-derived pancreatic progenitor population before (none) and after co-culture (AKT-HUVEC, MPEC, or BJ) Fig 2d in publication.
