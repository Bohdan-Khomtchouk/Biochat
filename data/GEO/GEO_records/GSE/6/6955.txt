SUMMARY
Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM #312750) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder linked to heterozygous de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene. MECP2 encodes methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which represses gene transcription by binding to 5-methylcytosine residues in symmetrically positioned CpG dinucleotides. The disorder is almost exclusively diagnosed in females, because males affected by the disease usually die perinatally due to severe encephalopathy.  Direct MeCP2 target genes underlying the neuropathogenesis of RTT remain largely unknown. To identify genes involved in the neuropathogenesis of RTT we assessed the gene expression profile of postmortem brains affected by RTT and that of age-matched normal brains using Affymetrix arrays. Keywords: comparison between Rettsyndrome  suffering  and non-suffering patients
