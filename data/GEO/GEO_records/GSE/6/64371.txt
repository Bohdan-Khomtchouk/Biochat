TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of fresh-frozen, furan-exposed mouse liver using RNA-seq [polyA enrichment]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Furan is a mouse and rat hepatocarcinogen. We sought to determine if furan-induced gene expression changes could be detected in paired fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples using RNA-seq (polyA-enrichment protocol).  All samples in this study (fresh-frozen, 18 hours in formalin, 3 weeks in formalin) were also examined using one- and two-colour microarrays and RNA-seq (ribo-depletion protocol) in order to determine the effect of the technology on gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
In this study we examined the transcriptional response in liver tissue of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to furan for 3 weeks to 8 mg/kg bw furan (or vehicle control) and sacrificed four hours after the final exposure.  Each dose group had 4 biological replicates. There were a total of 24 samples included in the final analysis of the polyA enrichment RNA-seq experiment.
