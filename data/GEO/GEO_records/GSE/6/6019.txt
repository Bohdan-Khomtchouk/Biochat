SUMMARY
Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, predominantly experienced by children and non-immune adults, which results in great mortality and long-term sequelae. Recent reports based on histology of post-mortem brain tissue suggest that CM may be the common end point for a range of syndromes. Here, we have analysed the gene expression profiles in brain tissue taken from experimental CM (ECM)-susceptible, Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected C57BL/6 (B6) and CBA/CaH (CBA) mice with ECM. Gene expression profiles were largely heterogeneous between the two ECM-susceptible strains. These results, combined with experimental data, support the existence of distinct pathogenic pathways in CM. Keywords: disease state analysis
