TITLE
Profiling of bacterial respiratory infection, viral respiratory infection, and non-infectious illness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A pressing clinical challenge is identifying the etiologic basis of acute respiratory illness. Without reliable diagnostics, the uncertainty associated with this clinical entity leads to a significant, inappropriate use of antibacterials. Use of host peripheral blood gene expression data to classify individuals with bacterial infection, viral infection, or non-infection represents a complementary diagnostic approach. Patients with respiratory tract infection along with ill, non-infected controls were enrolled through the emergency department or undergraduate student health services. Whole blood was obtained to generate gene expression profiles. These profiles were then used to generate signatures of bacterial acute respiratory infection, viral acute respiratory infection, and non-infectious illness.

DESIGN
273 subjects were ascertained for this analysis. This included 88 patients with non-infectious illness, 115 with viral acute respiratory infection, and 70 with bacterial acute respiratory infection.  Samples were obtained at the time of enrollment, which was at initial clinical presentation. Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit. Microarray data were generated using the GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array.   Microarrays were generated in two microarray batches with seven overlapping samples giving rise to 280 total microarray experiments.
