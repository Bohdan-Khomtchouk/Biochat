TITLE
Gene expression profiles during long-term low-temperature treatment and cold acclimation in synthetic wheat hexaploids

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We conducted microarray analysis to study comprehensive changes of gene expression profile under long-term low-temperature (LT) treatment and to identify other LT-responsive genes related with cold acclimation in seedling leaves and crown tissues (shoots containing apical meristems) of a synthetic hexaploid wheat line. The microarray analysis revealed marked up-regulation of a number of Cor/Lea genes and fructan biosynthesis-related genes under the long-term LT treatment. For validation of the microarray data, we selected four synthetic wheat lines, which contained the A and B genomes from a tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and the diverse D genomes originating from the different Ae. tauschii accessions, with distinct levels of freezing tolerance after cold acclimation. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the transcription accumulated levels of the Cor/Lea, CBF, and fructan biosynthesis-related genes were higher in more freezing-tolerant lines than those in the sensitive lines. The fructan biosynthesis pathway would be associated with cold acclimation to develop wheat freezing tolerance and related with diversity of the freezing tolerance level in addition to the CBF-mediated Cor/Lea expression pathway.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between a synthetic wheat line which treated 24℃ and 4℃. Total RNA samples were respectively isolated from leaves and crown tissues of the synthetic line grown at normal temperature for 3 weeks and then at 4°C for 12 and 6 weeks. Two independent experiments were conducted in each exprement.
