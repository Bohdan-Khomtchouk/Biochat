TITLE
Gene expression based profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected primary murine osteoclasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) is known to reside in cells of innate immune system- macrophages and dendritic cells. A variety of non -conventional cell typeslike adipocytes, mesenchyal stem cells and osteoclasts can also be infected with Mtb. However, cellular transcriptional adapations enabling survival of Mtb in these cells remain known. We used microarrays to understand global changes in transcriptional profiling during macrophage to osteoclast transition in presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Time-series changes in expression were seen in presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on 0, 2, 3 and 4 days post infection during macrophage to osteoclast transition.
