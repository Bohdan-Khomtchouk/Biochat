TITLE
Expression profiling of HCT116 cells transfected with shCTRL or shKSR1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We engineered HCT116 cells by transfecting a non targeting control hairpin or 2 different short hairpin against KSR1 to knockdown KSR1 and microarrays were performed on non-transfected controls, non-targeting shRNA controls, shRNA #1 targeting KSR1, and shRNA #2 targeting KSR1. We used microarray for molecular profiling of colon cancer cells in presence or in absence of KSR1, an important scaffold of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and identify genes which are regulated by KSR1

DESIGN
Cell lines were measured in as single biological replicates 1. HCT116 untransfected 2 HCT116 + shCTRL 3.HCT116 + shKSR1#1 4. 3.HCT116 + shKSR1#2
