TITLE
Exogenous Glucosamine Globally Protects Chondrocytes from the Arthritogenic Effects of IL-1beta

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Glucosamine proved to be a potent, broad-spectrum inhibitor of IL-1beta. Of the 2,813 genes whose transcription was altered by IL-1beta stimulation (p < 0.0001), glucosamine significantly blocked the response in 2,055 (~73%). Glucosamine fully protected the chondrocytes from IL-1-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors as well as proteins involved in PGE2 and NO synthesis. It also blocked the IL-1-induced expression of matrix specific proteases such as MMPs -3,-9,-10,-12 and ADAMTS-1. Keywords: treatment response
