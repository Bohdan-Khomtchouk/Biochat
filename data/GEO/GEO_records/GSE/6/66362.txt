TITLE
RNA-seq of zebrafish brain, liver and skin during perturbation with rotenone at young and old age

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish of two different age groups (12 and 36 months) were treated with low amounts of rotenone (mild stress) and compared to untreated zebrafish. Two different durations were used (3 and 8 weeks). Illumina sequencing (HiSeq2000) was applied to generate 50bp single-end reads.

DESIGN
68 sample: 3 tissues (brain, liver, skin); 2 age groups (12 and 36 months); controls and rotenone treated samples; 2-6 biological replicates for each group
