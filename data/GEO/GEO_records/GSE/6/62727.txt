TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in permanent atrial fibrillation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia with increased risk of stroke and congestive heart failure. AF is a highly genetic heterogeneous disease, but a large proportion of AF cannot be explained by genetic variants only. Some risk factors of AF, tendentious heritable phenomenon, potentially reversible conditions and some subtypes without DNA sequence variation all indicate the participation of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of AF.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 11 left atrium samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip GPL13534
