TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of CFBE41o-ΔF508 cells and CFBE41o−CFTR cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE41o-ΔF508) cells subjected to 23 bio-active small molecules including vehicle controls, at low temperature and untreated cells. Untreated Cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o−CFTR) are also included.

DESIGN
Two-colors Dye-swap, two or three biological replicates with two technical replicates each and DMSO (vehicle control) were included in each hybridization batch.
