TITLE
Characterization of mouse histone H3 variants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The selective incorporation of appropriate histone variants into chromatin is critical for the regulation of genome function. Although many histone variants have been identified, a complete list has not been compiled. We screened human and mouse genomes by in silico hybridization using canonical histone sequences, and found 14 uncharacterized H3-related genes in mouse. Most were similar to the H3.3 variant; their 3â€² untranslated regions lacked a stem-loop structure but did have a poly- adenylation signal. Transcriptome analysis revealed tissue-specific expression of these variants. When expressed as GFP-tagged versions in mouse C2C12 cells, some variants were stably incorporated into chromatin and the genome distributions of most variants were similar to that of H3.3. Over-expression of some variants altered gene expression patterns in differentiated C2C12 cells, suggesting that these new H3 variants have specific and distinct functions.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq and  ChIP-Seq  for GFP fused Histone H3 variants of C2C12 cells in growth or differentiated conditions; 3'-seq analysis for C2C12 cells and mouse tissues
