TITLE
Influence of NaCl on gene expression in Dickeya dadantii

ORGANISM
Dickeya dadantii 3937

SUMMARY
Growth in 0.3 M NaCl M63 minimal medium affects the transcriptome of Dickeya dadantii 3937.in comparison to that of cells grown in M63 medium.

DESIGN
NimbleGen design name 2005-05-31_Ogg_Erwinia_24mer, NimbleGen design ID 2181 A 1:2 expression design for 4597 genes from Dickeya dadantii 3937 with 20 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene. Each probe is replicated 2 times. The design includes random GC and other control probes. Protocol: High-density DNA array prepared with Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) technology.
