TITLE
The reversed evolution from multicellularity to unicellularity during carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using xenograft-based experimental evolution, we characterize the full life history from initiation to metastasis of a tumor at the genomic and transcriptomic levels.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cell lines or xenograft tumor samples.
