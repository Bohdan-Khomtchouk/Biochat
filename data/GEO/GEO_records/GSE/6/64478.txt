TITLE
Gene expression analysis of HdhQ111 mice in a Pin1 knock-out background

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we report additional phenotypes of mHtt mice that are modified in Pin1 knock-out mice

DESIGN
RNAs from the striatum of three mice of 12 months of age were purified for each of the genotypes (PinWT/HttWT; PinKO/HttWT; PinWT/HttKI; PinKO/HttKi)  to carry out gene expression profiling
