TITLE
Global expression analysis of differential expression of genes working under Soil Water Stress condition in different genotypes of rice in Vegetative and Grain-filling stage [set 2]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
One of the serious constraints to realize high level of rice crop productivity in agriculture has been due to Soil Water Stress (SWS) situation that growing plants often face. In order to increase or maintain the crop productivity in SWS situation, our initial aim is to understand the drought response mechanism in different genotypes of rice. For thorough analysis of SWS situation in rice we have taken here two wild genotypes of rice namely Oryza nivara, Oryza rufipogon and three Oryza sativa indica cultivars namely Nagina-22, IR20 and Vandana, where IR20 is known to be susceptible and Vandana is known to be tolerant under SWS condition [GSE49364 and the current study]. Global analysis of transcript profiling under SWS condition reveal the actual picture of genes responsive to stress situation in different genetic background of rice. Furthermore it would help us in the selection of most desirable resource for crop breeding without compromising the yield of crop. We used the 44k rice Oligoarray from Agilent technologies to study the expression profiles from five rice genotypes during vegetative (Veg) and grain-filling (GF) stages under varying water conditions, viz. Before Stress (BS), After Stress (AS) and After Recovery (AR).
