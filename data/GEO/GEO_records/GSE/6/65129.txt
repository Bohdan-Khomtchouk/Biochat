TITLE
Beauveria bassiana MBF 1 (BbMBF1) regulating genes involved in fungal resistance to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860

SUMMARY
Gene BbMBF1 playes an essential role in fungal response to oxidative stress, a determinant to the biocontrol  potential of entomopathogenic fungi.  The genome-wide exprssion analysis involved in stress response was analyzed by using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which involved in metabolism, cell transport and cell rescue, were significantly controlled by BbMBF1 during response to oxidative stress.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BbMBF1 disruption mutant were compared to that of wild type strain (WT) grown in SDB mediua (Glucose 4%, Peptone 1%, and Yeast extract 1%).
