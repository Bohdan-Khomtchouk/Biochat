TITLE
Profiling of soma and neurite transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report mRNA profiles of subcellularly localized transcriptomes (soma and neurite) of two mouse cell lines, N2A and CAD, as well as primary cortical neurons from E18.5 mice.  We also performed this fractionation and sequencing after RNAi knockdown (cell lines) or in knockout mice (primary cortical neurons) of the RNA-binding proteins muscleblind 1 and 2 (Mbnl1 and Mbnl2).

DESIGN
Fractionate neurons using porous transwell membranes.  Isolate poly-A RNA.
