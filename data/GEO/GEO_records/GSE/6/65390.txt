TITLE
miRNA expression-based, individualized outcome prediction for SDT treatment in melanoma

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of a total of 3100 capture probes, covering all human, mouse and rat microRNAs annotated in miRBase 18.0, in 8 melanoma samples divided into 4 groups (Control, ALA, US, and SDT group).
