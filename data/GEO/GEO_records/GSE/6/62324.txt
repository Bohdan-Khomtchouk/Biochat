TITLE
Brown adipose tissue from WT and SIRT1tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. SIRT1 plays key roles in metabolic regulation and adaptation. In this study, we examined the difference of gene expression in brown adipose tissue from WT and SIRT1tg mice.

DESIGN
SIRT1 transgenic model (heterozygous transgenic model) has already been described (Pfluger et al., 2008). Here we used homozygote transgenic mice which had been backcrossed to C57Bl/6N background. 3 months old WT and SIRT1tg mice were fed with a low fat diet. After sacrifice, total mRNA obtained from brown adipose were used for microarray.
