TITLE
p63 binding regions in HaCaT epidermal keratinocyte infected with caRAS/dnRAS and treated with TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the effect of caRAS/dnRAS expression and TGF-beta on p63 binding in HaCaT cells.

DESIGN
p63 binding sites in HaCaT cells were determined by ChIP-seq.
