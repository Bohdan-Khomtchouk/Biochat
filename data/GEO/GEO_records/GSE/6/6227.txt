TITLE
Expression data from rust or mock inoculated, fully expanded flag leaf halves

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Two sets of wheat lines near-isogenic to Lr34 were used to compare gene expression profiles of wheat: 1. with and without Lr34 gene; 2. rust and mock inoculation; 3. distal and basal portion of the flag leaves.  The two sets of wheat near-isogenic lines were used to subtract genetic background variations and to enrich Lr34-regulated gene expression profiles.  The study is aimed to better understand the mechanisms of the well-known durable leaf rust resistance gene, Lr34, mediated resistance at the transcriptome level. Keywords: Distal and basal leaf halves of near-isogenic lines
