TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of knockdown of the nuclear poly(A) binding proteins, PABPN1 and ZC3H14 on steady-state mRNA levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The polyadenosine RNA binding proteins (Pabs) represent one class of RNA binding proteins that play critical roles in gene expression. This class includes the well-studied nuclear and cytoplasmic Pabs, PABPN1 and PABPC1, respectively, as well as the newly characterized nuclear Pab, zinc finger CCCH-type containing #14, or ZC3H14. ZC3H14 was recently linked to a form of intellectual disability, suggesting a critical role for ZC3H14 in neurons; however, the post-transcriptional function of ZC3H14 is unknown. In this study, we performed a microarray analysis of cells depleted of ZC3H14 or PABPN1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These results revealed that PABPN1 significantly affected ~17% of expressed transcripts as compared to ZC3H14, which affected ~1% of expressed transcripts, suggesting that ZC3H14 has specific mRNA targets. The differentially expressed mRNAs identified in this analysis not only provide information about the classes and types of transcripts that are regulated by these proteins, but also represent a set of transcripts that could be directly bound by ZC3H14 and/or PABPN1.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MCF-7 cells treated for 48 hours with siRNA targeting PABPN1, ZC3H14 (all splice variants), or a control scramble siRNA.
