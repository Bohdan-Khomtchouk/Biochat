TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Nup98HoxA9 expressing ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To know whether the Nup98-HoxA9 affects global gene expression, we performed DNA microarray analysis using the following four clones: two independent Nup98-HoxA9 ES clones (clone#1 and clone#9), parental ES cells, and HoxA9-Ct ES clone.

DESIGN
Two independent Nup98-HoxA9 ES clones (clone#1 and clone#9), and HoxA9-Ct ES clone, was compared with parental ES cells (reference sample).
