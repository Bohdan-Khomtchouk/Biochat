TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis facilitates quantitative analysis to identify genes in hepatic tissue of partially hepatectomized rats regulated by ASCs-miR27b introduction in comparison with ASCs-siRNC or saline controls

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Methods: The cDNA libraries from 3 pooled samples of liver tissues for each group were sequenced to generate RNA profiles using Illumina Miseq platform Results: The sequencing runs yielded a total of 22.67 M reads with an average length of 100 bp. The high-throughput sequencing performed for liver samples with different treatments showed similar numbers of yielded reads ranged from 5.57 to 5.74 M and the same average length. The Strand NGS software (version 2.1) was used using default parameters for pre-alignment and post-alignment quality control analysis and 100% of the raw reads remained in the dataset. Of these, 19.02 M reads (84%) were mapped into contigs of the rat genome (rn5) and identified 31457 transcripts in liver samples.

DESIGN
Hepatic mRNA profiles of partially hepatectomized rats intravenously treated by ASCs-miR27b, ASCs-siRNC, saline control and na√Øve control were generated by sequencing, using Illumina Miseq platform
