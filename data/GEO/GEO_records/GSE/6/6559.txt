SUMMARY
Oncogenic Ras induces epidermal cell growth arrest. Induction of the JNK/Ap1 signaling cascade by expression of MKK7 overcomes Ras-induced cell growth arrest in a manner dependent on AP1 fucntion. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to MKK7, Ras  activation and AP1 inhibition Keywords: response to specific genetic change
