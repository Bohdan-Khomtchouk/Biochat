TITLE
Analysis of bacterial and macrophage transcripts in ISRE-positive and negative infected macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify bacterial transcripts that may be associated with type I IFN production in Salmonella enterica subsp typhimurium (SL1344) infected macrophages we transformed macrophages with an ISRE-GFP reporter construct and sorted separate populations of GFP positive and GFP negative infected macrophages.  We then did whole transcriptome profiling, collecting both host and bacterial transcripts, for differential expression analysis

DESIGN
Analysis of ISRE positive, negative, and mixed populations at two time points (unexposed and 24hours) in duplicate (biological replicates).  A sample consisting of Salmonella prior to infection was also included
