TITLE
Pax2 Dependent Expression in the Intermediate Mesoderm at E11.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Heterozygous and homozygous Pax2 E11.5 embryos were collected and the intermediate mesoderm was dissected and dispersed into single cells. The Pax2 positive cells also expressed EGFP, which was knocked into the Pax2 locus.  EGFP positive cells were sorted by FACS and RNA isolated.

DESIGN
We compared RNA expression levels in EGFP positive cells from Pax2 null and Pax2 heterozygote embryos.
