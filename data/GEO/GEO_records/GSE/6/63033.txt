TITLE
Analysis of Genomic Copy Number Variation in Equine Recurrent Airway Obstruction

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Sixteen severly RAO (Recurrent Airway Obstruction) affected horses were studied. All RAO affected male horses were hybridized with GSM1332974 (Thoroughbred male 1, male reference), and the female horses were with GSM1332975 (Thoroughbred female 2, female reference). Finally results are compared with GSE55266 and two other control horses (SPA-H1-3 and SPA-H1-5) and relatively novel RAO CNVs were reported.

DESIGN
16 RAO affected male and female horses were studied. they are of various breeds. Male and female RAO samples were hybridized with Thoroughbred1, and female samples were hybridized with Thoroughbred2
