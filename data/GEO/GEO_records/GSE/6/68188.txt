TITLE
From transcriptomics to phenomics to reveal adaptation response of Lactobacillus plantarum C2 in plant substrates

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine biological relevance of differentially expressed genes in Lactobacillus plantarum C2 during fermentation of plant substrates. Whole-transcriptome analysis based on customized microarray profiles has been used to determine altered transcription patterns in L. plantarum C2.

DESIGN
L. plantarum C2 was grown (24 h at 30°C) and stored ( 21 days at 4°C) in carrot or pineapple juices to mimic the chemical composition of the respective raw matrices. De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth was used as the control medium for optimal growth. Samples were analyzed at the late exponential phase of growth and after storage
