TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata are two closely related Brassicaceae species, which are used as models for plant comparative biology. They differ by lifestyle, predominant mating strategy, ecological niches and genome organization. In order to explore molecular basis of specific traits, we performed RNA-sequencing of vegetative rosettes from both species. Additionally, we sequenced apical meristems and inflorescences of A. lyrata that allow for intra-specific transcriptome comparison in several major developmental stages. Please view also related dataset GSE69077 (RNA-sequencing of heat stressed A. lyrata  and A. thaliana plants).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana aerial tissues were collected from mock treated plants, total RNA isolated and poly-A RNA populations sequenced
