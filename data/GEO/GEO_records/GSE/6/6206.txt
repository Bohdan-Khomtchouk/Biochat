TITLE
Expression data of untreated or cisplatin-treated wildtype or Rb-/- MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The absence of the Rb tumor suppressor gene changes levels/activities of transcription factors (e.g., E2F and p53) which alter gene expression patterns, related to cell cycle control and cellular response to DNA damage.  Cisplatin is a genotoxic chemotherapeutic agent and wildtype or Rb null cells have different sensitivities to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. We used microarrays to compare global profiles of gene expression and distinct responses of wildtype and Rb null MEFs in response to cisplatin. Keywords: genotype and cisplatin treatment
