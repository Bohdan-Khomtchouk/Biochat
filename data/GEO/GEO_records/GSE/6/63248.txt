TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of glucose deprivation-responsive gene expression in parental and KAP1 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the alteration of gene expression in response to 8-h glucose depletion in parental or KAP1 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. The results provide important information for KAP1-regulated gene response upon metabolic stress such as glucose starvation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-231/shKAP1 cells subjected to 0 or 8 hours of glucose starvation.
