TITLE
Effect of 4hr cortistatin A treatment on gene expression in SET2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the marine natural product cortistatin A (CA) as an inhibitor of CDK8 to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of CDK8 regulates super-enhancer function and inhibits AML proliferation. In this series, we examine the transcriptional effect on SET2 cells of 4hrs exposure to CA to identify immediate effects.

DESIGN
SET2 cells were treated in triplicate with either DMSO or CA for 4hrs after which RNA was harvested and prepared for RNA sequencing to assess transcriptional changes.
