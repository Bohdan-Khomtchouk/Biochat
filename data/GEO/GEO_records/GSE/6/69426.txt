TITLE
High-resolution mapping of H4K16 and H3K23 acetylation reveals conserved and unique distribution patterns and functions in Arabidopsis and rice

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide high-resolution maps of H4K16ac and H3K23ac in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.

DESIGN
For wild-type Arabidopsis and rice plants, ChIP-seq was performed with H4K16ac and H3K23ac antibodies.
