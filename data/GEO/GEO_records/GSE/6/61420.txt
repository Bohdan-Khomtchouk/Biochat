TITLE
Generation of Naïve Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Rhesus Monkey Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Conventional embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from primates resemble mouse epiblast stem cells, raising an intriguing question regarding whether the naïve pluripotent state resembling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) exists in primates and how to capture it in vitro. Here we identified several specific signaling modulators that are sufficient to generate rhesus monkey fibroblast-derived iPSCs with the features of naïve pluripotency in terms of growth properties, gene expression profiles, self-renewal signaling, X-reactivation and the potential to generate cross-species chimeric embryos. Interestingly, together with recent reports of naïve human pluripotent stem cells, our findings suggest several conserved signaling pathways shared with rodents and specific to primates, providing significant insights for acquiring naïve pluripotency from other mammal species. In addition, the derivation of rhesus monkey naïve iPSCs also provides a valuable cell source for use in preclinical research and disease modeling.

DESIGN
mRNA expression analysis of  4 rhesus monkey naive iPSC lines and 2 primed iPSC lines were examed.
