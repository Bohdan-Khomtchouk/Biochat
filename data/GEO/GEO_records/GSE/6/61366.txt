TITLE
Changes in cholesterol homeostasis and acute phase response following pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes links carbon nanotube exposure to risk of cardiovascular disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adverse lung effects in rodents following pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are well documented. However, systemic effects are less understood. Prospective epidemiological studies have shown increased cardiovascular disease risk after pulmonary exposure to airborne particles, which has led to concerns that inhalation exposure to MWCNT might pose similar risks. We used high-content genomics tools to compare hepatic responses after exposure to a short, entangled MWCNT to the hepatic responses after exposure to a long, stiffer MWCNT at the global transcriptomic level. Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed by single intratracheal instillation to 162 µg/mouse of a short MWCNT (NRCWE-26 (NC-7000), 847±102 nm in length) or long MWCNT (NM-401 (CP-0006-SG), 4048±366 nm in length). Liver tissues were harvested 24 h, 3 d and 28 d after exposure.

DESIGN
This experiment examined the pulmonary transcriptional response of female C57BL/6 mice exposed to NRCWE-26, a short multi-walled carbon nanotube, and NM-401, a long multi-walled carbon nanotube, at three doses: D1 (18 μg), D2 (54 μg), D3 (162 μg), and vehicle control. Each dose group was examined 1, 3 or 28 days post-exposure. Each dose group had 6 biological replicates. There were a total of 72 samples included in the final analysis using a two-color reference design.
