TITLE
Transcription profiling of a S96xSK1 yeast cross and its pool of spores.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To dissect local regulation into cis and trans contribution, we measured allelic differential expression in a hybrid cross of two yeast strains and compared it against allelic differential expression in a pool of spores of the same cross.

DESIGN
RNA- and DNA-seq of a diploid S. cerevisiae hybrid and its haploid spores.
