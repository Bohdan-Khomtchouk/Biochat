TITLE
Genetic suppression reveals DNA repair-independent antagonism between BRCA1 and COBRA1 in mammary gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of sorted mammary epithelial cells from animals at 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. Each individual sample was RNA obtained from an individual mouse. Our mice are mammary epithelium specific knocknout mouse models for gene Cobra1 and/or Brca1. For Cobra1, the first four exons were floxed. For Brca1, the largest exon, exon 11, was floxed. The mammary epithelium specific deletions were driven by cre recombinase under MMTV promoter (MMTV-cre). Animal genotype abbreviations used: wild-type (WT), meaning one of the following three: Cobra1f/f (Cff), Brca1f/f (Bff), and Brca1f/f;Cobra1f/f (Dff). Brca1 knockout (BKO), meaning MMTV-cre;Brca1f/f. Cobra1 knockout (CKO), meaning MMTV-cre;Cobra1f/f. Brca1 and Cobra1 double knockout (DKO), meaning MMTV-cre;Brca1f/f;Cobra1f/f

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from CD24+ sorted primary mammary epithelial cells from three time points in different genotypes.
