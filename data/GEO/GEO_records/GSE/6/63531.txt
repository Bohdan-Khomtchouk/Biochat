TITLE
Expression data from Caenorhabditis elegans fed with the bacterial strain Bifidobacterium animalis sbsp. lactis CECT 8145

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Modulation of gut microbiota through probiotic supplementation  is an interesting strategy to prevent obesity We use microarrays to study the global genome expression of C. elegans fed with the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis sbsp. lactis CECT 8145

DESIGN
Wild type strain N2 of C. elegans was cutured in  Nematode Growth medium (NGM, control fed) or NGM with a bacterial lawn fed of the strain B. animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145,  until reach young adult stage. Worm population were age-synchronized. RNA was isolated from each populations (control and treated) using RNAasy Kit (Qiagen) and hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays.
