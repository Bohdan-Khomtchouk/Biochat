TITLE
Adipocyte-derived Exosomal miRNAs from Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue: A Novel Mechanism for Obesity-Related Disease

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 array profiling of adipocyte-derived exosomes from obese and lean human subjects. We used miRNA arrays to profile exosomes shed from obese and lean human subcutaneous fat that was cultured for 60 minutes.
