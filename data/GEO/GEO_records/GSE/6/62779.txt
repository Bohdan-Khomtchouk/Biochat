TITLE
Genomic Screening of Testicular Germ Cell Tumors from Monozygotic Twins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic screening was performed for one family containing MZ twins with testicular germ cell tumors, in order to define alterations associated with risk of tumor development.

DESIGN
Copy number alterations were evaluated using array-CGH (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) in one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma (EC) from MZ twins. In addition, genomic alterations from the tumors and peripheral blood cells of the twins were compared to the parental genomes via their peripheral blood cells.
