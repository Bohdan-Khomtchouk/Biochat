TITLE
Bmp4-induced differentiation of EpiSCs depends on Wnt signals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to analyse the interactions between Bmp4 and Wnt at a genome-wide level in EpiSCs treated for 48 hrs with Bmp4 and/or Wnt3a in the presence of Activin and bFGF.

DESIGN
Control EpiSC were cultured in the presence of IWP2 for 48h. Cells were cultured with BMP4 with or without IWP2; Wnt3a and Wnt3a with BMP4 for 48h.
