TITLE
Identification of Gene Regulation Pattern from Lung Cancer Human Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify individual genes with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utilities in lung cancer, we performed gene expression profiling out of a broad coverage of human transcriptome using clinical patient tissues. Six RNA samples extracted from five cancerous tissues and one normal control were subjected to Affymetrix gene array analysis using Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. Data were further processed using Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console softwares. Both core-gene expression analysis and extended-gene expression analysis were performed to discover significantly regulated genes associated with lung cancer progression.

DESIGN
We used five human lung cancer samples (three primary cancer samples and two metastatic cancer samples) and one normal control to perform microarray gene expression profiling. One cancer sample (C688) was tested with matched normal control (N687), while others are unmatched samples.
