TITLE
Genome wide extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway components interaction with human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several recent studies, including ours, show that most components of signal  transduction cascades including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), that once were thought to act predominantly in cytoplasm, are in fact recruited to chromatin and are integral components of transcriptional complexes. However, their distribution along whole genome remains uncovered. Here we investigate genome wide recruitment of the ERK pathway components using chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing, ChIP-Seq.

DESIGN
Hela-S3 cells were starved for 48 hours (control) and stimulated with EGF at concentration of 100ng/mL for 20 minutes. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, chromatin isolated and subjected to ChIP reaction. Two technical replicates of ChIP reaction followed by sequencing were performed.
