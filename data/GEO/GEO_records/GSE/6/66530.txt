TITLE
ChIP-seq validation of recombinant antibodies to histone post-translational modifications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recombinant antibodies to histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), with their essentially infinite renewability, could fundamentally eliminate a major source of low reproducibility in epigenetics research. Here, we report new recombinant antibodies to trimethylated Lys4 and Lys9, respectively, on histone H3. Quantitative characterization demonstrated their exquisite specificity and high affinity, and they performed well in common epigenetics applications, including ChIP. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating recombinant antibodies to a range of histone marks, which will accelerate epigenetics research.

DESIGN
We characterized recombinant antibodies with native ChIP using HEK293 cells followed by deep sequencing.
