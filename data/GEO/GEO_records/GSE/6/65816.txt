TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of PLS-123 in OCI-Ly7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exploit targets or signaling pathways affected by PLS-123 during anti-tumor process, gene expression profiling was carried out in representative OCI-Ly7 cells treated for 24 hours.

DESIGN
OCI-Ly7 cells were treated with ibrutinib, PLS-123 or vehicle for 24 hours.
