TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of BAC36 and ORF59 deleted BAC36 during de novo primary infection of human B cells (PBMCs)

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the transcription profiles of wild type KSHV and ORF59 deleted KSHV (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) genome during early infection, till the virus establishes latent infection in human PBMCs

DESIGN
Samples from each time points were analyzed and the experiments were done in duplicate.
