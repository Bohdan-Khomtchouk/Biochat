TITLE
Gene Expression data in whole blood from 121 Puerto Rican children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Puerto Ricans are a racially admixed population, that consists of European, African and Native American ancestrie. Understanding eQTL patterns in Puerto Ricans should help us elucidate both regulation of gene expression and disease causation in racially admixed populations in general, and in Hispanic subgroups in particular.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from additional whole-blood samples collected in PaxGene tubes for the 121 study participants.
