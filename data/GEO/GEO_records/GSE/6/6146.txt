Expression data from CD34+CD38- stem cells and more differentiated CD34+CD38+ progenitor cellsmbryo

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of CD34+CD38- stem cells and more differentiated CD34+CD38+ progenitor cells were compared. Comparison of expression profiles of hematopoietic stem cells from fetal liver, umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized pheripheral blood allowed us to identify a unique set of genes with conserved expression during ontogeny. Keywords: Cell type comparison
