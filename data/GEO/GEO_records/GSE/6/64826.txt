TITLE
Expression data from H295R_GRα cells following treatment with dexamethasone or RU486

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human glucocorticoid receptor (GRα) is overexpressed at the molecular and protein level in malignant human adrenocortical cancers. A stable cell line model of GRα overexpression was established using the H295R human adrenocortical cancer cell line. The following results were obtained from gene expression profiling of H295R_GRα and H295R_Control (empty vector) cells following treatment with either a GRα agonist (dexamethasone), GRα antagonist (RU486) or vehicle (ethanol) control.

DESIGN
H295R_GRα and H295R_Control (empty vector) cells were treated in triplicate for 6 hours with dexamethasone 100 nM, RU486 100 nM or vehicle (ethanol) control.
