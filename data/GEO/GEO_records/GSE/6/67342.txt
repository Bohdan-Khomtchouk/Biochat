TITLE
Expression data of LoVo cells treated by 10mM metformin for eigher 8 or 24h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metformin is effective for prevention or treatment of various tumors. There are a lot of studies on the underlying mechanisms of metformin as respect to its anti-tumor action. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the anti-tumor effects of metformin on LoVo cells.

DESIGN
Human derived LoVo cells were treated with metformin (10mM) for 8 and 24h, and the control and treated cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.The samples were grouped as Met8h, Met24h, Con8h, and Con24h, respectively.
