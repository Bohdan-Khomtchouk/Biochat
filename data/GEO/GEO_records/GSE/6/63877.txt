TITLE
Microarray analyses of ESAM positive cells in the CD34(+) CD38(-) fraction of collagenase-treated bones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously identified endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) as a novel functional marker of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice. To examine ESAM expression in human, we analyzed diverse HSC sources using flow cytometry. From mononuclear cells of collagenase-treated human hip bones, we obtained two ESAM positive populations in CD34(+) CD38(-) fraction, referred to as ESAM(High) and ESAM(Bright). Then we conducted microarray analyses comparing gene expression signatures between these two populations.

DESIGN
Trabecular tissues of the femora were treated with collagenase IV and DNase. Mononuclear cells were collected, and CD34(+) CD38(-) ESAM(High) or ESAM(Bright) cells were sorted.
