TITLE
Reciprocal Regulation between the Circadian Clock and Hypoxic Signaling in Mammals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We propose that the clock plays an important role in fine-tuning the hypoxic response under pathophysiological conditions, which can serve as a strategy to reduce the severity of fatal hypoxia-related diseases.

DESIGN
RNA-seq  between wildtype and mutant MEF cells and Chip-seq in U2OS cells
