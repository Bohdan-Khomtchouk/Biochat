TITLE
Gene expression of APJ deficient endothelial cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Molecular pathways regulating the development of arterial and venous endothelial cells (ECs) are now well-established, but control of parallel arterial-venous (A-V) alignment is unclear. We report that arterial-venous alignment in the skin is determined by apelin receptor (APJ) expression in venous ECs.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in endothelial cells that has relationship with the deficient of APJ.  Endothelial cells were marked and isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting in Trizol.
