TITLE
Comparing effects of perfusion and hydrostatic pressure on human chondrocytes using gene profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hydrostatic pressure and perfusion have been shown to alter the chondrogenic potential of articular chondrocytes. In order to compare the effects of hydrostatic pressure plus perfusion (HPP) and perfusion (P) we investigated the complete gene expression profiles of human chondrocytes under HPP and P. A simplified bioreactor was constructed applying loading (0.1 MPa for 2 h) and perfusion (2ml) through the same piping by pressurizing the medium directly. High-density monolayer cultures of human chondrocytes were exposed to HPP or P for 4 days. Controls were maintained in static culture. Gene expression was evaluated by sequencing (RNAseq) and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. RNAseq identified similarities between the two treatments. Specifically, HPP and P increased COL2A1 expression and decreased COL1A1 and MMP-13 expression. Despite of the similarities, RNAseq revealed a list of cartilage genes including ACAN, ITGA10 and TNC, which were differentially expressed by HPP and P. Of these candidates adhesion related molecules were found to be upregulated in HPP. Both HPP and P treatment had beneficial effects on chondrocyte differentiation and decreased catabolic enzyme expression. The study provides new insight into how hydrostatic pressure and perfusion enhance cartilage differentiation and inhibit catabolic effects
