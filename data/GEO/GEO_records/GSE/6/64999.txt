TITLE
Gene regulation during differentiation of ovarian cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are regulated during differentiation of ovarian cancer stem cells, we performed whole genome micrroarray expression profiling. Human ovarinan cancer stem cell were cultivated in vitro under sphere-forming conditions, and induced to differentiate in the presence of serum upon attached plates. Total RNA extracted from cells were used for single-color microarray analyses with Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human ovarian cancer stem cells was measured before and after their differentiation in vitro
