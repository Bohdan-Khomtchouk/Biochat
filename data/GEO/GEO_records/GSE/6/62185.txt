TITLE
Sub-genomewide shRNAs constructed using an optimized selection algorithm and microRNA backbone provide stronger evidence for follow-up studies

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Sub-genomewide shRNA libraries were constructed using the current RNAi consortium constructs as well as using the DSIR (siRNA algoirthm) and a novel shRNA specific algorithm (shERWOOD). All libraries were placed into mir30 expression vectors. The shERWOOD libraries were also placed in a vector harboring an optimized mir cassette (ultramir). Each library was screened using the pancreatic cell line A385. A concensus set of essential genes identified as the set for which two shRNAs depleted in each of the libries. For these genes, a great percentage of shERWOOD seletected shRNA depleted. In addition the placement of shERWOOD selected constructs into ultramir scaffoled increased the rate of shRNA depletion for essential genes further.

DESIGN
Purpose: shRNA screens were carried out using various library construction strategies to identify the strategy that provides the best shRNA screening results. Method: Libraries were constructed using the TRC shRNA set as well as shRNAs identified using the DSIR and shERWOOD algorithms. shRNA libraries were cloned into mir30 expression vectors. shERWOOD shRNAs were also cloned into an expression vector harboring an optimized microRNA scaffold termed ultramir. Each resultant library was screened using the pancreatic cell line A385. Each library was analyzed separately to identify a set of genes where at least two shRNAs depleted. These gene sets were intersected to develop a set of essential genes. Results: The shERWOOD shRNA libraries provided the highest number depleting shRNAs for each essential gene. Further these shRNAs depleted to a greater extent than did the shRNAs from the other libraries. When shERWOOD libraries were placed into the ultramir cassette a greater number of shRNAs per essential gene depleted.
