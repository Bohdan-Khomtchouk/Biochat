TITLE
Global quadriceps skeletal muscle transcript data from fasted male BXD strains on chow or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from quadriceps skeletal muscle from fasted-state male BXD strains on Quadriceps, Chow or Quadriceps, High fat diet We used microarrays to compare the skeletal muscle expression differences across males in the BXD strain family and across two diverse diets

DESIGN
29-week-old male mice were fasted overnight (6pm-9am), anesthetized under isoflurane, and perfused, then quadriceps were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and RNEasy cleanup. Each dietary and strain cohort consisted of ~5 animals which were prepared independently then pooled evenly by Âµg RNA before the Affymetrix arrays were run.
