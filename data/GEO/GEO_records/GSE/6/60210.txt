TITLE
Human stem cell and mouse transchromosomic (hsa11) embryonic stem cell (with and without ectopic ZNF91 expression) ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the binding patterns in embryonic stem cells of KAP1 and KRAB Zinc Finger (KZNF) proteins as well as H3K4me3 DNA under several conditions. Native human stem cells. Mouse stem cells containing a transchromosomic copy of human chromosome 11, with and without the introduction of plasmids containing KRAB Zinc Finger sequences. We show that certain KZNFs are responsible for the repression of certain retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, preventing their spread across the genome.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of HESCs and mouse TC11 ESCs with ZNF91 plasmids and with empty vector plasmids. ChIP of KAP1, ZNF486, H3K4me3. At least 2 replicates of each condition.
