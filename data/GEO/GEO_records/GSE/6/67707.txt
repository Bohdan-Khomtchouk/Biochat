TITLE
Gene Array Data from p0 Mouse pup; ascending and descending aortas; fibulin-4 knockout and control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fibulin-4 plays an essential role in elastic fiber formation, though it's exact function is unclear. Mice lacking the fibulin-4 gene develop cutis laxa with thoracic aortic aneurysms and have narrowed descending aortic diamaters, dying shortly after birth. Another model that disrupt elastic fiber formation, elastin gene knockeds, are also perinatally lethal and have narrowed descending aortas but do not develop thoracic aneurysms. We hypothesized that there may be altered gene expression to explain the altered anatomy based on aortic tissue location we observed, which may provide therapeutic target(s)

DESIGN
Ascending and descending aortas of p0 mouse pups were dissected, pooled in groups of eight, and homogenized to isolate RNA and we used microarrays on the pooled samples to identify genes that had expression significantly changed.
