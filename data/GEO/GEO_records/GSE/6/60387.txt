TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the lsm4 and lsm5 mutant transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of lsm4 and lsm5 Arabidopsis mutants with their respective wild type plants grown under continous light conditions

DESIGN
lsm4 and lsm5 mutant plants were grown together with their respective wild type plants for two weeks under continuous white light at 22 degrees centigrades and the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed using RNA-seq.
