TITLE
Naïve-like Yellow-Fever specific CD8 T cells and reference CD8 T cell subsets in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Naïve-like CD8 T cells induced by the Yellow Fever Vaccine 17D were compared to the conventional subsets in total CD8 T cells Samples originate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 8 different donors vaccinated with the YF-17D vaccine

DESIGN
1'000 cells from various CD8 T cells subsets were purified by flow cytometry, from 8 vaccinees (donors d1 to d8); the subsets (cell types) include: A2/NS4b tetramer positive CCR7+ CD45RA+ CD8 T cells (A2_NS4b Naïve-like), Total Naive (CCR7+ CD45RA+), Total Tscm (CCR7+ CD45RA+ CD58+ CD95+), Total CM (CCR7+ CD45RA-) and Total Effectors (CCR7 negative).
