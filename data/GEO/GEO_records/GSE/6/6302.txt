SUMMARY
Cells must adjust their gene expression in order to compete in a constantly changing environment. Two alternative strategies could in principle ensure optimal coordination of gene expression with physiological requirement. First, the internal physiological state itself could feedback to regulated gene expression. Second, the expected physiological state could be inferred from the external environment, using evolutionary-tuned signaling pathways. Coordination of ribosomal biogenesis with the requirement for protein synthesis appears to be particularly important, since cells devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic capacity for ribosomal biogenesis. To define the relative importance of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally-expected growth rate. Gene expression followed the environmental signal according to the expected, but not the actual, growth rate. Simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and growth rate in chemostat-grown cultures further confirmed that ribosome biogenesis genes responded rapidly to changes in the environments but were oblivious to longer-term changes in growth rate. Our results suggest that the capacity to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes presented a major selection force during yeast evolution.
