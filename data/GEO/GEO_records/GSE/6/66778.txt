TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of H3K9 acetylation enrichment in hESCs and day 8 neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K9 acetylation was enriched in pluripotency genes in hESCs and in neural genes in neural progenitor cells

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9 acetylation distributions in hESCs and neural progenitor cells
