TITLE
MicroRNA profile of tumorigenic cells during formation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study designed to obtain microRNA profile of tumorigenic Sca-1+CD34+ cells during the formation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. After intranasal infection with adenovirus CRE (Ad-Cre), lung adenocarcinoma was identified pathologically in Lox-stop-lox Kras (LSL-Kras) G12D mice. Sca-1+CD34+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry and tested for the tumor-initiating ability to undergo self-renewal and differentiation. MiRNA profile was obtained from the microarray and further confirmed by qRT-PCR.The function of miRNAs was predicted bioinformatically, and miR-294 was verified to explore its relationship with tumor migration and invasion.
