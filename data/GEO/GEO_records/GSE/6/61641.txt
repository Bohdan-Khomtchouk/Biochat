TITLE
Genome-wide analysis expression of ileum samples from wild-type and iPGC-1β

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of metabolic pathway gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study is to assess mRNA level changes in metabolic genes in enterocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1β specifically in the intestine.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ileum samples from iPGC-1β mice was compared to the total RNA extracted from their wild-type littermates.
