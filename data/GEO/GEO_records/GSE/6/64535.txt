TITLE
Gene expression profiles after induced Id3 levels in A431 squamous carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previously it has been shown that Id3 can act as an apoptosis-inducer gene in immortalized human keratinocytes.  To further investigate the role of Id3 in the progression of skin cancer, the role of Id3 in A431 cells is investigated through ectopic induction of Id3. Microarray analysis is used to guide us the genes and pathways that are significantly altered after Id3 induction.

DESIGN
4 groups are included in this study, each with one sample.  There are two cell lines: A431 cells stably transfected with Id3 or control vector.  In each cell line, there are two conditions: induced and un-induced with tetracycline.
