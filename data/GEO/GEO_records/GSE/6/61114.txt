TITLE
Rapid acclimation of juvenile corals to CO2-mediated acidification by up-regulation of HSP and Bcl-2 genes

ORGANISM
Acropora millepora

SUMMARY
We compared the effect of acute (Moya et al 2012)  and chronic exposure to elevated pCO2 on gene expression in primary polyps of Acropora millepora

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome in Acropora millepora primary polyps at 380 and 750 ppm CO2 (air) after 9 days exposure
