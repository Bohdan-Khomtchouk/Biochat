TITLE
Global transcriptomic changes induced by manipulate MSH1 gene in tomato using next generation sequencing

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
apical meristem tissues from 4-week-old wild type, epiF3, MSH1 gene mutant including (mild-DR and dwarf-DR) plants were used in this experiment.

DESIGN
For each genotype, the transcriptome was sequenced with 3 biological replicates.
