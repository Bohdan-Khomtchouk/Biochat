TITLE
Identification of AGL24 downstream genes by using XVE inducible system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the transcriptional program controlled by AGL24, we took advantage of a functional estradiol-inducible AGL24 expression system in combination with microarray analysis to identify AGL24 target genes. Keywords: inducible system
