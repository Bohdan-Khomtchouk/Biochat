TITLE
Characterization of the cartilage DNA methylome in knee and hip osteoarthritis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterise the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of osteoathritis (OA) chondrocytes from both knee and hip cartilage, providing the first comparison of DNA methylation between OA and non-OA hip cartilage, and between OA hip and OA knee cartilage. The study was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Genome-wide methylation was assesed in chondrocyte DNA extracted from 23 OA hip, 73 OA knee and 21 healthy hip controls (NOF - neck of femure samples). Keywords: Methylation profiling by array

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 97 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array.
