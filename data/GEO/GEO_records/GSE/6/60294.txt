TITLE
The pH-sensing receptor OGR1 improves barrier function of CaCo-2 cells and inhibits migration in an acidic environment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
OGR1 is a pH-sensing G-protein coupled receptor involved in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation Proton activation of OGR1 increases barrier function in Caco2 cells

DESIGN
Microarray profiling was performed on OGR1 stable overexpressing Caco-2 cells during acidic pH shift
