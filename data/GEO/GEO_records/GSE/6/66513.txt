TITLE
Genome-wide occupancy of RNA polymerase II before and after heat shock in mouse cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to understand changes that occur in RNA polymerase II occupancy upon heat shock using ChIP-seq in mouse cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Pol II from control cells (no heat shock) and heat shocked cells.  Input chromatin before and after heat shock was also sequenced.
