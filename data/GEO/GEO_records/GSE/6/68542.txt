TITLE
Progesterone responsive uterine transcriptome in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that Brown Norway (BN) rats are progesterone resistant. Thus this experiment was designed to compare the transcriptomes in uterus that are altered by progesterone challenge between this strain of rat with Holtzman Sprague Dawley (HSD) rats

DESIGN
Progesterone was administered @ 40Âµg/gm body weight to the ovarectomized and 2 weeks rested females and controls received sesame oil (vehicle). Uterus were harvested after 9 hours and analyzed.
