TITLE
Effects of the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A on the gene expression program of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established transgenic mice overexpressing the histone demethyase LSD1/KDM1A under the control of Sca-1 promoter and investigated the global changes in gene expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells using a microarray- based approach.

DESIGN
We isolated mRNA from Sca-1-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells from two transgenic mice, Line 6 and Line 3, and subjected them to gene expression analysis using an Affimetrix GeneChip Array.
