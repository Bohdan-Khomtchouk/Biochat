TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-C with inducible KDM4C expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray gene expression profiling reveals that the histone H3 demethylase KDM4C transcriptionally activates the serine-glycine pathway, stress responses and genes in control of cell-cycle progression.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on total RNA isolated from three independent samples of BE(2)-C_tetoff_KDM4C cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 6 days.
