TITLE
ERbeta modulation of NFkB pathway in colon cancer cell lines SW480 and HT29

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in colon cancer cell lines SW480 and HT29 with and without stably expressed ERbeta gene, with and without 10ng/mL TNFa treatment for 2 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from colon cancer cell lines SW480 and HT29 with and without stably expressed ERbeta gene, with and without 10ng/mL TNFa treatment for 2 and 24 hours.
