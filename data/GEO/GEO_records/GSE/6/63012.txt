TITLE
Expression data from 2-3 month old brain-specific IκBα conditional knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The activation of NFkB pathway is commonly observed in many neurodegenerative disease and contributes to the disease pathogenesis. However, with hundreds of target genes expressed in the brain, the mechanism of NFkB signaling transduction pathway is bearly understood. We were interested in revealing the downstream mediators of NFkB in the brain and chose the IkBa-dificient model as our tool. IkBa is the essential negative regulator of NFkB activity and deletioon of IkBa induced NFkB hyperactivation. We used Nestin-Cre to conditionally knockout IkBa in the brain cells of neural lineage and performed the microarray to give us candidate genes.

DESIGN
Mouse hippocampi were dissected from 3 pairs of 2-3 month old IkBa brain-specific knockout animals and their littermate controls and used for RNA extraction and subsequent microarray assay
