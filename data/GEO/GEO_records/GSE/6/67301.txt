TITLE
Cbl family proteins are required to maintain the proteome homeostasis in mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR degradation is delayed in Cbl, Cbl-b double-deficient MCF10A but EGF stimulation does not enhance their growth. We performed a transcriptome analysis to gain insights into biological consequences of Cbl, Cbl-b loss in mammary epithelial cells.

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptome of MCF10A cells expressing shRNA against Cbl and Cbl-b with control shRNA-expressing cells using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0. Each sample was prepared in duplicates. Data were analyzed by GSEA.
