TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of cells isolated from human abdominal aortic aneurysms. Let-7f, a new potential circulating biomarker

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify and characterize miRNA expression in aneurysmal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and M1 and M2 macrophages isolated by laser microdissection from human AAA biopsy samples. The aim of this study was to profile (with microarray technology) miRNAs in M1 and M2 macrophages and Smooth muscle cells (SMCs), isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM). SMCs isolated from control non-aneurysmal aortas were the control group according to which data were normalized. Areas enriched in M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and smooth muscle cells were microdissected (9.8 [4.7-16.2] mm2) from two different biopsy samples of human abdominal aortic aneurysm. An area enriched in smooth muscle cells was microdissected from two biopsy samples of non aneurysmal abdominal aortas. Each microdissected samples were analyzed independently on microarray.

DESIGN
M1 and M2 macrophages and smooth muscle cells expressed in human abdominal aneurysmal aortas were each analyzed in duplicate (each isolated from different human donors of abdominal aortic aneurysm). Analysis of replicated samples of cells were performed on a second microarray. Data were normalized with smooth muscle cells isolated from human abdominal non aneurysmal aortas.
