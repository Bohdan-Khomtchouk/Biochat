TITLE
Overall gene expression comparison between antimony resistant and sensitive Leishmania donovani

ORGANISM
Leishmania donovani

SUMMARY
The mRNA expression of antimony resistant strains of Leishmania donovani was compared to the expression of the sensitive Leishmania donovani.

DESIGN
The antimony resistant and sensitive Leishmania donovani were grown in complete M199 medium with 10% FCS and Penicillin streptomycin mixture. At stationary phase (5 day culture) cells were harvested in sterile Phosphate buffered saline and used for RNA isolation.
