TITLE
Expression profiling of E14 cells overexpressing Hk2/Pkm2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: In this study, we compared transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) between normal mouse embryonic stem cell (E14) and Hexokinase2 (Hk2)/ Pyruvate Kinase M2 (Pkm2) overexpressed E14 cell. Result: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped over 4 billion sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified  28698 transcripts in 5 samples. Conclusion: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of Hk2/ Pkm2 overexpressed E14 cell transcriptomes, generated by RNA-seq technology

DESIGN
We compared transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) between normal mouse embryonic stem cell (E14) and  E14 cells over-expressing Hexokinase2 (Hk2)/Pyruvate Kinase M2 (Pkm2)
