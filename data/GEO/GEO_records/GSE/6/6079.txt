TITLE
expression comparison of wildtype lungs and hypomorphic for nmyc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
comparison of expression of wildtype lungs and lungs with hypomorphic expression of nmyc. the lungs were pooled from several biological samples. The hypomorphoic mutant was orignally published in Moens CB et al [PMID: 1577267]. this is part of a larger collection of data comparing nmyc misexpression in the lung (gain of fucntion) and protein expression in the hypomorphic lungs. Keywords: expression comparison
