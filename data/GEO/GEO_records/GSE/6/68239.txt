TITLE
Compartment-specific investigation of differential gene expression profiles in lungs with idiopathic pulmonariy fibrosis (IPF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung tissues were collected from patients with IPF undergoing lung transplantation. Non-transplanted donor lung tissue showing no evidence of interstitial lung disease served as healthy controls. Septa from different regions of the lungs were mircodissected and their RNA was subjected to microarray-analysis. RNA from 10 heathy donor tissues was pooled and used as a pooled reference. From each of the 10 IPF patients, samples were collected once from “healthy looking” (non-fibrotic) regions and from fibrotic loci.

DESIGN
Two-color design, 3 groups: one pooled healthy control sample (from n=10 patients), 10 samples from septa from normal and from fibrotic of n=10 patients.
