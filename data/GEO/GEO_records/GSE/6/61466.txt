TITLE
RNA-Sequencing analysis of the Drosophila transcriptomic response to infection by entomopathogenic nematodes and their mutualistic bacteria

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the application of next generation RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptional response of Drosophila adult flies to infection by the insect pathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and their mutualistic bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens, either separately or together. We find that Heterorhabditis and Photorhabdus differentially modulate a large number of genes, many of which participate in metabolic functions, stress responses, repression of gene transcription and neuronal activities. We have also identified Drosophila genes with potential role in nematode recognition and others with putative anti-nematode properties. These findings generate novel insights into how the host immune function is shaped to respond against nematode parasites and their associated bacteria.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of Drosophila wild-type adult flies infected with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora carrying or lacking Photorhabdus or the bacteria alone were generated at 12 and 30 hours post infection using Illumina deep sequencing technology.
