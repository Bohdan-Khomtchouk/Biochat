TITLE
Expression analysis of Listeria monocytogenes LO28 delta-lhrC1-5 mutant and LO28 wt

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Listeria monocytogenes LO28 delta-lhrC1-5 mutant, compared to the wild type strain. The lhrC1-5 genes encode the regulatory sRNAs LhrC1-5. The microarray studied the gene expression of unstressed cells and cells exposed to cefuroxime for 30 min. The lhrC1-5 mutant employed in this study is further described in Sievers et al. (2014) A multicopy sRNA of Listeria monocytogenes regulates expression of the virulence adhesin LapB. Nucleic Acids Res. 42:9383-98.
