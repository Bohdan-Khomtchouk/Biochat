TITLE
Ex vivo mouse model for hepatic schistosomiasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An ex vivo approach to studying hepatic schistosomiasis used thick naive mouse liver sections and sterile culturing. This tissue is unfixed, unfrozen, and alive for subsequent in vitro studies. We have cultured and monitored these sections for up to 48 hrs noting unchanged gross hepato-cellular morphology, and no significant increases in hepatotoxicity as demonstrated by media liver enzyme concentrations. Liver slices were treated with soluble egg antigen from Schistosoma japonicum eggs and cultured for 48hrs. Transcriptional changes were then analysed by microarray.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile of the naive mouse liver slices cultered with and without the additional of soluble egg antigen (SEA) from Schistosoma japonicum eggs. Microarray analysis was performed on cRNA synthesised from total RNA. The liver of female 6 week old C57BL/6 mice were removed and then sectioned at 250um thickness using a  vibrotome. Sections were cultered at 37oC and 5%CO2 in in Williamâ€™s Medium E containing 25 mM glucose, 10 mg/ml gentamycin and 10% FBS. SEA was added at 10ug/ml and sections sampled at timepoints 0, 4hr, 24hr and 48hrs. Illumina mouse ref8_V2 arrays were used and fold changes compared to whole intact, precut tissue.
