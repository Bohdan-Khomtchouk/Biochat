TITLE
MLL1 and MLL fusion proteins play distinct roles in regulating MLLleukemic transcription program [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the epigenetic profiling change of 1.) Mll1,  WDR5 and H3K4me2 in mouse MAF9 leukemia cells treated with or without MM401; 2.) WDR5 and H3K4me2 epigenetic profiling in MLL1 flox/flox, ER-Cre+/- cells with knocking out MLL1 by 4OHT or not.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profile of Mll1, WDR5 and H3K4me2 were generated in MAF9 cells or MLL1 flox/flox, ER-cre+/- cells. A sequence profile of genomic DNA (Input) is also included.
