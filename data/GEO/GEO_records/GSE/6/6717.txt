TITLE
Mycoplasma gallisepticum Rlow attached to MRC-5 cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mycoplasma gallisepticum str. R

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes important to the interaction of Mycoplasma gallisepticum with host cells in an in vitro system.  An interaction time of one hour was chosen since it is less than a generation time and thus all changes can be attributed to transcriptional changes.  A total of 60 transcripts were determined to be significantly up- or down-regulated under these conditions, including several hypothetical genes.  Also several metabolism-related genes and ATP synthase genes were significantly down-regulated. Keywords: transcriptional response to host cells
