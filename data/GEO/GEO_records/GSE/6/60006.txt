TITLE
Genome-wide maps of HES1 binding-site in human chondrogenic cell.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Notch signaling modulates skeletal formation and osteoarthritis (OA)  development through induction of catabolic factors. Here we examined functional roles of Hes1, the representative downstream transcription factor of Notch signaling, during these processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified resposive  elements of Hes1 around  gene loci of Mmp13 and Adamts5, which were  catabolic enzymes of cartilage matrix.

DESIGN
Examination of  HES1 binding site in human chondrogenic SW1353 cells.
