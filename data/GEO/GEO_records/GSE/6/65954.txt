TITLE
Gene expression profiling of IOERT exposed MCF10A breast epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intraoperative Electron Radiation Therapy (IOERT) is a therapeutic technique that delivers a single high dose of ionizing radiation (IR) directly to the tumor bed during cancer surgery. The main goal of IOERT is to counteract tumor growth by acting on residual cancer cells in the site at high risk for recurrence as well as to preserve healthy surrounding tissue from the side effects of radiation therapy. The high IR dose used during IOERT treatment induces a strong stress response resulting in the activation of pro- and anti-proliferative cell signaling pathways in both tumor and normal cells. The radiobiology of healthy tissue response to IR is a topic of interest which may contribute to avoid the impairment of normal tissue/organ function and to decrease the risks of secondary cancers. In this study, we examined changes in gene expression in MCF10A breast epithelial cell line exposed to 9Gy and 23Gy high single dose of IR delivered by IOERT.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in MCF10A breast epithelial cell line exposed to 9Gy and 23Gy high single dose of IR (named MCF10A_9Gy and MCF10A_23Gy respectively), were analyzed as two-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies whole human genome 4x44K microarrays
