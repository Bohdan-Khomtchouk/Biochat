TITLE
Liver expression data from 1 week old mouse portal tracts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intrahepatic biliary and arterial development proceed with complex orchestrations involving Notch, TgfB, Wnt and Vegf signaling within the portal tracts of the liver.  These pathways coordinate morphogenesis and remodeling temporally and spatially from mid-gestation through early postnatal life.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to examine changes in remodeling/differentiation programs in portal tracts at 1 week postanally, comparing Jag1+/-Rfng+/- and controls.
