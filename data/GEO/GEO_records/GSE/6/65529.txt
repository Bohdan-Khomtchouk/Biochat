TITLE
Single cell analysis of macrophages exposed to beads coated with LPS from Salmonella enterica subsp. typhimurium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present a detailed single cell analysis of the macrophage response to LPS from Salmonella enterica.  By combining single cell transcriptional analysis, fluorescently labeled, LPS-coated beads, and cytometry we are able to distinguish the responses of macrophages that have internalized LPS-coated beads and those that have not.

DESIGN
Analysis of 96 single macrophages that were either: left untreated, were exposed to but did not internalize uncoated beads, were exposed to and internalized uncoated beads, were exposed to but did not internalize LPS-coated beads, or were exposed to and did internalize LPS-coated beads.
