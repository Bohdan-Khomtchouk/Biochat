TITLE
Transcriptomic response of bovine dermal fibroblasts to lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We report the responsiveness of bovine dermal fibroblasts to lipopolyssacharide (LPS) within individuals at different ages. Cultures were collected from three different heifers at the ages of approximately 5 and 16 months. Isolated fibroblasts were then exposed to LPS to determine whether there was a differential response within an animal based upon age.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts were isolated from 3 cows at the ages 5 months and 16 months. Isolated fibroblasts were treated with LPS for 0 hrs, 2 hrs, and 8 hrs.
