TITLE
Comparison between gene expression in heart from Lmna H222P homozygous and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present research is devoted to the identification of gene(s) severely affected by LMNA mutations, leading to striated muscle laminopathies and more specifically the cardiomyopathy. For this purpose, we developped a large-scale gene expression approach on heart and skeletal tissues from Lmna H222P heterozygous Knock-In mouse model. Keywords: disease state modification
