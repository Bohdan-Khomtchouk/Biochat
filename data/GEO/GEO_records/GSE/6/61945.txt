TITLE
Human fetal pancreas transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the transcriptional programs that underlie pancreas differentiation and identity, we have generated genome-scale expression profiles by RNA-seq from human embryonic stem cell derived liver progenitors and human fetal pancreatic tissue (days 54-57 post conception).  These samples were compared to those already published transcriptomes (Xie et al., 2013).  Together, these samples were used to perform principles compotent analysis.  Once this was performed, we were able to identify transcription factors that were important in the identity of each cell type.

DESIGN
To generate genome-scale expression profiles by RNA-seq from human embryonic stem cell derived liver progenitors and human fetal pancreatic tissue (days 54-57 post conception), total RNA was isolated from human embryonic stem cell derived liver progenitors and frozen human fetal pancreas.  Libraries were sequenced and mapped to the hg19 version of the human genome.  Gene expression was determined using Sailfish. These samples were compared to those already published transcriptomes (Xie et al., 2013).  Together, these samples were used to perform principles compotent analysis.
