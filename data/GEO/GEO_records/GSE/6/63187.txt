TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of three wine yeast strains duting their response to nitrogen availability

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A time-course transcriptomic experiment was performed in three geographically different wine yeast strains in order to test differences in gene expression as response to different nitrogen availability

DESIGN
mRNA amounts for different wine yeast strains at different nitrogen availability was determined along the fermentation of a syntethic must. mRNA determinations were made at different fermentation stages (12, 24, 36 and 96 h after innoculation) Please note that there are two replicates per each stage (i.e. two raw data files per each sample; R1.txt and R2.txt) and the data were combined to generate the normalized data for each stage (i.e. sample).
