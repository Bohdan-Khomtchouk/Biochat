TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana shoots at 10 DAG; pSHR:SHR-GR in shr-2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in the shoot after SHR induction by DEX.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to identify new target genes of SHR and the effect of SHR on growth and development of the Arabidopsis shoot system by global transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
Five-condition experiments: Control, DEX3hr, DEX6hr, DEX12hr and DEX24hr  Biological replicates: 2 Control, 2 DEX3hr, 2 DEX6hr, 2 DEX12hr and 2 DEX24hr
