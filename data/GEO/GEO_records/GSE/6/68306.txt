TITLE
miR-193a-3p is a key tumor-suppressor in ulcerative colitis-associated colon cancer and promotes carcinogenesis through regulation of IL17RD.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer although mechanisms remain poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the role of miRNAs in neoplasia development in this high-risk population

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue from  controls (n=12), UC without neoplasia (UC, n=9), UC-associated neoplastic tissue (UCN, n=10; HGD-4, CRC-6) and adjacent tissue (n=9). miRNA array analysis was performed using the Nanostring nCounter System v1
