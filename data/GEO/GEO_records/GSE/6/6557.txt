TITLE
A genome wide role for CHD remodeling factors and Nap1 in nucleosome disassembly

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Chromatin remodeling factors and histone chaperones were previously shown to cooperatively affect nucleosome assembly and disassembly processes in vitro. Here we show that S. pombe CHD remodellers, Hrp1 and Hrp3 physically interact with the histone chaperone Nap1. Genome wide analysis of Hrp1, Hrp3 and Nap1 occupancy, combined with nucleosome density measurements in respective mutants revealed that the CHD factors and Nap1 co-localized in particular to promoter regions where they remove nucleosomes near the transcriptional start site. Hrp1 and Hrp3 also regulate nucleosome density in coding regions where they have redundant roles to stimulate transcription. Previously, DNA replication dependent and independent nucleosome disassembly processes have been described. We found that nucleosome density increased in the hrp1 mutant in the absence of DNA replication. Finally, regions where nucleosome density increased in hrp1, hrp3 and nap1 mutants also showed nucleosome density and histone modification changes in HDAC and HAT mutants. Thus, this study revealed an important in vivo role for CHD remodellers and Nap1 in nucleosome disassembly at promoters and coding regions, which are linked to changes in histone acetylation.
