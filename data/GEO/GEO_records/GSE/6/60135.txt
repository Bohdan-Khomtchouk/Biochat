TITLE
Gene-expression profiles of BMP signaling-affected SK-OV-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are extracellular signaling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily. By regulating target gene transcription, BMPs control various cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration. In addition, rBMP2 was used to observe BMP signaling in treatment of ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3. We attempted to address the possible roles of BMP signaling by inhibiting a wide-range of downstream pathways using a small molecule inhibitor of type I BMPRs, dorsomorphin. The potential utility of this molecule as a molecular inhibitor of BMP signaling in treatment of ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3 was also evaluated.

DESIGN
SK-OV-3 cells were incubated in 12 separate culture dishes, 3 dishes with PBS, 3 dishes with recombinant BMP2 (rBMP2) (100 ng/ml), 3 dishes with DM (5 μM) and 3 dishes with recombinant BMP2 (rBMP2) (100 ng/ml) plus DM (5 μM) in the culture medium for 24 hours prior to the analysis.
