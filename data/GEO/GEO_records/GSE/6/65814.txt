TITLE
Identification of Liver Receptor Homologue-1 (LRH-1)-regulated genes in HT29 colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor which has been implicated in the growth and development of breast, pancreatic and colorectal cancers (CRC). In order to identify novel LRH-1-regulated genes in CRC cells, we performed gene expression profiling following siRNA-mediated LRH-1 silencing in the CRC cell line HT29.

DESIGN
HT29 cells were transfected with LRH-1 siRNA #1, #2, or with a non-targeting siRNA (siLUC) for 24 hours. Following assessment of RNA integrity, four biological replicates for each siRNA treatment were used for microarray analysis.
