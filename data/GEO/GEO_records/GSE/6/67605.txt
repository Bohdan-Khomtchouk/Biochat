TITLE
MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) reveals DsrA sRNA targetome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
DsrA regulatory RNA represses both hns and rbsD mRNAs through distinct mechanisms in Escherichia coli

DESIGN
Identification of RNAs co-purified with MS2-DsrA in a rne131 Î”dsrA strain. DsrA (without MS2) was used as control
