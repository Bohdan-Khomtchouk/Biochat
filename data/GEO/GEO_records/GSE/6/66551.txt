TITLE
Nuclear orphan receptor TLX affects gene expression in pancreatic beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Illumina’s digital gene expression (DGE) system, we investigated the transcriptional response to TLX overexpression in beta cells. Finally, an average of 13,791,918 and 12,476,623 reads of high quality clean tags were obtained from control and TLX-overexpressing beta cells, respectively. Results reveals that overexpression of TLX resulted in suppression of 176 genes by ≥50%, and also results in ≥2-fold upregulation of 49 genes.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of stable TLX overexpressing MIN6 cells and control cells by high throughput sequencing
