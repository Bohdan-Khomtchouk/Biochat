TITLE
HUVEC Gene Regulation by Histidine-Rich Glycoprotein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HRG is a 75kDa heparin-binding protein non to extert gene regultaion changes on macropahges. To assess the effect of HRG on Enodothelial Cell gene regulation Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were treated with Histidine-Rich Glycoprotein (HRG) 24 hour treatment with HRG. and examined for gene regulation changes versus untreated HUVECs after 6 and

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples were analysed. HUVECs were treated with HRG (1ug/ml) or PBS (control) in culture for 6 and 24 hours after treatment in duplicate.
