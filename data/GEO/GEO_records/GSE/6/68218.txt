TITLE
The transcirptional effect of CtrA depletion in S. meliloti

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
We wanted to test the effect on global gene expression of depleting the essential cell cycle regulator CtrA in order to determine the genes both indirectly and directly transcriptionally regulated by CtrA Gene expression changes in S. meliloti 1,2,4 and 6 hours post CtrA depletion
