TITLE
Genome distribution of binding sites of ScbR and ScbR2 in Streptomyces coelicolor

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
By ChIP-seq of ScbR and ScbR2 binding sites across M145 chromosome, 143 and  492 peaks of ScbR and ScbR2 were identified, respectively. And they shared numurous same sites.

DESIGN
Oversee binding sites distribution of ScbR at 30h and of ScbR2 at 42h across the genome
