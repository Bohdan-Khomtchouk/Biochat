TITLE
Development of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures for mouse glioma-initiating cells (GICs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify a novel miRNA that is aberrantly expressed in GICs, we analyzed differences in miRNA expression between the mouse GICs, NSCL61 and OPCL61, showing characteristic features of cancer stem cell, and their parental cells by miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
neural stem cells, glioma-initiating cells (GICs) from neural stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, glioma-initiating cells (GICs) from oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
