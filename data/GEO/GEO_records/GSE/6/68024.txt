TITLE
transcript modification by myb1 interactants-MYB1â€™s partners

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-14_myb1 - transcript modification by myb1 interactants - Transcription modification produced by transgenes - We produced 5 transgenic lines, overexpressing Eg MYB1,Eg MYB1+ EgOVATE, EgMYB1+EgHISTONE, EgHISTONE, EgOVATE and the CONTROL with the empty vectors. We have 2 lines of each construction. Plants were grown in short day conditions and we sampled the inflorescence stem.

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - normal vs transgenic comparaison
