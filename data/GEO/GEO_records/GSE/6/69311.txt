TITLE
Yap and Taz in Neural Crest play a Crucial Role in Smooth Muscle Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conditionally knocked out both Yap and Taz in cranial neural crest (CNC) using the Wnt1Cre driver and sequenced mRNA from embryonic day 10.5 mandibles.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA level in E10.5 mandibular tissues from control and Wnt1Cre Taz and Yap dKO mutant.
