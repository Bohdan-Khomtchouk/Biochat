TITLE
Molecular Mechanisms of Early Response in Adaptive Cerebral Arteriogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study aims at a comprehensive understanding of the genomic program activated during early-phase of collateral vessel growth in a rat model for cerebral adaptive arteriogenesis (3-VO). While arteriogenesis constitutes a promising therapeutic concept for cerebrovascular ischemia, genomic profiles essential for therapeutic target identification were analysed solely for collateral arteries of the heart and periphery. Despite challenging anatomical conditions of the brain the 3-VO model allows identification of differentially expressed genes during adaptive cerebral arteriogenesis by selective removal of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Keywords: early response time course, selective collateral growth, brain
