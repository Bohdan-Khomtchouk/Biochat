TITLE
Differential gene expression in Lrig1null duodenal tumors compared to normal duodenum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (Lrig1) is a pan-ErbB negative regulator and intestinal stem cell marker downregulated in many malignancies. Over 91% Lrig1-CreERT2/CreERT2 (Lrig1-/-) mice developed duodenal adenomas, providing the first in vivo evidence Lrig1 acts as a tumor suppressor. We thus characterize the differential expressing transcripts in these duodenal adenomas to explore the pathegenesis. Elevated expression of the Egfr ligands was detected in adenomas compared to adjacent normal tissue. These adenomas also expressed the gastric-specific genes Gastrokine1 and Mucin5ac, indicating gastric metaplasia. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from proximal adenomas as well as adjacent normal tissue and wildtype proximal duodenum. These data are used to obtain 679 upregulated and 874 downregulated transcripts in tumors.

DESIGN
Total RNA from matched duodenal tumors or adjacent normal or wildtype duodenum was isolated with Rneasy (with Dnase digestion)  and used to probe the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST chip; the probe was prepared with Ambion Expression Target preparation Kit P/N 4411974.
