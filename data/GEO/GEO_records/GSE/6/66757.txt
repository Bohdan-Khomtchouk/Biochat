SUMMARY
The present work focuses on global gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in rhesus monkey infants with HFMD induced by CA16 infection at different time points. Genome-wide expression and analysis were performed by using Agilent whole genome microarrays and established bioinformatics tools. 931   signiÔ¨Åcantly differentially expressed genes associated with 5 gene ontology categories, including cell communication, cell cycle, immune system process, regulation of transcription and metabolic process were identified. Subsequently, by mapping genes related to immune system process on KEGG pathways, the predominance of inflammation mediate by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway and interleukin signaling pathway emerged. Ultimately, co-expression genes and their networks were analysised.

DESIGN
Coxsackievirus A16 infection induced gene expression in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured at 7-1st dpi, 3-2nd dpi, 7-2nd dpi, 14-2nd dpi.  Three samples from two experiment donors and one control donor were performed at each time. To exclude the individual difference, mix the two experiment samples at each time, and mix the two control samples.
