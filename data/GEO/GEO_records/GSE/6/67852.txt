TITLE
Genome-wide maps of BAF180 and REV-ERBα binding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide cistromes of BAF180 subunit of the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex in mouse liver at CT10 and CT22. In addition, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis on REV-ERBα in WT and  SRC-2-/- mouse liver at CT10. We found circadian oscilation of BAF180 chromatin recruitment in mouse liver with peak recruitment at CT22 and nadir at CT10. Further,REV-ERBα chromatin recruitment was significantly reduced in SRC-2-/- mouse liver compared to WT mice at CT10.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for BAF180 was performed in WT mice liver at CT10 and CT22 using two different antibodies. ChIP-Seq for REV-ERBα was performed in WT and SRC-2-/- mice in liver at CT10 with biological replicates.
