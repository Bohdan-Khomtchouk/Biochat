TITLE
Sox9 controls self-renewal of oncogene targeted cells and links tumor initiation and invasion [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox9 is a transcription factor expressed in most solid tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Sox9 function during tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, using a genetic mouse model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most frequent cancer in human, we show that Sox9 is expressed from the earliest step of tumor formation in a Wnt/Î²-catenin dependent manner. Deletion of Sox9 together with the constitutive activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling completely prevents BCC formation and leads to a progressive loss of oncogene expressing cells. Transcriptional profiling of oncogene expressing cells with Sox9 deletion, combined with in vivo ChIP-sequencing uncovers a cancer-specific gene network regulated by Sox9 that promotes stemness, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and cytoskeleton remodeling while repressing epidermal differentiation. Our study identifies the molecular mechanisms regulated by Sox9 that links tumor initiation and invasion.

DESIGN
Basal interfolicular cells expressing SmoM2 in presence or absence of Sox9 were FACS isolated and RNA was extracted before being hybridized Affymetrix microarrays. We then obtained a genes of list deregulated in absence of Sox9 by comparing Sox9 wild type and conditional knock-out SmoM2 expressing cells.
