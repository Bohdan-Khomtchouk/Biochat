TITLE
Expression data from renal cancer xenograft tumor treated with sunitinib or vehicle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established 3 types of primary xenograft models (KURC;Kyoto University Renal Cancer-1,2,3) derived from human renal cell carcinoma tissues, and 40 mg/day of sunitinib was orally administered. We performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profile of sunitinib-treated primary xenograft tumors (sensitive or resistant status) with that of vehicle-treated.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from KURC1,2,3 xenograft tumors treated with sunitinib or vehicle. Forty mg/day of sunitinib was orally administered once a day, and KURC1 and KURC3 developed resistance to sunitinib.
