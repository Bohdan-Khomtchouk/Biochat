TITLE
BRACHYURY orchestrates distinct mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks in differentiating human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor BRACHYURY (T, BRA) is one of the first markers of gastrulation and lineage specification in mammals. Despite its wide use and importance in stem cell and developmental biology, its genomic targets are largely unknown. Here, we used differentiated human embryonic stem cells to study the role of BRA in Bmp4-induced mesoderm and Activin-induced endoderm progenitors by ChIP-seq. We show that BRA has distinct genome-wide binding landscapes in these two populations. Our data illuminate the function of BRA in the context of human embryonic development and show that the regulatory role of BRA is context-dependent.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of BRACHYURY (T, BRA) in two cell types: endoderm and mesoderm progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells after 36 hours of growth in chemically-defined media (described in Bernardo et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2011, 9:144-155). Input DNA samples are included as a control.
