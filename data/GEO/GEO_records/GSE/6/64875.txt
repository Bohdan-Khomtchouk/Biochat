TITLE
Global re-wiring of p53 transcription regulation by the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As HBx has been reported to interact with p53 and alter the recruitment of p53 to its binding sites, we would like to identify p53-associated genes that were deregulated by HBx. We employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes that were deregulated by HBx protein.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transduced with recombinant HBx and control adenoviruses 24 hours post seeding. HepG2 cells were treated with UVC (254 nm) irradiation 48 hours postransduction and harvested 24 hours after UV irradiation. Experiements were conducted with three biological replicates.
