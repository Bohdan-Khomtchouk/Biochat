TITLE
Genome wide analysis of AR binding sites and histone modifications in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation.We performed ChIP-seq analysis to investigate the role of AR and histone modifications.In addition, by siRNA mediated knockdown of AR-associated factors, changes of AR-binding sites in prostate cancer cells were analyzed..

DESIGN
ChIP-sequence analysis of AR and its associated factors in prostate cancer cells
