TITLE
Genome-wide localization maps of JMJD1A, SWI/SNF components, and PPARγ in brown adipocytes treated with isoproterenol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed ChIP-seq profiles for H3K4me3, H3K27ac, BRG1, ARID1A, PPARγ and JMJD1A and FAIRE-seq open chromatin profile in immortalized brown adipocytes (iBATs) treated with 1 μM isporoterenol (ISO) or vehicle for 2 hr

DESIGN
ChIP-seq profiles for H3K4me3, H3K27ac, BRG1, ARID1A, PPARγ and JMJD1A and FAIRE-seq open chromatin profile in iBATs at Day 8 of differentiation treated with 1 μM isporoterenol (ISO) or vehicle for 2 hr
