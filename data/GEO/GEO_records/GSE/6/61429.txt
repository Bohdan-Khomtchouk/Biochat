TITLE
Effect of sodium butyrate on colorectal cancer cell line HT-29

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HT-29 treated with Sodium Butyrate. Sodium Butyrate, a HDAC inhibitor present in gut, can differentiate the undifferentiated HT-29 to enterocytes by the induction of brush border enzyme alkaline phosphatase.  Results provide the transcriptional profiling underlying the butyrate-induced differentiation of CRC.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Butyrate treated vs. untreated HT-29 cells. Two Time points: 24 hours and 48 hours. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, two 24 hours butyrate treated replicates  and two 48 hours butyrate treated replicates.
