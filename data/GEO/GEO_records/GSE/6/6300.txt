TITLE
Expression data from eye antennal imaginal disc expressing either activated Ras or secreted Spitz

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to identify genes expressed and required for the second mitotic wave (SMW) during eye development. Eye discs expressing Spitz under the control of GMR Gal4 have no SMW as Spitz promotes G1 arrest, ectopic differentiation also occures. To control for the ectopic differentiation, Spi expressing eye antennal discs were compared to eye antennal discs expressing activated RasV12. In discs expresseding RasV12 under the control of GMRGal4 the SMW takes place normally prior to any ectopic differentiation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: Comparison of eye antennal discs of two different over expression genotypes
