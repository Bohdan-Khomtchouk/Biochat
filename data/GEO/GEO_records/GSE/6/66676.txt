TITLE
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genomic landscape of hepatic tissue affected by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in severely obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery is unknown.  Our purpose here was to uncover genomic profiles of obese controls, and obese cases with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), borderline nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in order to clarify molecular functions, biological processes, and pathways that are dysregulated in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the severely obese adolescent. In a prospective observational cohort study, we have intra-operatively obtained 165 liver samples; of these 67 were submited for microarray analysis.  Through ANOVA, we found 8648 genes with differential regulation between the four histologies; from these, we uncovered gene signatures shared between borderline and definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and gene sets with differential effects between borderline and definite.

DESIGN
Prospective observational cohort study, where liver biopsies were obtain intra-operatively and submitted for Human Gene St 1 microarray.
