TITLE
Expression data from Hes1 conditional knock-out NOTCH1-induced leukemias

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To formally address the biological activity of Hes1 in vivo, we tested the interaction between oncogenic NOTCH1 and acute Hes1 loss in a retroviral-transduction bone marrow transplantation model of NOTCH-induced T-ALL Forced expression of activated NOTCH1 in this model typically results in full leukemia transformation 5-10 weeks later.

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression analysis of Hes1 wild type and Hes1-/- NOTCH1 induced leukemias
