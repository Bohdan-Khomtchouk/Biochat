TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of neonatal mouse cochlear hair cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined transcripts that are enriched in neonatal mouse cochlear hair cells. Hair cells were purified by FACS sorting for GFP fluorescence from the cochleas of transgenic mice in which the endogenous Atoh1 gene was fused with GFP

DESIGN
Two replicates of GFP+ hair cells were compared with all other cochlear cell types that were GFP-
