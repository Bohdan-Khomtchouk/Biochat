TITLE
Human transcripts up-regulated in the human mesenchymal stem cells migrated within the rat synovium; rat transcripts up-regulated in the rat synovium after human mesenchymal stem cells injection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
After the injection of human synovial mesenchymal stem cells into the rat (Lewis strain) knee joint, synovium was investigated using species specific microarray analyses of human and rat transcripts to investigate the gene expression change after injection.

DESIGN
Human synovial mesenchymal stem cells were injected into the rat anterior cruciate ligament transected knee. After harvesting the synovium and extraction of RNA, species specific microarray analyses were performed uisng Affymetrix microarrays to investigate the gene expression change of human and rat transcripts after injection.
