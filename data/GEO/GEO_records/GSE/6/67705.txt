TITLE
Methylome-wide analysis of chronic HIV infected patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Current therapy has turned HIV infection into a chronic condition. Clinically, some patients suffer prematurely from ailments associated with advanced age; however, the relationship between HIV and aging is unclear. Here we have collected a large cohort of HAART treated HIV+ subjects with both recent and chronic infection and recapitulated the shared phenotype of HIV and age. To further understand this signal, we applied validated models of DNA methylation-based biological age to establish a clear link between HIV infection and molecular age advancement. We then show this result to be robust to HIV duration, cellular composition, and general methylome disorder. Finally we show a pattern of hypomethylation in HIV+ individuals at the HLA locus. Together these results lead to a much-needed better understanding of the epigenetic consequences and gerontological aspects of chronic HIV infection.

DESIGN
To determine whether HIV is associated with signs of aberrant biological aging, samples of whole blood were collected from HIV-infected, HAART-treated but otherwise healthy non-Hispanic white males (no hepatitis C co-infection, no diabetes, and strict adherence to therapy) and healthy non-Hispanic white male controls. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genome-wide methylation profiles of each sample were determined using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. As a validation, a second cohort of subjects was profiled by flow-sorting cells and measuring methylation in pure-cell populations. Data were normalized and controlled for quality using standard techniques. Please note that the following samples were excluded from the data processing by quality control steps; METI-6 METI-7 352_CD4 381_CD4 however, their raw data was provided so that the full pipeline could be reproduced.
