TITLE
H. pylori strain content variation after five year infection of macaques measured by array CGH

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori strains USU101 was infected into macaques, some of which were treated with the dietary carcinogen ENNG. After 5 years, H. pylori isolates were obtained by endoscopy followed by culture. The resulting strains were analyzed for differences in gene content by array CGH.

DESIGN
Array CGH was performed by two color microarray. The monkey output strains were labeled with Cy5 (channel 2) and the input strain USU101 was labeled with Cy3 (channel 1). Each output strain was analyzed by 2-3 separate array experiments.
