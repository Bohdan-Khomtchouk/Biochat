TITLE
Expression data from HELA cells subject to EGF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HELA cells derived from human cervical tumor were subjected to EGF stimulation for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes. We used microarrays to understand the temporal regulation of the cellular EGFR cascade. Keywords: time course
