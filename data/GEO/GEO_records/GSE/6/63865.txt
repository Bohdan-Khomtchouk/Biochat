TITLE
Endogenous DAF-16 genome-wide recruitment under low Insulin signaling condition in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to understand the complexity of gene regulation downstream of IIS, we used anti-DAF-16 antibody, we report the first genome-wide ChIP-sequencing study of endogenous DAF-16 recruitment  in daf-2(e1370). We also report the average bin-wise normalized read count of ZFP-1 and DAF-16 on DAF-16 summits

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profile of DAF-16 in mix stage
