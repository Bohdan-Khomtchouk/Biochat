TITLE
IFNγ signaling endows DCs with the capacity to control type I inflammation during parasitic infection through promoting T-bet+ regulatory T cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of IFNγ-insensitive DCs IFNγ signaling drives dendritic cells (DCs) to promote type I T cell (Th1) immunity. Here, we show that activation of DCs by IFNγ is equally crucial for the differentiation of a population of T-bet+ regulatory T (Treg) cells specialized to inhibit Th1 immune responses. Conditional deletion of IFNγ receptor in DCs but not in Treg cells resulted in a severe defect in this specific Treg cell subset, leading to exacerbated immune pathology during parasitic infections. Mechanistically, IFNγ-unresponsive DCs failed to produce sufficient amount of IL-27, a cytokine required for optimal T-bet induction in Treg cells. Thus, IFNγ signalling endows DCs with the ability to efficiently control a specific type of T cell immunity through promoting a corresponding Treg cell population.

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 WT DC samples and 3 IFNγR2 KO DC samples isolated from unmanipulated mice. In addition, we analyzed 3 WT DC samples and 3 IFNγR2 KO DC samples isolated from mixed BM chimeras (WT + IFNgR2KO) day 8 T. gondii infected.
