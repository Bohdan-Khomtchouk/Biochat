TITLE
Identification of IL-22 regulated genes in the ileum after infection with Toxoplasma gondii

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-22 acts on epithelial cells and has been shown to induce tissue protective and wound healing responses in these cells. But it has recently been decribed that IL-22 exacerbates ileatis after infection with T. gondii. The goal of the study is to identify the IL-22-dependent genes during T. gondii infection in order to understand why IL-22 is pathogenic in this context.

DESIGN
one experimental condition, 5 mice per group, 2 groups: WT and IL-22 KO animals
