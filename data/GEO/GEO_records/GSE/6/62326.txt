TITLE
Gene expression profiles of OSCC cells and the metastatic sublines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The orthotopic transplantation of human OEC-M1 cells in immune-compromised mice was established to feasibly study tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis of OSCC. Through in vivo selection, two sublines, designated as LN1-1 and LN1-2 were successfully isolated from cervical lymph nodes and identified to originate from OEC-M1 cells.

DESIGN
Two sublines, LN1-1 and LN1-2 were established from lymph nodes of orthotopic transplantation of human OEC-M1 cells in immune-compromised mice.
