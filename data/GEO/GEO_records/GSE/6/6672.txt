TITLE
Differential gene expression in brain of the Cin85-/- mutant mouse line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cin85 is an adaptor protein independently identified as Cbl-interactin protein of 85kDA, SETA and SH3KBP1. The protein control the spatial and temporal assembly of multiprotein complexes that transmit intracellular signals that eventually controll physiological or pathological processes. Cin85 interacts with components of the synaptic vesicles. The Cin85 knock out could be a model for neuronal defects related to impaird neurotransmitter release line mental retardation, abnormal behaviour and cognitive function. The role of Cin85 in EGFR internalization might be a model for different kind of cancer. Detection of changes in gene expression levels in brain of Cin85 k.o. have been done. About 77 significantly regulated genes in brain have been found. Several of the differentially regulated genes are transcription factors, are involved in tumorigenesis, associated with neuronal functions and neurodegenerative diseases or have functions in splicing processes.
