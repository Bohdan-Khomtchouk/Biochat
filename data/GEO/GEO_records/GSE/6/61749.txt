TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of thermal adaptive E. coli (part 1)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analyses of the Escherichia coli cells acquired in the thermal adaptive evolution (Kishimoto et al, 2010, PLoS Genet) were performed. The ancestor strain (Anc) and the evolved strains (41B, 43B, 45L and 37L) were analyzed. The cells exponetially growing at the regular (37ºC) and/or evolutionary (41~45ºC) temperatures and in response to heat shock at 45ºC were collected for microarray analyses. Multiple transcriptome analyses identified the specific evolutionary direction and bias for thermal adaptation.

DESIGN
Five different strains (both the evolved cells and the ancestor) exponentially growing at regular and evolutionary temperatures and responding to heat shock were collected for the transcriptome analysis. Every 2-3 biological replications were performed.
