TITLE
Microarray analyses of the effects of prenatal metformin exposure on the gene expression profile of liver, brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue of neonatal mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to characterise the effects of prenatal metformin exposure on a tissue gene expression level in mice. The data consists of two models, regular diet (study I) and  high fat diet (study II) model. In  both models, metformin (300 mg/kg) or control agent (water) was administered to pregnant female mice from the embryonic day E0.5 untill E17.5.  In the high fat diet model, the dams had been on a high fat diet (60% of fat) for one month prior to and during the gestation. The diet was changed to regular diet from E18.5. The pups were sacrificed by decapitation at postnatal day 4 and brain (study I),  liver (studies I and II) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (study II) were taken for further microarray analyses.

DESIGN
In study I,there are 3 replicates in each group of interest: brain_male_ctrl; brain_male_met; liver_male_ctrl; liver_male_met; liver_female_ctrl; liver_female_met. In study II, there are 6 replicates in each group of interest: liver_male_ctrl; liver_male_met; wat_male_ctrl; wat_male_met.
