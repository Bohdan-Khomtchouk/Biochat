TITLE
Role of AcsR in expression of the acetly-CoA synthetase gene in Vibrio vulnificus

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus MO6-24/O

SUMMARY
VarS/A is one of the global factors regulating diverse aspects of metabolism and virulence of bacteria including pathogenic Vibrio spp. An experiment to identify VarS/A-regulon in V. vulnificus revealed that a putative LuxR-type transcriptional regulator was down-regulated in Î”varA mutant. To investigate the roles of this regulatory cascade from VarS/A to a LuxR-type regulator in V. vulnificus, the target gene regulated by a LuxR-regulator was identified and its expression was characterized.
