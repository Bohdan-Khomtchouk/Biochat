TITLE
DNA methylation analysis by RRBS in germ cells of mice exposed to Vinclozolin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide quantitative maps of cytosine methylation at single base resolution by RRBS in E13.5 primordial germ cells and adult sperm purified from mice exposed to Vinclozolin.

DESIGN
Pregnant F0 female mice were exposed to two doses (a low dose VD1=1 mg/kg bw/d and a high dose VD2=100mg/kg bw/d) of Vinclozolin in the drinking water during pregnancy. We isolated primordial germ cells at E13.5 and mature sperm from adult F1 males obtained from control and exposed mothers. For PGCs, we sequenced RRBS libraries prepared from one pool isolated from F1 embryos exposed to the low dose, one pool isolated from F1 embryos exposed to the high dose, and two control pools isolated from unexposed embryos. For sperm, we sequenced three RRBS libraries prepared from a pool of sperm isolated from F1 males exposed to the high dose, and five RRBS libraries prepared from control pools isolated from unexposed animals.
