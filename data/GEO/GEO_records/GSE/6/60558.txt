TITLE
Expression data in HT1080 cells treated with cMyc-shRNA or non-targeting control shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cMyc is a master regulator of transcription in growing cells. Here, we used microarray to study global transcriptomic expression of cMyc knockdown HT1080 cells to investigate cMyc- regulated gene expression.

DESIGN
Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were transfected with cMyc shRNA or non-targeting control shRNA followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST array.
