TITLE
Affymetrix Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array Data for p53 deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used an experimental mouse model to further evaluate whether constitutive p53 deficiency in the germ line may increase the rate of de novo CNV in the offspring. C57Bl6 mice with defined trp53 status (either +/+, +/- or -/-) were crossed with 129SvSL trp53+/+ mice and 129SvSL trp53-/- mice were crossed with C57Bl6 trp53+/+ mice.  CNV were analyzed in DNA isolated from whole F1 embryos at 17.5 days and compared with liver DNA from their parents. One out of 36 embryo from trp53+/+ parents was detected to have a potential de novo CNV.  No de novo CNV was detected in 84 embryos with a p53 deficient parent.  These observations suggest that, in this mouse model, partial or complete deficiency of p53 function in the germ line does not increase the rate of CNV formation in the offspring.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array was performed at The Jackson Lab
