TITLE
Pineal gland gene expression of 129 Wt P0 mice versus NeuroD1 pineal gene expression at P0

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study determines pineal gland gene expression levels in the NeuroD1 knockout mouse at postnatal day zero. Comparison was performed against pineal gland gene expression levels in 129 wildtype mice also disected at P0. Keywords: Comparison of wildtype versus transgenic pineal gland gene expression
