TITLE
Expression data from human nasopharynx cell line transfected with gene or empty vector.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in human nasopharynx cell line transfected with gene or empty vector.

DESIGN
human nasopharynx cell line transfected with gene or empty vector were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
