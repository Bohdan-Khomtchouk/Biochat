TITLE
Gene expression profile in sciatic nerve from presymptomatic SOD1G93A Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis animal model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses using a whole mouse genome platform were employed in the evaluation of gene expression pattern of sciatic nerves of transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice and their littermate controls at presymptomatic age of 60 days.

DESIGN
Sciatic nerve from SOD1G93A and Non transgenic controls from 60 days were used in the experiments. 4 biological replicates were used. A reference sample, comprised by RNA from different neonatal organs (heart, liver, kidney) were used in the hybridations.
