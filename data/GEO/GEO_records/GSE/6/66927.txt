TITLE
Ribo_seq (aka ribosome profiling) analysis of control and Myc-induced U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Ribo-seq to examine the effect of Myc activation on protein translation in U2OS cells and correalted these changes with alterations in RNA level measured by RNA-seq on tye same conditions. We also examined these effects in the presence of Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR

DESIGN
We measure ribosome occupancy profiles in U2OS cells containing an inducible Myc expression vector that were induced or mock-treated in duplicates for 36 hours. In addition, we repeated the experiments in the presence of Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR.
