TITLE
Musashi-2 Post-transcriptionally Attenuates Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling to Expand Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A greater understanding of the molecular pathways that underpin the unique human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal program will improve strategies to expand these critical cell types for regenerative therapies. The post-transcriptional mechanisms guiding HSPC fate during ex vivo expansion have not been closely investigated. Using shRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-2 (MSI2) is required for human HSPC self-renewal. Conversely, when overexpressed, MSI2 induces multiple pro-self-renewal phenotypes, including significant ex vivo expansion of short- and long-term repopulating cells through direct attenuation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Using a global analysis of MSI2-RNA interactions, we determined that MSI2 post-transcriptionally downregulates canonical AHR pathway components in cord blood HSPCs. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into RBP-controlled RNA networks that underlie the self-renewal process and provides evidence that manipulating such networks can provide a novel means to enhance the regenerative potential of human HSPCs expanded ex vivo.
