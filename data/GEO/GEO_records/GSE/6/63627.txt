TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of primary tumors and lung metastases using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic mammary carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we explored the molecular basis of site-specific metastasis of breast cancer to the lungs in a clinically relevant model based on the JygMC(A) cell line. In this dataset, we include expression data from JygMC(A) primary mammary tumors, lung metastases, normal mammary glands and normal lung parenchyma.

DESIGN
In total, 28 samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Partek Genomic Suite 6.6 (PGS, Version 6.6, Partek Inc.): PT vs. NMG; PT vs. LM; LM vs. NL; LM vs. NMG. Genes with an FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change > 2 were selected.
