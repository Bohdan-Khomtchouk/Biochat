TITLE
Aortic microRNA expression in germ-free mice and pathogen-free mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of microbes on microRNAs in aorta, in this study, we examined expression of microRNA in the aorta of male (10 weeks old) germ-free mice and pathogen-free mice (control).

DESIGN
We assessed global expression of microRNAs in the thoracic aorta of germ-free mice (n = 3) and pathogen-free mice (n = 3) using the Nanosting nCounter assay.
