TITLE
Transcriptome of postnatal mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study aimed at determining the differences in global mRNA expression between proliferating cardiomyocytes in the 2-day-old heart and growth arrested cardiomyocytes in 13-day-old heart of ICR mice.

DESIGN
The transcriptomic profiles of the samples at the two time points(day 2 and day 13 of postnatal stage) were analyzed by direct comparison of the transcriptional level between the two groups of heart on the same custom 12Ã—135K microarray (Roche NimbleGen)
