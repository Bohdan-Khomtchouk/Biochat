TITLE
Male and female embryonic chicken livers (arnol-affy-chick-445002)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The study is relevant to an understanding of the forces that lead to sex differences in the brain. Many neural and psychiatric diseases affect men and women differently, so the understanding of sex differences in brain function impacts on our understanding of why the male and female brain differ in their susceptibility to disease. Using Affymetrix chicken arrays, we will measure the gene expression in male and female embryonic chicken liver to compare with previous studies of brain. Gene expression differs in the male and female embryonic chicken liver.  Z-linked genes are expressed higher in males than females, in a manner similar to Z-linked genes in the brain.  The comparison of brain and liver will demonstrate which sex differences are specific to brain and which are general. 20 male and 20 female chicken embryos will serve as source of brain tissue. In late stage embryos, we will remove the liver and extract total RNA. Four birds will comprise each individual sample. Thus, we will have 5 biologically independent male samples, and an equal number of female samples. Keywords: dose response
