TITLE
RNAseq comparison of gene expression profiles in ScxGFP positive cells from E11.5, E13.5 and E15.5 hindlimb samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAs were isolated from FACS sorted ScxGFP positive cells of hindlimbs at E11.5, E13.5 and E15.5, and characterized by RNAseq

DESIGN
18 hindlimbs, 12 hindlimbs and 11 hindlimbs were pooled together for E11.5, E13.5 and E15.5, respectively.GFP positive cells were FACS sorted, then for RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation and proceeded for RNAseq
