TITLE
microRNA expression profile between KRAS/BRAF wild and BRAF mutant colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genome-wide miRNA expression analysis was performed in clinical samples, comprising 15 BRAF-mutant and 15 non-KRAS/BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers by using a SurePrint G3 Human miRNA microarray.

DESIGN
clinical samples, comprising 15 BRAF-mutant and 15 non-KRAS/BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers by using a SurePrint G3 Human miRNA microarray.
