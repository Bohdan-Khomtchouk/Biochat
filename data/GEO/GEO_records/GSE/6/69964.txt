TITLE
Human macrophages response depends on the infectious agent: is this null hypothesis (H0) an unquestionable dogma?

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The macrophage is a pluripotent activity in response to infections. We used the central position of this cell type, in an ex vivo system for studying its responses to various infectious agents. Our model is based on cellular macrophages derived from human monocytes purified from healthy individuals. We have stimulated or not the macrophages to obtain paired samples, in a naive environment. Transcriptomic analyzes of match paired and standardized data generated results showing (i) the existence of specific signatures of the infectious agent and its strategy, and (ii) the preponderant existence of macrophage responses specifically related to individuals. The null hypothesis H0, according to which the response of the macrophage is exclusively specific for the pathogen, is refuted. Our results open new perspectives in which the macrophage innate response may be intrinsically associated with the individual.

DESIGN
Two paired experimental conditions, NT vs. Treated cells. 5 experimental treatments: TbgB2/7/1; LdLDD8; LiITMAP263; LiLEM75, E0111:B4. Biological replicates: 6 Trypanosoma brucei gambiense bloodstream forms (TbgB2/7/1) Leishmania donovani LdLDD8 = MHOM/IN/80/Ldd 8, clone 2 Leishmania infantum LiITMAP263 = MHOM/MA/67/ITMAP-263, clone 2, visceral tropism Leishmania infantum LiLEM75 = MHOM/FR/78/LEM 75, clone X, cutaneous tropism E0111:B4 = lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli, Sigma)
