TITLE
Host transcriptomic analysis of THP-1 infected with Mtb and MtbΔwhiB3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the role of WhiB3 in regulating host transcriptome, THP-1 were activated with PMA and infected with Mtb and MtbΔwhiB3, host transcriptome was studied.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from THP-1 infected with Mtb and MtbΔwhiB3 and total RNA wa isolated at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h.
