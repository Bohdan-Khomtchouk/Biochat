TITLE
Genome-wide maps of the effect of butanol in P. putida BIRD1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida BIRD-1

SUMMARY
We report the application of a high-throughput technique, RNA-seq, to study the transcriptomic response of P. putida BIRD1 in the presence of butanol with the aim to study in more detail the mechanisms involved in butanol response. Our work is the first global transcriptomic analysis done in P. putida BIRD1 in the presence of butanol.

DESIGN
P. putida BIRD1 mRNA profiles in the presence of control condition (LB) and butanol (carbon source) or butanol shock.
