TITLE
Expression data from follicle associated epithelium (FAE) of small intestine in wild type  C57BL/6 mice or mice depleted with RBP-J (by VillinCre-Rbpjflox/flox)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of RBP-J in regulating epithelial cell differention in small intestine, we isolated FAE from mice depleted with RBP-J

DESIGN
FAE were isolated from mice described above. Total RNA were extracted from the tissue by QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit.
