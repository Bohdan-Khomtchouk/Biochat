TITLE
MiR-30e in Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells [Experiment 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MiR-30e represses the osteogenic program in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by targeting IGF2, and drives their differentiation into adipogenic or smooth muscle lineage, respectively.

DESIGN
In Experiment 1, SMCs were cultured from mouse aortas and transduced with miR-30e or control lentivirus. In Experiment 2, MSCs were extracted from mouse bone marrow and transduced with miR-30e or control lentivirus. In Experiment 3, the MSCs were transfected with a scrambled oligo or anti-miR-30e oligo. In all 3 experiments, N=3 per group. RNA was extracted from each experiment and run on Affymetrix arrays.
