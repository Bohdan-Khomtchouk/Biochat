TITLE
Gene expression in the mouse brain during spontaneous sleep and prolonged wakefulness

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies address temporal changes in gene expression during spontaneous sleep and extended wakefulness in the mouse cerebral cortex, a neuronal target for processes that control sleep; and the hypothalamus, an important site of sleep regulatory processes. We determined these changes by comparing expression in sleeping animals sacrificed at different times during the lights on period, to that in animals sleep deprived and sacrificed at the same diurnal time.
