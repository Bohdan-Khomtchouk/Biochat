TITLE
Expression data from mouse integration-free iPS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming process can bring in genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, and these abnormalities can endow effect on gene expression of obtained iPSCs. We used Microarray to detect obvious gene expression differences between iPS cells ,which were induced using one episomal plasmid from C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and one normal ES cell line from C57BL/6 inbred strain mice.

DESIGN
iPS cells and control ES cells were selected in early passage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To reduce the effect of in vitro culture, we chose iPS cells and ES cells in passage 7 to 10 for analysis.
