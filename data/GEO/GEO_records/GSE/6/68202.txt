TITLE
Gene expression analysis of spinal cord microglia in atopic diathesis model mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate differential gene expression pattern in atopic diathesis model mice spinal cord microglia compared to normal mice.

DESIGN
Sort microglia from atopic diathesis model mice and control mice, extract RNA and subjected to RNA array assay.
