TITLE
IHH microRNA response to genetically-reconstructed Zaire Ebola viruses [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in IHH cells infected with Zaire Ebola virus and mutants: Zaire Ebola virus: This wild-type Ebola virus - strain Mayinga - was isolated from a fatal human case in Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1976 Zaire Ebola virus, VP35 R312A possesses a R312A mutation in the VP35 protein. Zaire Ebola virus, delta sGP. Lacks the ability to produce non-structural protein, the secreted glycoprotein (sGP). Zaire Ebola virus, delta mucin.  Lacks the mucin-like domain (MLD), which contains both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites, for the glycoproteins.

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Cells: Immortalized Human Hepatocytes (IHH); seed 60,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. After infection, 3x wash with PBS and replace with 5% FCS DMEM without NaPyr or NEAA. Time matched mocks done in triplicate from same cell stock as rest of samples. Time Points = 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs post infection in triplicate.
