TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild-type and Osterix1-Cre:Hdac3 CKO BMSC-derived osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were isolated from femurs and tibias of littermate wildtype and CKO mice.  Cells were plated in osteogenic culture medium (alphaMEM, 20% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 1% non-essential amino acids, 50 ug/mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM beta glycerophosphate, 10^-7 M dexamethasone) and cultured for 7 days prior to RNA isolation.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from osteogenic cultures of BMSC grown for 7 days
