TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of hepatic target genes during thyrotoxicosis and recovery

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis showed that most positively- and negatively-regulated T3 target genes were altered by either acute or chronic stimulation, with few regulated both acutely and chronically. In addition, several target genes showed differential temporal expression patterns not only between acute vs. chronic stimulation, but also after T3 withdrawal.

DESIGN
Mice received daily intraperitoneal injection of L-T3 (liothyronine; Sigma) for 14 days, and were sacrificed 6 hours after a single L-T3 injection (acute T3) as well as 6 hours after multiple L-T3 injections (chronic T3). In parallel groups, mice treated with L-T3 for 14 days were maintained untreated for another 10 days and sacrificed on days 10 after the last (14th) L-T3 injection (T3 withdrawal). Animal experiments were performed as two subsets, with two baseline groups. Acute T3 effect was evaluated relative to “Baseline A”, whereas chronic T3 and its withdrawal were compared to “Baseline B”.
