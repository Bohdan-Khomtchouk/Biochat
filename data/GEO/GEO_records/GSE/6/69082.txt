TITLE
Gene expression signature after γklotho knockdown in HCC1395 triple negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
γKlotho is critical for the survival of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells HCC1395, since its depletion leads to decreased cell viability, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here, we compare γKlotho knockdown cells with control HCC1395 cells at gene expression level in order to get insight into the possible cellular mechanisms contributing to the sensitivity of TNBC cells to γKlotho depletion.

DESIGN
HCC1395 cells were transfected with control siRNA (siRevL1) or a pool of siRNAs targeting γKlotho and 48 h later RNA was extracted for microarray expression analysis.  Two biolgical replicates  for each siRNA-transfection were used.
