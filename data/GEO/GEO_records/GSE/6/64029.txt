TITLE
Exosomal microRNA released from primary normal BM and AML CD34+ cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an attempt to clarify the diferrence of exosomal microRNA derived from Normal BM and primary AML CD34+ cells. Primary cells  were cultured in serum free medium and supernatant was harvested. After extract microRNAs, the difference of exosomal microRNAs between normal BM and leukemia was analyzed by array.

DESIGN
Normal BM CD34+ cells was used as control (n=1). CD34+ fraction of leukemic cells (AML M1 [n=1], AML M4 [n=1]) was used as experimental samples.
