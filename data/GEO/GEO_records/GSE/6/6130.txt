SUMMARY
Determining agreement in classification between platforms and procurement methods requires a variety of methods. We have shown that centroid-based algorithms are robust classifiers for breast cancer subtype assignment across platforms (microarray and qRT-PCR data) and procurement conditions (fresh frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues). On a gene-by-gene basis, we found that the standard deviation, dynamic range, and concordance correlation coefficient are important parameters to assess individual primer set performance across procurement methods. Our strategy for primer set validation and classification have applications in routine clinical practice for stratifying breast cancers and other tumor types Keywords: reference x sample
