TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma stem-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to determine how inhibition of microRNA 10b affects gene expression in neurospheres cultures of glioblastoma stem-like cells. We used microarrays to detail the regulation of gene expression by microRNA 10b in glioblastoma.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile genes expression in three GBM stem-like cells cultures, GBM4, GBM6 and GBM8 (Wakimoto H. et al., Cancer Research, 2009, PMID19351838) 24h after transfection with miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide, or non-specific control (control 1) or transfection reagent alone (control 2).
