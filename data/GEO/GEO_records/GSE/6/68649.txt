TITLE
The expression profiles of extracellular matrix-related genes in the presence or absence of EBI3 in the PCR array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a PCR array of 84 ECM-related genes using RNA obtained from dermal fibroblasts stimulated with or without EBI3. 18 of the 84 genes were upregulated and 22 genes were downregulated in EBI3-treated fibroblasts in comparison with untreated cells.

DESIGN
In the present study, we examined the involvement of the IL-12 family cytokines in the expression of the extracellular matrix.
