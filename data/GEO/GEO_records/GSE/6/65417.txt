TITLE
Expression data from C. elegans wild type, hlh-25 mutant and hlh-29 mutant strains

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the six proteins that make up the REF-1 family are HES homologs that act in both Notch dependent and Notch-independent pathways to regulate embryonic events.  To further our understanding of how the REF-1 family works to coordinate post-embryonic cellular events, we performed transcriptome analysis of HLH-25 and HLH-29 mutant strains.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarray, including probe preparation, hybridization, fluidics run and chip scan, was performed by Georgia State University DNA/Protein Core Facility. Global gene expression in synchronized young adult populations of VC1220 (hlh-25 mutant) and tm284 (hlh-29 mutant) animals were compared to expression in N2 (wild-type) animals using GeneChip C. elegans Genome Array (Affymetrix). Data collection was carried out using GCOS 1.4 software (Affymetrix).  Probe intensity values were normalized to a target value of 500 with normalization factor equal to 1. Data analysis was performed using GeneSpring GX 11 Software (Aglient, Palo Alto,CA).
