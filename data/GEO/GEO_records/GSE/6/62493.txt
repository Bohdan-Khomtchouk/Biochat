TITLE
Inactivation of the Budding Yeast Cohesin Loader Scc2 alters Gene Expression both Globally and in Response to a Single DNA Double Strand Break [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome integrity is fundamental for cell survival and cell cycle progression. Important mechanisms for keeping the genome intact are proper sister chromatid segregation, correct gene regulation and efficient repair of damaged DNA. Cohesin and its DNA loader, the Scc2/4 complex have been implicated in all these cellular actions. The gene regulation role has been described in several organisms. In yeast it has been suggested that the proteins in the cohesin network would effect transcription based on its role as insulator. More recently, data are emerging indicating direct roles for gene regulation also in yeast. Here we extend these studies by investigating whether the cohesin loader Scc2 is involved in regulation of gene expression. We performed global gene expression profiling in the absence and presence of DNA damage, in wild type and Scc2 deficient G2/M arrested cells, when it is known that Scc2 is important for DNA double strand break repair and formation of damage induced cohesion. We found that not only the DNA damage specific transcriptional response is distorted after inactivation of Scc2, but also the overall transcription profile. Interestingly, these alterations did not correlate with changes in cohesin binding.

DESIGN
We investigated Scc1 FLAG tagged binding in WT ans Scc2-4 mutant in absence and presence of a single DNA DSB on Chr. VI
