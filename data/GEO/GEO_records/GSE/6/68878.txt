TITLE
Gene expression profiles of normal B-cell subsets from sternal bone marrow

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mononuclear cells were isolated from the sternal bone marrow and prepared for multiparametric flow cytometry using an optimized and validated protocol. B-cell subsets of PreBI, PreBII, Immature, Naive, Memory and Plasma cells were isolated and a al of 38 gene expression profiles were generated using the HuEx-1_0-st-v2-micro array chip from Affymetrix to characterize the gene expression in the individual subpopulations.

DESIGN
Bone marrow tissue was obtained by physical scraping of the medulla from seven patients (homo sapiens) undergoing cardiac surgery. Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow and prepared for multiparametric flow cytometry using an optimized and validated protocol. B-cell subsets of PreBI, PreBII, Immature, Naive, Memory and Plasma cells were isolated and a total of 38 gene expression profiles were generated using the HuEx-1_0-st-v2-micro array chip from Affymetrix .
