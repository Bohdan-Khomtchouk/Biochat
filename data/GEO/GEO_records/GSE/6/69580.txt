TITLE
Differential miRNA expression profiles betweenHBV-related  HCC tumor versus non-tumor liver tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA played an important role in the process of carcinogenesis in HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we performed miRNA microarray to evaluate the miRNAs that expressed differentially between HCC tumor versus non-tumor liver tissues.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from snap fresh tissue collected from resected HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. All HCC tumors were HBV-associated HCC.
