TITLE
Genome wide mapping of long noncoding (lnc) RNAs in hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatic stellate cells are the primary cell type responsible for development of fibrosis in chronic liver disease.  We used directional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the lncRNAs expressed in human HSCs. We also identified the lncRNAs that change in expression with differentiation of nonfibrotic quiescent HSCs into fibrotic HSC myofibroblasts and those that are regulated by TGF-beta signaling. ChIP-seq was also performed to identify DNA regions occupied by H3K27ac to define super-enhancers in HSC myofibroblasts.  This study identified lncRNAs expressed HSCs that may regulate fibrosis.

DESIGN
Analysis of genome-wide lncRNA expression using RNA-seq and ChiP-seq in human HSCs under four different conditions
