TITLE
The RNA-Seq transcriptome of human prostate cancerÂ cell line depleted of CIC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify which genes were regulated by CIC in human prostate cancer cell, the effect of CIC knockdown on PC3 cell transcriptome was determined

DESIGN
The transcriptome profiles were obtained from control PC3 and shCIC treated PC3
