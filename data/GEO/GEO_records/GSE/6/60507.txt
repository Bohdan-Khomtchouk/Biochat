TITLE
BAC aCGH profiling of 64 GBM (primary

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
aCGH was used to profile copy-number aberrations (CNA) in 64 glioblastoma specimen of patients treated within clinical trials. The data was used to identify changes in CNA which contribute to the aberrant of expression of HOX transcription factors. Our group had previously demonstrated that expression of HOX genes was associated with increased resistance to chemo-radiotherapy and worse outcome in GBM patients  Keywords: Disease state comparison

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from the 64 samples and synthetic normal reference DNA were labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 respectively and hybridised to HumArray3 and HumArray2 chips. The unified platform HumArray3.1 is used for annotation purposes
