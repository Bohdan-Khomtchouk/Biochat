TITLE
Calcineurin-dependent transcriptome in ICN1 (activated NOTCH1)-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activated NOTCH1 induces T-ALL in mice when transduced in bone marrow (BM) cells. T-ALL cells activate the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in vivo (Medyouf H. et al. Nat Med 2007 [PMID 17515895]). Through appropriate crosses, mouse ICN1-induced T-ALL were generated that include a ROSCreERT2 transgene and 2 copies of a CnB1 floxed alleles.

DESIGN
Cohorts of secondary recipient mice were injected with these T-ALL cells, and when becoming leukemic, divided into 2 subgroups. Group 1 was treated with Tamoxifen (TAM), resulting in CnB1 gene deletion and inactivation of calcineurin. Group 2 was treated with carrier solvent (corn OIL), thus maintaining CnB1 and calcineurin activity. RNAs were extracted from flow cytometry-sorted leukemic cells. Details in Gachet S. et al. Leukemia 2013 (PMID 23689515).
