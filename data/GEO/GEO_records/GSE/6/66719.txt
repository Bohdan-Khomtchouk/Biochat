TITLE
SF3B1 Degron knockdown RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of mutant and/or wild-type SF3B1 in MEL202 cell line by Degron knock-in, followed by RNA-seq, to identify splicing events governed by mutant SF3B1.

DESIGN
Control: parental MEL202 cell line. Experiments: mutant-SF3B1 knockdown; wildtype-SF3B1 knockdown; mutant SF3B1 knockout. Treatments: each of these four conditions plus and minus shld.
