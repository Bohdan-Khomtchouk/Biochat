TITLE
Genome wide host gene expression analysis in chicken lungs infected with avian influenza viruses

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The mechanisms responsible for the molecular pathogenesis of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) or low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in avian species remain poorly understood. Thus, global immune response of chickens infected with HPAIV H5N1 (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011) and LPAIV H9N2 (A/duck/India/249800/2010) viruses was studied using microarray to identify crucial host genetic components responsive to these infection. HPAIV H5N1 induced excessive mRNA expression of cytokines (IFNA, OASL, MX1, RSAD2, IFITM5, GBP 1, IL1B, IL18, IL22, IL13, IL12B, CCL4, CCL9, CCL10, CX3CL1 etc) in lung tissues. This excessive cytokine response (cytokine storms) may cause tissue damage and high mortality in chickens. In contrast, the expression levels of most of the cytokines remained unchanged in the lungs of LPAIV H9N2 virus infected chickens. This study indicated the relationship between host cytokines response and their roles in pathogenesis in chickens infected with HPAIVs.
