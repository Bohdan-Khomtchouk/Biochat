TITLE
Overexpression Studies of SNHG1 Revealed that SNHG1 Regulated the Distal Genes Expression in Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many long noncoding transcripts are involved in cancer progression. Here, we utilized high-throughput microarray to compare the transcriptome alterations between the SNHG1 overexpression or control in HCT116 cell lines. Two isoforms of SNHG1 (denoted as SNHG1S and SNHG1L in the present work) were separately cloned and stably expressed in HCT116 cells with the lentivector. Moreover, GSEA analysis revealed the significant associations between SNHG1-regulated genes and plethora of gene signatures or pathways, such as process of interferon response. Collectively,the present study indicated that SNHG1 regulated the distal genes in cancer progression.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells overexpressing SNHG1 isoforms (Short or Long) or control vector. Three biological replicates of each condition were analyzed on Agilent microarray.
