TITLE
Modulation of cell metabolic pathways and oxidative stress signaling contribute to acquired melphalan resistance in multiple myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma RPMI8226 cells adapted to growth in melphalan display a shift towards Warburg metabolism and modulated oxidative stress signaling Inhibitors targeting specific enzymes in these pathways are selectively toxic to the melphalan-resistant cells.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles were measured on 6 batches each of control and melphalan-treated RPMI8226 and RPMI8226-LR5 cells using Illumina Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which enables genome-wide expression analysis (more than 47 000 transcripts) of 24 samples in parallel on a single microarray.
