TITLE
The splicing factor PRP31 is involved in transcriptional gene silencing and stress response in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To study how PRP31, ZOP1 and STA1 affect gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing, we performed RNA deep sequencing for the seedlings materials C24, prp31, zop1, and sta1 mutants.

DESIGN
Compare the mRNA profiles of 10-day old seedlings materials of mutants (prp31, zop1 and sta1) to wild type C24 by Illumina suquencing.
