TITLE
Whole genome mapping of p63 binding sites in ME180 human cervical carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using tiled microarrays covering the entire human genome, we identify ~5800 target sites for p63, a homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor essential for stratified epithelial development and implicated in epithelial stem cell maintenance. Keywords: ChIP-chip
