TITLE
Expression data from mouse SCN after 30-min light pulse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transmission of information about the photic environment to the circadian clock involves a complex array of neurotransmitters, receptors, and second messenger systems.  Using laser capture microscopy and microarray analysis, a population of genes rapidly induced by light in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is identified. Keywords: comparative expression analysis
