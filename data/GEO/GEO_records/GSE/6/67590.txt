TITLE
3' RNA-seq of flies over-expressing cabut protein or RNAi against cabut mRNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
CbtOE (Tim-gal4; UAS-cbtFLAG), Tim-gal4 (control for CbtOE), cbtRNAi (Tim-gal4-UAS-Dcr2-UAS-cbtIR-cbtE1) and Tim-gal4;UAS-Dcr2 (control for CbtRNAi) flies. Flies were entrained in LD (light: dark) condition for 3-4 days and harvested at six time points: ZT3, ZT7, ZT11, ZT15, ZT19, ZT23 Fly heads  were collected, RNA was extracted and  RNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (Engreitz et al., 2013)

DESIGN
Three  samples of cbtRNAi and three samples of their controls.  Two samples of cbtOE with two samples of their controls.
