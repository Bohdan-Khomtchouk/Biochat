TITLE
Effect of PARG or NUDIX5 inhibition on Progesterone Gene Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T47D cells were starved 0% FCS for 24 hours. Following starvation PARG was inhibited via the use of Tannic Acid (TA) and the gene expression in response to progesterone studied. Cells were stimiulated with R5020 for 1 or 6 hours. NUDIX5 was reduced in T47D cells 48 hours prior to hormone induction via the use of NUDIX5 specific siRNA. Progesterone response and gene expression changes were analyzed as described above following 6 hours of R5020.

DESIGN
T47D cells T0 (Time 0), T6 (6 hours R5020), TA; Tannic Acid
