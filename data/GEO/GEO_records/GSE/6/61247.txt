TITLE
ChIP-seq profiling of loci bound by HIF1a in wild-type E12.5 hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to identify genes directly bound by HIF1a in cardiomycoytes Methods: crosslinked chromatin isolated from E12.5 mouse hearts was precipitated using an anti-HIF1a antibody and processed for sequencing. A list of genes containing a HIF1a peak (Minimum score 3.5) was compared with RNA-seq results to identify genes that are bound by HIF1a and expressed in E12.5 hearts Results: this analysis identified 1016 genes expressed and bound by HIF1a in embryonic hearts

DESIGN
Two experimental replicates and one input
