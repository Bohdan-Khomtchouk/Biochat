TITLE
A two miRNA classifier differentiates follicular thyroid carcinomas from follicular thyroid adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The inherent diagnostic limitations of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA), especially in the “indeterminate”  category, can be partially overcome by molecular analyses. We aimed at the identification of  miRNAs that could be used to improve the discrimination of indeterminate FNAs. miRNA expression profiling  was performed for 17 follicular carcinomas (FTCs) and 8 follicular adenomas (FAs). The microarray  results underwent cross-comparison using three additional microarray data sets. Candidate miRNAs were  validated by qPCR in an independent set of 32 FTCs and 46 FAs. Sixty-eight differentially expressed miRNAs  were identified. Thirteen miRNAs could be confirmed by cross comparison. A two-miRNA-classifier was  established improving the diagnostic applicability and resulted in a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity  of 49%. We present a classifier that has the potential to be successfully evaluated in cytology material  for its capability to discriminate (mutation negative) indeterminate cytologies and thereby improving  the pre-surgical diagnostics of thyroid nodules.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling was performed for 17 follicular carcinomas (FTCs) and 8 follicular adenomas (FAs). All samples are independent, coming from different patients.
