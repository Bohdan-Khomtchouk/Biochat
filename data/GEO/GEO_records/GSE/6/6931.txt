TITLE
Expression data from female reproductive organs of adult mice treated with estrogen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen induce organ-specific cell proliferation and development in female reproductive organs, though the reproductive differentiation, sex maturation, implantation and lactation. However, the mechanism of organ-specific estrogen responsive genes is unknown. Thus, we examined early estrogen responsive genes in mouse uterus, vagina and mammary gland. Keywords: organ specificity
