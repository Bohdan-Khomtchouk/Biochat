TITLE
Density variation and MMP3 treatment of SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Response of mouse mammary epithelial cells to different cell densities and treatment with  MMP3

DESIGN
Cells were plated in 35 mm dishes at 50K, 100K, or 250K (experiment A), or 25K, 50K, 100K, or 250K (Experiment B), then treated as controls or with MMP-3 for three days, then isolated for RNA.
