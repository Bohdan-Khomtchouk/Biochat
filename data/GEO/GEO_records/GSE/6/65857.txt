TITLE
Functional antagonism between the MYT1L and MEF2 transcription factors controls neural development and the expression of schizophrenia-associated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we describe a novel functional antagonism between the MYT1L and MEF2 transcription factors in regulation of neural development

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional effects of Myt1L and MEF2A knockdown by lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs in differentiating human neural stem cells
