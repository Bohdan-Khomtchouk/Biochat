Effects of Beta Catenin antagonist BC2059 in AML cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the global transcriptomic changes induced by treatment with the Beta Catenin antagonist BC2059 in AML cells The canonical WNT-β-catenin pathway is essential for self-renewal, growth and survival of AML stem/blast progenitor cells (BPCs). Deregulated WNT signaling inhibits degradation of β-catenin, causing increased nuclear translocation and co-factor activity of β-catenin with the transcriptional regulator TCF4/LEF1 in AML BPCs. Here, we determined the pre-clinical anti-AML activity of the anthraquinone oxime-analog BC2059 (BC), known to attenuate β-catenin levels. BC treatment disrupted the binding of β-catenin with the scaffold protein TBL1 (transducin β-like 1) and proteasomal degradation and decline in the nuclear levels of β-catenin. This was associated with reduced transcriptional activity of TCF4 and expression of its target genes, cyclin D1, c-Myc and survivin. BC treatment dose-dependently induced apoptosis of cultured and primary AML BPCs. Treatment with BC also significantly improved the median survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with either cultured or primary AML BPCs exhibiting nuclear expression of β-catenin. Co-treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and BC synergistically induced apoptosis of cultured and primary AML BPCs, including those expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as further significantly improved the survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with primary AML BPCs. These findings underscore the promising pre-clinical activity and warrant further testing of BC against human AML, especially those expressing FLT3-ITD.

DESIGN
4 samples analyzed: OCI-AML3 cells (untreated); OCI-AML3 cells treated with 100 nM of BC2059 for 8 hours; Primary FLT3-ITD expressing AML cells (untreated);  Primary FLT3-ITD expressing AML cells treated with 100 nM of BC2059 for 8 hours.
