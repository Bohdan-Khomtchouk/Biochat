TITLE
Transcriptome comparison between thymic T cell subsets in wildtype and Caph2(I15N) mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to look for transcriptional differences between stage-matched thymic T cell subsets isolated from wildtype and condensin II mutant mice CD4+CD8+ cells from 8-12 week animals were separated according to the expression of CD71, in order to isolate proliferative and non-proliferative subsets

DESIGN
Total RNA from FACS purified CD4+CD8+CD71+ and CD4+CD8+CD71- was isolated, and comparisons were drawn between immunophenotypically matched cells from wildtype and Caph2 mutant (I15N) mice.
