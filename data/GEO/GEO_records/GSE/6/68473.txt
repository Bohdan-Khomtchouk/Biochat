TITLE
Zebrafish developmental hypoxia

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Study of hypoxia-induced differential expression during zebrafish development at gastrulation (shield) and segmentation (8-somite) stages

DESIGN
An 8-chip study with 2 biological replicates from +/- hypoxia at 2 different stages of development. Each sample is prepared from 12-15 dechorionated, hand-selected, developmentally synchronized embryos exposed to 1-2 hours of hypoxia.
