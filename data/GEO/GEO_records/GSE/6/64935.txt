TITLE
RNA sequencing of ATCC 17978hm Acineotbacter baumannii strain and CpdA mutant

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
Difference in RNA expression levels between Acinetobacter baumannii cells expressing high and low levels of cyclic AMP

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Acineotbacter baumannii bacterial cells in Log phase gown in MH broth culture, isolated RNA in triplicate from three expreiment. cpdA::Tn mutant and 17978hm strain compared. Assessing increased levels of cAMP within the cell
