TITLE
Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised ‘bivalent’ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation in fourteen human rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples using RRBS. In addition, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation in one human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) forced to terminally differentiate by expression of the forced heterodimer MyoD~E12 (MDE). Lastly, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation changes during normal differentiation in one primary human normal myoblast cell line
