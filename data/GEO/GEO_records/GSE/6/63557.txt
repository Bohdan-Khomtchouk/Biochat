TITLE
Gene expression patterns in responding versus non-responding AB1-HA tumors from mice during immunotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Balb/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously with AB1-HA cells on both flanks on day 0. The mice were then treated with anti-CTLA-4 on day 5 or 6. 7 days later, one tumor was removed for gene expression studies, and the other was left in situ to monitor tumor growth and determine if the eventual outcome was progression or regression.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of three experimental groups; (i) untreated mice; (ii) anti-CTLA-4 treated responders; (iii) anti-CTLA-4 treated nonresponders. There were 10 animals in each group.
