TITLE
Culture-expanded mouse lymph node-derived fibroblastic reticular cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lymph node stromal cells were isolated from young C57Bl6/J mice and ex-vivo expanded and purified for gene expression analysis. The aim was to assess gene expression patterns for cultured FRCs.

DESIGN
Two replicate samples of untreated young (4-6 weeks old) C57BL6/J mice
