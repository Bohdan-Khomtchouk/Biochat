TITLE
Dormancy within Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms: a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus epidermidis

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from three independent biological replicates of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms with different proportion of dormant cells.

DESIGN
Whole trancriptome analysis of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms with prevented and induced dormancy.
