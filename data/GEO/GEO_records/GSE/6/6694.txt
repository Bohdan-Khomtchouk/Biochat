Zebrafish Paired End DiTag libraries

Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Used a DNA tag sequencing and mapping strategy called gene identification signature (GIS) analysis, in which 5' and 3' signatures of full-length cDNAs are accurately extracted into paired-end ditags (PETs) that are concatenated for efficient sequencing and mapped to genome sequences to demarcate the transcription boundaries of every gene. GIS analysis is potentially 30-fold more efficient than standard cDNA sequencing approaches for transcriptome characterization. Keywords: Paired End DiTags
