TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of human THP-1 monocytes stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA) or oleic acid (OA) and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-density array-based DNA methylation profiling of human THP-1 monocytes stimulated for 24 h with 1, 10 or 100uM AA, or the same concentrations of OA, and unstimulated controls. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
