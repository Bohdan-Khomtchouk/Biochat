TITLE
Impact of influenza A on human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Over 2600 genes were differentially expressed in pDCs exposed to influenza A compared with the controls (no virus). Multiple functional group clusters of genes were impacted, including those involving antiviral responses and also metabolism, such as the glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glucose metabolic process, and positive regulation of macromolecule biosynthesis clusters.

DESIGN
Blood pDCs were purified from 5 human donors, exposed ex vivo for 8 h to either influenza A or no virus, harvested, and RNA was extracted for subsequent DNA microarray analysis.
