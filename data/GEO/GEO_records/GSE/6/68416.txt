TITLE
BMAL1 Activates Clock Gene Expression by Regulating Transcription Initiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We showed that Bmal1 mainly regulates clock gene initiation, with this functioning being highly conserved across species.

DESIGN
compare RNA-seq and chip-seq between wildtype and mutant cells
