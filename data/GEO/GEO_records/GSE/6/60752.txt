TITLE
Time resolved ribosome profiling study of oxygen and glucose deprivation of rat pheochromocytoma cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Oxygen and glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in many (patho)physiological conditions. In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) occurs during ischemia and stroke, resulting in extensive tissue injury and cell death. We applied time-resolved ribosome profiling technique to assess early events at the level of gene expression in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells during short-term OGD. Most substantial alterations in transcripts levels and their translation were seen to occur in the first 20 minutes of OGD. The rapid adaptation of translation apparatus to OGD is global and involves altered elongation and initiation rates. We also observed salient and reproducible alterations in ribosome densities of individual mRNAs such as increased translation of particular upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs); induced site-specific arrests of the ribosomes and synthesis of extended protein isoforms.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling (with mRNA-seq sequencing) was carried out at 0,20,40 and 60 minutes of OGD. Two biological replicates were used.
