TITLE
Expression data from mutant of RSC chromatin-remodeling complex in respiratory growth

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
RSC is a growth essential ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nps1/Sth1 is the ATPase subunit of the complex. A temperature-sensitive mutant allele of NPS1, nps1-13 and the null mutation of the RSC2 or RSC7 gene showed growth defect on a medium containing non fermentable carbon source, such as lactate or ethanol-glycerol (YPEG), suggested a possibility that RSC plays a role on mitochondria function. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression profiles between the wild type and nps1-13 mutant under respiratory condition.
