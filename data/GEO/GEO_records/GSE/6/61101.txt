TITLE
MIRA-Seq analysis of bovine dermal fibroblasts from the same individuals at two different ages

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We report the results of MIRA-Seq-based high-throughput profiling of the bovine fibroblast methylome from three different individuals at two different ages (5 and 16 months of age) to determine the stability of methylation with age.

DESIGN
Examination of methylation in one cell line (fibroblasts) of three individuals at two ages (5 and 16 months).
