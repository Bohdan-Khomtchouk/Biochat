TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the AD11 anti-NGF transgenic mouse model of neurodegeneration at 1, 3, 6, 15 months of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the gene expression profile of brain regions at different stages of the Alzheimerâ€™s like neurodegeneration in the anti-NGF AD11 trangenic mouse model. Total RNA was extracted from hippocampus, cortex and basal forebrain of postnatal day 30 (P30, 1 month), P90 (3 months), P180 (6 months)  and at 15 months of age. Expression profiles were studied by Agilent microarray analysis, followed by qRT-PCR validation of significant candidates. Wide changes in gene expression profiles occur already at the presymptomatic stage P30, with the most significantly affected clusters of mRNAs are linked to Inflammation and Immune Response.

DESIGN
AD11 mice were compared to the trangenic VH controls. A total of 60 female AD11 mice and 59 female control VH (5 per group) mice were used for this study: 5 AD11 and 4-5 control VH mice for each time point (1,3,6,15 months of age) and brain area (HP, CTX, BFB).
