TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of GMP from Icsbp (Irf-8) deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to study the consequences of the loss of Icsbp expression in hematopoiesis Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitors from bone marrow were isolated from Icsbp wild type and deficient mice by flow cytometry. Global gene expression was performed using Affymetrix gene chip technology. Keywords: Gene modification, Irf-8, knock out mice
