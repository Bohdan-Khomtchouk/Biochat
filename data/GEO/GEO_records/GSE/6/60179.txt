TITLE
Role of Ror2 in primordial germ cell migration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of eggs and sperm, are a unique model for identifying and studying regulatory mechanisms in singly migrating cells. From their time of specification to eventual colonization of the gonad, mouse PGCs traverse through and interact with many different cell types, including epithelial cells and mesenchymal tissues. Work in drosophila and zebrafish have identified many genes and signaling pathways involved in PGC migration, but little is known about this process in mammals. We have generated a point mutation in the Ror2 gene that we know disrupts primordial germ cell migration in the developing mouse embryo. We used microarray analysis to determine if this defect is mediated through genome-wide or pathway-specific transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
We analyzed primordial germ cells (PGCs) from 4 wild-type (WT) and 4 Ror2Y324C/Y324C mutant embryos using Oct4-DPE-EGFP. PGCs were collected during their active migratory state at embryonic day 9.5 (somite range 20-25).
