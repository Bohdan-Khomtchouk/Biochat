TITLE
Identification of time-dependent biomarkers and effects of exposure to volatile organic compounds using high-throughput analysis (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation of DNA is one of the common epigenetic signaling tools that cells use to lock the expression of various genes. In this study, we examined the effects of VOCs exposure in humans on methylation using microarray analysis. We recruited participants who had short-term exposure, long-term exposure, or no exposure. We then analyzed changes in methylation in blood samples from these participants. We found that 1178 genes were hypermethylated and 402 genes were hypomethylated compared with the control group in time-dependent manner. Further research is required to determine the time-dependent effects of VOCs on epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
Methylation of DNA in human blood samples (IRB #AS 14039) divided into three groups: control (unexposed workers; n = 12), short-term exposure (workers exposed to VOCs for less than 10 years; n = 12), and long-term exposure (workers exposed to VOCs for more than 10 years; n = 12) was experimented by methylation microarray analysis after exposure to VOCs
