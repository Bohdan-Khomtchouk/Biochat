TITLE
Differential microarray expression profile analysis of long non-coding RNAs in umbilical cord vein plasma from normal and gestational diabetes-induced macrosomia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the umbilical cord lncRNA profiles in gestational diabetes-induced  macrosomia, the umbilical cord vein blood from normal and gestational diabetes-induced macrosomia was hybridized to a microarray containing probes representing 33,000 lncRNA genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to validate selected differentially expressed lncRNAs. The gene ontology (GO), pathway and network analysis were performed. The microarray identified 8814 lncRNAs that were expressed in the umbilical cord blood, of which 349 were significantly upregulated and 892 were significantly downregulated (fold-change â‰¥ 2.0) in GDM group. The highest enriched GOs targeted by downregulated transcripts were biological regulation. Pathway analysis indicated that nine pathways corresponded to downregulated transcripts.

DESIGN
Thirty pairs of GDM macrosomia and normal controls were divided into three subgroups randomly, and the umbilical cord vein blood from each subgroup was mixed, and hybridized to a microarray.
