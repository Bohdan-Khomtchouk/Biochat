C.glutamicum Δpup mutant senses a stronger iron limitation than the wild type.

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
Pupylation is a posttranslational protein modification in bacteria resembling ubiquitination in eukaryotes. The prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup is covalently attached to other proteins via an isopeptide bond between its carboxyterminal glutamate residue and a lysine residue in the target. In mycobacteria, pupylation was shown to mark proteins for unfolding by the ATPase Mpa and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. However, the occurrence of pupylation in species without a proteasome like Corynebacterium glutamicum suggests that degradation may not be the only fate of pupylated proteins.  The Δpup mutant senses a stronger iron limitation than the wild type. Among the 125 genes showing at least 2-fold changes in transcript levels in the Δpup mutant (p-value ≤ 0.05) were 54% of all genes known to be regulated by the master regulator of iron homeostasis DtxR (Brune et al., 2006; Wennerhold and Bott, 2006). Except for ftn, which is activated by DtxR and showed a 2-fold decreased mRNA level, the other DtxR target genes showed increased mRNA levels in the Δpup strain. These included ripA, encoding a transcriptional regulator of iron proteins, which represses a number of prominent iron-containing proteins under iron limitation, such as aconitase or succinate dehydrogenase (Wennerhold et al., 2005). 79% of the known RipA target genes showed decreased mRNA levels in the Δpup strain.
