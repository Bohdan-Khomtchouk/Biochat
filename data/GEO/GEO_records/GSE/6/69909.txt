TITLE
MicroRNA sequencing of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (uMSCs) and HEK293T cells derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that were found in many biological fluids such as blood, urine, and cultured medium. Exosomes are small vesicles (approximately 100nm in diameter) that contain many functional molecules like cytokines, receptors and regulating RNAs. In this study, we found that uMSC-derived exosomes accelerates wound healing and reduce myoblast formation in vivo. In vitro study showed uMSC-exosomes specific microRNAs take major roles in inhibiting myoblast differentiation of fibroblast. MicroRNA sequencing of both uMSC- and HEK293T-derived exosomes revealed significant differences between these exosomes. Further infomatic and functional analysis showed that uMSC-exosomes specific microRNA-21, -23,-145, and -125b can target different components of TGF-β signaling which attenuates the expression of α-SMA in fibroblasts, thus inhibiting myoblast differentiation

DESIGN
Exosomes were collected form cell culture medium by serial centrifugation and ultracentrifugation.
