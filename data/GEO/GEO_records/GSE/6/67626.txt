TITLE
The effect of BRG1 on the responsivness of IFNg Stimulated Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the effect of reconstitution of BRG1 in BRG1-deficient cells on the responsivness of IFNg stimulated genes. Cells were infected with control adenovirus or BRG1-encoding virus. Cells were then left untreated or exposed to IFNg for 6 hours. Total RNA was collected and analyzed with Illumina arrays.

DESIGN
SW13 cells were infected with BRG1-encoding adenovirus or control virus. Cells were left untreated or exposed to IFNg for 6 hours
