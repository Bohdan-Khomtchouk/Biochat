TITLE
To Be a Flower or Fruiting Branch: Insights Revealed by mRNA and Small RNA Transcriptomes from Different Cotton Developmental Stages

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Purpose: found out the regulated genes of nulliplex-branch and its forming molecular mechanism Methods: shoot apical mRNA and miRNA in two nulliplex branch and two normal branch cotton of three development stages were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: we found 3 825 and 353 specific stage differnent expressed genes in pre-budding stage of island cotton and upland cotton, respectively. In miRNA, we found 16 and 18 specific stage differnent expressed miRNA in pre-budding stageof island cotton and upland cotton, respectively. Conclusions: Our study represents the genes and miRNA control development of lateral branch and regulate flowering time at same times.

DESIGN
Shoot apical mRNA and miRNA of normal branch cotton and nulliplex branch botton were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
