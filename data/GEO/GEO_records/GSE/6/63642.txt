TITLE
BTG1 modulates ATF4 function in response to cellular stress: implications for tumor cell survival

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of glutamine starvation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with and without Btg1 at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that loss of Btg1 affect the expression of stress-response genes. Results provide important information of the differentially expressed genes regulated by Btg1 upon glutamine deprivation, explaining the survival advantage of tumor cells harboring Btg1 loss under cellular stress condition.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from WT and Btg1-/- MEFs subjected to 16 hours glutamine starvation compared to untreated cells.
