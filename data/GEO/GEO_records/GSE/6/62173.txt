TITLE
Expression data of mice cochlea treated with L-methionine and valproic acid.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Treatment of DBA/2J mice with a combination of L-methionine and valproic acid significantly attenuated progressive hearing loss. We examined gene expression in the whole cochlea of the mice. This study was aimed to detect genes of which change in expression levels were associated with attenuation of progressive hearing loss in the mice.

DESIGN
DBA/2J mice at 4 weeks old (untreated_4-weeks, N=5), mice treated with control vehicle (0.1M sodium bicarbonate) for 8 weeks (Control_vehicle_12-weeks, N=5), and mice treated with L-methionine and valproic acid  (MET_and_VA_12-weeks, N=6) were analyzed.
