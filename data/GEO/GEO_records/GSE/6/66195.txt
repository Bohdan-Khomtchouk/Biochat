TITLE
miRNA profiles of tubular cells (Rodent A and Rodent B)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs of 18â€“23 nucleotides that regulate gene expression. Recently, plasma miRNAs have been investigated as biomarkers for various diseases. In the present study, we assessed whether the miRNA expression profiles of tubular tissues could discriminate proximal tubule injury and diagnose acute kidney injury (AKI) and the renal tubular dysfunction without morphological changes.
