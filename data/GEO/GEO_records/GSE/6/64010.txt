TITLE
The tomato SlDREB2 transcription factor improves salt stress tolerance in tomato

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The tomato SlDREB2 transcription factor was overexpressed in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and transgenic plants tolerance to salinity was compared to that of wild-type plants.

DESIGN
At least 4 plants were collected for RNA extraction. The aim of the experiment was to compare transcriptomes of 35::SlDREB2 plants and wild-type plants grown together and exposed to salt (125 mM) during 48h. A technical replicate (dye swap) was conducted.
