TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of TEL-AML1 targets in acute leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Around 20-25% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the TEL-AML1 (TA) fusion gene. It is a fusion of two central hematopoietic transcription factors, TEL (ETV6) and AML1 (RUNX1). Despite its prevalence, the exact genomic targets of TA have remained elusive. We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by TA genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells  using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq).

DESIGN
Nascent RNA expression profiles were generated with GRO-seq after TEL-AML1 expression in the Nalm6 pre-B-ALL cell line in four different time points (0, 4, 12 and 24 h). TEL-AML1-mut and luciferase induction cell lines were used as controls. Two replicates were included for all six samples.
