TITLE
Comparison of conventional target labelling to PCR and IVT amplified target populations

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our aim was to identify which stand alone amplification protocol performed best in our lab when the starting amount of total RNA was limited to 50 ng (A typical amount of total RNA we obtained by laser capture microdissection of tissues from silique samples). Since the quality of extracted RNA is very often tissue dependent and will affect the amplification efficiency, we decided to use total RNA extracted from whole siliques; better representing tissues targeted by LCM. We set out to compare two basic methods of RNA amplification, based on IVT and PCR. Keywords: Comparison of target preparation regimes from limiting amounts of RNA
