TITLE
MYEOV as a novel biomarker for human non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the roles of MYEOV in lung cancer cell proliferation, we compared the expression profiles of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines transfected with control siRNA and siMYEOV.

DESIGN
We collected RNA from A549 cell lines transfected with control siRNA and siMYEOV.
