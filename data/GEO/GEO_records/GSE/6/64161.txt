TITLE
Effect of PARP inhibition on Progesterone Gene Expression Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T47D cells were starved 0% FCS for 24 hours. Following starvation PARP1 was inhibited via the use of 3AB and the gene expression in response to progesterone studied. Cells were stimiulated with R5020 for 1 or 6 hours.

DESIGN
T47D cells T0 (Time 0), T1 (1 hours R5020), T6 (6 hours R5020)
