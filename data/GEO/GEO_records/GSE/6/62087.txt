TITLE
The effect of XKA on gene expression profile in KKAy mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Xiao-Ke-An (XKA) is a Chinese medicine for T2D. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of XKA remain to be systematically elucidated. In this study, the therapeutic mechanisms of XKA were investigated. Male KKAy mice were administered with XKA for 32 days while the model and normal group was treated with distilled water.

DESIGN
The KKAy mice were administered orally once daily with either distilled water (model group) or XKA (1.5 g/kg) for 32 days. And the C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with distilled water as normal group. Livers from normal, model and XKA (1.5 g/kg) treatment groups were used for further microarray experiment.
