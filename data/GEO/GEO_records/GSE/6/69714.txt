TITLE
Expression data of S. pombe wild-type and subtelomere-deleted strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Gene expression is regulated by various mechanisms. One is gene silencing, which is caused by highly condensed heterochromatin structures. S. pombe genome contains 4-6 subtelomeres adjacent to the telomeres. In order to investigate the roles of subtelomeres,  we analyzed the effect of subtelomere deletion in global gene expressions.
