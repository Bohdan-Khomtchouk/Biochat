TITLE
Genome-wide Expression Profiles of Drought and High-salinity Stresses-responsive Genes in Rice (Oryza Sativa L. Indica)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Three rice major tissues, namely flag leaf, shoot and panicle, were involved in this study. Each tissue had two kinds stress treatment, drought and high salinity, in 3 different time courses. For drought treated samples, an additional water recovery was applied. Each experiment had three replicates. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression in three tissues with stress treatment and without treatment
