TITLE
RNA-seq of autistic and control cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess the status of splicing changes in microexons in the cortex of individuals with autism. Methods: We performed RiboZero Gold (rRNA depleted) 50bp PE RNA-seq in a larger set of case and control samples to define 12 autism and 12 control samples showing the greatest global differential gene expression change. These samples, which show differential expression of the splicing regulator SRRM4, were used to evaluate global splicing changes. Results: Within these samples, 126 of 504 (30%) detected alternative microexons display a mean ΔPSI > 10 between ASD and control subjects of which 113 (90%) also display neural-differential regulation. By contrast, only 825 of 15,405 (5.4%) longer (i.e. > 27 nt) exons show such misregulation, of which 285 (35%) correspond to neural-regulated exons. Notably, we also observe significantly higher correlations between microexon inclusion and nSR100 mRNA expression levels across the stratified ASD samples and controls, for those microexons regulated by nSR100 relative to those microexons that are not regulated by this factor (p=1.4×10-7, Wilcoxon Sum Rank test). Conclusions: These data suggest microexon regulation is a potentially important mechanism underlying ASD and likely other neurodevelopmental disorders

DESIGN
