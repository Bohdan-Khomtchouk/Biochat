TITLE
Dynamic regulation of the histone variant H1.0 contributes to intratumor epigenetic and functional heterogeneity [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes regulated by the histone variant H1.0 by RNA-seq analysis of cell lines expressing inducible specific shRNAs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of in vitro-transformed human skin fibroblasts expressing inducible shRNAs targeting H1.0. Two different cell lines expressing distinct shRNAs are analyzed. For ech cell line, uninduced cells (NT), cells induced with doxycycline for 16h  (SHOT), cells induced with doxycycline for 14 days (DOX) and cells washed out of doxycycline for 4 days (washDOX) are compared.
