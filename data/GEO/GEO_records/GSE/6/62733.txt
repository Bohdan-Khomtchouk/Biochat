TITLE
Accumulation of epigenetic alterations at the promoters of transcriptional regulator genes in the placentas of pregnancy cases with inadequate maternal gestational weight gain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The concept that fetal environment correlates with health later on has been defined as developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), in which epigenetic modifications are considered to serve as a memory of exposure to in utero environments. Although many animal studies have demonstrated direct associations of maternal nutritional conditions during pregnancy with epigenetic alterations in the offspring, such evidence from human studies has been very limited.   To gain more insight into the effects of in utero environments on the human placental epigenome, we obtained genome-wide methylation profiles for 34 postpartum placentas from pregnancies of normal and fetal growth restriction cases with various extents of maternal gestational weight gain (GWG).   Whereas we initially failed to identify specific loci whose methylation is commonly altered across all subjects in each of subgroups categorized by the extent of GWG and babyâ€™s birth weight, the application of Smirnov-Grubbs' outlier test to the same dataset revealed the accumulation of epigenetic alterations in the placentas under the adverse in utero environments. This methodology is potentially applicable to various epigenome studies for human populations. Further annotations of the genomic and functional features of loci with altered DNA methylation demonstrated that environmentally induced hyper-methylation is significantly frequently occurred at the promoter region of transcriptional regulator genes including polycomb-targets and zinc-finger genes. Aberrant epigenetic modifications at such developmental regulator loci, if occurred in fetuses in a similar manner as observed in the placentas examined in this study, would elevate the risk of developing various diseases including metabolic and mental disorders in the later life.

DESIGN
We subjected placentas from 14 fetal growth restriction (FGR) births and 19 births within the normal range of birth weight to genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
