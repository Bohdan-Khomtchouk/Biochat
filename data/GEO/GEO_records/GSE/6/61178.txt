TITLE
LN-308/U-138MG shVEGFR-2 knock-down analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to evalute the genetic regulations upon knok-down of VEGFR-2 in two different glioma cell lines in partiular focussing on genes related to glioma migration and invasion as well as resistance to chemotherapy.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from glioma cells harbouring shVEGFR-2 knock-down compared to controls
