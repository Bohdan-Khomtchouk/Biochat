TITLE
Potential role of natural variation in the Arabidopsis CBF Pathway contributing to local adaptation of ecotypes collected from Italy and Sweden

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The two Arabidopsis ecotypes that are adapted to Italy and Sweden, respectively, showed different degree of freezing tolerance. By comparing the low temperature transcriptomes of the IT and SW ecotypes, we showed CBF pathway plays a significant role in natural variation of freezing tolerance.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in the Arabidospsis ecotypes of Italian and Swedish plants grown at warm, cold for 1 week, and for 2 weeks.
