TITLE
MicroRNA targetome analysis during HCMV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate miRNA-mediated temporal crosstalk during productive infection, we identified genome-wide miRNA target sites using Argonaute-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (AGO-CLIPseq) in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected cells and evaluated the targeting efficacy by applying our new AGO-CLIPseq enrichment (ACE)-scoring algorithm.

DESIGN
To uncover the miRNA targetome in uninfected or infected human foreskin fibroblasts with HCMV (24, 48 and 72 post-infection hour) were subjected to take AGO-CLIPseq as well as mRNAseq/smallRNAseq.
