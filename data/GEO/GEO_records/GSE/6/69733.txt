TITLE
Knockdown of SR protein family in P19 cells and RNA-seq of cytoplasmic and whole cell polyA+ RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our data suggest that all SR proteins contribute to mRNA export via NXF1. To identify endogenous export targets we depleted all seven SR proteins individually from P19 WT cells prepared cytoplasmic fractions. We sequenced the cytoplasmic fraction and as a control whole celll RNA from the identical sample.

DESIGN
Knockdown of seven SR Proteins plus control, total RNA and cytoplasmic RNA, polyA+ enriched, 2 biological replicates per condition, 2 technical replicates per condition
