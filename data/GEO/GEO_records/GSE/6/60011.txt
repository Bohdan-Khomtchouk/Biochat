TITLE
Genome-wide sequences bound by the transcription factors BLUEJAY and JACKDAW in Arabidopsis thaliana roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the genomic sequences bound by the C2H2 transcription factors BLUEJAY and JACKDAW as profiled by chromating immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Illumina high sequencing. Plants were carrying constructs of proteins (translational) fusions of these transcription factors to the yellow fluorescent protein.  Gene fusions were expressed under all their genomic regulatory regions using recombineering. The recombineering technique was used to recombine the fluorecent protein at the 3' end of their genomic regions in a JATY clone carrying these genes. Subsequently the JATY clones carrying these translational fusions were introgressed into plants. We performed ChIP on roots grown under standard conditions and fixed with formaldehyde in PBS-EDTA. Sequences bound by BLUEJAY and JACKDAW were immunoprecipitated with a-GFP AbCam290 at 4 Â°C overnight. Biological replicate samples were make into libraries of ~100 bp insert size and 50 bp of single ends sequenced through Illumina High Sequencing.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of samples of plants expressing the C2H2 transcription factors fused to the yellow fluorescent protein; and of control wild type plants processed through the same protocol.
