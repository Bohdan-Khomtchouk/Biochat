TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (wild type and lasRrhlR mutant strains) exposed to human neutrophils

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In the present in vitro study, interactions between P. aeruginosa (sessile biofilms as well as planktonic cells) and PMNs were analyzed by means of DNA microarray based transcriptomics. We found that the P. aeruginosa wild type biofilms, in contrast to planktonic cultures and quorum sensing (QS) deficient strains, respond to PMN exposure in a rather aggressive manner. The response does not involve protective mechanisms such as those involved in oxidative stress. Rather it is dominated by QS controlled virulence determinants such as those encoded by pqs, phz, rhlAB, all of which are designed to cripple Eukaryotic cells including PMNs and macrophages. Our comparative analysis supports the view that QS plays a major role in mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa evades host defense systems. Keywords: Stress response
