TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human HOS cell line overexpressed with miR23a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human HOS cell line was overexpressed with  miR23a and gene expression profiling was studied with Illumina expression microarray (HumanHT12_V4).

DESIGN
Three negative control replicates vs. three miR23a over-expression replicates
