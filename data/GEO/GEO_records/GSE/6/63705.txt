TITLE
Gene regulated by Srebp1 and c-Myc during reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by Srebp1 and c-Myc during reprogramming, we performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with SKO, SKOM or SKOM plus Srebp1.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with SKO, SKO, SKOM or SKOM plus Srebp1 was measured at day 5.
