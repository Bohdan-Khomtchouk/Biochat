TITLE
Biochemical fractionation of HEK293 nuclei and RNA-seq of chromatin-associated and soluble-nuclear RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Biochemical fractionation of HEK293 nuclei and RNA-seq of chromatin-associated and soluble-nuclear RNA.

DESIGN
Nuclei from three biological replicates were isolated by detergent lysis, fractionated, then three chromatin and three soluble RNA samples were converted to cDNA using Illumina TruSeq stranded protocol, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000
