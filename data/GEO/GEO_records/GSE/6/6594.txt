TITLE
Nitrosomonas europaea cells treated with chloromethane for one hour and compared to untreated cells

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
We analyzed the global transcriptional response of N. europaea when exposed to  chloromethane (3.2 mM for 1 h).  Chloromethane treatment led to down regulation of 175 genes and  up regulation of 67 genes. This treatment was less harmful to the cells than chloroform Keywords: stress response, global transcription, toxin-antitoxin genes
