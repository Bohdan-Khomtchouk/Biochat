TITLE
Role of IRAKM in IL-33-induced dendritic cell activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain additional insight into the role of IRAKM in dendritic cell activation in response to IL-33 challenge, we profiled transcriptomes of mouse DC2.4 dendritic cell lines with or without IRAKM following IL-33 treatment in vitro.

DESIGN
IRAKM-sufficient and deficient DC2.4 cells were cultured overnight in the absence or presence of IL-33. Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix platform.
