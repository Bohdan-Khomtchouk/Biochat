TITLE
Deep sequencing analysis of microRNA expression in human melanocyte and melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the miRNAome in human melanocyte and melanoma cell lines using high-throughput RNA sequencing. We identified a group of dysregulated miRNAs by comparing the miRNA expression profiles among melanoma cell lines. Target genes of these miRNAs participate in functions associated with the cell cycle and apoptosis. Gene networks were built to investigate the interactions of genes during melanoma progression. We identified that the key genes that regulate melanoma cell proliferation were regulated by miRNAs. Our findings provide further knowledge regarding the mechanisms of melanoma development.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of melanocyte (HEMn-LP), low metastatic melanoma (A375) and high metastatic melanoma (A2058) cell line were generated using Illumina GA
