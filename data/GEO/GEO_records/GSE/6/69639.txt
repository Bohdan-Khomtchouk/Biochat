TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of HT-29 cells stimulated with pairwise combinations of TNF, EGF, and insulin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to investigate the link between signaling-network activation and transcriptional regulation downstream of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin. Microarrays were used to capture the transcriptional responses to TNF, EGF, and insulin at intermediate-to-late times after stimulation.

DESIGN
Nine combinations of TNF, EGF, and insulin were evaluated at three time points after stimulation in biological duplicate.
