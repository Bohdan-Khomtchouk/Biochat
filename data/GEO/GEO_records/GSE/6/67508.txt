TITLE
Expression data among esophageal cancer cell sublines with different migration ability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular directed migration is critical to invasion-metastasis cascade of cancer cells. We used in vitro transwell model to screen two esophageal cancer cell lines (KYSE30/180) and obtained two pairs of subpopulations with distinct motility ability. Then we used microarrays to detail the differentially expressed genes and microRNAs between these two cell sublines (30U/D and 180U/D) to identify those responsible for ESCC motility.

DESIGN
KYSE30/180 cells were subject to four successive selections using transwell (CORNING, USA). Subpopulations penetrated through membrane (D) or not (U) were harvested respectively for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix genome and LC Sciences microRNA microarrays simultaneously.
