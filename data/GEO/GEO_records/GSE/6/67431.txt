TITLE
The nuclear pore-associated TREX-2 complex employs the Mediator Med31 submodule as a docking site to regulate gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) influence gene expression besides their established function in nuclear transport. The TREX-2 complex localizes to the NPC basket and affects gene-NPC interactions, transcription and mRNA export. How TREX-2 regulates the gene expression machinery is unknown. Here, we show that TREX-2 interacts with the Mediator complex, an essential regulator of RNA Polymerase (Pol) II. Structural and biochemical studies identify a conserved region on TREX-2, which directly binds the Mediator Med31/Med7N submodule. TREX-2 regulates assembly of Mediator with its Cdk8 kinase and is required for recruitment and site-specific phosphorylation of Pol II. Transcriptome and phenotypic profiling confirm that TREX-2 and Med31 are functionally interdependent. TREX-2 additionally uses its Mediator-interacting surface to regulate mRNA export suggesting a mechanism for coupling transcription initiation and early steps of mRNA processing at the Mediator level. In sum, we provide insight into how NPC-associated adaptor complexes can access the core transcription machinery.

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed from WT, sac3∆, cdk8∆ and Sac3 R288D mutant cells. For each strain triplicates were analyzed. WT strain was sac3∆ transformed with pRS315 SAC3 WT
