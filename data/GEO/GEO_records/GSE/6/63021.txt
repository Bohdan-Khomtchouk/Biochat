TITLE
The VELVET complex in the gray mold fungus Botrytis cinerea:  impact of BcLAE1 on differentiation, secondary metabolism and virulence

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Full transcriptomes of the Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain B0510 and the null-mutants deltaBcVEL1 and deltaBcLAE1, cultured onto solid grape juice medium with cellophane overlays , were compared to identify BcVEL1  or/and BcLAE1-dependent genes.

DESIGN
The Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain and the null-mutants deltaBcVEL1 and BcLAE1  were cultured for 48h onto solid grape juice medium with cellophane overlays. 4 replicates were performed. The 12 total-RNA samples (3 strains* 4 replicates) were used for hybridization on NimbleGen 4plex gene expression arrays (20,885 gene models from Botrytis cinerea with three 60-mer probes per gene).
