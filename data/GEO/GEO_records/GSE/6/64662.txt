TITLE
Gene expression following treatment with HDAC6 inhibitor C1A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA Extraction from a human colon tumor developed in a xenograft mouse (Extraction from fresh frozen tumor tissue material). The affymetrix Human genome U219 array plate was used. Sequences used in the design of the array were selected from the Uingene database 219, RefSeq version 36, and full length human mRNAs from GenBank. Measure gene expression of more than 36 000 transcipts and variants per sample, which represent more than 20 000 genes.

DESIGN
Study performed under contract by Alpha Metrix Biotech, Rodermark, Germany. Full details are available upon request. Processed data are available on the series record and consists of the differentially expressed genes identified in the comparison of the 14d_treated vs 24h_treated samples.
