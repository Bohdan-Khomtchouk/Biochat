TITLE
Human p53 signaling qPCR primer Array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H1299 cells were overexpressed miR-138 or silenced AGO2. The expression of 92 genes associated with p53 using the “Human p53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array”

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. H1299 cells were transfected with NC mimics, AGO2 siRNA or miR-138 for 48h. Equal amount total RNA from each group was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
