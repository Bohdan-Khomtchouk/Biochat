TITLE
Expression data from SKOV3ip1 cells treated with MORAB-003 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MORAB-003 significantly upregulated a number of genes involved in autophagic processing, including GABARAPL2, LC3II (MAP1LC3B), ATG3, ATG4B, and BECN1, while expression of the oncogenic factor PIK3C3 was downregulated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cells treated with MORAB-003

DESIGN
microarray analysis of SKOV3ip1 cells with and without MORAb-003 treatment was performed under the following conditions: 1) cells plated in folate-free medium (7 days), 2) cells plated in medium with physiological levels of folic acid (2-10 nm) (7 days), 3) cells with physiological levels of folic acid (7 days) and 003 antibody (24 hours), 4) cells with physiologic levels of folic acid (7 days) and control 004 antibody (24 hours); 5) cells with physiological levels of folic acid (7 days) and MORAb003 antibody (24 hours) . For each condition, a single cell growth was carried out and an RNA sample was extracted. Three aliquots from each RNA sample were then hybridized to Affymetrix U133 2 arrays, for a total of 15 arrays. time course 7days and 24 hours
