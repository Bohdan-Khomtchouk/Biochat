TITLE
Spinophilin silencing in the breast cancer cell line SUM159

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling was used to determine the most abundantly expressed genes in spinophilin-silenced breast cancer cells compared to control cells in the cell line SUM159. We identified several differentially expressed genes in spinophilin-silenced cells.

DESIGN
A total number of six samples were analyzed, each in three replicates. There are three SUM159 Control samples and three samples of the cell line SUM159 with silenced spinophilin.
