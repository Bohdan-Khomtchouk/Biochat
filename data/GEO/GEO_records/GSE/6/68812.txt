TITLE
Bile diversion to the distal small intestine has comparable metabolic benefits to bariatric surgery

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is highly effective in reversing obesity and associated diabetes. Recent observations in humans suggest a contributing role of increased circulating bile acids in mediating such effects. Here we use a diet-induced obesity mouse model and compared metabolic remission when bile flow was diverted through a gallbladder anastomosis to jejunum, ileum or duodenum (sham control). We found that only bile diversion to the ileum results in physiologic changes similar to RYGB including sustained improvements in weight, glucose tolerance and hepatic steatosis despite differential effects on hepatic gene expression.  Circulating free fatty acids and triglycerides decrease while bile acids increase, particularly conjugated tauro-b-muricholic acid, an FXR antagonist. Activity of the hepatic FXR/FGF15 axis was reduced and associated with altered gut microbiota. Thus bile diversion, independent of surgical rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract, imparts significant weight loss accompanied by improved glucose and lipid homeostasis that are hallmarks of RYGB.

DESIGN
Total RNA from n = 5 DIO, n = 4 GB-IL, n = 5 RYGB mice livers was extracted of total RNA and submitted fro RNAseq
