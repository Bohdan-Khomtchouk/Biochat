TITLE
Responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to low oxygen

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
In order to understand how Pseudomonas aeruginosa responds to low oxygen we grew strain PAO1 with 3 different oxygen concentrations: 2%, 0.4% and 0% supplemented with nitrate as an electron acceptor. Gene expression under these conditions was compared to that of cells grown with 20% oxygen. Keywords: Comparison of transcriptome profiles
