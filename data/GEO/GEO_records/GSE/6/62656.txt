TITLE
Comparison after 4 and 52 h (Chloro-Sap)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea12-02_chlorosap - comparison after 4 and 52h - To observe the effects of guanosine penta/tetraphosphate on gene expression - Plants of four different genotypes (43A10.6, 44B1.3, H1 P3.2 and Col-0) were grown for ten days on MS/2 plates with 1% sucrose under 80ÂµE light in long-day conditions (16 hours of light, 8 hours of dark). Plants were treated at 10:30 in the morning (Time 0; 10:30 is 3 and a half hours after the onset of the light period) by flooding with 30uM dexamethasone (in aqueous solution with 0,3 % DMSO and 0,033 % Silwet L-77) for 5 minutes . Samples were taken at 4 hrs and 52 hrs after T0. Aerial parts of the seedlings were rapidly harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

DESIGN
