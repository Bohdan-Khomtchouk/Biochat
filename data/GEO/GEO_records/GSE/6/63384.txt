TITLE
Multi-platform Characterization of Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma (Genome-wide DNA Methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma and non-tumor adjacent tissues. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples included tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues excised from a cohort of 35 patients with Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma. Candidate prognostic biomarkers were validated by pyrosequencing in independent cohorts.

DESIGN
Total genomic DNA was bisulfite converted and hybridized to Infinium Human Methylation27Beadchips. Fluorescent signals were collated via Bead Studio software and converted into Î²-values. Illumina Bead Studio software output data were normalized using SSN (simple scaling normalization), to correct for dye bias and transformed into M-values (M = log2 intensity of methylated probe/ intensity of unmethylated probe), using the R package lumi.
