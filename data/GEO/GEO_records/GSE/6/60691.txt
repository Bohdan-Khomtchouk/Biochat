TITLE
Disrupting SUMOylation potentiates transactivation function and ameliorates polyglutamine AR-mediated disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our findings demonstrate beneficial effects of enhancing transactivation function of the ligand-activated polyQ AR and indicate that the SUMOylation pathway may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.

DESIGN
We mutated conserved lysines in the polyQ AR that are targeted by SUMO, a modification that inhibits AR transactivation function.
