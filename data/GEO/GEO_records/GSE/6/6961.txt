TITLE
Genes in nonpermissive temperature-induced cell differentiation of testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which nonpermissive temperature induces cell differentiation in testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells harboring temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Testicular Sertoli TTE3 cells used in the present study were derived from transgenic mice harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. In the TTE3 cells, inactivation of the T-antigen by a nonpermissive temperature at 39ËšC led to cell differentiation accompanying elevation of transferrin and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A. Of the 22, 690 probe sets analyzed, nonpermissive temperature up-regulated 729 probe sets and down-regulated 471 probe sets by > 2.0-fold.
