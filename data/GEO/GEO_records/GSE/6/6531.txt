TITLE
Identification of Helicobacter pylori genes contributing to stomach colonization.

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Chronic infection of the human stomach with Helicobacter pylori leads to a variety of pathologic sequelae including peptic ulcer and gastric cancer, resulting in significant human morbidity and mortality. Several genes have been implicated in disease related to H. pylori infection including the vacuolating cytotoxin and the cag pathogenicity island. Other factors important for establishment and maintenance of infection include urease enzyme production, motility, iron uptake and stress response. We utilized a C57BL/6 mouse infection model to query a collection of 2400 transposon mutants in two different bacterial strain backgrounds for H. pylori genetic loci contributing to colonization of the stomach. Microarray based tracking of transposon mutants allowed us to monitor the behavior of transposon insertions in 758 different gene loci. Of the loci measured 223 (29%) had a predicted colonization defect. These include previously described H. pylori virulence genes, genes implicated in virulence in other pathogenic bacteria and 81 hypothetical proteins. We have retested 10 previously uncharacterized candidate colonization gene loci by making independent null alleles and confirmed their colonization phenotype using competition experiments and determination of the dose required for 50% infection. Of the genetic loci retested, 60% have strain specific colonization defects while 40% had phenotypes in both strain backgrounds for infection, highlighting the profound effect of H. pylori strain variation on the pathogenic potential of this organism. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
