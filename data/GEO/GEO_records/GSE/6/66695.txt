TITLE
Genome-wide Scan for Methylation Profiles in Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and breast cancer samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485577 CpGs in breast cancer and normal samples. Samples included 40 normal, 80 breast cancer samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 120 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.1
