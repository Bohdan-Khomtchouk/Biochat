TITLE
Influence of neutrophils in tumor-supportive stromal cells gene expression  in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor infiltrating neutrophils (TAN) have been shown to exert both pro- and anti-tumoral activities and their  recruitment and polarization are triggered by tumor-derived signals. Resident mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC)  could contribute to tumor-supportive cell niche and have been shown to display tumor-specific transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional features compared to normal tissue. In our study, we investigate whether these two cell subsets establish a bidirectional crosstalk in the context of B-cell lymphoma. We used microarrays to explore how neutrophils could trigger the polarization of tumor-supportive stromal cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis were performed on stromal cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow (BM) or tonsil (Resto) of healthy donors. These BM-MSC (n=3) or Resto (n=3) were  primed or not with neutrophils for 1 day to induce stromal modification.
