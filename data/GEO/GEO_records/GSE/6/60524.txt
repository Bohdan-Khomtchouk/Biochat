TITLE
MicroRNA analysis on epithelial D492 cells and its mesenchymal derivative D492M cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA analysis of breast epithelial cell line with stem cell properties before and after undergoing endothelial induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).

DESIGN
miRNA expression anlysis was done on breast epithelial cells before and after endothelial induced EMT. D492 is a breast epithelial cell line with stem cell properties that undergoes EMT in 3D rBM coculture with endothelial cells. Total RNA was isolated from D492 and D492M (a mesenchymal derivative) Â at 50% and 90% confluency in monolayer.
