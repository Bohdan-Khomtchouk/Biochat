TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human Ad5- and CMV-specific CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression profiles of FACS-sorted, human Ad5- and CMV-specific CD4 T cells from the same PBMC sample of healthy donros, using affymetrix Human Gene 2.0ST Gene-Chips; The analysis show that Ad5- and CMV-specific CD4 T cells demonstrate differential gene expression profiles even though the cells are from the same PBMC

DESIGN
PBMC from healthy donors (n=3) were CFSE-labeled, then equally divided and stimulated with Ad5 and CMV antigens; On day 6 post stimulation, Ag-specific CD4 T cells were sorted by flow based on CFSE-low.
