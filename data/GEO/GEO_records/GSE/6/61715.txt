TITLE
Loss of the Histone Methyltransferase EZH2 induces Resistance to Multiple Drugs in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we analyzed global gene expression changes that were associated with drug resistance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia using the Affymetrix microarray platform.

DESIGN
Changes in global gene expression were determined with Affymetrix microarrays in the AML cell lines MV4-11 (drug-sensitive) and MV4-11R (drug-resistant). We generated the resistant cell line by continous cultivation of parental MV4-11 for 3 months with increasing concentrations of the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PKC412.
