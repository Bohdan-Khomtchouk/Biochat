TITLE
Gene expression comparison between WT, U17 snoRNA knockdown and U17 overexpression NIH-3T3 cells to identify target mRNAs regulated by U17 snoRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mRNA transcriptome after differential expression of U17 snoRNA. We hypothesiaed  that if U17 snoRNA regulates cholesterol homeostasis by modulating the expression of target mRNAs, genes that are differentially expressed by the loss-of-function or gain-of-function of U17 snoRNA would be candidate U17 targets. Results revealed negative regulation of target genes by U17 snoRNA, in which increasing dosage of U17 snoRNA from U17 knockdown to WT to U17 overexpression lead to decreases in target levels.

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from WT, U17 snoRNA KD (ShSnhg3 stable clone), and U17 snoRNA OE (pMDÎ²globinU17b stable clone) cells grown in LPDS media for 24 hours.
