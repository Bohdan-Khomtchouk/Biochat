TITLE
Effect of YAP overexpression on HuCCT1 cholangiocarcinoma cell line transcriptome (YAPS94A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The YAP pathway in regulating organ size by integrating external signals to control the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. YAP is known to be involved in tumorigenesis in several tissues, yet its role in cholangiocarcinoma is not established We used microarrays to assess the role of YAP pathway in cholangiocarcinoma either by overexpressing a constitutively active YAP1 mutant, or by downregulating YAP1 expression using shRNA

DESIGN
HuCCT1 cells where transfected with either an empty vector or a vector overexpressing the constitutively active YAP1 S127A; cells were harvested, RNA was collected and analyzed using microarray
