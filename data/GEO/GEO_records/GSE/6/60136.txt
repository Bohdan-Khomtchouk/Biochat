TITLE
Exosc8-Regulated Genes in Fetal Liver-Derived Erythroid Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosc8 and Exosc9 are components of the exosome that establish a barricade to erythroid maturation. Here, we knocked down Exosc8 in fetal liver-derived erythroid progenitor cells to determine the cohort of Exosc8-regulated genes in erythroid cells.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated fetal liver progenitor cells were infected with retrovirus expressing shRNA targeting either luciferase or Exosc8. Total RNA was isolated from these cells after 3 days ex-vivo culture, during which the cells underwent erythroid maturation.
