TITLE
DNA elimination analysis of scnRNA production-defective Tetrahymena

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
Analysis of genome-wide IES elimination of Late-scnRNA accumulation-defective cells inducates that Early-scnRNAs are sufficient to induce DNA elimination for a majority of IESs, whereas Late-scnRNAs are important for DNA elimination of some, mainly Type-B, IESs.

DESIGN
new MACs of exconjugants were isolated from different mutants at 36 hpm, and the genomic DNA was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing
