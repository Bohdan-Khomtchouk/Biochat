TITLE
Small RNA profiles of three different mycovirus-infected Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, created using Illumina high definition adapters

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Small RNA libraries of three different mycovirus-infected A. fumigatus isolates were constructed by using Illumina high definition adapters. sRNAomes were analysed and  putative virus-derived small RNAs were identified.

DESIGN
Analysis of small RNA profiles of three different mycovirus-infected A. fumigatus isolates
