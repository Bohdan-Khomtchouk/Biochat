TITLE
Epigenome profiling reveals significant DNA demethylation of interferon signature genes in lupus neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide DNA methylation patterns within neutrophils and low-density granulocytes of Lupus patients and demographically matched controls

DESIGN
Comparison of 15 Lupus patients vs 15 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 beadchip array
