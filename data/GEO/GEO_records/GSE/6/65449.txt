TITLE
Characterizing the interactions between a naturally-primed IgA and its conserved Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron species-specific epitope in gnotobiotic mice [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
We report the mid-log phase transcriptional profile of the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, grown in the presence of mouse monoclonal IgAs with species- and strain-level specificity (mAb 260.8 and mAb 225.4, respectively).

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiling of the type strain of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (NC_004663) grown in vitro in the presence of either (i) PBS (carrier control), (ii) mAb 225.4 alone, (iii) mAb 260.8 alone, (iv) an equal combination of mAbs 225.4 and 260.8, or (v) a nonbinding control mouse mAb IgA (JC63.1)
