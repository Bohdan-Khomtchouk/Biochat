TITLE
Genome-wide maps of ParBF (SopB) binding along DNA in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide analysis from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA (ChIP-sequencing) at very high resolution (about 50 millions reads) of the DNA binding pattern of ParBF (SopB) of plasmid F

DESIGN
Differencial examination of ParBF binding by comparing input and IP (anti-SopB antibody) samples
