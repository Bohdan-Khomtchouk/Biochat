TITLE
Gene expression profiling of SF1 knockdown in human endometriotic stromal fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic silencing of Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF1) is lost in endometrial tissue in endometriosis and this is hypothesized to result in de novo local steroidogenesis favoring growth and inflammation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial specific transcriptional and functional role of SF1.  Expression of SF1 was robustly increased in cultures established from stromal fibroblasts isolated from endometriomas (OsisHESC) over endometrial stromal cells isolated from eutopic sites in healthy proliferative phase endometrial biopsies (HESC). In order to evaluate the role of SF1 in the regulation of genes in fibroblast isolated from human endometriomas, OsisHESC were transfected with scrambled siRNA (siNT) or siRNA targeting SF1 (siSF1).

DESIGN
SF1 siRNA group and Non-targeting siRNA group. In order to evaluate the role of SF1 in the regulation of genes in fibroblast isolated from human endometriomas, OsisHESC were transfected with scrambled siRNA (siNT) or siRNA targeting SF1 (siSF1) and subjected to gene expression profiling. Two group comparison
