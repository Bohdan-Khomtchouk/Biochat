TITLE
ZAS3-null vs wild-type whole mouse thymus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The HIVEP/ZAS/Schnurri genes encode large zinc finger proteins that regulate gene expression through DNA binding to the kappaB motif. The ZAS proteins have also been shown to associate with signaling molecules to regulate the TNFa and TGFb signaling pathways. Because ZAS3 transcript and protein expression is rapidly abrogated in primary lymphocytes upon tissue culture, we have generated a ZAS3-null mouse model to study the physiological function of ZAS3. Mice with targeted disruption of ZAS3 are viable with life span comparable to controls. Additionally, the gross anatomy and histology of the major organs, proliferation rates of splenocytes and thymocytes, and the diversity of the TCRb chains of ZAS3 mice are comparable to wild-type. However, compared to wild-type mice, there are decreased CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD4+CD69+ thymocyte populations.   Additionally, CD44hi/CD62Llo subset and CD25 and CD69 expression are increased in splenocytes of ZAS3 mice. Microarray analysis validated by  real time PCR revealed changes in the expression level of specific transcripts in ZAS3-null thymus, including several proteins in the G-protein coupled olfactory receptor family. Furthermore, EMSA shows that disruption of ZAS3 results in varying changes in binding activities towards NF-kB and AP1 binding sites. Other phenotypes observed in the ZAS3 mice include generalized increased bone density in older animals and infertility in females. As with ZAS2/shn-2 mice, disruption of ZAS3 is not lethal and does not grossly affect development or homeostasis. We propose that the ZAS proteins likely have overlapping functions, which may be uncovered with deletion of multiple ZAS genes in a single animal. Keywords: Gene knock-out mouse model
