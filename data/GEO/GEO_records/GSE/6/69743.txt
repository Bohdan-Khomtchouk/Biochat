TITLE
Global transcriptome response of Staphylococcus xylosus in meat model

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus xylosus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus xylosus is used as starter culture for sausage fermentation for a long time but the molecular mechanisms for its adaptation in meat remained unknown. A global transcriptomic approach was carried out to determine these molecular mechanisms. S. xylosus modulated the expression of about 30% of the total genes during its growth and survival in the meat model. The expression of many genes encoding enzymes involved in glucose and lactate catabolism was up regulated. In parallel, genes encoding transport of peptides and peptidases that could furnish amino acids were up expressed and thus concomitantly a lot of genes involved in amino acids synthesis were down regulated. Finally S. xylosus responded to salt added in the meat model by over expressing genes involved in transport and synthesis of osmoprotectants, Na+ and H+ extrusion and in production of energy through the F0F1-ATPase.

DESIGN
Microarray was used to evaluate modification in the transcriptome of S. xylosus C2a strain in the inoculum (Mx) or in meat (V). Three biological replicates were collected on separate days for samples and labelled following a dye-switch design; for each condition one labeling in Cy3 and one in Cy5.
