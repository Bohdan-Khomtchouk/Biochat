TRF2 Inhibition-Mediated Degradation Derepresses the Neuronal Differentiation Program

SUMMARY
Telomere binding factor 2 (TRF2), is a protein that plays a major role in the maintenance of telomere integrity.  In mitotic normal and transformed cells, TRF2 inhibition triggers a rapid telomere DNA damage response that results in cell senescence or apoptosis.  Here we provide evidence that TRF2 plays a role suppressing neuronal differentiation.  TRF2 interacts with the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) in nuclear PML protein-containing compartments of neuronal cells in vivo.  Inhibition of TRF2 function with a dominant-negative form of TRF2 elicits a telomeric DNA damage response, and disrupts the TRF2-REST complex resulting in proteasomal degradation of REST.  Overexpression of REST impairs the ability of DN-TRF2 to induce neuronal differentiation, indicating that enhanced degradation of REST is sufficient to account for the differentiation-inducing effect of DN-TRF2.  REST degradation derepresses RE1-regulated genes (L1CAM, BDNF, b3-tubulin, syntaxin and others) resulting in morphological and functional differentiation of neurons.  Our findings identify a novel interaction between the telomeric protein TRF2 and REST which regulates the molecular differentiation program of neurons. Keywords: transfection and molecular inhibition
