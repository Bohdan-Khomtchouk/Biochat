TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana cao mutant alternative splicing exploration by RNAseq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The early flowering Arabidopsis cäö mutant is defective in the BRR2a helicase involved in splicing. In order to get some explanation about the phenotype, we compared the expression profiles of wt and mutant with RNA-seq. In addtion, the same RNA-seq data was used to measure the extent of intron retention in the cäö mutant

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression and alternative splicing between the cao mutant and the wt
