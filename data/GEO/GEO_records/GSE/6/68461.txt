TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of murine MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing different levels of Id2 and Kit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of the transcriptional regulator Id2 in the context of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using an Id2/GFP-reporter mouse model of MLL-AF9-driven AML, we showed that Id2 is expressed heterogeneously across the leukemic population. Moreover, differential expression of Id2 and the stemness marker Kit defines subsets of AML cells with different leukemogenic properties with lower levels of Id2 associated with enrichment in leukemia stem cell potential. To define gene expression patterns associated with distinct endogenous levels of Id2 and higher LSC potential, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on FACS-sorted KitHI–Id2HI (BM_Kplus-Iplus), KitHI–Id2LOW(BM_Kplus-Iminus), KitLOW–Id2HI (BM_Kminus-Iplus) and KitLOW–Id2LOW (BM_Kminus-Iminus) MLL-AF9-cherry+ AML cells obtained from bone marrow of terminally sick mice.

DESIGN
Primary MLL-AF9+ AMLs were generated by reconstituting lethally irradiated congenic mice with foetal liver cells obtained from Id2-GFP reporter mice and transduced with a retroviral vector co-expressing MLL-AF9 and the cherry reporter protein. KitHigh–Id2High, KitHigh–Id2Low, KitLow–Id2High and KitLow–Id2Low MLL-AF9/cherry+ AML cells obtained from bone marrow of terminally sick primary recipients were FACS-sorted and used for RNA sequencing analysis (3 samples/subset).
