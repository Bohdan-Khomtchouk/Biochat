TITLE
Mutational analysis of measles virus suggests constraints on antigenic variation of the glycoproteins

ORGANISM
Measles morbillivirus

SUMMARY
RNAseq of mutant measles virus libraries

DESIGN
Insertional mutagenesis of measles to identify tolerated locations Mutant measles virus libraries were constructed as described in:    Heaton, N.S., Sachs, D., Chen,C.J., Hai, R., and Palese, P. (2013).    Genome-wide mutagenesis of influenza virus reveals unique plasticity of    the hemagglutinin and NS1 proteins. PNAS. 110, 20248-20253.
