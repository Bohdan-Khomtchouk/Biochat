TITLE
Histone H3 K4,36,79R 18 hr

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from two replicate cultures of the mutant strain were isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the samples and the wild-type control allow the identification of genes regulated by H3 K4,36,79R mutant.  Cells were grown in galactose media and then shifted to glucose media for 18 hours to give the 18 hour time point Keywords: repeat
