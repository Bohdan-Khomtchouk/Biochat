TITLE
Palmitate-induced gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis was performed to investigate the expression of genes in HGF stimulated with palmitate Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity and higher concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) in plasma. Among FFAs, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), such as palmitate, have been proposed to promote inflammatory responses. Although many epidemiological studies have shown a link between periodontitis and T2D, little is known about the clinical significance of SFAs in periodontitis. The goal of this study is to demonstrate a potential link between the pathogenesis of periodontitis and SFAs in plasma.

DESIGN
HGF were treated with either with 0 (1% Bovine serum albumin) or 100 ÂµM Palmitate for 36 hours (n=2 each).
