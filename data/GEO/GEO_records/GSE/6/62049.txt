TITLE
mRNA Expression Changes Induced by Myocardial MCU Inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial calcium is an important second-messenger controlling fight-or-flight responses in the heart.  The molecular identity of MCU (Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter) was recently discovered allowing us to test this hypothesis in vivo by expressiing a myocardial delimited dominant negative form of MCU. We queried mRNA expression changes induced by dominant negative MCU expression in the heart.

DESIGN
Neonatal ( < 24 h) and 6 week old hearts were harvested from mice expressing the dominant negative MCU contruct or wild-type littermates.
