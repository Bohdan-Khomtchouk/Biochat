TITLE
Notch1 - WISP1 Axis Determines Tumor-Regulating Role of Melanoma Stromal Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are crucial in regulating cancer progression, yet  the molecular mechanisms that determine the tumor-regulating function of CAF are  poorly understood. Here, we uncover the Notch1 pathway as a molecular determinant  that controls the regulatory role of CAF in melanoma growth, invasion and metastasis,  and can be manipulated to reprogram and convert CAF to act as tumor suppressors.  The Notch1-determined tumor-regulating function is in part mediated by Wnt-induced  secreted protein 1 (WISP1). These findings reveal the Notch1â€”WISP1 axis as a crucial  molecular determinant in governing stromal regulation of tumor progression, and  establish this axis as a potential therapeutic target

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from MSCD-SF transduced with Cre-GFP/lentivirus in vitro compared to MSCD-SF transduced with GFP/lentivirus. Samples are duplicates.
