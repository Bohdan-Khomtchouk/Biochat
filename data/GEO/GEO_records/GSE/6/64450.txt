TITLE
Unique gene program of rat mesenteric arteries as revealed by Deep RNA Sequencing

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study used Deep RNA sequencing to define gene expression in the small resistance arteries and compare to a reference conduit artery, the aorta Methods: Deep RNA Sequencing (~90 million reads) was performed on 2 samples of adult SD rat mesenteric arteries and compared to that of 2 samples of aorta. Results: ~900 genes were identified that were expressed at least 2-fold difference between meseteric artery and aorta

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 2 samples of rat mesenteric artery and 2 samples of rat aorta were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq
