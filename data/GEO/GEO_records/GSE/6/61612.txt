TITLE
Gene expression data from Lhx5 mutant mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lhx5 mutant mouse embryos show loss of a neuronal nucleus of the brain called the mamillary body and essential for the formation of memories. We wanted to identify the genes that are responsible for the normal development of the mammillary body. Therefore, we used microarray experiments to identify the genes that show a changed expression in the Lhx5 mutant mammillary neuroepithelium in comparison to the wild type.

DESIGN
The mammillary neuroepithelium of Lhx5 mutant und wild type embryos (Mus musculus (C57BL/6)) was dissected at a stage, where the size of the mammillary body was not yet detectable changed (E10.5) to exclude effects of the size reduction of the mammillary body in Lhx5 mutant embryos. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix  microarrays was performed to detect changes in the transcriptome that are responsible for the mutant phenotype.
