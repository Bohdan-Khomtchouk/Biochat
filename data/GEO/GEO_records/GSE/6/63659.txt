TITLE
Transcriptomic Changes in TGF-β1 Differentiated and PGE2 Dedifferentiated Myofibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These data show that the genes that distinguish myofibroblasts from fibroblasts are myriad, and that some genes not traditionally associated with myofibroblast differentiation may serve as novel therapeutic targets for fibrosing disorders. Gene expression levels were assessed from total RNA on the Affymetrix U219 microarray.

DESIGN
Here, we use transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which has recently been shown to reverse myofibroblast differentiation, to investigate the transcriptomic changes that occur during TGF-β1-induced differentiation and PGE2-induced de-differentiation of myofibroblasts.
