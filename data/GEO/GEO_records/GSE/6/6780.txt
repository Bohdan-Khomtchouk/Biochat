TITLE
Evaluating the effects of activating mutations of human LH receptor in MA-10 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the potential tumorigenic effect of two activating mutations of hLHR identified in patients, we generated in vitro cell model using mouse Leydig MA-10 cells. The two mutations, Asp578His and Asp578Gly, were stably transfected to MA-10 cell to create MA-10-Asp578His and MA-10-Asp578Gly line. The profile of expressed genes in cells expressing the mutated hLHR was compared with that of control cells using cDNA microarrays with NIA mouse clone sets. Keywords: Genetic modification analysis
