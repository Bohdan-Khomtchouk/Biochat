TITLE
Gene expression data from spinal cord of DRa1-mMOG-35-55 or Vehicle treated DR*1501-Tg mice with EAE

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate DRα1-mMOG-35-55 effects on CNS inflammation during Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a more comprehensive manner, we performed microarray analysis on spinal cords from DRα1-mMOG-35-55- vs. Vehicle-treated DR*1501-Tg mice with EAE.  EAE was induced with mMOG-35-55/CFA/Ptx and mice were treated with DRα1-mMOG-35-55 (100ug daily x 3) or Vehicle ,after disease onset at a clinical score of 2.  Twenty four hr after the last treatment, total RNA was isolated from spinal cords and gene expression profiles from pooled RNA were analyzed using the Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Affymetrix GeneChip system

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from spinal cords of 3 DRa1-mMOG-35-55 treated mice and 3 Vehicle treated mice,and pooled in to two groups SCV - for Vheicle treatment and SCA - for DRa1-mMOG-35-55 treatment
