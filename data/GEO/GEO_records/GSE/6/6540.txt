TITLE
Expression data from olfactory epithelium of Lip-C-treated mice compared to Lip-O-treated control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of macrophage depleted mice to study the role of macrophages in regulating neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis of olfactory sensory neurons Keywords: comparison of gene expression level in sham and 48 hr OBX Lip-O mice versus Lip-C mice
