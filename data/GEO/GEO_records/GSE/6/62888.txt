TITLE
The ThbZIP1 can be regulated by an ABF Transcription Factor and sensitivity to ABA treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In the current report, we report that ThbZIP1 is a direct target gene of the ThABF1 transcription factor. There are three ABRE motifs in the promoter of ThbZIP1, Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays showed that a ABF protein, ThABF1, specifically binds to the ABRE motifs. The interaction between ThABF1 and the promoter of ThbZIP1 was further confirmed by transient expression assays in tobacco leaves. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) results suggested that binding of ThABF1 to ABRE motifs in the promoter of ThbZIP1 occurs in vivo in Tamarix hispida to regulate the expression of ThbZIP1. Moreover, ThABF1 and ThbZIP1 share similar expression patterns in response to salt, drought, ABA, methyl viologen (MV) and cold stress. Microarray analyses results showed there were 1,662 and 1,609 genes that were significantly upregulated or downregulated, respectively, under ABA stress conditions. ThbZIP1 regulated the genes via binding to the C-, G- or A-box motifs in their promoter sequences. Based on these data, the results suggested a regulatory network model mediated by ThbZIP1, under abiotic stress conditions, ThABF1 regulates the expression of ThbZIP1, and the activated ThbZIP1 binds to bZIP recognition sequences or other motifs to regulate the expression of genes containing these motifs in their promoters.

DESIGN
Differentially expression genes of ThbZIP1-overexpression plants and wild type of Columbia Arabidopsis thaliana were measured under ABA stressed and normal condition for 3 hours, respectively. Two independent experiments were performed at each treatment using different plants for each experiment.
