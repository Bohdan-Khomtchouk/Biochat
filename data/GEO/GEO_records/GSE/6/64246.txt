TITLE
Investigating pathogen defense mechanisms of porcine mammary epithelial cells in vitro.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine mammary epithelial cell (PMEC) cultures of three lactating sows were treated with potential mastitis-causing pathogens E. coli and S. aureus in vitro. Subsequently transcriptome profiles were analysed after 3 h and 24 h post-challenge, respectively.

DESIGN
per experimental group 3 PMEC cultures were sampled in triplicate for expression profiling.
