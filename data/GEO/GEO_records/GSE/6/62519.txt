TITLE
The RSC Complex localizes to coding sequences to regulate Pol II and histone occupancy (Agilent)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin structure during multiple stages of transcription. We report that RSC, an essential chromatin remodeler, is recruited to the open reading frames (ORFs) of actively transcribed genes genome-wide, suggesting a role for RSC in regulating transcription elongation. Consistent with such a role, Pol II occupancy in the ORFs of weakly transcribed genes is drastically reduced upon depletion of the RSC catalytic subunit Sth1. RSC inactivation also reduced histone H3 occupancy across transcribed regions. Remarkably, the strongest effects on Pol II and H3 occupancy were confined to the genes displaying the greatest RSC ORF enrichment. Additionally, RSC recruitment to the ORF requires the activities of the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes and is aided by the activities of the Pol II CTD Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1. Overall, our findings strongly implicate ORF-associated RSC in governing Pol II function and in maintaining chromatin structure over transcribed regions. ChIP-chip experiments to measure Sth1, Rpb3 and H3 occupancy in WT and various mutants (histone acetyltransferase and  Pol II CTD kinase mutants). The histone H3 and Rpb3 occupancy were also measured in cells upon Sth1 depletion.

DESIGN
The WT and mutant strains were grown in Synthetic complete or YPD media to an O.D. 600 of 0.6-0.8.  For inducing Gcn4, the cells grown in SC were treated with Sulfometuron methyl for 20-25 minutes and process for chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies again Myc, Rpb3 or histone H3.
