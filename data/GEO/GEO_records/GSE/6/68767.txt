TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of Bacillus cereus to proanthocyanidin exposure

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus

SUMMARY
B. cereus RNA isolation were taken at OD 0.5 just before addition of 0.02 mg/mL EEC, and at 30 min of exposure. Water was added instead of EEC for control. Total RNA was isolated and we performed DNA microarray for genome-wide transcriptional analysis of B. cereus ATCC 14579 in the presence or absence of EEC. The microarray used in this study was custom-made B. cereus ATCC 14579 developed by Agilent Technologies ( ). The B. cereus microarray design was based on the predicted chromosomal open reading frames (NCBI Accession No. AE016877). It targets the 5234 annotated CDS, three non-overlapping probes were designed, low-quality probes were eliminated, and finally 15242 could be spotted. Microarray data was normalized to 75th percentile and the difference was found to be significant by unpaired T-test (P = 0.05). Next, ratio changes of 2-fold (for up-regulated genes in the EEC stress condition) and 0.5-fold (for down-regulated genes in the EEC stress condition) were regarded as biologically significant. 596 were up-regulated and 495 were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Bacillus cereus was selected at 0, 30 min exposure for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.
