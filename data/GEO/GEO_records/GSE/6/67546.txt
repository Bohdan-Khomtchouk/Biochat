TITLE
Fat-specific protein 27/CIDEC plays an important role in promoting alcoholic liver injury in mice and humans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we developed a mouse model with long-term chronic (8-12 week) plus single/multiple binge ethanol feeding, which mimicks the drinking patterns of AH patients, who often have a history of chronic drinking plus recent excessive drinking. This model produces severe macrosteatosis, significant inflammation, and mild fibrosis. Moreover, we conducted translational studies by comparing transcriptome data from this clinically relevant in vivo model and human AH biopsy samples, and identified many similar disregulated genes in this animal model and AH samples. And we find that FSP27/CIDE-C plays a critical role in promoting steatosis and hepatocellular damage in mouse and in human AH.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, P8w, P10d, E8w, E10d1B, E8w1B,E8wMB
