TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in rice lacking cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;2

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Goal of the study is to characterize specific function(s) of the cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS) 1;2 for apical meristem induction in rice plants. To address the issue, we conducted transcript profiling toward basal parts of the knockout mutant lacking GS1;2. We used microarrays conduct transcript profiling of gs1;2 plants. Wild-type samples were used as control.
