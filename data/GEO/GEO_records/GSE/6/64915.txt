TITLE
Identification of a plasma four-microRNA panel as a potential noninvasive biomarker for osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TaqMan low density array (TLDA) was carried out to screen of the profiles of circulating miRNAs in pooled plasma samples from healthy controls and pre-operative osteosarcoma patients. The expression changes of circulating miRNAs in osteosarcoma patients were identified.

DESIGN
To select candidate plasma miRNAs for osteosarcoma detection and monitoring, we employed TLDA technique to screen expression levels of 739 miRNAs in pooled plasma samples from healthy controls and pre-operative osteosarcoma patients (each pooled from 10 individuals).
