TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CD11c+ splenic DCs day 7 after allo-HSCT.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of our study is to determine whether Atg16L1 deficiency leads to differences in the transcriptional profile of CD11c+ Dendritic Cells, ultimately leading to an increased inflammatory phenotype.

DESIGN
CD11c+ cell sorted splenic DCs were isolated from 8 week old WT and Atg16L1 hypomorphic mice from spleens of allo-HSCT recipients on day 7 were placed directly into TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). mRNA was isolated, amplified, and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip (MOE430A).
