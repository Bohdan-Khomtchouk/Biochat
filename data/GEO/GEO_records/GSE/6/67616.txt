TITLE
Integrative analysis of the acquisition of pluripotency in PGCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PGCs become pluripotent cells, we performed whole transcriptome analysis during the conversion of PGCs into EGCs.

DESIGN
There are 3 groups of gene expression profiles, time course analysis of PGCs to EGCs, forced expression of germ cell genes in ESCs, and chemical treatment of PGCs at day2 of the culture
