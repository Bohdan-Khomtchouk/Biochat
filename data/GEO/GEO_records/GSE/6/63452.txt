TITLE
Knock-in of PIK3CA-H1047R into MCF-10A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have compared the proteome, transcriptome and metabolome of two isogenic cell lines: MCF-10A, derived from human breast epithelium, and the mutant MCF-10A-H1047R. These cell lines differ by a single amino acid substitution (H1047R) caused by single nucleotide change in one allele of the PIK3CA gene which encodes the catalytic subunit p110Î± of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The H1047R mutation of PIK3CA is one of the most frequently encountered somatic cancer-specific mutations. In MCF-10A, this mutation induces an extensive cellular reorganization that far exceeds the known signaling activities of PI3K. The changes are highly diverse; with examples in structural protein levels, the DNA repair machinery and sterol synthesis. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals a highly significant concordance of the genes differentially expressed in MCF-10A-H1047R cells and the established protein and RNA signatures of basal breast cancer. No such concordance was found with the specific gene signatures of other histological types of breast cancer. Our data document the power of a single base mutation, inducing an extensive remodeling of the cell toward the phenotype of a specific cancer.

DESIGN
2 cell lines (H1047R and WT), 4 time points (0, 6, 12, 24 hours), 3 replicates
