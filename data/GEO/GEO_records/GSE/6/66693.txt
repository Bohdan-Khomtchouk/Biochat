TITLE
Drop-Seq analysis of mixtures of human (HEK) and mouse (3T3) cells (1000/100 STAMPs) at 12.5 cells per microliter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A cell supsension containing an equal mix of HEK and 3T3 cells was used in Drop-Seq, a novel technology for high-throughput single cell mRNAseq.  Cells were mixed at a final concentration of 12.5 cells per microliter in droplets.

DESIGN
An estimated 570 STAMPs were selected for amplification.
