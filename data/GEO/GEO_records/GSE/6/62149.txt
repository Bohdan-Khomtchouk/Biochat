TITLE
Epigenetic memory of the first cell fate decision prevents complete ES cell reprogramming into trophoblast [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming of ES cells towards the trophoblast lineage, and specifally into self-renewing TS cells, can seemingly be achieved by manipulation of transcription factors such as Cdx2 and Oct4, or modulation of signalling cascades, notably Ras signalling. Here we analyze the arising cells from such treatment in detail for the efficiency and completeness of the reprogramming process. We find that the reprogrammed cells retain an epigenetic and transcriptional memory of their ES cell origin and are not equal to bona fide trophectoderm-derived TS cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq expression analysis in conventional ES and TS cells and various ES-to-TS reprogramming models
