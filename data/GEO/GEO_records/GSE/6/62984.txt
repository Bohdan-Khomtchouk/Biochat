TITLE
Analysis to evaluate the presence of 5’ cap in intragenic lncRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA aliquots were digested with 5’-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (5'-exo) following pre-treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) to release the 5’ cap and render the RNA susceptible to 5’ exonuclease digestion (TAP+/5'-exo+). Two color array hybridizations were performed and  TAP+/5'-exo+ samples were compared with TAP-/5'-exo+ control samples.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, TAP+/5'-exo+  vs. TAP-/5'-exo+  treated total RNA samples. Biological replicates: 4 with dye swap
