TITLE
Role of TBC1D4 in mouse kidneys: Identification of compensatory mechanisms in the DCT of TBC1D4-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vitro studies identified TBC1D4 as an regulator of renal ion and water transporting proteins. However, TBC1D4-deficient mice did not show a defective renal salt and water homeostasis. With microarray analysis we aimed to decipher compensatory mechanisms in TBC1D4-deficient mice which might mask the renal phenotype already on transciptomic levels.

DESIGN
We used and compared mRNA of COPAS-sorted and -enriched distal convoluted tubule (DCT)-cells, known to express TBC1D4 at high levels, of 8-week old male homogenous C57/Bl6 mice of TBC1D4-deficient and wild-type mice.
