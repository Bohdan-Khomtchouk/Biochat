TITLE
Gene expression profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes: comparison between melanoma patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We focused on the major peripheral blood lymphocyte populations that may be involved in anti-tumor responses and negatively impacted by cancer, specifically CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, B cells and CD56dim natural killer cells. The pure cell subsets were stringently sorted by flow cytometry from PBMC samples. Gene expression profiles of these cell populations from melanoma patients were compared to healthy controls. Keywords: gene expression profile
