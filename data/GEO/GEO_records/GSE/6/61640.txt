TITLE
Genome-wide analysis expression of ileum samples from PGC-1β fl/? and iKOPGC-1β

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of metabolic pathway gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study is to assess mRNA level changes in metabolic genes in enterocytes from intestine specific PGC-1β konckout mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ileum samples from IKOPGC-1β mice was compared to the total RNA extracted from their wild-type littermates.
