TITLE
Transcriptional signature of wounded keratinocytes reveals selective roles for ERK1/2, P38 and PI3K signalling pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Covering denuded dermal surface after injury requires migration, proliferation and differentiation of skin keratinocytes. To clarify the major traits controlling these intermingled biological events, we surveyed the genomic modifications occurring during the course of a scratch closure of cultured human keratinocytes. Using a DNA microarray approach, we report the identification of 161 new markers of epidermal repair. Expression data, combined with functional analysis performed with specific inhibitors of ERK, p38[MAPK] and PI3 kinases, demonstrate that kinase pathways exert very selective functions by precisely controlling the expression of specific genes. Inhibition of the ERK pathway totally blocks the wound closure and inactivates many early transcription factors and EGF-type growth factors. P38[MAPK] inhibition only delays “healing”, probably in line with the control of genes involved in the propagation of injury-initiated signalling. In contrast, PI3 kinase inhibition accelerates the scratch closure and potentiates the scratch-dependent stimulation of three genes related to epithelial cell transformation, namely HAS3, HBEGF and Ets1. Our results define in vitro human keratinocyte wound closure as a reparation process resulting from a fine balance between positive signals controlled by ERK and p38[MAPK], and negative ones triggered off by PI3 kinase. The perturbation of any of these pathways might lead to dysfunction in the healing process, as those observed in pathological wounding phenotypes, such as hypertrophic scars or keloids.
