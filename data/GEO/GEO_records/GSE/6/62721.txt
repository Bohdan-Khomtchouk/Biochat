Molecular Mechanisms Regulating the Defects in Fragile X Syndrome Neurons Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells

SUMMARY
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We have previously generated FXS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients' fibroblasts. In this study, we aimed at unraveling the molecular phenotype of the disease. Our data revealed aberrant regulation of neural differentiation and axon guidance genes in FXS-derived neurons, which are regulated by the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST). Moreover, we found REST to be elevated in FXS-derived neurons. As FMRP is involved in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway we employed microRNA-array analyses and uncovered several miRNAs dysregulated in FXS-derived neurons. We found hsa-mir-382 to be down-regulated in FXS-derived neurons, and introduction of mimic-mir-382 into these neurons was sufficient to repress REST and up-regulate its axon guidance target genes. Our data link, FMRP and REST, through the miRNA pathway, and show a new aspect in the development of FXS.
