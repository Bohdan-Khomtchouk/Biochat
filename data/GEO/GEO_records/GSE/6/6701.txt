TITLE
Expression data from ischemia and reperfusion events in NRVMs using Coverslip Hypoxia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
NRVMs were subjected to varying durations of ischemia or ischemia+reperfusion using coverslip hypoxia.  Expression profiling was used to identify genes that are differentially regulated in either event. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying ischemia and reperfusion using Coverslip Hypoxia and identified distinct classes of genes regulated during these processes. Keywords: time course
