TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of fetal and adult liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression analysis of 92 adult and 14 fetal liver samples

DESIGN
The study includes 106 individuals, 14 fetal and 92 adult samples, no replicates. Liver samples from 14 fetuses were obtained at gestational week 8-12. Adult liver samples were collected from 50 organ donors who had met accidental death and 42 liver samples from patients undergoing liver resection due to malignant tumors, most commonly from patients with metastatic colon cancers. Liver biopsies from these patients were collected from 'healthy' tissue that showed no visible pathological changes compared to the adjacent tumor.
