TITLE
Changes in cellular microRNA expression induced by porcine circovirus type 2-encoded proteins.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We employed deep sequencing technology to uncover cellular miRNAs differentially regulated after expression of each of three PCV2-encoded open reading frames (ORFs) in porcine kidney epithelial PK15 cells.

DESIGN
Control PK15 vs. PCV2 ORF1, ORF2, ORF3-expressing PK15.
