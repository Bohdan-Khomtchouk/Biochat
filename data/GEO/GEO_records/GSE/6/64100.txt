TITLE
miRNA expression profile in MDA-MB-231 cells on LPA stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LPA is a natural bioactive lipid with growth factor-like functions due to activation of series of six G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1-6). In this study we determine the LPA induced early-miRNA expression profile in human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were serum starved for 24h and then stimulated with LPA (1ÂµM) for 45min. The controls were the serum starved unstimulated cells. Three replicates were included in this study.
