TITLE
Characterization of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum NtrC regulon by DNA Microarray analysis.

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
The Bradyrhizobium japonicum NtrC regulatory protein influences gene expression in response to changes in intracellular nitrogen status. Under conditions of low nitrogen, phosphorylation of NtrC results in up-regulation of a number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen acquisition. To better define the exact nature of NtrCâ€™s influence on gene expression, a ntrC mutation was created in B. japonicum and transcriptional profiling was performed by DNA microarray analysis of both the mutant and wild type strains.
