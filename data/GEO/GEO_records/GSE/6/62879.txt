TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of mouse Gata1- megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (G1MEs) expressing one of the two isoforms of GATA1: full-length (GATA1fl) or an amino-truncated form of GATA1 (GATA1s).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We transduced mouse Gata1- megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors with MIGRI-GFP vector expressing GATA1fl or GATA1s cDNAs. GFP-positive cells expressing one of the two isoforms of GATA1 were isolated by FACS 42 hours following transduction and used for microarray transcriptome analysis. At this time point, there was no apparent difference in the cell surface phenotypes between GATA1fl and GATA1s-expressing cells. Transcriptome data for G1ME/GATA1fl at 42h were deposited previously under GSE14980 (GSM374049, GSM374050, GSM374051), whereas G1ME/GATA1s at 42h are deposited here.

DESIGN
We performed differential expression analysis comparing mean expression levels of genes in G1ME cells at 42 hours after transduction with GATA1fl (3 replicates deposited previously under GSE14980: GSM374049, GSM374050, GSM374051) or GATA1s (3 replicates deposited here). All 6 samples were prepared the same way and analyzed on the same platform, Affymetrix Mouse Genome 420 2.0.
