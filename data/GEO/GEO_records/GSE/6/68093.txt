TITLE
Root development and responses are alerted by light

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Arabidopsis roots by the effect of light. Plant growth is sustained by a continuous cell division in meristems  followed by cell differentiation and elongation. We have found that in  Arabidopsis thaliana roots, flavonols play a key role in regulating the transition from cell division to differentiation. Using an engineered device to grow roots in darkness, but shoot in  light cycle, coupled with transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis, we deciphered that flavonols accumulation regulates proliferation-promoting levels of auxin-PLETHORA and superoxide anion (O2-). High flavonols levels restrict auxin transport and the PLETHORA gradient but also superoxide radical content, promoting an accelerated cell differentiation. Furthermore, cytokinin-SHY2 and H2O2-UPB1 pathways, which promote differentiation and, respectively, antagonize auxin and O2- activity, increase flavonols biosynthesis establishing mutual interactions among these pathways. Flavonols function as positional signals integrating hormonal and ROS pathways to determine final organ growth. This work analyze the effect of root illumination in gene transcription. Details of how plants and roots are grown are described in Silva et al. (submitted)

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA extracted from three independent experiments of Arabidopsis roots growing in presence of light and three  independent experiments of Arabidopsis roots growing without light.
