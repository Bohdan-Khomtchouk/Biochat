TITLE
Genome-wide miRNA-expression analysis after p53 activation in colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to comprehensively identify miRNA-expression changes after p53-activation a miRNA-Seq analysis was conducted after activation of a conditional p53 allele in SW480 cells.

DESIGN
SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells were subjected to miRNA-Seq analysis after 16 hours doxycycline-treatment. Kompetenzzentrum f√ºr fluoreszente Bioanalytik, Regensburg, Germany
