TITLE
Normal mouse skin lacking Hras

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oncogenic activating mutations in Ras genes are among the most common drivers of human disease. Treating mouse skin with the chemical carcinogen DMBA induces a characteristic mutation in Hras at codon 61. To understand how skin responds to a constitutive lack of Hras, we generated a cohort of Hras knockout mice.

DESIGN
A backcross was generated using male Mus spretus and female FVB/N Hras-/- mice; female F1 hybrids were mated with male FVB/N Hras -/- or Hras -/+ mice to generate a backcross population. This series contains mice that were Hras -/-. Mice were aged to 8 weeks and a tail skin sample was snap frozen.
