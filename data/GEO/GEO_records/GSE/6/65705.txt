TITLE
Characterization of the platelet transcriptome by RNA sequencing in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent technological advances have made transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) possible in cells with low RNA copy number including platelets. Resulting studies have used RNA-seq in platelets isolated from healthy individuals to characterize the platelet transcriptome. However, platelets, possibly through gene expression changes, contribute to the etiology of and response to cardiovascular disease and events. To address this, we performed the largest human platelet RNA-seq analysis to date in 34 platelet samples: 16 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 16 non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and 2 controls.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of platelet samples from 34 individuals: 16 with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 16 with non-STEMI, and 2 non-myocardial infarction controls
