TITLE
Affymetrix CytoscanHD data for genomic plasticity of osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify chromosomal aberrations during passaging of parental SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells with low metastatic potential and of SAOS-2-derived LM5 cells with increased metastatic potential

DESIGN
DNA of early and late passage SAOS-2 and LM5 cells was analyzed by Affymetrix Cytoscan HD genotyping arrays
