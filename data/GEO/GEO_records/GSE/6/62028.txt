TITLE
Differences in gene expression between fast and slow muscle or between normal and denervated slow muscles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fast and slow skeletal muscles show different characteristics and phenotypes. This data obtained from microarray includes the comparison of normal fast plantaris and slow soleus muscles of adult rats. Characters of slow muscle are strongly dependent on the level of muscular activity. Denervation silences the muscular activity. Therefore, we determined the effects of denervation on gene expression in slow soleus muscle of adult rats.

DESIGN
Denervation was performed by transection (~5 mm) of left sciatic nerve at the gluteal level. No treatments were made in the normal control rats. Sampling of soleus and/or plantaris was performed in both normal and experimental groups 28 days after the surgery.
