TITLE
Cultured A549 lung cancer cells treated with actinomycin D and sapphyrin PCI-2050

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to characterize changes in gene expression in response to the anti-cancer agent sapphyrin PCI-2050.  Cultured A549 human lung cancer cells were treated with sapphyrin PCI-2050 or actinomycin D, a known transcripitonal inhibitor.  The gene expression profiles of drug-treated and control A549 cultures were determined using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Further details are provided in our published manuscript: < > . Keywords: responses to treatments with anti-cancer agents
