TITLE
Microarray analysis of the therapeutic effects of the mixture of salvianolic acids from Salvia miltiorrhiza and total flavonoids from Anemarrhena asphodeloides on sulfur mustard-induced damages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further investigate the potential molecular basis of the therapeutic effects of the mixture of salvianolic acids from Salvia miltiorrhiza and total flavonoids from Anemarrhena asphodeloides (MSTF) on sulfur mustard (SM) damage, gene expression analysis was conducted on rats liver tissues using microarrays.

DESIGN
Rats were randomly assigned to one of the three following treatment groups (10 rats per group): normal control, SM and SM + MSTF. SM was dissolved in propylene glycol. The SM was applied with subcutaneous injection as a single dose of 3.5 mg/kg body weight equivalent to 0.7 LD50. The equivalent volume of solvent was given to control rats. MSTF (120 mg/kg body weight/day) dissolved in double distilled water were administered intragastrically to the rats 1 h after SM treatment. Twenty-four hours following SM treatment, the rats were subjected to anesthesia and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Liver was dissected out from each animal. 3-4 of these liver tissues were processed for the microarray experiment.
