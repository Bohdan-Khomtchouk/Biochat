TITLE
Transcriptional profile Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 : 1.5mM gallic acid (GA) treated cells

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling was used to characterize the response of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 human isolate during challenge with 1.5 mM gallic acid (GA). Twelve independent experiments were performed and mixed at random in groups of four for total of three RNA samples. The transcriptional profile reveals a massive induction of genes involved in transport and decarboxilation of gallic acid.
