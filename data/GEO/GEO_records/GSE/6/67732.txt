TITLE
crpD2 mutant vs Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
The DNA binding domain of crp gene was deleted from WP3 genome to construct the WP3ΔcrpD2 strain. The two strains were cultured at 20°C and the transcriptional profiles were compared.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates sample and 6 technical replicates for each experiment
