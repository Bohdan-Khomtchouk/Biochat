TITLE
Proteogenomics-based identification of the repertoire of human MHC class I-associated peptides

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have develop a proteogenomics-based approach for identification of human MHC class I-associated peptides, including those deriving from polymorphisms, mutations and non-canonical reading frames

DESIGN
RNA-seq of human EBV-infected B lymphoblasts derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from volunteers Please note that GSM1641204 and GSM1641205 are reanalyzed and duplicated sample records of GSM1186811 and GSM1186812, respectively, for the convenient retrieval of the complete raw data from SRA
