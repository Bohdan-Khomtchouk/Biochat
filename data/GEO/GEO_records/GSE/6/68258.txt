TITLE
Illumina Infinium whole-genome SNP-CN data from cell lines originating from patients with multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed Illumina Infinium whole-genome SNP-CN profiling of KMS11, MM.1S, and RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell lines to detect gene copy number variants distinct to each cell line

DESIGN
Three multiple myeloma cell lines (KMS11, MM.1S, and RPMI8226)
