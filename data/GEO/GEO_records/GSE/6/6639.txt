SUMMARY
Background: Translation deregulation is an important mechanism that causes aberrant cell growth, proliferation and survival. eIF4E, the mRNA 5 prime cap–binding protein, plays a major role in translational control. To understand how eIF4E affects cellular proliferation and cell survival, we identified mRNA targets that are translationally responsive to eIF4E. Methodology/ principal findings: Microarray analysis of polysomal mRNA from an eIF4E-inducible NIH 3T3 cell line was performed. Induction of eIF4E expression resulted in increased translation of a defined set of mRNAs; many of the mRNAs are novel targets, including those that encode large- and small-subunit ribosomal proteins and cell growth–related factors. eIF4E overexpression also led to augmented translation of mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic proteins, which conferred resistance to endoplasmic reticulum–mediated apoptosis. Conclusions/ significance: Our results shed new light on the mechanisms by which eIF4E prevents apoptosis and transforms cells. Downregulation of eIF4E and its downstream targets is a therapeutic option for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. Keywords: time course
