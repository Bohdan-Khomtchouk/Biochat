TITLE
Global gene expression profiling identifies new therapeutic targets in acute Kawasaki disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile in Kawasaki patients at acute and convalescent phase with different clinical outcomes were investigated.

DESIGN
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying KD, we investigated the acute and convalescent whole blood transcriptional profiles of 171 KD subjects and compared them with the transcriptional profiles of pediatric patients with confirmed bacterial or viral infection, and with healthy control children. We also investigated the transcript abundance in patients with different intravenous immunoglobulin treatment responses and different coronary artery outcomes.
