TITLE
Screening of genes activated by phsiological E2F induced by gorwth stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes activated by physiological E2F, we examined gene expression profiles using human normal fibroblasts (HFFs), which were starved of serum and re-stimulated with serum.

DESIGN
To identify genes activated by growth stimulation, human normal fibroblasts (HFFs) were starved of serum for 48 hr, re-stimulated with serum or left serum-starved for 18 hr, and harvested. Gene expression profiles of each sample were examined by DNA microarray.
