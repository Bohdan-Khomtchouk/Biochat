TITLE
Characterization of Anatomical, Macromolecular, and Gene Expression Changes in the Retinal and Retinal Pigmented Epithelium of the nm3342 Mouse: A Potential Model of Serous Retinal Detachment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize gene expression changes in mice following serous retinal detachments, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a tool to identify genes with the potential effects on the neural retina as well as retinal pigmented epithelium.   Total RNA was harvested from nm3342 (mutant) and age-matched wild-type (C57Bl/6J) mice at P30 or P365 for examination using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Retinas and retinal pigmented epithelium was harvested from both age-matched mutant and wild-type mice.
