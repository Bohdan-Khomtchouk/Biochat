TITLE
Expression data from Murine T cell in response to cycloheximide treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cycloheximide has been used for inhibiting protein synthesis in order to identify IL-2 direct targeted genes in T cells, but the effects of cycloheximide itself on genomewide genes are not well defined We conducted a global analysis of cycloheximide regulated genes in mouse T cell line CTLL-2 using Affymetrix mouse genome array, and identified 213 genes differentially expressed (?1.5-fold change) in response to cycloheximide 30min after adding cylcoheximide to T cells cultured without IL-2 for 14 hours. These genes involve in a number biological processes. Keywords: stress response
