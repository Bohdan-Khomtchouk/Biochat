TITLE
Synergism between PPARα and glucocorticoid receptor signaling promotes self-renewal of BFU-E erythroid progenitors and increases red cell production [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analyses of gene expression by RNA-Seq in mouse E14.5 fetal liver burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) cells untreated or treated by dexamethasone (DEX) with or without PPARα agonist GW7647.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on enriched populations of mouse BFU-E isolated from E14.5 fetal liver, as well as BFU-E enriched cells treated with Dex ± GW7647.
