TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of prefrontal medial cortex, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens of alcohol-preferring and nonpreferring rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Animal models provide opportunity to study neurobiological aspects of human alcoholism.  Changes in gene expression have been implicated in mediating brain function, including reward system and addiction.  The current study aimed to identify novel genes that may underlie ethanol preference.  Microarray analysis comparing gene expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal medial cortex (mPFC) was performed in two rat strains selected for extreme levels of ethanol preference - Warsaw High Preferring (WHP) and Warsaw Low Preferring (WLP).  The identified candidate genes may underlie differential ethanol preference in rat model of alcoholism. This study was supported through funding from the following grants: Polish Scientific Committee Grant 2011/03/N/NZ29/05222, Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education Grants “Iuventus Plus” (IP2011 030371) and N N519 657940.

DESIGN
This is analysis of 18 RNA samples, including 9 technical replicates.  Two strains of rats selected for extreme levels of ethanol preference (low preferring WLP and high preferring WHP) were compared.  Three brain areas (nucleus accumbens, prefrontal medial cortex and hippocampus) were studied.  For each brain area, 6 RNA samples (including 3 technical replicates) were analyzed.  Each RNA sample consist of of equal amounts of total RNA from 3 male rats.  Comparisons: Nucleus accumbens of WHP vs. Nucleus accumbens of WLP; Prefrontal medial cortex of WHP vs. Prefrontal medial cortex of WLP; Hippocampus of WHP vs. Hippocampus of WLP. 3 biological replicates in each comparison.
