TITLE
Analysis of wheat straw grown Trichoderma reesei gene expression as influenced by L-methionine in the medium

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Wheat straw grown cultures of T. reesei QM9414 were supplemented with 100 ÂµM L-methionine and  the genome wide gene expression monitored in order to find novel L-Methionine repressible genes.
