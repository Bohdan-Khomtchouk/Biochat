TITLE
RNA-seq of poly(A)-/ribo- or poly(A)+ RNAs from human and mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used RNA-seq to examine circular RNAs from poly(A)-/ribo- RNAs in human and mouse embryonic stem cells, and from from RNase R treated poly(A)-/ribo- RNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
In order to identify novel circular RNAs from different species
