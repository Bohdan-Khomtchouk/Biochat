TITLE
Nilotinib (Tasigna) in the Treatment of Early Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis: An Open-Label, Pilot Clinical Trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the safety, efficacy, and molecular change associated with treatment of patients with early, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) with nilotinib (Tasignaâ„¢).

DESIGN
In this open-label pilot trial 6 adult patients with early dcSSc received nilotinib. Primary endpoints were safety and change in modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) after 6 months. Lesional skin biopsies at baseline, 6 and 12 months of treatment were assessed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and DNA microarray.
