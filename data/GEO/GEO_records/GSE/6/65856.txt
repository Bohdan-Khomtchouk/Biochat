TITLE
Expression data from Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Expressing T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T cells isolated from healthy donors were transduced with non-tonically signaling CARs or tonically signaling CARs, each with CD28z or 4-1BB costimulatory domains

DESIGN
Human T cells isolated from healthy donors were transduced with non-tonically signaling CARs or tonically signaling CARs, each with CD28z or 4-1BB costimulatory domains
