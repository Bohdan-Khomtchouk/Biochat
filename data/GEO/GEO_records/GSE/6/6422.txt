Populus tissue analysis

Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptome in roots, young and mature leaves, nodes and internodes in the reference genotype Nisqually-1 and identified a core set of approximately 10,000 genes expressed in common among vegetative organs. Quantitative contrasts of transcript levels among organs identified expected patterns of expression associated with organ-specific physiological processes, although a surprisingly high number of defense-related genes were preferentially expressed in young leaves and nodes. Application of a novel runs test established an objective criterion for the identification of genomic regions in which adjacent genes were expressed more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting the presence of chromatin domains. Comparisons between P. trichocarpa Nisqually-1 and the P. tremula X P. alba hybrid INRA 717-1B4 revealed similar expression patterns, particularly in stems. Although a comparison to Arabidopsis thaliana revealed similar proportions of expressed genes in leaves and stems, there was very little conservation between rank correlations of expression patterns.
