TITLE
Human induced pluripotent stem cells: diploid, chr7q deletion, spontaneous chr7 correction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis, a) comparing isogenic karyotypically normal iPSCs to del7q-iPSCs, b) comparing del7q-iPSCs to spontaneously corrected iPSCs. The chr7q deletion results in reduced expression levels of a large number of genes in the chr7q deleted region

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, del7q-iPSCs vs. isogenic normal iPSCs and del7q-iPSCs vs spontaneously corrected-iPSCs. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3  del7q-iPSC replicates and 3 spontaneously corrected-iPSC replicates
