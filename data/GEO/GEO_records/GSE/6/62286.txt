TITLE
Comparison of microRNA expression between prostate adenocarcinoma cells, DU-145 and immortalized normal cells, PWR-1E

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The primary goal of this experiment was to determine the endogenous miRNA that are differentially expressed between prostate adenocarcinoma cells, DU-145 and prostate immortalized epithelial cells, PWR-1E. Subsequently, we performed other analysis with BLAST and in silico algorithm searches to determine the appropriate miRNA that could regulate a novel gene MIEN1.

DESIGN
We used two samples, namely, DU-145 and PWR-1E, independently, for miRNA expression
