TITLE
Comparative analysis of transcriptional profiles of adult Schistosoma japonicum from different laboratory animals and the natural host, water buffalo

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Although numerous researches on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, the comparison of gene expression profiles of S. japonicum from the different laboratory animals and natural hosts is still a gap. We systematically compared the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. The findings of this study provide the basis for schistosomiasis research in different mammalian hosts at transcriptional level and valuable resource for the screening of anti-schistosomal intervention targets.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of  adult male and female worms from BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and water buffaloes were analyzed.
