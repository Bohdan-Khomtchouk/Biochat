TITLE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical study of critically ill patients with sepsis and sepsis-related ARDS with whole blood RNA collected within the first 24 hours of admission Goal of the study was to determine whether biologically relevant genes were identified  to be differentially expressed genes in patients with sepsis alone and sepsis with ARDS

DESIGN
Prospective observational study, case cohort design
