TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts of NIPBL-haploinsufficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cohesinopathies are characterized by mutations in the cohesin complex. Mutations in NIPBL, a cohesin loader, result in Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). CdLS is a congenital genetic disorder distinguished by craniofacial dysmorphism, abnormal upper limb development, delayed growth, severe cognitive retardation, and multiple organ malformations.It has been suggested that CdLS is caused by defects in the cohesin network that alter gene expression and genome organization. However, the precise molecular etiology of CdLS is largely unclear. To gain insights, we sequenced mRNAs isolated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts of both WT and NIPBL-haploinsufficient mice and compared their transcriptomes.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression of WT and NIPBL+/- mice by RNA-seq
