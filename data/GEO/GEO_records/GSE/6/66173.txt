TITLE
Genetic disruption of COX-1 inhibits multiple oncogenic pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA sequencing in isogenic models of COX-1 proficient (OV3/SCR) and COX-1 deficient (OV3/COX1KD) OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. COX-1 knockdown was associated with a coordinated anti-oncogenic phenotype, with growth, angiogenesis, migration/invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition among the pathways down-regulated.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed at Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
