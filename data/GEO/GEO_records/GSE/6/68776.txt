TITLE
Exon array profiles of primary human Ewing sarcoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix exon array data were generated from total RNA that was isolated from localized Ewing sarcoma biopsy specimens. Expression of transcript summarized data was compared to data generated from normal stem cells and normal adult tissues.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 32 archived tumor biopsy specimens obtained from patients with localized Ewing sarcoma. Samples were analyzed by Affymetrix exon arrays using standard procedures. Data were compared to human neural crest and mesenchymal stem cells (in triplicate: GSE21511) as well as to 33 normal adult tissues (Affymetrix tissue controls; 11 tissues in triplicate: cel files obtained from: ). Normalization was achieved by RMA using Parkek Genomics Suite
