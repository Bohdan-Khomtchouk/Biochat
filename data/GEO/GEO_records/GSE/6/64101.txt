TITLE
Pit-1 overexpression in the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to evaluate Pit-1-induced genes in the MCF-7 cell line The Pit-1 transcription factor (also known as POU1F1) plays a critical role in cell differentiation during organogenesis of the anterior pituitary in mammals and is a transcriptional activator for pituitary gene transcription. Increased expression of Pit-1 has been reported in human tumorigenic breast cells. Here, we found that Pit-1 overexpression or knockdown in human breast cancer cell lines induced profound phenotypic changes in the expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. In immunodeficient mice, Pit-1 overexpression induced tumoral growth and promoted metastasis in lung. In patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and node-positive tumors elevated expression of Pit-1 was significantly and independently associated with the occurrence of distant metastasis. These findings suggest that Pit-1 could help to make a more accurate prognosis in patients with node positive breast cancer and may represent a new therapeutic target (Journal of Clinical Investigation 2010, 120:4289-4302)

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 (control, two samples as condition, named C1 and C2) or the pcDNA3-Pit-1 overexpression vector (two samples as condition, named 1+ and 2+) for 48 hours.
