TITLE
DNA methylation, RNA Pol2 binding and H3-K4me2 of human promoters in WI38 primary fibroblasts and sperm cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the function of DNA methylation at cis-regulatory regions and its impact on gene expression, we measured methylation, RNA polymerase II and histone modifications at 24.000 promoters in primary human soma and germline cells. Keywords: DNA methylation, MeDIP
