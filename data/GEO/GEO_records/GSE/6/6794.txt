TITLE
Expression data from 3T3-L1 adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3T3-L1 fibroblasts are a commonly used in vitro model for adipogenesis.  When induced with hormones, they differentiate into mature fat cells.  Here, microarrays were used to study 3T3-L1 adipose differentiation through time. Keywords: time course
