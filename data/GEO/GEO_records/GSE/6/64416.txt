TITLE
Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields enhance neuronal differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells on graphene-based substrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Graphene-based substrate has efficient neuronal differentiation of hMSCs. Stimulatory effects of graphene on hMSCs neurogenesis can be enhanced by ELF-EMF exposure and it is mediated by enhancement of cell adhesion accompanied by intracellular signal pathway. We used microarrays to assess up-regulated genes in human gene expression profiles during neurogenesis induced by ELF-EMF exposure on graphene.

DESIGN
3 groups (HMSCs grown in neuronal medium on glass, graphene, graphene under ELF-EMF exposure) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain total human gene expression. To that end, we hand-selected up-regulated gene involved in neurogenesis, extracellular matrix, and cell migration.
