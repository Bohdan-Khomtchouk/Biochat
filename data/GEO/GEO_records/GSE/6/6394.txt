TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for RNA Polymerase II using monoclonal antibody (8WG16) on GM06990 Cells [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase II ChIP-chip using monoclonal antibody (8WG16) performed on GM06990 cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts). Goal was to identify Pol II-binding regions. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip
