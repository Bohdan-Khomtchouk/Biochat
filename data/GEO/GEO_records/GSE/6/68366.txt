TITLE
MiRNA expression profile in human CD34+/CD105- cells derived from the renal artery subsequent to long warm ischemia compared short warm ischemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNA regulate the maintenance, differentiation and function of stem cells and progenitor cells. miRNA expression of progenitor cells located in the adventital layer of arterial vessels has not been characterized in either animal or human models.  Further it is unknown if local arterial miRNA expression profiles change after injury of end organs supplied blood by these arterial conduits.  CD34+/CD105- cells were extracted and analyzed for changes in miRNA expression after kidney specific ischemic injury.

DESIGN
CD34+/CD105- cells were isolated from renal artery after short warm ischemic time in living donor kidney explants and long warm ischemic time following radical nephrectomy for renal cell cancer
