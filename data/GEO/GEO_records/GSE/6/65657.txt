TITLE
miRNA expression profile in angiosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We first  use microRNA expression profiles to find miRNA expression signatures in 3 cases of human angiosarcoma and capillary hemangiomauman, then RT-PCR for large sample verification. Through the bioinformatics prediction of its target genes, we study its function and aim to find the new molecular markers and therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
We identified the miRNA expression signatures in human angiosarcomas and capillary hemangiomas by using microRNA expression profiles
