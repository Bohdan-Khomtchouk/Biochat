TITLE
Gene expression profiling of perinatal or adult regulatory T cells (Tregs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative analysis of gene expression of 3 different experiments; 1. Perinate or adult-tagged GFP+YFP+ and bulk GFP+YFP- Tregs, 2. FL or BM-derived Tregs 3. Perinate or adult thymic Tregs.

DESIGN
1. Foxp3-eGFP-Cre-ERT2 x Rosa26-YFP lineage-reporter mice were injected ip with tamoxifen (4 injections, every third day) between 0-10 (perinate) or 35-45 (adult) days of age, and keep until 8 weeks of age. Perinate or adult-tagged GFP+YFP+ cells and bulk GFP+YFP- were double-sorted. 2. Hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from E18.5 fetal liver of CD45.1 congenic mice or from bone marrow of 5 weeks old CD45.2 B6 mice via negative selection of Thy1.2+ cells. The two populations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and were iv-transferred into irradiated (1000 rad) Rag-1-KO mice. FL or BM-derived Tregs were double sorted after reconstitution. 3. Foxp3-GFP+ Tregs were double-sorted from perinate (4 days old) or adult (5 weeks old) thymi. RNA from whole samples was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
