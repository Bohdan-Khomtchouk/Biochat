TITLE
Genomewide poly(A) site mapping for YJR141W and related mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genomewide characterization of  YJR141W role in mRNA polyadenylation.

DESIGN
Poly(A) site usage was quantified using the 3'T-fill aproach for 3 mutants and a control (BY4741) S. cerevisiae strain. Biological duplicates were analyzed for tsa685 (pcf11-2::KanR; his3^1 leu2^0 ura3^0 met15^0 pcf11-2 BY4741) and tsa801 (CFT2-1::KanR; his3^1 leu2^0 ura3^0 met15^0 cft2-1 BY4741). Only one replicate was analyzed for tsa1248 (YJR141W-PH::KanR; his3^1leu2^0 ura3^0 met15^0 yjr141w-ph BY4741) and BY4741 (Mata; his3^1leu2^0 ura3^0 met15^0). A second batch of libraries (marked as " B " ) the same starting RNA was performed. The second batch contains biological triplicates for BY4741 and tsa801; and biological duplicates for tsa685 and tsa1248. Samples sharing the same biological origin are labeled with the same roman numeral.
