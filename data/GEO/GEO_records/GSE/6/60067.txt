Cervical neoplasia genomes

SUMMARY
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), also known as cervical dysplasia, is premalignant lesions of the cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that shows abnormal growth of squamous cells in the cervix epithelium. Given the evidence suggesting that differences may exist between CIN and CSCC, we hypothesize that progression may be mediated by subpopulation selection or by acquisition of additional alterations, including gene mutations or chromosomal alterations. In this study, we analyzed cervical CIN, microinvasive carcinoma (MIC) and CSCC by whole-exome sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and found that CIN genomes harbored fewer mutations (especially fewer driver mutations) and copy number alterations (CNAs), suggesting that additional genomic alterations might burst onto the CIN genome at the final stage of CIN progression to CSCC or an early stage of CSCC.

DESIGN
To find genomic differences between CIN and CSCC, a total of eight cervical neoplasia genomes (three CINs, one MIC, and four CSCC genomes) were analyzed in this study. The hospital pathology department confirmed pathologic features of the cervical neoplasias. All of the picked areas from tumor and normal areas were frozen, cut, and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H & E). Two pathologists selected cases with rich tumor cell population (at least 70%), which were subsequently used in the study. Copy number profiling was performed using Agilent 180K platform according to the manufacturer's protocol.
