ATM-dependent regulation of gene expression upon DNA damage in human fibroblasts

SUMMARY
The relationships between profiles of global gene expression and DNA damage checkpoint functions were studied in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT).  Three telomerase-expressing AT fibroblast lines displayed the expected hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and defects in DNA damage checkpoints. Profiles of global gene expression in AT cells were determined at 2, 6 and 24 h after treatment with 1.5 Gy IR or sham-treatment, and were compared to those previously recognized in normal human fibroblasts.  Under basal conditions 160 genes or ESTs were differentially expressed in AT and normal fibroblasts, and these were associated by gene ontology with insulin-like growth factor binding and regulation of cell growth. Upon DNA damage, 1091 gene mRNAs were changed in at least two of the three AT cell lines.  When compared with the 1811 genes changed in normal human fibroblasts after the same treatment, 715 were found in both AT and normal fibroblasts, including most genes categorized by gene ontology into cell cycle, cell growth and DNA damage response pathways.  However, the IR-induced changes in these 715 genes in AT cells usually were delayed or attenuated in comparison to normal cells. The reduced change in DNA-damage-response genes and the attenuated repression of cell-cycle-regulated genes may account for the defects in cell cycle checkpoint function in AT cells.  The observation of attenuated and not ablated checkpoint responses in AT cells supports a hypothesis that the ATM- and rad3-related checkpoint kinase ATR also responds to IR-induced DNA damage and complements ATM signaling.
