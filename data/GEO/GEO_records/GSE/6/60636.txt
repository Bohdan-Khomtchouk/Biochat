TITLE
Methylated CpG Island Recovery Assay (MIRA)-chip from Sirt1 wild-type (Sirt1+/+) and knock-out (Sirt1-/-) murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proper DNA-methylation is inevitable for normal development and this epigenetic program is dynamically reprogrammed especially around embryo implantation. Accordingly, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from inner cell mass in pre-implantation embryo exhibit the lowest DNA methylation level compared with differentiated tissue cells to ensure their pluripotency and germ-line potency. Methylated CpG Island Recovery Assay (MIRA) coupled chip DNA methylome analysis demonstrated that Sirt1 deficiency increases the abnormal DNA methylation especially on the a subtype of imprinted and germ-line development genes.

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA methylome between Sirt1+/+ and Sirt1-/- murine ESCs
