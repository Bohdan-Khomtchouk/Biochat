TITLE
Foxm1 Transcription Factor Accelerates Formation of Lung Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1 or Foxm1b) protein (previously called HFH-11B, Trident, Win, or MPP2) is abundantly expressed in human non-small cell lung cancers where it transcriptionally induces expression of genes essential for proliferation of tumor cells. In this study, we used Rosa26-Foxm1 transgenic mice, in which the Rosa26 promoter drives ubiquitous expression of Foxm1 transgene, to identify new signaling pathways regulated by Foxm1. Lung tumors in Rosa26-Foxm1 mice were induced using the 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)/ butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) lung tumor initiation/ promotion protocol. MCA/BHT-treated Rosa26-Foxm1 mice displayed a significant increase in the proliferation of lung tumor cells as well as in the number and size of lung adenomas. Elevated tumor formation in Rosa26-Foxm1 transgenic lungs was associated with persistent pulmonary inflammation, macrophage infiltration and increased expression of Cdc25C phosphatase, cyclin E2, chemokine ligands Cxcl5, Cxcl1 and Ccl3, cathepsins, and Matrix metalloprotease 12, all of which stimulate signaling pathways essential for cellular proliferation, pulmonary inflammation and remodeling. Lung tumors from Rosa26-Foxm1 mice displayed increased expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), whereas diminished Cox-2 levels were observed in Foxm1-deficient lung tumors from Mx-Cre Foxm1 fl/fl mice. Cell culture experiments with A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells demonstrated that depletion of Foxm1 by either siRNA transfection or treatment with Foxm1-inhibiting ARF 26-44 peptide significantly reduced Cox-2 expression. Foxm1 protein bound to the –3479/–3461 and –7826/–7795 bp regions of the human Cox-2 promoter, indicating that the human Cox-2 gene is a direct transcriptional target of Foxm1 in lung tumor cells.
