TITLE
Gene expression in homozygous mbl/axin1 zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Homozygous masterblind (mbl-/-) zebrafish exhibit reduced or absent eyes and telecephalon, and the expansion of the diencephalic fates to the front of the brain. A missense mutation in the GSK3-binding domain of zebrafish axin1, a scaffolding protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, results in the mbl phenotype. In an effort to identify and study the genes affected by Wnt signaling, we used a 14,000-oligonucleotide-gene microarray to determine differentially expressed genes in mbl/axin1 (-/-) and wild type control zebrafish embryos and larvae. Keywords: zebrafish, Danio rerio, wild-type mbl, axin1, development
