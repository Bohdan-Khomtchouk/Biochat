TITLE
Expression data from livers from mice receiving high-fat (HF) diets supplemented with different berries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis was employed to analyze hepatic gene expression in mice that were protected against HF-induced obesity and liver steatosis (ie HF diets supplemented with lingonberries, blackcurrants or bilberries) and compare to mice who were not protected (HF control) or even experienced increased obesity and fatty liver (HF diet with açai). The study was done to increase understanding of underlying mechanisms of the observed effects.

DESIGN
Livers were taken from male C57BL/6JBomTac mice receiving low-fat diet (10% kcal fat), HF diet (45% kcal fat) or HF diets supplemented with 20% w/w of freeze-dried berries (lingoberries, blackcurrants, bilberries or açai) for 13 weeks (n=6). The microarrays were performed using MouseWG-6 v2.0 Whole-Genome Expression Beadchips according to Illuminas standard protocol.
