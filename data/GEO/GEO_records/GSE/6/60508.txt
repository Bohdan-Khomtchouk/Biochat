TITLE
Expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 and selected RNA silencing mutant plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in several Arabidopsis thaliana mutants (nrpd1, nrpe1, ros1 dml2 dml3) compared to  wild-type Col-0. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Le et al. 'DNA demethylases target promoter transposable elements to positively regulate stress responsive genes in Arabidopsis' . Genome Biology (in press).

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from three week-old plants grown on Murashige Skoog sucrose agar. The number of biological replicates for each plant genotype were as follows: Col-0 (3 biological replicates), rdd (2), nrpd1 (2) and nrpe1 (2) respectively. Each array contains 60-mer probes targeting 39,042 genes (TAIR 9.0) with 4 probes per gene.
