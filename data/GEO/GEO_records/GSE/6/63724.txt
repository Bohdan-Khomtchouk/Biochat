TITLE
MicroRNA-188 regulates age-related switch between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation [osteoblast]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified microRNA-188 differentially expressed in the BMSCs of aged and young mice and influented on BMSCs differentiation with ageing. Then we used microarrays to detail the osteogenic gene expression during osteogenic differention of BMSCs from 188KO mice.

DESIGN
BMSCs isolated from WT and 188KO mice were cultured with osteogenic induction medium for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
