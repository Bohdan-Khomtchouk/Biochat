TITLE
Sharp changes in gene expression levels along germinal layers distinguish the development of gyrencephaly

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
Gyrencephalic species develop folds in the cerebral cortex in a stereotypic manner, but the genetic mechanisms underlying this unique patterning process are unknown. We present a large-scale transcriptomic analysis of individual germinal layers in the developing cortex of the gyrencephalic ferret, comparing between regions prospective of fold and fissure. We find unique transcriptional signatures in each germinal compartment, indicating that thousands of genes are differentially expressed between regions, including ~80% of genes mutated in human cortical malformations. Regional differences result from sharp changes in gene expression levels, which occur at multiple locations across the developing cortex of ferret and human, but not in the lissencephalic mouse. These complex expression patterns emerge sequentially during development and map the eventual location of specific folds and fissures. Our findings demonstrate that step-wise gene expression maps within germinal layers distinguish the development of gyrencephaly from lissencephaly, and may contribute to identify novel genes responsible for human malformations.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed with 3 replicates of each of them. Comparisons were done taking different reference sample depending on the comparison ( Usually taking the SG as reference)
