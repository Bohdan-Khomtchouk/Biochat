TITLE
Ovarian Cancer prognosis: Different methylation in patients with PFS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of differently methylated regions of CpG islands in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissue from patients with progression free survival < 3 years (worse outcome) vs. patients with PFS > 3 years (good outcome, relapse free until last follow up). Patients were homogenous in regard to clinical (FIGO III/IV, serous histology, optimally resected (macroscopically tumor free), platin-taxan chemotherapy) and molecular properties (immunohistochemistry for p16, BRCA1, Ki67 and p53)).

DESIGN
Comparative hybridization of enriched, methylated DNA from 2 pools of good vs. 2 pools of worse prognosis EOC (each pool with DNA from 3 tumors)
