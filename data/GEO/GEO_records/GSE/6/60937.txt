TITLE
Gene profiles of HUVECs in different phosphate concentration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyperphosphatemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease. High inorganic phosphorus can induce endothelial cell apoptosis, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood. This study addresses this knowledge gap.Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed gene profiles in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in high phosphate (3.0 mM)  normal phosphate (1.0 mM) medium and low phosphate( 0.5mM).

DESIGN
Differential gene expression in HUVECs seeded in high phosphate (3.0 mM ) medium ,normal phosphate ( 1.0 mM ) medium and simulated hypophosphatemia (0.5mM) were identified using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays ( Affymetrix ). Three chips were used to minimize the random error in each group.
