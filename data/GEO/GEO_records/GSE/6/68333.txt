TITLE
Expression data from the study of the oestrognic activity of glabridin in Ishikawa cells in comparison to 17β-oestradiol (17β-E2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The general objective of this study was to investigate the effects of glabridin in Ishikawa cells in comparison to 17β-oestradiol by studying its mechanism of action via Affymetrix GeneChip® PrimeViewTM array

DESIGN
The treatments were the unctreated control, 10µM glabridin, 100nM glabridin, 1nM 17β-E2 and the combination treatment of 1nM 17β-E2 with 100nM glabridin. The cells were treated for 72 hours and the RNA were extracted for microarray and RT-qPCR study.
