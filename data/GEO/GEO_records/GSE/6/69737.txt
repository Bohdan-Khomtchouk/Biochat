TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human cell lines established from normal patient's fibroblast and BWS patients with known mutations in the CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out in one normal human fibroblast cell line established from normal people and three different cell lines established from BWS patients to characterize the molecular mechanisms relevant to the etiology of BWS and tumor development. Whole-transcriptome sequencing of three BWS fibroblastic cell lines was established from patients with mutation in the CDKN1C mutation (CDKN1C+ cell line), and loss of methylation in the KCNQ1OT1 region (KvDMR+ cell line: with KvDMR molecular defect, and KvDMR- cell line: absence of KvDMR molecular defect but it had some clinical signs of BWS)

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of the 4 different cell lines
