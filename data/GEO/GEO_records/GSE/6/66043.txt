TITLE
Murine embryonic stem cells synthesize retinoic acid to promote their own spontaneous differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are derived from blastocyst-stage embryos and are thought to be functionally equivalent to the inner cell mass in their developmental potential. ESCs pluripotency is maintained through a complex interplay of different signaling pathways and a network of transcription factors, which is centered around Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog. Although, in general, much is known about this pluripotency self-renewal circuitry, the molecular events that lead ESC to exit from pluripotency and begin differentiation are currently less known. Retinoic acid, an active metabolite of the vitamin A (retinol), plays important and pleiotropic roles in vertebrate embryonic development and ESC differentiation. Here we demonstrate that RA promotes early steps of ESC differentiation, and that ESC increase their capacity to synthesize RA during spontaneous differentiation as embryoid bodies, up-regulating the RA biosynthetic pathway components RDH1, RDH10, ADH3, RALDH2, and CRABP2.

DESIGN
Microarray derived from total RNA of mESC not treated or treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 2 hours.
