TITLE
Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of Dhh1 complexes reveals mitochondrial RNP complex association with yeast P-bodies

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
P-bodies (PB) are cytoplasmic RNP complexes that aggregate into foci when cells are exposed to stress.  While the core components and stress response of PB and related RNP granules are conserved, it remains unclear how and why cells assemble mRNP complexes into granule foci during stress. We use mass spectrometry and antibody-based microarray to analyze proteins and RNA, respectively, that are immunoisolated with the core PB protein Dhh1-GFP. Analysis of the RNA associated with Dhh1-GFP immunoisolate reveals an enrichment of mitochondrial catalytic RNPs complex, suggesting a role for PB in mitochondrial RNA processing.

DESIGN
RNA from 7 anti-GFP immunoisolations as well as total (input) RNA  for each experiment was prepared. The seven samples include one mock IP from a strain containing GFP alone as well as 6 from Dhh1-GFP strains, two replicates from a (+) glucose condition and four replicates from a (-) glucose condition in which Dhh1-GFP forms cytoplasmic foci. 5ug of total RNA and 200ng IP RNA was hybridized to cutsom Agilent microarrays and detected using the S9.6 monoclonal antibody to RNA:DNA hybrids (ATCC clone ) and a Cy3 labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody.
