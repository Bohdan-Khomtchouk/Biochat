TITLE
ALKBH1-Mediated Transfer RNA Demethylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a central component of protein synthesis and cell signaling network. One salient feature of tRNA is its heavily modified status, which can critically impact its function. Here we show that mammalian ALKBH1 is a tRNA demethylase. It mediates the demethylation of N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in tRNAs. The ALKBH1-catalyzed demethylation of the target tRNAs results in their reduced partition in polysomes and their decreased usage in protein synthesis. This process is dynamic and responds to glucose availability to affect translation. Our results uncover reversible methylation of tRNA as a new regulatory mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression.
