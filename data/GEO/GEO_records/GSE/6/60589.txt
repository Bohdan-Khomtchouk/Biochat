TITLE
Loss of BTG1 function promotes ETV6-RUNX1-mediated leukemic transformation by upregulation of BCL6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene signatures in WT+Ctrl vs WT+ETV6-RUNX1, Btg1-/- and Btg1-/-+ETV6-RUNX1 in cKit+Ter119- fetal liver-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (FL-HPCs). The Btg1-/-+ETV6-RUNX1 FL-HPCs display a strong increase in proliferation compared to WT+ETV6-RUNX1.

DESIGN
Total RNA otained from WT+Ctrl, WT+ETV6-RUNX1, Btg1-/-+Ctrl and Btg1-/-+ETV6-RUNX1 FL-HPCs cells that were cultured for 12 days in expansion medium.
