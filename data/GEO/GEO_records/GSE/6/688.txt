SUMMARY
HMF3A cells, created from adult human mammary fibroblasts by immortalisation with a thermolabile SV40 large T antigen and the catalytic sub-unit of human telomerase, undergo co-ordinated induction of cellular senescence upon inactivation of T antigen. HMF3A cells cease proliferating by 4 days at 39°C. We directly compared the gene expression profiles of cells at 33.5°C and after shift up to 39.5°C for 7 days (10 arrays, 3 biological replicates). To eliminate genes that change in response to the temperature shift, we compared the profiles of HMF3Dwt cells at 33°C and those shifted up to 39°C for 7 days (4 arrays, 2 biological replicates). Since HMF3Dwt cells were immortalised with wild type U19 LT antigen, they proliferate at both temperatures. To break up the list of genes obtained with the 7 day shift, we performed several further comparisons on the arrays. HMF3A cells at 33°C were compared to the primary donor fibroblasts (HMF3 passage 8, 4 arrays), HMF3A cells shifted to 39°C for 2 days (4 arrays, 2 biological repeats), HMF3A cells shifted to 39°C for 7 days and then shifted back to 33°C for 3 days (8 arrays, 4 biological repeats) or 7 days (4 arrays, 2 biological repeats). As a comparison to the irreversible process of senescence, we sought to identify genes that changed upon reversible growth arrest, quiescence. Thus changes that occurred when the cells were grown to confluency and starved were also determined (2 biological replicate, 6 arrays).
