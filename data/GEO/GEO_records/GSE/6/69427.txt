TITLE
Responsive genes upon deletion of the dasR gene in Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338

ORGANISM
Saccharopolyspora erythraea

SUMMARY
Transcription profile analysis between the wild-type strain NRRL23338 and the dasR null mutant to determine the overall transcription changes caused by the deletion of global regulatory gene dasR in S.erythraea.

DESIGN
Transcription changes between the dasR mutant and the wild-type strain NRRL23338 were performed at two time points, 24,48h.
