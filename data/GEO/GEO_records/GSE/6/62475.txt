TITLE
Genome-wide binding sites of Progesterone receptor (PGR) isoforms PGR-A and PGR-B during differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide binding sites of PGR-A and PGR-B at 2h of in vitro differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells that express either PGR-A or PGR-B. Progesterone, acting through the progesterone receptors (PGRs), is one of the most critical regulators of endometrial differentiation, known as decidualization, which is a key step toward the establishment of pregnancy. Yet a long-standing unresolved issue in uterine biology is the precise roles played by the major PGR isoforms, PGR-A and PGR-B, during decidualization in the human. Our approach, expressing PGR-A and PGR-B individually after silencing endogenous PGRs in human endometrial stromal cells (HESC), enabled the analysis of the roles of these isoforms separately as well as jointly by ChIP-seq and gene-expression analysis.

DESIGN
In order to study the cistromes of PGR-A and PGR-B at 2h of in vitro differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells, we generated primary cultures of human endometrial stromal cells expressing flag tagged PGR-A and PGR-B individually after silencing endogenous PGRs. Input DNA was used as the reference sample.
