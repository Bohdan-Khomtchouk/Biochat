TITLE
Change in H3K4me3 in Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs, and over Spinal Motor Neuron differentiation (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs express a truncated form of Suz12 fused to Beta-galactosidase. These cells maintain a reduced level of H3K27me3 despite this mutation to a core component of PRC2, unlike Eed-/- ESCs whose H3K27me3 is ablated. This data shows the concomitant changes in H3K4me3 levels in these cells.

DESIGN
An ESC line mutant in Suz12, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, was assessed for H3K4me3 by ChIP-seq, as compared to a wild type ESC line, as well as both lines subjected to in vitro differentiation down the Spinal Motor Neuron pathway.
