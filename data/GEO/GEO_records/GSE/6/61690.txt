TITLE
Transcriptional changes in dormant and non_dormant potato meristems

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
RNA was sequenced from meristems excised from dormant and non-dormant potato tubers harvested from four different harvest years.

DESIGN
Expression based on mapped RNA-sequences was accomplished from excised meristems from fall harvested (dormant tubers) and the same harvested tubers were stored under standard commercial conditions until sprouting was present (non-dormant). The experiment was replicated for four different harvest years.
