TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Sorted Mouse Cortical Projection Neuron Subtypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuronal development requires a complex choreography of transcriptional decisions to obtain specific cellular identities. Realizing the ultimate goal of identifying genome-wide signatures that define and drive specific neuronal fates has been hampered by enormous complexity in both time and space during development. Here, we have paired high-throughput purification of pyramidal neuron subclasses with deep profiling of spatiotemporal transcriptional dynamics during corticogenesis to resolve lineage choice decisions. We identified numerous features ranging from spatial and temporal usage of alternative mRNA isoforms and promoters to a host of mRNA genes modulated during fate specification. Notably, we uncovered numerous long non-coding RNAs with restricted temporal and cell type specific expression. To facilitate future exploration, we provide an interactive online database to enable multidimensional data mining and dissemination. This multi-faceted study generates a powerful resource and informs understanding of the transcriptional regulation underlying pyramidal neuron diversity in the neocortex.

DESIGN
24 distinct samples analyzed. 2 replicates each of 3 distinct sorted mouse cortical projection neuron subtypes at 4 developmental time points.
