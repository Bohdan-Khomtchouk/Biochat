TITLE
Genome-wide peripheral blood transcriptome analysis of Arab female Lupus and Lupus nephritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide alternative splice analysis of RNA from lupus and its severe form lupus nephritis We aimed to explore the genome-wide peripheral blood transcriptome of lupus (SLE) and its severe form lupus nephritis (LN) cases compared to healthy subjects (HC) using high density Affymetrix Human Exon1.0.ST arrays. Analysis revealed 15 splice variants that are differentially expressed between SLE/HC and 99 variants between LN/HC (p≤0.05,SI > or≤0.5,Benjamin Hochberg-False discovery rate correction). Comparison between LN/SLE revealed 7 variants that are differentially expressed with p≤0.05,SI > 0.5,Benjamin Hochberg-FDR correction. Pathway analysis of differentially spliced genes revealed 11 significant pathways in SLE and 12 in LN (p < 0.05). Analysis of peripheral blood transcriptome revealed signature causative genes that are alternatively spliced, signifying their clinical relevance in the pathophysiology of disease. The extent of differential splicing was found to be higher in LN than in SLE, signifying the need for further in-depth research in the same domain. Present study is the first to reveal the significance of alternative variants in susceptibility to SLE and LN.

DESIGN
We analyzed blood from 11 female subjects (5 lupus, 3 lupus nephritis and 3 healthy control) using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Alt Analyze and Genespring software. No techinical replicates were performed. One of the outiler sample (HC2)  was excluded from further analysis.
