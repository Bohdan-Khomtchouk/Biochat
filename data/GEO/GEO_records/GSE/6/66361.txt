TITLE
Analysis of the gene expression profile in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells after EphB2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of Eph/ephrin signaling in numerous biological processes has been established. However, Eph/ephrin signaling has been shown to have complex role in tumor progression. The role of EphB2 receptor in the progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has not been studied before. EphB2 is significantly overexpressed in cSCC cells compared with normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). We used microarray based global gene expression profiling to study the effect of EphB2 knockdown on the expression of different genes in cSCC cells.

DESIGN
cSCC cell lines (n=3) were transfected with either control or EphB2 siRNA (75 nM) and incubated for 72 hours. Total RNA was extracted and processed expression profiling with GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.
