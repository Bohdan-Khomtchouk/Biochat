TITLE
Pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF): a novel trophoblast derived factor limiting feto-placental angiogenesis in late pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the trophoblast secretes anti-angiogenic factors, which increase in late pregnancy to limit angiogenesis. Therefore, we determined the paracrine effect of primary human trophoblasts from early versus late pregnancy on the angiogenic potential of isolated feto-placental endothelial cells. We found that the expression and secretion of anti-angiogenic factors differs in early vs late pregnancy, and differentially affects feto-placental angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Trophoblasts were isolated from third trimester placenta. A pool of 5 preparations from different cell types was used for each microarray.
