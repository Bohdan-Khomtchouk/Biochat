TITLE
Bradyrhizobium japonicum_Bacteroids vs. Bacteria grown in HM-Arabinose

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
A transcriptomic analysis of bacteroids isolated from soybean plants inoculated with B. japonicum USDA 110, relative to cells cultured in HM-arabinose medium was performed and the results combined with two other transcriptomic analyses to form a reiterated pool of transcripts that define genes essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
