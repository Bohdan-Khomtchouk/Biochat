TITLE
YBX1-dependent LNA-tRF-mediated modulation of gene expression under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to test whether inhibition of tRFs induced under hypoxia would counteract the YBX1-dependent reduction of target transcripts, we used transient transfection of antisense locked-nucleic acids (pooled LNAs) against tRFAsp, tRFGly, tRFGlu, and tRFTyr under hypoxia followed by microarray profiling.

DESIGN
Synthetic antisense locked-nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting the YBX1 binding site on tRFAsp, tRFGly, tRFGlu, and tRFTyr  were transfected (as a pool) in control and YBX1-knockdown cells under hypoxia to assess the consequences of inhibiting tRFs induced in hypoxic MDA-parental cells.
