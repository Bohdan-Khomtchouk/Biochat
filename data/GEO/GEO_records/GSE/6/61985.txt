TITLE
Correlating citric acid formation and manganese limitation in Aspergillus niger using transcriptome and proteome analysis

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Aspergillus niger is well known for its capability to produce citrate in high amounts but the detailed metabolic response causing citrate production has not been fully elucidated. Manganese is known to have an important effect as its limitation is a requirement to obtain high-level citrate formation. To identify the translational regulation causing citric acid overflow metabolism, transcriptome and proteome data from cultivations in manganese limitation and manganese excess conditions were analyzed. In addition to four already described main responses, two novel events were identified. The first metabolic response was down regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) during manganese limited conditions, which was confirmed by in vivo experiments. Down regulation of the first step in the gluconeogenesis, while maintaining a high activity through glycolysis, promoted secretion of citrate into the medium as an alternative regulatory mechanism for adjusting the intracellular concentrations of TCA intermediates. The other novel observation was down regulation of two cation transporters at manganese limited conditions. It was hypothesized that lowered cation transport across the mitochondrial membrane reduced the ability of the cell to maintain homeostasis thereby favoring citric acid secretion. Finally, upregulation of an ABC transporter was measured, which was assumed to be a citrate permease.
