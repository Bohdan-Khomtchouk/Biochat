TITLE
Expression data from the orthotopic tumors of MES-SA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The spontaneous pulmonary metastasis model of human uterine sarcoma was established using GFP-expressed MES-SA cells. Several sublines with different metastatic potentials were generated by in vivo passaging. We used microarrays to identify the metastatic-related genes using the orthotopic tumors with different metastatic potentials.

DESIGN
Orthotopic transplanted uterine sarcoma were observed after 3 weeks post-transplantation and the xenografted tumor reached about 2000 mm3 in additional 3 weeks. After 6 weeks post-transplantation, the animals were sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia, and the tumors were resected. The GFP-positive regions were collected using Leica MZ10F fluorescent stereomicroscope. This study compared the gene expression profiling between the orthotopic tumors with high (H)- and low (L)-metastatic potentials.
