TITLE
Defined conditions for the isolation and expansion of basal prostate stem cells of mouse and human origin [mouse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Isolation and culture of primary prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells (PESC) has been proven difficult and ineffective. Here we present methods to grow and expand both murine and human basal PESCs long-term in serum- and feeder-free conditions. The method enriches for adherent mouse basal PESCs with a Lin-Sca1+ CD49f+Trop2high phenotype. Progesterone and sodium selenite are additionally required for the growth of human Lin-CD49f+Trop2high PESCs.  The gene expression profiles of expanded basal PESCs show similarities to ES cells and Lamin B1 and PRDX1 were identified as novel PESC markers. If transplanted in combination with urogenital sinus mesenchyme, expanded mouse and human PESCs generate ectopic prostatic tubules demonstrating their stem cell activity in vivo. The novel methods will facilitate the cellular, molecular and genomic characterization of normal and pathologic prostate glands of mouse and human origin.

DESIGN
Murine prostate cells were seperately cultured under spheroid and adherent stem cell conditions and subsequently used for RNA extraction
