TITLE
A Genome Wide Association Study Reveals Genetic Predisposition for Bortezomib-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Multiple Myeloma by Variation in the PREP1-CBS locus.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide association study using Affymetrix HD-SNP arrays 6.0 to identify risk variants for developing bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) in 469 multiple myeloma (MM) patients who received bortezomib-dexamethasone (VD) induction therapy prior to autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and conducted validation in an independent cohort of 114 MM patients. We identified one previously unreported gene locus associated with BiPN at 21q22.3 (rs2839629, PKNOX1; OR = 1.89, P= 6.47 x 10-7). PKNOX1 is known to regulate expression of MCP-1, a potent mediator of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. rs2839629 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 = 0.87) with rs915854, localized 6.5kb centromeric to CBS encoding an endogenous H2S-producing enzyme. CBS-H2S signalling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders, and specifically in neuropathy models. Our data provide conclusive evidence for genetic susceptibility to BiPN in MM and new potential targets in neuro-protective strategies of treatment.

DESIGN
Identify risk variants for developing bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) within a cohort of 469 MM patients by means of genome wide association study, validation in an independent cohort of 114 MM patients
