Steady-state analysis of genes regulated by the E. coli RNA chaperone, Hfq

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray analysis to identify genes regulated by the RNA chaperone, Hfq. Four experiments were performed: 1/ Hfq+ vs Hfq- strains. 269 significantly differentially regulated genes were identified by SAM (Statistical Analysis of Microarrays), of which 120 changed more than 1.5 fold (48 increased and 72 decreased in hfq-). Amongst other genes, these experiments identified significant regulation of the sigma E and sigma 32 regulons. However, only genes induced by sigma E were similarly induced in hfq-; 8 operons repressed by sigma E were not repressed in hfq-. 2/ wt vs delta rseA. RseA is the antisigma factor for sigmaE. This comparison results in elevated steady-state levels of sigma E, and confirmed induction and repression of target regulon members. 3/ hfq+ vs hfq+ rpoE overexpression. RpoE encoding sigma E was overexpressed in an hfq+ background, confirming normal regulation of the sigma E regulon. 4/ hfq+ vs hfq- rpoE overexpression. Sigma E was overexpressed in an hfq- background. This demonstrated that 8 operons normally repressed by sigma E require hfq for this repression. The simple conclusion is that sigma E regulates small RNAs that, together with Hfq, bind target mRNAs and results in their rapid degradation.
