TITLE
Next Generation RNAseq of neonatal hearts one day post surgery comparing sham, apical resection or apical resecection plus vagotomy treatments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report global RNA expression profiles in whole heart ventricle tissue from postnatal day 2 mice that had undergone surgery 24 hours prior to collection.

DESIGN
Heart ventricle mRNA profiles were generated from CD-1 neonatal mice by deep sequencing, in triplicate, on the Illumina HiSeq 2500.
