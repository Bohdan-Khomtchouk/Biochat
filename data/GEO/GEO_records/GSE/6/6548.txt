TITLE
An estrogen-dependent model of breast cancer created by transformation of normal human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was performed to check that ESR1 and BMI1 are biologically active after lentiviral transduction of primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) with lentiviral vectors expressing ESR1 and BMI1 from the human PGK promoter. ESR1 targets like PGR, PRLR and GREB1, but not TFF1 and XBP1, were induced by estradiol in the ESR1-expressing cells. BMI1 targets like BMI1, NEFL and CCND2 were repressed in the BMI1-expressing cells. BMI1 suppressed genes associated with squamous and neural differentiation in the ESR1 plus BMI1-expressing cells. Keywords: Drug response
