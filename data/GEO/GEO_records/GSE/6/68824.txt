TITLE
The effect of Lats2 knockout and diet on liver disease in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver samples of mice harboring liver-specific deletion of Lats2 (Lats2-CKO) were compared to WT mice. This effect was tested along with the effect of diet - high cholesterol diet (Paigen-PD) vs. normal chow (ND).

DESIGN
Expression array analysis on Affymetrix microarrays was carried out for livers from WT and Lats2-CKO mice fed ND or HCD for 9 weeks.
