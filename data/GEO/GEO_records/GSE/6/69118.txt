TITLE
DNA methylation of estrogen regulated enhancers defines endocrine sensitivity in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of estrogen receptor (ESR1) determines whether a breast cancer patient receives endocrine therapy as part of their adjuvant care, but does not guarantee patient response. However, the molecular factors that define endocrine response in ESR1-positive breast cancer patients remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the DNA methylome of endocrine sensitivity and demonstrate the potential impact of differential DNA methylation on endocrine response in breast cancer.  We show that DNA hypermethylation occurs predominantly at estrogen-responsive enhancers and is associated with reduced ESR1 binding and decreased gene expression of key regulators of ESR1-activity; thus providing a novel mechanism by which endocrine response is abated in ESR1-positive breast cancers. Conversely, we delineate that ESR1-responsive enhancer hypomethylation is critical in transition from normal mammary epithelial cells to endocrine responsive ESR1-positive cancer.  Cumulatively these novel insights highlight the potential of ESR1-responsive enhancer methylation to both predict ESR1-positive disease and stratify ESR1-positive breast cancer patients as responders to endocrine therapy.

DESIGN
Methylation profiling with Illumina's HumanMethylation450K array was performed on ESR1-positive hormone sensitive MCF7 cells, and three different well characterised endocrine resistant MCF7-derived cell lines; tamoxifen-resistant (TAMR), fulvestrant-resistant (FASR) and estrogen deprivation resistant (MCF7X) cells.  For each cell line two biological replicates were profiled bringing the number of samples to eight.
