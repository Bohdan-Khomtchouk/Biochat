TITLE
Systems analysis of uterine  microenvironment  in Treg depleted pregnant mice at 12 days after fertilization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of uterine microenvironment at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Tregs orchestrated the immune reponse triggered in presence of embryo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from uterine microenvironment tissues of Treg depleted pregnant mice (12 days after fertilization) compared to control tissues (uterus from PBS treated pregnant mice).
