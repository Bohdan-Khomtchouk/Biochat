TITLE
Global Genome Analysis of the Downstream Binding Targets of Testis Determining Factor SRY and SOX9 [SOX9 ChIP]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A major event in mammalian male sex determination is the induction of the testis determining factor Sry and its downstream gene Sox9. The current study provides one of the first genome wide analyses of the downstream gene binding targets for SRY and SOX9 to help elucidate the molecular control of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development. A modified ChIP-Chip analysis using a comparative hybridization was used to identify 71 direct downstream binding targets for SRY and 109 binding targets for SOX9. Interestingly, only 5 gene targets overlapped between SRY and SOX9. In addition to the direct response element binding gene targets, a large number of atypical binding gene targets were identified for both SRY and SOX9. Bioinformatic analysis of the downstream binding targets identified gene networks and cellular pathways potentially involved in the induction of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development. The specific DNA sequence binding site motifs for both SRY and SOX9 were identified. Observations provide insights into the molecular control of male gonadal sex determination.

DESIGN
The current study provides one of the first genome wide analyses of the downstream gene binding targets for SRY and SOX9 to help elucidate the molecular control of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development.  At embryonic day 13 (E13) of pregnancy rats were euthanized and embryonic gonads were collected for chromatin. A modified ChIP-Chip analysis using a comparative hybridization was used to identify direct downstream binding targets for SRY and for SOX9. Then, bioinformatic analysis of the downstream binding targets was done to identify gene networks and cellular pathways that are potentially involved in the induction of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development.
