TITLE
Differential gene expression of periostin-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Periostin participates in different processes involved in connective tissue homeostasis. It is also involved in repairment of damaged tissues. We used the osteoblast murine cell line MC3T3-E1 cell line to show how overexpresion of periostin is able to increase their adhesion properties while diminishing their migration capacity.  By differential gene expression we evaluated putative targets involved in those cellular properties.

DESIGN
An isolated clone of MC3T3-E1 periostin-overexpressing cells was selected to compare differential gene expression with MC3T3-E1 cells.
