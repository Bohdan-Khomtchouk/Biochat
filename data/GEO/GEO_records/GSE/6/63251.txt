TITLE
Regulation of LbetaT2 gonadotrope gene expression by GnRH pulses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LbetaT2 cells exposed to different number and concentration of GnRH pulses over 4 hours during in vitro perfusion culture We used MU74Av2 arrays to profile gene expression in response to different pulse frequency and pulse amplitude

DESIGN
RNA extracted at end of 4 h of perfusion
