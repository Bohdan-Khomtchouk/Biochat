TITLE
CTCF binding profiles in MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced CTCF binding sites in Akt1+/+ or Akt1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line.

DESIGN
The information of CTCF binding sites in wildtype (WT) and Akt1-/- MEF cells was generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx.
