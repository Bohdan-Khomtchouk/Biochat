TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis using customized AZ microarray on Flower pedicel Abscission and non abscission zones in Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum c.v New Yorker) Plants.

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To extend our previous knowledge from our gene expression studies on Flower pedicel Abscission zone using Affymetrix microarray chip we have employed whole transcriptome analysis by NGS as a discovery platform to identify and add the transcripts to pre-existing database. We designed the Customized AZ Microarray chip with the transcripts obtained from NGS (includes novel transcripts), pre existing Agilent probes, and some additional transcripts from previous databases. The flower pedicel AZ tissue and non abscission(NAZ) pedicel tissues was sampled at six time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 h), following flower removal, and analyzed for their gene expression profiles using the customized AZ microarray.

DESIGN
Solanum lycopersicum Custom Microarray 4x180K Array designed by Genotypic Technology Private  Limited. (AMADID:043310)
