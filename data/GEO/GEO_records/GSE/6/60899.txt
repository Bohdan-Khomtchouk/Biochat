TITLE
Genome-wide copy number and allele-specific copy number analysis of choroid plexus tumors (I)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number analysis was performed using genotyping microarrays for 55 choroid plexus tumors. Genomic aberrations were investigated by tumor histological classification and the pattern observed in each subgroup was further refined. Allele specific copy number analysis also allowed us to identify regions of acquired uniparental disomy with neutral copy number values.

DESIGN
Fifty-five choroid plexus tumors (23 choroid plexus carcinomas, 23 choroid plexus papillomas, 9 atypical choroid plexus papillomas) were used in this study. These samples were inspected for hybridization quality. No replicates were included.
