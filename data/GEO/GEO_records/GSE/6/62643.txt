TITLE
Expression diversity of Phytophthora ramorum from canyon live oak

ORGANISM
Phytophthora ramorum

SUMMARY
Expression diversity of P. ramorum isolates belonging to the NA1 clonal lineage growing on solid CV8 was examined.  We found that phenotypes and transcriptomes change when isolates were passing through oak trees.

DESIGN
Global expression patterns of 8 isolates originating from coastal live oak and California bay laurel  and re-isolates from canyon live oaks were investigated.  No biological replicates were generated.  The sequenced strain Pr102 was included.  Gene models Phytophthora ramorum v1.0 were used to construct NimbleGen 72K x4 custom arrays.
