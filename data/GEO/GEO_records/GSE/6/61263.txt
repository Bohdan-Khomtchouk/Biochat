TITLE
Pyronema confluens circadian rhythm analysis

ORGANISM
Pyronema omphalodes CBS 100304

SUMMARY
The aim of this analysis was the identification of candidate genes that might be regulated in a circadian manner in the filamentous ascomycete Pyronema confluens. The fungus was grown in submerged culture to promote vegetative growth, and after a period in constant light, the samples were shifted to darkness (DD). Cultures were sampled after 24 and 36 hours in DD. The samples were used for RNA-seq analysis, and candidate genes with significantly higher expression after 24 vs. 36 hours or the reverse were further analyzed with RT-qPCR.

DESIGN
For each growth condition (DD24 and DD36), three independent biological replicates were performed and sequenced.
