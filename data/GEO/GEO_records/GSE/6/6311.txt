TITLE
SOX13 regulated genes in CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ab and gd T cells originate from a common, multi-potential precursor population in the thymus, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this lineage fate decision process are unknown.  We have identified Sox13 as a gd-specific gene in the immune system.  Using Sox13 transgenic mice, we show that SOX13 promotes gd T cell development while opposing ab T cell differentiation. Conversely, mice deficient in Sox13 expression exhibited impaired development of gd T cells, but not ab T cells. One mechanism of SOX13 function is the inhibition of WNT/TCF signaling, suggesting that differential WNT/TCF activity is an essential parameter for this binary cell fate choice. Keywords: global gene expression profile comparison
