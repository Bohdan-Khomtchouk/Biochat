TITLE
Gene expression profiling of histone deacetylase inhibition in epithelioid sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES) is a rare neoplasm uniquely comprised of cells exhibiting both mesenchymal and epithelial features. Having propensity for local and distant recurrence, it can pose a diagnostic dilemma secondary to pathologic complexity. Patients have dismal prognosis due to lack of effective therapy. HDAC inhibitors exhibit marked anti-tumor effects in various malignancies. Our studies demonstrate that pan-HDAC inhibitors constitute potentially novel therapeutics versus ES. Human ES cells (VAESBJ, HS-ES, Epi544) were studied in vitro to evaluate the effects of HDACi.

DESIGN
Gene array analysis was used to identify the impact of HDACi on ES gene expression in three cell lines.
