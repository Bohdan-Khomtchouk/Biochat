TITLE
The role of Tet3 in regulating gene expression in response to global synaptic activity changes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Counter to the long-held belief that DNA methylation of terminally differentiated cells is permanent and essentially immutable, post-mitotic neurons exhibit extensive DNA demethylation. The causal role of active DNA demethylation in neurons, however, is not known. Tet family proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine to initiate active DNA demethylation through the base-excision repair pathway. Here, we show that synaptic activity bi-directionally regulates neuronal Tet3 expression. Functionally, knockdown of Tet or inhibition of base-excision repair in hippocampal neurons elevates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, whereas overexpressing Tet3 or Tet1 catalytic domain decreases it. Furthermore, dysregulation of Tet3 signalling prevents homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, Tet3 dictates neuronal surface GluR1 levels. RNA-seq analyses further revealed a pivotal role of Tet3 in regulating gene expression in response to global synaptic activity changes. Thus, Tet3 serves as a synaptic activity sensor to epigenetically regulate basic properties and meta-plasticity of neurons via active DNA demethylation.
