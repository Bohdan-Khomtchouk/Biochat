TITLE
Effect in MOLM-14 cells of 24hr cortistatin A treatment on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the marine natural product cortistatin A (CA) as an inhibitor of CDK8 to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of CDK8 regulates super-enhancer function and inhibits AML proliferation. In this series, we examine the transcriptional effect on MOLM-14 cells of 24hrs exposure to CA.

DESIGN
MOLM-14 cells were treated in triplicate with either DMSO or CA for 24hrs. RNA was harvested and hybridized to microarrays to assess transcriptional changes.
