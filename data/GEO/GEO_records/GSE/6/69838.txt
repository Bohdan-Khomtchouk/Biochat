TITLE
Transcriptomic signatures of risk genes implicated in psychiatric disorders during neuronal differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Susceptibility genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), monogenetic disorders with intellectual disabilities (ID) or schizophrenia (SCZ) converge on processes related to neuronal function and differentiation. Furthermore, ASD risk genes are enriched for FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) targets and for genes implicated in ID. In addition, a significant co-heritability was observed between ASD and SCZ. The genetic overlap between ASD, FXS, ID and SCZ together with the symptomatic differences gives rise to the question if pathomechanisms impair the same or different regulatory patterns activated during neuronal differentiation (ND). To test this idea, we performed transcriptome analysis of in-vitro differentiation of the neuroblastoma cell line model SH-SY5Y and identified genes that were differentially expressed, dynamically regulated, and coordinately expressed. The identified genetic modules activated during ND are enriched for genetic risk factors for these four disorders. Although risk genes for the disorders significantly overlap, we observed disorder specific enrichments: ASD or FXS implicated genes were likely to be positive regulators of ND whereas ID implicated genes were related to negative regulation. ASD and SCZ genes were specifically enriched among cholesterol and fatty acid associated modules. ID genes were overrepresented among cell cycle modules. In addition, we show that ASD genes are likely to be hub genes. We hypothesize that knowledge about genetic variants of an individual combined with network and pathway context of the related genes will allow differentiating between psychiatric disorders.
