TITLE
Next generation sequencing reveals a controlled immune response to Zaire Ebola virus challenge in cynomolgus macaques immunized with VSVΔG/ZEBOVgp

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
RNA deep sequencing analysis was perfromed on PBMCs obtained from cynomolgus macaques (CMs) prior to and after immunization with VSV carrying ZEBOVgp (VSVΔG/ZEBOVgp) and at multiple points after ZEBOV challenge

DESIGN
We selected two groups of animals either (3 animals in each group) immunized with VSVDG/ZEBOVgp or VSVΔG/MARVgp. A baseline blood draw was taken at day -28, with post immunization and challenge blood draws at days 0, 4, 7, 14 and 35.  Analysis for this study was done on PBMC isolated from whole blood of each animal.
