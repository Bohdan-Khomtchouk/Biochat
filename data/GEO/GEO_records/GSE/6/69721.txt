TITLE
Expression data from fully engorged Haemaphysalis flava ticks (FE) midgut and partially engorged Haemaphysalis flava ticks (PE) midgut (MGs)

ORGANISM
Haemaphysalis flava

SUMMARY
To characterize the differentially expressed genes between fully engorged ticks and partially engorged ticks

DESIGN
A total of 60 midguts of all collected Haemaphysalis flava ticks (30 fully engorged ticks and 30 partially engorged ticks) were dissected.
