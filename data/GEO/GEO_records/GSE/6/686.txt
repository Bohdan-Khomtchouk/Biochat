TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
60 fresh frozen HNSCC from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) were obtained from the UNC Tissue Procurement Facility under an IRB approved protocol. 55 tumor samples were collected from the primary tumor and five tumor samples were collected from a local recurrence at the primary site; one tumor also had a sample of the primary tumor and an associated lymph node metastasis . In addition, we profiled three normal tonsillar epithelium samples that were collected from three pediatric patients following routine tonsillectomy and four HNSCC tumor derived cell lines (UNC7, UMSCCA1, CAL27 and JHU022). Each experimental sample (tumor, normal or cell line) was assayed versus a “common reference” sample that was a pool of total RNA derived from 30 of the HNSCC samples. This tumor pool reference strategy has been successfully used in another profiling study. In total, 78 experiments were performed, which utilized three separate preparations of the common reference pool.
