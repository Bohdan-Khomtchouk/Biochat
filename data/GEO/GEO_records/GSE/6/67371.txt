TITLE
Selective elimination of mitochondria mutations in the germline by genome editing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Currently there is no treatment for mitochondrial disease, a group of devastating inherited disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we report a strategy to prevent the germline transmission of mitochondrial diseases. This technique is based on the specific elimination of mutated mtDNA through the use of mitochondria targeted nucleases. Our approaches represent a potential therapeutic avenue for preventing the transgenerational transmission of human mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA.

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analyzed. Test samples were compared to sex-matched reference samples.
