TITLE
Early dendritic cell molecular signature modelling predicts late vaccine-induced adaptive T-cell responses (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were vaccinated with different Lentivirus vector-plaforms or PBS. Transcriptomes of sorted dendritic cells 6 hours after vaccination were used to build a model predictive of the vector-platform efficacy measured as the antigen-specific response 5, 7 and 10 days after the vaccination

DESIGN
Groups of 7-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, France and Germany) were immunized either intravenously or sub-cutaneously with a controlled quantity of vector particles as defined in CompuVac assay protocols (www.compuvac.eu). Control mice were injected with 100 ÂµL of phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS).
