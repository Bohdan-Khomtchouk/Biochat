TITLE
Microarray analysis of Rhodobacter sphaeroides CceR and AkgR deletion strains

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
To gain a better understanding of the transcription factors that regulate central carbon metabolism in Rhodobacter sphaeroides global gene expression analysis was used to determine genes under the regulatory influence of 2 transcription factors: CcmR (RSP_1663) and AkgR (RSP_0981) both predicted to be involved in the regulation of central carbon and energy metabolism.
