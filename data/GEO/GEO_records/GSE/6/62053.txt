TITLE
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) changes DNA methylation patterns in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of human PC3 invasive prostate cancer cell line treated with vehicle control (SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine) and with SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) as well as of untreated human LNCaP non-invasive prostate cancer cell line. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA Methylation BeadChip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in human cell lines exposed to described treatments. Samples included biological triplicate of PC3 control (SAH treated), biological triplicate of PC3 treated with SAM, and biological duplicate of LNCaP untreated.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from the 8 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation BeadChip v1.2.
