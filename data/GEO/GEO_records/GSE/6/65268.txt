TITLE
ChIP-on-Chip for the Ciliary derived stem/progenitor cells and their differentiated progeny.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome profiling of histone methylation (H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and RNA Pol II) in Ciliary derived stem/progenitor cells and differentiated cells. In the present study we focus on the cellular differentiation that involves loss of pluripotency and gain of lineage and cell type-specific characteristics and we show developments from adult ciliary derived stem/progenitor cells to differentiated retinal neurons/glial cells of human cadaveric eyes in vitro.

DESIGN
Ciliary pigment epithelial cells isolated from human cadaveric eye balls were cultured in the presence of mitogens like Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) to generate neurospheres (Stem/progenitor population). The generated neurospheres were plated on laminin and poly-D-lysine-coated cover slips in the presence of the Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Retinoic acid (RA) and 10% FBS for the differentiation (Retinal neuron/glial cells). Global Methylation patterns of histone H3K4me3, RNA Pol II and H3K27me3 were analysed in the present study. This work would provide an outline of epigenetic modifications in ciliary derived stem/progenitor cells and the progeny that underwent differentiation into retinal neurons/glial cells and present that specific histone methylations are involved in gene expression reprogramming during the process of differentiation.
