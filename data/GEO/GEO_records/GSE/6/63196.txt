TITLE
Gene Expression of Prostate Cancer Cells; 22Rv1, DU-145 and LNCaP: 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) Treatment vs. Control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic silencing mediated by CpG methylation is a common feature of many cancers. Characterizing aberrant DNA methylation changes associated with tumor progression may identify potential prognostic markers for prostate cancer (PCa). We treated three PCa cell lines, 22Rv1, DU-145 and LNCap with the demethylating agent 5-aza 2’–deoxycitidine (DAC) and examined gene expression changes using a custom microarray (GPL16604). These data were integrated with gene methylation status (GEO Pending) in PCa cell lines and further combined with patient tumor data to identify potential novel biomarkers for PCa patients. In order to identify genes that are methylated in PCa, we employed a genome-wide gene expression profiling approach and compared cells treated with 5-aza 2’–deoxycitidine (DAC) to untreated cells. 22Rv1, DU-145 and LNCaP PCa cell lines were incubated in culture medium with 2 μg/mL DAC for 4 days with medium change every 2 days. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression was analyzed using a custom microarray (GPL16604).

DESIGN
Cells were plated in 6 cm dishes and incubated in culture medium with 2 μg/mL DAC for 4 days with medium change every 2 days. The effect of DAC on gene expression in the PCa cell lines 22Rv1, DU-145 and LNCaP was measured by gene expression array. Experiments were preformed in triplicate.
