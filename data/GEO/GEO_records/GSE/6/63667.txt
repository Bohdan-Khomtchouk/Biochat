TITLE
Gene expression response to high radiation treatment in MCF7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intraoperative radiotherapy (IOERT) is a high radiation therapeutic technique which administers a single high dose of ionizing radiation (IR) immediately after surgical tumor removal in order to destroy the residual cancer cells in the site at high risk for recurrence. IR is able to regulate several genes and factors involved in cell-cycle progression, survival and/or cell death, DNA repair and inflammation modulating an intracellular response radiation dependent producing an imbalance in cell fate decision. In this study, we examined changes in gene expression in MCF7 breast cancer cell line exposed to 9Gy and 23Gy high single dose of IR delivered by IOERT.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in MCF7 breast cancer cell line exposed to 9Gy and 23Gy high single dose of IR (named MCF7_9Gy and MCF7_23Gy respectively), were analyzed as two-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies whole human genome 4x44K microarrays
