TITLE
Metabolic Inflexibility Impairs Insulin Secretion And Results In MODY-like Diabetes In Triple FoxO-deficient Mice

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic b-cell failure in type 2 diabetes is associated with functional abnormalities of insulin secretion and deficits of b-cell mass. Itâ€™s unclear how one begets the other. We have shown that loss of b-cell mass can be ascribed to impaired FoxO1 function in different models of diabetes. Here we show that ablation of the three FoxO genes (1, 3a, and 4) in mature b-cells results in early-onset, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-like diabetes, with signature abnormalities of the MODY networks of Hnf4a, Hnf1a, and Pdx1. Transcriptome and functional analyses reveal that FoxO-deficient b-cells are metabolically inflexible, i.e., they preferentially utilize lipids rather than carbohydrates as source of acetyl-CoA for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This results in impaired ATP generation, and reduced Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion. When viewed in the context of prior data illustrating a role of FoxO1 in b-cell dedifferentiation, the present findings define a seamless FoxO-dependent mechanism linking the twin abnormalities of b-cell function in diabetes. We used microarrays to detail the change of gene expression in pancreatic beta cells after knocking out FoxO1,3 and 4.

DESIGN
Primary islets were isolated from pancretic beta cell- specific triple FoxO(1,3, and 4) KO and their littermates control (WT) mice. Gene expression was analyzed by microarray.
