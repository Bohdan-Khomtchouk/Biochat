TITLE
Gene expression profiling in mice overexpressing human wild type (WT) keratin 8 (K8) or K8 variants (G62C and R341H).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3 months old untreated male/female animals were used in the experiment. We used microarray analysis to determine differential gene expression in mice livers overexpressing WT K8 and K8 variants.

DESIGN
Mice liver tissues were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
