TITLE
Exploring pathogenic microRNAs of rice sheath blight pathogen

ORGANISM
Rhizoctonia solani

SUMMARY
We constructed seven small RNA libraries of Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA and sequenced using Illumina GA II. The seven samples include  mycelium cultured on PDA without rice incubated, 6 different stages at 10 hours (10h), 18h, 24h, 32h, 48h and 72h spanning the Rhizoctonia solani AG1 strains infection rice. We identified miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) using MIREAP and mirdeep2. The milRNAs were used for further analysis of interactions between milRNA and mRNA that may involve in plant-infection.

DESIGN
Identification of milRNAs in R. solani AG1.
