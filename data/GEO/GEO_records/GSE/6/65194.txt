TITLE
Expression profiling of breast cancer samples from Institut Curie (Maire cohort) --Affy CDF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of 130 breast cancer samples (41 TNBC ; 30 Her2 ; 30 Luminal B and 29 Luminal A), 11 normal breast tissue samples and 14 TNBC cell lines.

DESIGN
This dataset contains 178 arrays. 153 arrays were used to analyze 130 unique breast cancer samples from as many patients and 23 technical duplicates. In addition 11 “Normal” samples from healthy breast tissue obtained from mammoplasty are included, as well as a collection of 14 breast cancer cell lines. Data production involved different array batches and hybridation series which were accounted for in the pre-processing of the data.
