TITLE
Arabidopsis De-etiolated 1 Represses Photomorphogenesis by Positively Regulating Phytochrome Interacting Factors in the Dark

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis seedlings undergo photomorphogenic development even in darkness when the function of De-etiolated 1 (DET1), a repressor of photomorphogenesis, is disrupted. Our results indicate that DET1 directly interacts with a group of transcription factors known as the phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs). Furthermore, our results suggest that DET1 positively regulates PIF protein levels primarily by stabilizing PIF proteins in the dark. Genomic analysis also revealed that DET1 may control the expression of light-regulated genes to mediate photomorphogenesis partially through PIFs.

DESIGN
Total of twelve samples, two treatments and three genotypes, and each have three replicates.
