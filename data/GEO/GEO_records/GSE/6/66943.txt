TITLE
Expression data from interstital murine lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lung alveoli form a epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit. We performed microarray analyses on two distinct subsets of PDGFRa expressing interstitial lung fibroblast populations and idenitfied a myo (dim) and matrix (bright) fibroblast signature.

DESIGN
We isolated 2000 PDGFRa-GFP dim and bright lung fibroblasts each form single cell lung digests and subjected them to microarray analysis. Sham operated animals do not regenerate alveolar septa but undergo surgical trauma. PNX operated animals undergo compensatory lung regrowth and regenerate alveolar sepatae. PNX+dnFGFR operated animals express a dominant negative FGFR2 mutation which inhibits myofibroblast activation and alveolar regrowth.
