TITLE
ChIP-on-chip from multiple donors of BM-MSCs with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (BM-MSCs) exhibit therapuetically valuable properties, including the capacity to differentiate into skeletal tissues and modulate immune system activity. These properties depend on proper regulation of dynamic gene expression in response to environmental  and developmental stimuli. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with human promoter tiling microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip) to profile histones H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at promoters genome-wide. The goal of the study was to identify gene promoters marked by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in BM-MSCs.

DESIGN
ChIP-on-chip performed with antibodies to H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on BM-MSCs from 3 different donors (labeled 1632, 167696, and 8F3560) and with technical replicates.
