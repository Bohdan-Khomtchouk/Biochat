TITLE
Mutations in the SIX1/2 pathway and the DROSHA/DGCR8 miRNA microprocessor complex underlie high-risk blastemal type Wilms tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blastemal histology in chemotherapy-treated pediatric Wilms tumors (nephroblastoma) is associated with adverse prognosis. To uncover the underlying tumor biology and find novel therapeutic leads for this subgroup of patients, we analyzed 58 blastemal-type Wilms tumors by exome and transcriptome sequencing and validated our findings in a large independent replication cohort. Recurrent mutations identified either somatically or in the germline included a hotspot mutation (Q177R) in the homeodomain of SIX1 and SIX2 in tumors with high proliferative potential, mutations in microprocessor genes like DROSHA, DGCR8, DICER1 and DIS3L2, and alterations in IGF2, MYCN, and TP53, the latter being strongly associated with dismal outcome. DROSHA and DGCR8 mutations had a strong effect on miRNA expression patterns in tumors, which was functionally validated in cell lines transfected with mutant DROSHA.
