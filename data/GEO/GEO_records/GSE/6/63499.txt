TITLE
DNA Methylation Changes in Whole Blood and CD16+ Neutrophils in Response to Chronic Folic Acid Supplementation in Women of Childbearing Age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Folate, a water-soluble vitamin, is a key source of one-carbon groups for DNA methylation, but studies of the DNA methylation response to supplemental folic acid yield inconsistent results.  The aim of this study was to determine if DNA methylation patterns in the dominant white blood cell type, neutrophils, would respond differently than whole blood in response to chronic folic acid supplementation. Saliva and blood methylation was clearly distinguishable though there was positive correlation overall. There was little correlation in CpG sites within relevant candidate genes.  Correlated CpG sites were more likely to occur in areas of low CpG density (i.e. CpG shores and open seas). There was more variability in CpG sites from saliva than blood, which may reflect its heterogeneity. Thus, this study provides a framework for using DNA methylation from saliva and suggests that DNA methylation of saliva may offer distinct opportunities for epidemiological and longitudinal studies of psychiatric traits.

DESIGN
DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood and CD16+ neutrophils from obese and normal weight adult women undergoing 8 weeks of folate supplementation.  Blood was collected in EDTA vacuum tubes, and CD16+ nutrophils were isolated by positive selection with Dynabeads.  DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen). DNA methylation was interrogated for each sample using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina).
