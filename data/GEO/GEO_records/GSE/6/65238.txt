TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Wnt3a-treated triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptome of two different triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines to define a comprehensive list of Wnt target genes. Cells were treated with Wnt3a for 6h, 12h or 24h. We found up-regulated and down-regulated genes in response to Wnt3a treatment. They  are involved in the Wnt pathway itself, and also in TGFÃŸ, p53 and Hedgehog pathways. Thorough characterization of these novel potential Wnt target genes may reveal new regulators of the canonical Wnt pathway. The comparison of our list of Wnt target genes with those published in other cellular contexts confirms the notion that Wnt target genes are tissue-, cell line- and treatment-specific.

DESIGN
Cells were seeded in six-well plates, serum starved overnight then treated with Wnt3a for the indicated times (6, 12 and 24 hours). Triplicates for each condition were included in the experiment.
