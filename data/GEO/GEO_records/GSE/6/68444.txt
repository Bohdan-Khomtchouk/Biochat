TITLE
rRNA 5-methylcytosine in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we use bisulfite conversion of RNA combined with high-throughput IIlumina sequencing (RBS-seq) to identify single-nucleotide resolution of m5C sites in ribosomal RNAs of all three sub-cellular transcriptomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. m5C sites in rRNAs were also anlyzed in Arabidopsis T-DNA knockouts for the RNA methyltransferases TRM4A, TRM4B, TRDMT1, NSUN5, NOP2A, NOP2B and NOP2C.

DESIGN
RNA Bisulfite sequencing was used to identify candidate m5C sites in rRNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana. Illumina sequencing was performed on a MiSeq platform. Two experiments were performed; experiment 1 and experiment 2. In experiment 1, one to three biological replicates were performed for the genotypes wild type, nop2a-2, nop2b-1, nop2b-2, nop2c-1, nop2c-2, nsun5-1 and nsun5-2. In experiment 2, one biological replicate was performed for each of the genotypes wild type, trm4a, trm4b-1, trdmt1 and trdmt1 trm4b.
