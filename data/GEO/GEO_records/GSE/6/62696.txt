TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome changes in testosterone-deficient pigs fed a high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the role of testosterone in modulating hepatic fat accumulation, we collected liver tissues from high fat diet-fed intact male pigs, castrated male pigs, and castrated male pigs with testosterone replacement. RNA-Seq was employed to profile hepatic gene expression in pigs with different testosterone levels.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA profiles of intact male pigs fed a HFC diet, castrated male pigs fed a HFC diet, and castrated male pigs treated with testosterone fed a HFC diet were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
