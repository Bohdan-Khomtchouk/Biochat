TITLE
Expression Analysis of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells During In Vitro Differentiation to an Adipocyte Lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue-derived stromal stem cells (ASCs) represent a promising regenerative resource for soft tissue reconstruction. To understand the changes in cell function during the transition of ASCs into fully mature fat cells, we compared the transcriptome profiles of cultured undifferentiated human primary ASCs under conditions leading to acquisition of a mature adipocyte phenotype by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from separate ACS isolates of six human adult females before and after 7 days (7d: early stage) and 21 days (21d: late stage) of adipocyte differentiation in vitro.
