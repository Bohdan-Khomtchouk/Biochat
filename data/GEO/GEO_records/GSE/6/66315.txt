TITLE
SUMO and RNAPolII chromatin profiling in SUMOylation-competent and -deficient bone marrow derived dendritic cells unstimulated or stimulated with LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To determine SUMO1 and SUMO2 chromatin profile in a static and dynamic manner in BMDC before and after LPS stimulation, and to determine RNAPolII chromatin occupancy in sumoylation-deficient BMDC compared to wild-type cells. Methods: SUMO1, SUMO2 and RNAPolII chromatin profiles were determined by sequencing BMDC chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for SUMO1, SUMO2 and RNAPolII before and after LPS stimulation. Results: We show dynamic  occupancy of three distal sites upstream of Ifnb1 gene by SUMO1 and SUMO2, as well as increased RNAPolII recruitment on selected genes. Conclusions: SUMO acts as a regulator of inflammatory and anti-viral gene programs.

DESIGN
A study of SUMO and RNAPolII chromatin profile in Bone Marrow derived Dendritic Cells.
