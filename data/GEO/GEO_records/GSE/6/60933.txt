TITLE
Ileal gene expression in Duoxa-/- mice and cohoused littermate controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dual oxidases play a role in innate host defense at barrier epithelia. We examined the effect of loss of dual oxidase function (duoxa-/-) on gene expression in the mouse terminal ileum at homeostasis. To control for cage/litter effects, duoxa-/- were cohoused with wild type littermate controls.

DESIGN
Ileal mucosal samples were obtained from duoxa-/- mice and cohoused wild type littermates from three separate cages (litters). For each cage, RNA was pooled from n=2-3 animals per genotype.
