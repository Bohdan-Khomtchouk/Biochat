TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes in an orange-pericarp mutant and wild type in pummelo (Citrus grandis)

ORGANISM
Citrus maxima

SUMMARY
To gain new insight into the underlying mechanism that may be involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, global gene expression at the transcriptional level was also investigated by RNA-seq analysis. The comparative analysis revealed extensive changes in the gene expression level of the orange-pericarp mutant (MT), which resulted in the down-regulation of 168 genes and the up-regulation of 135 genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis indicated seven reliable metabolic pathways are altered in the mutant, including carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids.

DESIGN
Total six sample pools: the pericarp of WT and MT in ripe stage, each three biological replicates. The orange-pericarp mutant accumulates large amounts of Î²-carotene in the pericarp.
