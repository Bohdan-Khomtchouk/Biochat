TITLE
Epigenome analysis of fetal and adult liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation analysis of 96 adult and 14 fetal liver samples

DESIGN
The study includes 110 individuals, 14 fetal and 96 adult samples, no replicates. Liver samples from 14 fetuses were obtained at gestational week 8-12. Adult liver samples were collected from 52 organ donors who had met accidental death and 44 liver samples from patients undergoing liver resection due to malignant tumors, most commonly from patients with metastatic colon cancers. Liver biopsies from these patients were collected from 'healthy' tissue that showed no visible pathological changes compared to the adjacent tumor.
