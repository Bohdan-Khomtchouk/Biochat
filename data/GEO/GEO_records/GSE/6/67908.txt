TITLE
Intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We separately analyzed the HER2-negative and HER2-positive components of 12 HER2 heterogeneous breast cancers using gene copy number profiling and massively parallel sequencing, and identified potential driver genetic alterations restricted to the HER2-negative cells in each case. Our results indicate that even driver genetic alterations, such as HER2, can be heterogeneously distributed in a cancer, and that the HER2-negative components are likely driven by genetic alterations not present in the HER2-positive components, including BRF2 and DSN1 amplification.

DESIGN
13 breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification by central immunohistochemistry and CISH were amenable to microdissection, as HER2-positive and HER2-negative areas were sufficiently discrete. The HER2-positive and HER2-negative components were microdissected either on a PixCell II laser capture microdissector (Arcturus) into separate tubes from 8um-thick representative tissue sections stained with HercepTest for guidance, or using a sterile needle under a stereomicroscope in selected cases.
