TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Mtb H37Rv on treatment with ATD-3169 (Redox generating compound)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Mtb H37Rv was found to be highly susceptible to ATD-3169 (Redox generating compound). To further understand the mechanism of ATD-3169 action, we performed microarray analysis of Mtb H37Rv exposed to 3µM, 30 µM and 150µM of ATD-3169 for 4h.

DESIGN
Mtb H37Rv was grown till early log phase and treated with ATD-3169 concentrations (3uM, 30uM, 150uM) for 4 hours at 37 degrees at 180rpm. Three independent experiments were done for each of the strain.
