TITLE
Gene expression profiling on isogenic lines expressing wild-type and mutant forms of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are two mutually exclusive ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF complex. SMARCA4 deficient lung cancer population selectively depend on SMARCA2 for cancer growth phenotype. Rescue experiments with ectopic expression of wild-type, bromodomain mutant and ATPase dead SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 highlight that ATPase domain is the drug target. In this study, we performed genome-wide microarray and differential gene expression profiling on isogenic lung cancer lines expressing cDNA rescue constructs for wild-type, bromodomain mutant and ATPase dead SMARCA2 and SMARCA4

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from A549 and H1299 cells expressing wild-type, bromodomain mutant or ATPase dead SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 cDNA
