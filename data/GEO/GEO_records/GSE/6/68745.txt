TITLE
Expression data from wildtype and Tfr1 heart KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We deleted Tfr1 in the heart to determine the role of Tfr1 in iron uptake in normal cardiac funciton  We used microarrays to identify global gene changes associated with deletion of Tfr1 in skeletal muscle

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from WT and Tfr1 KO hearts at both postnatal day 5 and postnatal day 10.RNA was labaled and hibridized to Affymetrics microarrays.
