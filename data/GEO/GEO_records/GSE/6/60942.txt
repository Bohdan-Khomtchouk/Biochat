TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of Pattern II Demyelinating Brain Lesions from a Multiple Sclerosis Patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with marked heterogeneity in several aspects including pathological processes. Four histopathological patterns of MS have been described. Pattern II is characterized by infiltrating macrophages and T-cells and by antibody and complement deposition. Transcriptome analysis of three patern II demyelinating brain lesions from a multiple sclerosis patient using RNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of mRNA transcripts for genes specific of activated macrophages, T and B cells as well as genes coding for immunoglobulins, complement proteins and some pattern II associated proteins, providing additional evidence supporting pattern II demyelination.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different demyelinating lesions identified by Immunohistopathology.
