TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of the developing lower urogenital region

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We will use micro-dissection and FACS techniques to isolate cell types from the developing lower urogenital region and perform a transcriptional analysis using RNA-SEQ.  This analysis will determine the transcriptional profile of each cell type, identify compartment specific transcripts, compartment specific transcript isoforms and cell-type specific long-noncoding RNAs.  In addition the unbiased nature of RNA-SEQ will potentially identify novel transcripts that have not been annotated in the database.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from FACS isolated embryonic day 17.5 bladders using Tg(Upk2-cre)6Xrw x Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo transgenic mice.  The long term goal is to generate a transcriptional atlas of developing lower urogenital region.
