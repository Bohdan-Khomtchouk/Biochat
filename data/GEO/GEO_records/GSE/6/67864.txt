TITLE
Profiling ethanol-targeted transcription factors in human carcinoma cell-derived embryoid bodies.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 493 differentially expressed genes were identified in response to 50 mM ethanol exposure, in which 111 of them were up-regulated and 382 were down-regulated. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis revealed that the genes are involved in the important biological processes like neurological system process, cognition, behavior, sensory perception of smell, taste and chemical stimuli and synaptic transmission. In consistent, disease enrichment chart showed relevant categories like neurological diseases, developmental disorders, skeletal and muscular disorders, connective tissue disorders. Furthermore, we have shorted out a group of 26 genes that encode transcription factors. We validated relative gene expression of several transcription factors from the list by quantitative real time PCR. We hope that our study substantially contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the pathology of alcohol mediated anomalies and ease further research.

DESIGN
Our aim was to provide a profile of important regulator that exerts ethanol related genomic alteration. For this, we have analyzed gene expression pattern of human carcinoma cell derived embryoid bodies in absence or presence of ethanol. A cDNA microarray analysis was used to profile mRNA expression in embryoid bodies at day 7 with or without ethanol treatment.
