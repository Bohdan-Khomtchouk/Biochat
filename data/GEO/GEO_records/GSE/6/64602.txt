TITLE
Expression data from AMPK deficient MLL-AF9 leukemia initiating cells and whole leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of AMPK significantly extended the onset of leukemogenesis and depleted leukemia initiating cells (LICs). To identify how AMPK regulates LICs, we performed gene expression profiling of LICs isolated from AMPK wild type leukemic mice or AMPK-deficient leukemic mice.

DESIGN
4 groups were analyzed; 1) Whole leukemia (GFP+) from AMPK WT ( AMPKfl/fl) mice, 2) Whole leukemia  (GFP+) from AMPK-deficient ( AMPKΔ/Δl) mice, 3) LICs=L-GMP  (GFP+,lin-,c-kit+, CD16/32+,CD34+) cells from  AMPK WT ( AMPKfl/fl) mice, 4) LICs=L-GMP  (GFP+,lin-,c-kit+, CD16/32+,CD34+) cells from AMPK-deficient ( AMPKΔ/Δl)  mice.
