TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in human esophageal cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
miRNAs comprise a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to various human tumors. This study was aimed to identify new aberrant expression miRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and invested the potential functions in this tumor.
