TITLE
Septic shock in advanced age: Transcriptome analysis reveals altered molecular signatures in neutrophil granulocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of granulocytes from 24 subjects was used to investigate their differences regarding sepsis and aging.

DESIGN
Two-colour hybridization design. Aliquots of total RNA isolated from adult or elder individuals with sepsis or healthy controls were labeled with Cy3 and co-hybridized with a common reference RNA pool (Universal Human Reference RNA, Agilent, cat #740000) labeled with Cy5 . Biological replicates:6 per group. No technical replicates.
