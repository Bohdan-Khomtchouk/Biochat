TITLE
Hepatic gene expression data from A/J mouse and A/J-12SM consomic mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SMXA-5 mouse shows a high-fat induced fatty liver. The QTL for fatty liver was mapped on mouse chromosome 12, designated as Fl1sa. The liver triglycerides content of A/J-12SM consomic mouse, a chromosome substitution strain, was suppressed  compared to that of A/J mouse. We compared the hepatic gene expressions between A/J mouse and A/J-12SM consomic mouse.

DESIGN
Total RNA of male A/J mice and A/J-12SM consomic mice fed a high-fat diet for 7weeks were extracted individually from liver of nine mice.   The RNAs from three mice were pooled and hybridized on one Affimetrix microarray. Sample were analyzed in triplicate set of array (three biological replicates).
