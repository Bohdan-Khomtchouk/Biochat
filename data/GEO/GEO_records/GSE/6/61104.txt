TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana roots at 7DAG; ga1, ga1 scl3 (LOF) and ga1 SCL3 OE (GOF)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in the root between ga1, ga1 scl3 and ga1 SCL3 OE.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to determine the effect of GRAS transcription factor SCL3 and gibberellin on the growth and development of the Arabidopsis root system by global transcriptome analysis and to identify new regulators in the regulatory pathway.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiments, ga1, ga1 scl3 and ga1 SCL3 OE. Biological triplicates: 3 ga1-3 , 3 ga1-3 scl3 and 3 ga1-3 SCL3 OE
