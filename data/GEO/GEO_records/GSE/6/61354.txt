TITLE
BRMS1L suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inducing epigenetic silence of FZD10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRMS1L (breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 like，BRMS1-like) is a component of the SIN3A-HDAC corepressor complex that suppresses target gene transcription. Here, we show that reduced BRMS1L in breast cancer tissues is associated with tumor metastasis and poor patient survival. Functionally, BRMS1L inhibits migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These effects are mediated by epigenetic silencing of FZD10, a receptor for Wnt signaling, by facilitating the recruitment of HDAC1 to its promoter and enhancing histone H3K9 deacetylation. Consequently, BRMS1L-induced FZD10 silencing inhibits aberrant activation of WNT3-FZD10--catenin signaling. Furthermore, BRMS1L is a target of miR-106b and miR-106b upregulation leads to BRMS1L reduction in breast cancer cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of BRMS1L expression promotes metastasis of breast cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice, while ectopic BRMS1L expression inhibits metastasis. Therefore, BRMS1L provides an epigenetic regulation of Wnt signaling in breast cancer cells and acts as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor.

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with negative control vector or vector overexpressing BRMS1L for 24 hours. Each chip measures the expression 45033 genes were collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI.
