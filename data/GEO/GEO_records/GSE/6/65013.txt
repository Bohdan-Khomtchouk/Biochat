TITLE
Cell cloning of Barrett's esophagus stem cell, gastric cardia stem cells and normal esophagus stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus confers significant risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  We have established the cloning of patient-matched stem cells of Barrett’s, gastric, and esophageal epithelium.  Barrett's esophagus stem cells (BE), gastric cardia stem cells (GC) and normal esophagus stem cells (Eso) from 12 patients were cloned (For BE: 12 patients, GC: 12 patients and Eso: 2 patients). Keratin 5 positive and Keratin 7 positive cells were cloned from human fetal esophageal epithelium. Using air liquid interface culture system, stem cells were induced to differentiate into mature epithelial structures.

DESIGN
We cultured the cloned patient-matched stem cells of Barrett’s, gastric, esophageal epithelium, fetal esophagus cells (krt5 and krt7 + cells) and performed the ALI structure. Total RNA were isolated from them.   We used Affymetrix chips (HuEx-1_0-st-v2)  to hybridize 2 samples from each stem cell and ALI strucure.
