TITLE
Transcription analysis on difference of copper body concentrations in Crassostrea angulate

ORGANISM
Crassostrea angulata

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of intraspecies difference of copper accumulation in Crassostrea angulata. In this attempt, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome of oyster (gill and mantle). Digital gene expression (DGE) technology was applied to analyze the relationships between gene expression and differential Cu body burden.
