TITLE
Transcription factor binding dynamics during human ES cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells provide a powerful system to dissect the underlying molecular dynamics that regulate cell fate changes during mammalian development. Here we report the integrative analysis of genome wide binding data for 38 transcription factors with extensive epigenome and transcriptional data across the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to the three germ layers. We describe core regulatory dynamics and show the lineage specific behavior of selected factors. In addition to the orchestrated remodeling of the chromatin landscape, we find that the binding of several transcription factors is strongly associated with specific loss of DNA methylation in one germ layer and in many cases a reciprocal gain in the other layers. Taken together, our work shows context-dependent rewiring of transcription factor binding, downstream signaling effectors, and the epigenome during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.

DESIGN
200 ChIP-seq experiments profiling 38 transcription factors (TFs) and several chromatin marks in 5 cell types--male human ES cell line HUES64 and directed differentiation of HUES64 towards mesendoderm (dMS, 12 hours), endoderm (dEN, 120 hours), mesoderm (dME, 120 hours), and ectoderm (dEC, 120 hours). In addition, three ES cell lines were derived with shRNA mediated knockdown of GATA4 and differention toward endoderm (dEN_shGATA4) and mesoderm (dME_shGATA4). These cell lines were used for MNChIP-seq of GATA4, SMAD1, and H3K27Ac and for 4 RRBS experiments in GATA4 knockdown and control cell lines.
