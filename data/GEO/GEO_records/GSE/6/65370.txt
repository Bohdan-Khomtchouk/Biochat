TITLE
Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid-enriched high fat diet delays the development of fatty liver in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of quality of fat in a high fat diet (HFD) over time on hepatic lipid storage and transcriptome in mice. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse liver after being fed with Control, HFD-EPA/DHA and HFD-corn oil diet for 8 and 12 weeks.

DESIGN
In total, 24 samples were analyzed. Based on hierarchical clustering and scatter plots, one microarray from the HFD-corn oil group at 8 weeks was removed from subsequent analyses. The Piano package was used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify the total number of genes regulated and the direction of regulation. Gene Ontology (GO) terms were annotated to each probe-set after performing GSEA. The reporter algorithm was used to analyse the functional enrichment level of individual GO term. Heatmaps were generated using the  log10p-values to visualize enriched GO biological processes (BPs) terms.
