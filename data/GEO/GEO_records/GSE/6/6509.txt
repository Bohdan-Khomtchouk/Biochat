TITLE
Gene Profile of RU486 effect on LPS induced gene expression in CNS.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was designed in order to identify genes differentially expressed when glucocorticoid signaling is blocked by a glucocorticoid-receptor antagonist (RU486 â€“ mifepristone) in the context of brain inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is only able to cause murine brain damage in our experimental conditions upon RU486 pre-treatment. Hence, the study may reveal potential candidate genes to mediate neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. Due to the factorial design of the experiment, RU486 main-effect could be dissociated from the effects resultant of RU486/inflammation interaction. In addition, brain dissection was conducted to verify the effects in the brain side ipsilateral or contralateral to the site of intracerebral LPS infusion.
