TITLE
Loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is linked to gene body hypermethylation in kidney cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation is common in cancer. To associate DNA methylation with gene function, we performed RNAseq upon tumor  tissue and matched normal tissues of two ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) patients. To quantify 5mC and 5hmC level in each CG site at genome-wide level, we performed BS-seq and TAB-seq upon tumor  tissue and matched normal tissues of two ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) patients, respectively.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of tumor and matched normal tissues from two ccRCC patients were generated by deep sequencing, using Hiseq 2000. Single-nucleotide-resolution, whole-genome, 5mC and 5hmC profiles of tumor and matched normal tissues from two ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) patients were generated by deep sequencing, using Hiseq 2000.
