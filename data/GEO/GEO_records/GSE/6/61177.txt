TITLE
Myocardial gene expression in response to pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myocardial deletion of klf4 sensitizes mouse to pressure overload. In order to gain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of such alterations, we profiled gene expression before and after 3-day of pressure overload (induced by transverse aortic constriction -TAC) in the hearts from MHC-cre (Cre) control and MHC-cre-klf4-deficient (KO) mice.

DESIGN
10wk old male mice was subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce pressure overload or sham operation as control group. After 3 days, heart was removed and total RNA was extracted from apex and subjected for array analysis. Four animals in each group.
