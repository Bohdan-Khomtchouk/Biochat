TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for miR-340 overexpressing human glioma-initiating cells (GICs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify functional targets of miR-340, we compared the gene expression profiles of miR-340 overexpressing human GICs with the profiles of their parental cells.

DESIGN
The precursor form of miR-340 or control miRNA was overexpressed in glioma cells using miRNA lentiviral particles. The cells were incubated with recombinant virus at 37Â°C for 12 hr and cultured in the presence of puromycin for 3 days.
