TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Regulated by the HER2 Isoform HER2D16 in MCF-7 Breast Tumor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The oncogenic isoform of HER2, HER2D16, was stably overexpressed in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line (MCF-7/HER2D16) and miR expresion profiles between MCF-7 cell lines expressing a vector control (MCF-7/pcDNA) were compared to the MCF-7/HER2D16 cell line.

DESIGN
This experiment includes a total of 4 samples which are divided in to 2 groups, each with 2 biological repeats
