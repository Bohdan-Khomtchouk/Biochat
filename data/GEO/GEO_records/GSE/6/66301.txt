TITLE
Gene expression profiling of patient's DCIS-IDC tandem lesions by RNA sequencing analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tandem DCIS/IDC are defined as ductal carcicnoma in situ (DCIS) lesions that have concurrent invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) within the same breast. These are identified radiologically by an area of clustered microcalcifications adjacent to (contiguous with) an invasive mass. Our radiologist (Dr. William P. Smith) has provided us with biopsy cores from each region. One core from each region (DCIS and IDC) has bas been collected and subjected to RNA sequencing for our studies to compare changes from DCIS to IDC in each individual patient.

DESIGN
6 pairs of DCIS-IDC samples were collected, and analysed by RNA sequencing
