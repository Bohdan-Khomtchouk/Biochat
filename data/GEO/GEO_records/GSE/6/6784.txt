TITLE
Expression data from MCF10A cells subject to EGF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10A cells derived from spontaneously immortalized normal human mammary epithel were subjected to EGF/SERUM stimulation for 0,20,40,60,120,240 and 480 minutes. We used microarrays to understand the temporal regulation of the cellular EGFR cascade. Keywords: time course
