TITLE
Characterization of protoporphytin IX effects on X-ray irradiation in Hela cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hela cells were used to evaluate the protoporphytin IX (PpIX) effects on X-ray irradiation. Treatment conditions were (1) control group (untreated cells); (2) cells treated with 1 μg /ml PpIX for 6 hours; (3) cells irradiated with 3Gy X-rays; (4) cells treated with 1 μg /ml PpIX for 6 hours prior to irradiation with 3Gy X-rays.

DESIGN
Hela cells gene expressions in 4 groups were measured at 24 hours after exposure to 0 and 3 Gy X-rays plus treatment with PpIX prior to irradiation.
