TITLE
Chip-seq analysis of CHD8 distribution in T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHD8 is an ATPase of the SNF2 family involved in ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling. Here we report data of the occupancy of CHD8 by ChIP-seq in human breast carcinoma T47D cells under different growing conditions. We show that under normal proliferation conditions CHD8 is mostly associated with promoters. Then, cells were subjected to 48 h or serum starvation followed by stimulation with the progesterone receptor (PR) agonist R5020 or with vehicle (ethanol), for 5 and 45 minutes. R5020 induced the fast association of CHD8 with a number of intergenic or intronic regions. We found that these regions were enriched in PR binding sites. Furthermore, they were enriched in H3K4me1 and P300, typical markers of enhancers. Therefore, our data indicate that in the presence of the PR agonist CHD8 is recruited to a number of PR enhancers. In additional experiments we demonstrated that CHD8 is required for activation of PR enhancers and for transcriptional regulation of progesterone-dependent genes.

DESIGN
Examination of CHD8 distribution in five different growing conditions and one IgG control sample.
