TITLE
LncRNAs specific signature in acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate risk

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics (NC-AML). To this end, we used RNA-sequencing approach on forty NC-AML to evaluate the lncRNAs expression profile.

DESIGN
lncRNAs expression profile of 40 AML patients were generated by RNAsequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000
