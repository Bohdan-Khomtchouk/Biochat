TITLE
A microfluidic device for epigenomic profiling using 100 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed the microfluidic-oscillatory-washing-based ChIP-Seq (MOWChIP-Seq) protocol. We achieved genome-wide mapping of histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) with as few as 100 cells. Moreover, the automated microfluidic platform dramatically reduced assay time and has a potential for future scale-up.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) in 2 cell types (GM12878 and mouse Embryonic day 14.5 Fetal Liver Lineage-Sca1+c-Kit+ cells) with chromatin samples of various sizes (10K, 1K, 600, and 100 cells). These samples were aliquoted from a stock generated by sonicating 10K cells. Examination of 2 different histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) in GM12878 cells by directly starting with 100 and 600 sonicated cells (labeled as " direct " ).
