TITLE
Role of histone demethylase LSD1 in hepatic cancer metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of LSD1-depleted HepG2 cells revealed that LSD1 regulates the expression of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism genes. We found that LSD1 is an important regulator of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in hepatoma.

DESIGN
We depleted LSD1 in HepG2 human hepatoma cells using two different siRNAs, and then carried out an expression microarray experiment.
