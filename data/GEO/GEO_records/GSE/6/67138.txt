TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs between human HCC tumors with and without vascular invasion [batch 1]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) mainly regulate the expression of targeted genes by regulating mRNA degradation or repressing their protein translation. Recent research has shown miRNAs to have remarkable potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. Since vascular invasion (VI) provides a direct path for solid tumor metastasis/recurrence, in this study we investigated if miRNAs can serve as a biomarker to differentiate between VI- and VI+ tumors. MiRNA microarray profiling was then performed on 172 human HCC tumors samples with or without VI from HCC patients.
