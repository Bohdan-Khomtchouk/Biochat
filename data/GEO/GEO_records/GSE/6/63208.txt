TITLE
Epigenomic profiling in visceral white adipose tissue of offspring of mice exposed to late gestational sleep fragmentation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Late gestational sleep fragmentation (LG-SF) is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. Objectives: To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring. Methods: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or control sleep (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using MeDIP coupled to microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice/group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks. Results: We detected 2148 DMRs between LG-SF and LG-SC groups (p < 0.0001, MAT algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response. Conclusions: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated to metabolic processes and inflammatory response in VWAT. Furthermore, LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations appear to increase the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

DESIGN
16 mouse VWAT samples were analyzed by MeDIP coupled to microarray analysis: Offspring of mothers exposed to late-gestational sleep fragmentation (n=8, LG-SF group) and offspring of mothers mouse exposed to normal sleep conditions (n=8, LG-SC group)
