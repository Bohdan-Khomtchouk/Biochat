TITLE
Glis3 regulates pancreatic beta cells development and maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glis3 is expressed in pancreatic beta and PP cells. To identify down stream target genes of Glis3, we performed microarray analysis using pancreas total RNAs from 1 week-old WT and Glis3KO2 mice.  insulin and pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy) was significantly decreased together with several other β cell markers, Glut2 and MafA by microarray analysis. Immunohistochemistry, QRT-PCR, and transmission electron microscopy indicated that postnatal Glis3KO2 pancreas still contains a large population of β cells that express Pdx-1, Nkx6.1, and Isl-1; however, insulin production and secretory granules were greatly reduced in these cells. In addition, chromogranin A (ChgA) and Urocortin 3, which are associated with mature β cells, was dramatically decreased in Glis3KO2 pancreas. These observations suggest that Glis3 plays a critical role in the maturation of pancreatic β cell phenotype.

DESIGN
Pancreatic total RNAs were purified from 4 WT and 4 Glis3KO2 at 1 week old age. Then the samples were applied to Agilent mouse genome chip.
