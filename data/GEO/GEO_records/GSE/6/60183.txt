TITLE
Gene expression in the epidermis including guard cells of phot1 phot2 and pGC1::SOC1-GFP/phot1 phot2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Stomata pores are surrounded by a pair of guard cells in the epidermis in plants. Stomata apature is controlled by environmental factors. Stomata opening is also enhanced by introduction of SOC1-GFP driven by GC1 promoter in phot1 phot2 double mutants (pGC1::SOC1-GFP/ phot1 phot2). Epidermis including guard cells were isolated from phot1 phot2 and pGC1::SOC1-GFP/phot1 phot2 and gene expression were analyzed.

DESIGN
phot1-5 phot2-1 in gl1 background (phot1 phot2) and pGC1::SOC1-GFP/phot1 phot2 were grown under 16 h light / 8h dark, constant 22ËšC conditions for 4 to 5 weeks. Epidermis including guard cells were isolated from leaves of these plants. Three biological replicates were used.
