TITLE
The human reticulocyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA from circulating blood reticulocytes was utilized to provide a robust description of genes transcribed at the final stages of erythroblast maturation. After depletion of leukocytes and platelets, Affymetrix HG-U133 arrays were hybridized with probe from total RNA isolated from blood sampled from 14 umbilical cords and 14 healthy adult humans. Keywords: Adult vs. fetal reticulocyte transcriptome comparison
