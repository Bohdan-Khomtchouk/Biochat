TITLE
LRP8-Reelin-regulated Neuronal (LRN) Enhancer signature underlying learning and memory formation (GRO-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comprehensive landscape of epigenomic events regulated by the Reelin signaling through activation of specific cohort of cis-regulatory enhancer elements (LRN-enhancers), which involves the proteolytical processing of the LRP8 receptor by the gamma-secretase activity and is required for learning and memory behavior

DESIGN
All GRO-Seq experiments were designed to understand the unique signature of LRN-enhancers and  to evaluate the transcriptional response to Reelin treatment in neuronal cells.
