TITLE
Identification of MOL1-dependent genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to generate the transcriptional profile of WT and mol1-1 mutants in a 1cm fragment above the base of the infloresence stem of 15 to 20 cm tall Arabidopsis. We then used stastical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes that potentially contribute to the mol1-1 mutant phenotype.

DESIGN
RNA from two replicates each of WT and mol1-1 mutants were sequenced and differentially expressed genes were identified.
