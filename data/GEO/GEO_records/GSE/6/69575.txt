TITLE
Probing the regulatory effects of specific mutations in three major binding domains of the pleiotropic regulator CcpA of Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Study the effect of single amino acid point mutations in CcpA at the transcriptome level. Cells were grown in LB with or without 1% glucose and harvested at an OD600 of 0.3 (early exponential phase).
