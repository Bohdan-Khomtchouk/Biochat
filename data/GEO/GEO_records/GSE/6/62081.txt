TITLE
Gene expression in WT and podoplanin (PDPN)-deficient MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEFs were grown from WT and PDPN-deficient mouse embryos and gene expression was analyzed. The aim was to determine whether a lack of PDPN caused significant global changes in gene expression in primary fibroblasts. Here, we performed a microarray on WT and PDPN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts to determine whether there were signficiant underlying changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
Two replicates each of WT and PDPN KO MEFs from C57BL6/J mice
