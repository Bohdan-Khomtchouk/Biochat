TITLE
Sex-specific early response to pressure overload in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pressure overload (PO) leads first to cardiac hypertrophy and later to heart failure. In mice, PO leads to sex differences in cardiac morphology and function.  However, early sex differences in gene regulation that precede sex differences in function have not yet been identified. To identify such changes, we developed a model of PO that is characterized by compensated hypertrophy without sex differences after 2 weeks and by heart failure with sex differences after 9 weeks. We used transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham-operation in male and female mice and analyzed gene expression by microarray experiments. Keywords: the influence of gender on hypertrophic gene expression
