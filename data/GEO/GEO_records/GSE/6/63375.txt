TITLE
Pre-mRNA Splicing is Facilitated by an Optimal RNA Polymerase II Elongation Rate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing was analyzed by  in isogenic human HEK293 cell lines that inducibly express a-amanitin resistant mutants of the RNA polymerase II large subunit with slow and fast elongation rates.

DESIGN
Alternative splicing was analyzed by, RNA-seq and RASL-seq of polyA+ RNA from a-amanitin treated cells; transcription elongation rate was analyzed by BrUTP-labelled GRO-seq of a-amanitin treated cells at time points after release from a DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-bold beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) block.
