TITLE
MLL1 and MLL fusion proteins play distinct roles in regulating MLLleukemic transcription program [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the transcriptome profiling of: 1) MM-401, a MLL1 specific inhibitor in MAF9 cells; 2) Comparation of the transcriptone profilings of MM-401,EPZ-5676 (Dot1L inhibitor), MI-2(Menin inhibitor) and  iBET(Brd4 inhibitor) in MAF9 leukemia cells.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq profiling on mouse MAF9 leukemia cells. Biological duplicates of each sample are labled as rep1/2.
