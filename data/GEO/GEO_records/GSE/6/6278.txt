TITLE
Global Mapping of Transposon Location

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transposable genetic elements are ubiquitous, yet their presence or  absence at any given position within a genome can vary between  individual cells, tissues, or strains. Transposable elements have  profound impacts on host genomes by altering gene expression,  assisting in genomic rearrangements, causing insertional mutations,  and serving as sources of phenotypic variation. Characterizing a  genome?s full complement of transposons requires whole genome  sequencing, precluding simple studies of the impact of transposition  on interindividual variation. Here, we describe a global mapping  approach for identifying transposon locations in any genome, using a  combination of transposon-specific DNA extraction and microarray- based comparative hybridization analysis. We use this approach to map  the repertoire of endogenous transposons in different laboratory  strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that transposons  are a source of extensive genomic variation. We also apply this  method to mapping bacterial transposon insertion sites in a yeast  genomic library. This unique whole genome view of transposon location  will facilitate our exploration of transposon dynamics, as well as  defining bases for individual differences and adaptive potential.
