TITLE
Genome-wide screening for complete genetic loss in PCa by CGH onto cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) onto cDNA microarrays may be used to carry out genome-wide screens for regions of genetic loss, including homozygous (complete) deletions that may represent the possible location of tumour suppressor genes in human cancer. Screening of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 allowed the mapping of specific regions where genome copy number appeared altered and led to the identification of two novel regions of complete loss at 17q21.31 (500 kb spanning STAT3) and at 10q23.1 (50-350 kb spanning SFTPA2) in the PC3 cell line. Keywords: Tumour vs normal comparison, array CGH
