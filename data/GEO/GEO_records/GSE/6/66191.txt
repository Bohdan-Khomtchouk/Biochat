TITLE
Elevated dairy fat intake in lactating women alters milk lipid and fatty acids without detectible changes in expression of genes related to lipid uptake or synthesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous work has demonstrated that elevated maternal lipid intake (particularly from dairy products) is associated with increased lipids and altered fatty acid profile in milk produced by healthy lactating women. We investigate our primary hypothesis that a maternal diet rich in full-fat dairy products would simultaneously increase milk lipid percent and expression of genes related to the uptake and/or de novo biosynthesis of milk lipids.

DESIGN
Within a a randomized, crossover study we performed a microarray analysis comparing 6 lactating women with diets rich in full-fat or non-fat dairy products. Each woman consumed one of the two diets during timepoint one, and after a two week washout period, switched over to the other diet. The timepoint value indicates whether the particular dietary treatment was consumed first or second.
