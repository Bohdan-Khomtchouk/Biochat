TITLE
Myeloid cells stimulate liver metastasis through downregulation of ANGPTL7 in cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of the molecular effects of myeloid cells on cancer cells. Myeloid cells were shown to promote metastatic liver progression but the mechanisms involved is unknown. Here we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells upon myeloid cell depletion.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from FACS sorted MC38 colon cancer cells in tumor bearing livers of CD11bDTR transgenic mice after PBS (control) or DT (depletion) treatments.
