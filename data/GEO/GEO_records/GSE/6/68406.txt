TITLE
Profiling of Salivary Exosomal microRNAs in Oral Lichen Planus Patients [set 1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared microRNA (miRNA) profiles of salivary exosomes of patients with oral lichen planus with those of healthy controls. Saliva samples from 16 patients with oral lichen planus and 8 healthy controls were divided into 2 sets and were examined by performing miRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Examination of 8 oral lichen planus patients and 4 healthy controls. Each patient and control represent pooled RNAs from salivary exosomes of 8 patients and 4 healthy controls, respectively. Please note that each set (i.e. set1 and set2) was analysed independently.
