TITLE
Expression data from renal dendritic cells under homeostatic conditions and from donor and host dendritic cells from renal allografts (3 days post-transplantation), isolated from cortex and medulla.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Renal dendritic cells play key roles in renal homeostasis and during kidney allograft rejection. Microarray analysis aims to evaluate whether dendritic cells modulate their gene expression profile in relation to their distribution in the different renal compartments (with varying biophysical characteristics), under homeostatic conditions and during acute renal allograft rejection (3 days post-transplantation).

DESIGN
Renal dendritic cells from homeostatic (healthy) kidneys and donor/host dendritic cells from renal allografts (3 days post-kidney transplantation) were isolated from cortex and medulla, through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted cells and amplified. The cDNA product was fragmented, biotin-labeled and hybridized on Affimetrix arrays.
