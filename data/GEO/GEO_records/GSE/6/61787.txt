TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the heart tissues of heart-specific Bmal1 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice without cardiac Bmal1 function develop severe progressive heart failure with age.  To examine the mechanism underlying the failing heart phenotype observed in heart-specific Bmal1 knockout mice, microarray analyses were performed.  The analyses revealed that broad classes of genes regulating cellular energy metabolism were upregulated or downregulated in the heart tissues of heart-specific Bmal1 knockout mice compared with those of control animals.

DESIGN
Heart total RNA extracted from six animals per genotype (control and heart-specific Bmal1 knockout) was pooled and then used for a microarray analysis.
