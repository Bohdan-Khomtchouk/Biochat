TITLE
Evolution of Context Dependent Regulation by Expansion of Feast/Famine Regulatory Proteins [ChIP-chip]

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) experiments were carried out for all 8 FFRPs in H. salinarum NRC-1.

DESIGN
To study the FFRP localization in both nutrient-replete and -deplete conditions, all strains were grown in CDM and genomic DNA of samples was harvested in both early log phase and late log phase. DNA from FFRP-bound regions was collected through c-Myc-tagged protein complexes and unenriched non-IP DNA were each labeled and hybridized to the whole genome tiling array.
