TITLE
DNA methylation data from cell lines originating from patients with multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of KMS11, MM.1S, and RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell lines to identify methylation changes distinct to each cell line

DESIGN
Three multiple myeloma cell lines (KMS11, MM.1S, and RPMI8226) with two replicates each
