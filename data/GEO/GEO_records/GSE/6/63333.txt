TITLE
Genome-wide binding patterns of group B Sox proteins in four Drosophila species

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used DamID-seq to analyze the genome-wide binding patterns of the group B Sox proteins Dichaete and SoxNeuro in four species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura. Both binding site turnover between species and a comparison of the binding properties of the two partially-redundant transcription factors were analyzed. We found that, despite widespread turnover, genomic intervals that are commonly bound by both Dichaete and SoxNeuro are highly conserved in Drosophila.

DESIGN
DamID for Dichaete (Dichaete-Dam) was performed in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura, while DamID for SoxNeuro (SoxN-Dam) was performed in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The control experiment, Dam-only, was performed in all species. Three biological replicates were sequenced for each condition in each species.
