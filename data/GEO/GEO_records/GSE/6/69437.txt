TITLE
Gene expression in wheat heads treated  with the mutant tri6Δ of Fusarium graminearum, which produces a priming-induced resistance to fusarium head blight

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease of cereal crops caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg). FHB affects the flowering heads (or spikes) and developing seeds.  This study compares the gene expression profile of heads from the susceptible cultivar Roblin after inoculation with either water (W) or the disarmed Fg strain tri6Δ (T6). Tri6 is a global transcription regulator affecting the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway.

DESIGN
We used the Affymetrix wheat array to compare gene expression in wheat spikelets from the susceptible cultivar Roblin.  One central spikelet (F0) per head was inoculated with either water (W) or the disarmed Fg strain tri6Δ (T6) using a point inoculation method.  Sampling was done at 0, 24 and 48 hours after inoculation. Spikelets F0, F2 and F4 relative to inoculation point were sampled separately. Three biological replicates were done for each condition.
