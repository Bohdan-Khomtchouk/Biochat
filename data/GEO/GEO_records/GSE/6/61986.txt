TITLE
Differiential gene expression profiling in peripheral blood between pregnant sows versus non-pregnant sows

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular markers of early pregnancy in pigs, we compared global gene expression profiles of the maternal peripheral blood in pregnant sows with the non-pregnant sows. Peripheral blood sample was collected at 14 days after insemination from the submandibular vein of pregnant and non-pregnant sows respectively, and total RNA was isolated, purified and sent for microarray analysis. This study identified 127 up-regulated and 56 down-regulated genes (FC > = 1.5 and P < 0.05) in peripheral blood from pregnant sows versus non-pregnant sows. Of the differently expressed genes, nine (including LPAR3, RXFP4, GALP, CBR1, CBR2, GPX6, USP18, LHB and NR5A1) were found to exert function related to early pregnancy processes. Seven differentially expressed genes (CHGB, USP18, VWF, LPAR3, NR5A1, PPARD, BIN1) were selected to perform qRT-PCR in the same RNA samples.The expression profiles of these genes detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with those by microarray, which confirmed the reliability of our microarray data.

DESIGN
To minimize the adverse effects of genetic heterogeneity in microarray experiments, three half-sib pairs and one unrelated pair were selected with four sows from the pregnancy group and the other four from the non-pregnancy group.
