TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of Su(H) in Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cell lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The conserved Notch pathway functions in diverse developmental and disease-related processes, requiring mechanisms to ensure appropriate target-selection and gene activation in each context. To investigate, we partitioned Drosophila chromatin into different states, based on histone modifications, establishing the preferred chromatin conditions for binding of CSL, the Notch pathway transcription factor. While most histone modifications were unchanged by CSL binding or Notch activation, rapid changes in H3K56 acetylation occurred at Notch regulated-enhancers. This modification extended over large regions, required the histone acetyl-transferase CBP and was independent of transcription. Such rapid changes in H3K56 acetylation are a conserved indicator of enhancer activation, also occurring at mammalian Notch-regulated Hey1 and at Drosophila ecdysone-regulated genes. This core histone modification may therefore underpin the changes in chromatin accessibility needed to promote transcription following signaling activation.

DESIGN
Su(H) profile of Kc cells transfected with GFP-Su(H). In total 6 samples,  3 replicates of anti-GFP ChIP and corresponding total input samples in Kc cells.
