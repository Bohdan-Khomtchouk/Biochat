SUMMARY
EORTC 10994 phase III breast cancer clinical  trial comparing FEC (5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin)  with ET (epirubicin, docetaxel). 161 needle biopsies of locally  advanced or large operable breast  tumours were hybridised to  Affymetrix X3P chips. The array data from the ER negative tumours  (28/65  pathological CR in the FEC arm, 27/59 pathological CR in the  ET arm) were used to validate the cell line-based chemotherapy  response predictors developed by the Potti/Nevins group at Duke  University (doi:10.1038/nm1491). Keywords: Tumour profiling
