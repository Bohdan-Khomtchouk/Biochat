TITLE
Enhancer Analysis in Peripheral Nerve Injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K27acetylation in sham and injured nerve. Schwann cells play an important role in the response of peripheral nerve to injury. This study was designed to identify enhancers that are altered in sciatic nerve at 3 days post-injury to help identify pathways that mediate the gene expression reprogramming that occurs in Schwann cells after nerve injury. We employed ChIP-seq analysis of H3K27 acetylation as a mark of actively engaged enhancers, and compared enhancers in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerve compared to contralateral (sham) condition.

DESIGN
2 independent ChIP samples each for Sham and Injury conditions, with respective inputs
