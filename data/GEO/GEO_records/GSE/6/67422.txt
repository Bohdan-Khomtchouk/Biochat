TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of chronic inflammation-induced gene expression in primary hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole genome expression changes in primary hepatocytes in response to chronic stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that chronic treatment of primary hepatocytes with TNFα would result in a reprogramming of the cell's transcriptome to improve adaptation to the presence of a chronic inflammatory stress. Here we provide expression analysis detailing genes upregulated, downregulated, and unchanged after 2 days of TNFα treatment. We have included gene expression profiling of cells treated with TNFα for 2 hours to help isolate the changes unique to chronic TNFα treatment of primary hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from primary hepatocytes cultured with 2ng/mL TNFα for 2 hours or 2 days, compared to untreated cells
