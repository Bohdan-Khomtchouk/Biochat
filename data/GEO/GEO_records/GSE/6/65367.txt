TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of neurons generated using induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with schizophrenia and 22q11.2 deletion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to study neuropsychiatric disorders associated with 22q11.2 microdeletions (del), the most common known schizophrenia (SZ) -associated genetic factor. Several genes in the deleted region have been implicated; one of the more promising candidates is DGCR8, which codes for a protein involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. We carried out miRNA expression profiling (miRNA-seq) on neurons generated from iPSCs derived from controls and SZ patients with 22q11.2 del.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling of 7 SZ samples and 9 Control samples derived from iPSCs
