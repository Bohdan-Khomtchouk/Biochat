TITLE
miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) profiling of monocyte-derived osteoclasts and macrophages.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the miRNA changes that occur during osteoclast differentiation we used the miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) to profile monocyte-derived osteoclasts and monocyte-derived macrophages. Of the 2046 probes present on the assay, we detected expression of ~400 (20%) miRNAs across all samples.
