TITLE
miR-K12-6-5p expression changes of human transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of BJAB cells expressing miR-K12-6-5p. To identify host RNA targets of KSHV miRNAs, we took advantage of the observation that RNAs targeted by miRNAs often display small reductions in their steady-state levels, perhaps as a result of their impaired translation. Accordingly, we examined cellular transcript accumulation by array-based expression profiling under four sets of conditions in which KSHV miRNAs were expressed.

DESIGN
Cells transfected with negative control miRNA compared to miR-K12-6-5p.
