TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Gata6 in primary mouse keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In adult K14ΔNLef1 mouse, the overexpression of ∆NLef1, a ß-catenin dominat negative, in basal keratinocytes leads to the conversion of hair follicles into multilayered epithelial cysts and ectopic sebaceous gland. ∆NLef1 transcriptional activity led to Gata6 overexpression in the pilosebaceous unit in transgenic mice. To uncover direct target genes of Gata6 we performed ChIP-Seq experiments in primary mouse keratinocytes.
