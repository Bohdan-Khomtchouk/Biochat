TITLE
Gene expression changes induced in K562 cells by the homeobox gene DLX4 and by treatment with Activin A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control patterning of virtually all organ systems including the hematopoietic system. However, the role of homeobox genes in controlling development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the homeobox gene DLX4 in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation using the bipotent cell line K562 as a model. We compared the global gene expression profile of K562 cells that stably overexpressed DLX4 with that of vector-control K562 cells. As positive controls, global gene expression profiles were evaluated in vector-control K562 cells that were stimulated with Activin A (ActA) to induce erythroid differentiation and in vector-control K562 cells that were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce megakaryocytic differentiation. Our study provides insights into the role of homeobox genes in controlling differentiation of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.

DESIGN
Three groups of samples were included: DLX4 vs Empty vector; Activin A vs None; PMA vs DMSO
