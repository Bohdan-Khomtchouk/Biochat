TITLE
Mouse Reissner's Membrane Gene Expression studies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to screen for the expressed genes in Reissner's membrane (RM) that are related to ion transport and its regulation.  The objectives were 1) to determine whether short-term incubation altered the transcriptome and 2 ) to discover which genes changed expression levels in response to glucocorticoids. Keywords: drug response
