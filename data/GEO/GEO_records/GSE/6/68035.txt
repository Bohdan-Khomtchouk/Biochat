TITLE
Extracellular matrix-dependent generation of integration- and xeno-free iPS cells using a modified mRNA transfection method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we sought to examine whether an extracellular matrix (ECM)-based xeno-free culture system that we recently established could be used together with a microRNA-enhanced mRNA reprogramming method for the generation of clinically safe iPS cells. The notable features of this method are (1) the use of a xeno-free/feeder-free culture system for the generation and expansion of iPS cells rather than the conventional labor-intensive culture systems using human feeder cells or human feeder-conditioned medium and (2) the enhancement of mRNA-mediated reprogramming via the delivery of microRNAs. Strikingly, we observed the early appearance of iPS cell colonies (~11 days), substantial reprogramming efficiency (~0.2-0.3%), and a high percentage of ESC-like colonies among the total colonies (~87.5%), indicating enhanced kinetics and reprogramming efficiency. Therefore, the combined method established in this study provides a valuable platform for the generation and expansion of clinically safe (i.e., integration- and xeno-free) iPS cells, facilitating immune-matched cell therapy in the near future.

DESIGN
Test (iPS generated by ECM-based xeno-free culture system with a microRNA-enhanced mRNA reprogramming method) vs. Control (hESC and fibroblast)
