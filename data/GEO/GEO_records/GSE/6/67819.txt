TITLE
microRNA alterations associated to early relapse in advanced stage ovarian cancer patients (validation set)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A set of 45 surgical specimens has been profiled for miRNA expression to validate miRNA alterations associated to early relapse in advanced stage ovarian cancer patients.

DESIGN
Fresh frozen samples were collected from a series of consecutive patients with high-grade advanced stage ovarian cancer who underwent primary surgery at INT-Milan. After surgery all patients received postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients signed an Institutional Review Board approved consent for bio-banking, clinical data collection and molecular analysis. Clinical codes: Histotype: according to WHO classification guidelines Stage: according to International Federation of Gynecological and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines Grading: according to WHO classification guidelines Debulking: NED: not evident disease; mRD: minimal residual disease; GRD: gross residual disease Therapy code: P: Platinum without taxanes; PT: Platinum/paclitaxel
