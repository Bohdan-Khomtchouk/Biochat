TITLE
Genome-wide identification of FHY3 binding sites in Arabidopsis floral organ (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify FHY3 regulated genes in floral organ. We performed RNA-seq using Ler, ag-10, fhy3-68, ag-10 fhy3-68.

DESIGN
Inflorescence of  Ler, ag-10, fhy3-68, ag-10 fhy3-68 containing stage 8 and younger flowers were harvested forRNA-seq analysis  two distinct biological replicates were subjected to ultra-high-throughput Solexa (Illumina) sequencing.
