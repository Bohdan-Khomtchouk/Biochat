TITLE
Brown Adipose YY1 Deficiency Activates Expression of Secreted Proteins Linked to Energy Expenditure and Prevents Diet-Induced Obesity [BAT]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown adipose tissue from Yin Yang 1 (YY1) brown fat specific knockout mice fed a high fat diet for 3 months. YY1 deficiency in brown adipose tissue leads to strong thermogenic deficiency. The goal was to identify the genes controlled by YY1 responsible of brown fat defective function.

DESIGN
Control mice YY1flox/flox versus YY1flox/flox; Ucp1Cre were fed a high fat diet for 3 months
