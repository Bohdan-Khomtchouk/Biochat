SUMMARY
Virus infection triggers widespread silencing of host genes by a distinct class of endogenous siRNAs in Arabidopsis

DESIGN
This study constructed and sequenced two independent small RNA libraries from the upper uninoculated leaves of (i) WT Arabidopsis plants 14 d after mock inoculation and of (ii) rdr1 rdr6 plants 14 d after infection with Fny CMV-Δ2b, and one library each from the upper uninoculated leaves of (iii) WT, (iv) rdr1, and (v) rdr6 plants 14 d after infection with TuMV-GFP. Coimmunoprecipitation with FLAG- and HA-specific antibodies was used to obtain (vi,vii) AGO1 and (viii,ix) AGO2 complexes, respectively, from the FLAG-AGO1/ago1-36 and HA-AGO2 plants 14 d after infection with Fny CMV-Δ2b for extracting total loaded small RNAs for the construction and sequencing of small RNA libraries.
