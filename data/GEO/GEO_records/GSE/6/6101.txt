TITLE
300 ppm Citrinin treatment for 2 h (GPL4399)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The availability of yeast DNA microarrays provides the possibility of monitoring gene expression levels as a function to toxin exposure, and consequently as a means of determining mechanisms of toxicity. This system possesses the benefit of the essential volume of yeast cultures, the high reproducibility of expression profiles, and the massive functional information. Because small amount of biological sample cultures are required for this analysis, toxicity test for rare chemical such as mycotoxins which is a natural compound and difficult to be artificially synthesized. Citrinin [518-75-2], 4,6-dihydro-8-hydroxy-3,4,5-trimethyl-6-oxo-3H-2-benzopyran-7-crboxylic acid, is the one of the popular mycotoxicin produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus family possibly spread all over the world. This natural chemicals is one of the well characterized mycotoxin but the information especially mechanism of toxic action is limited. We used two types of microarrays, one have ORF (Open reading Frame) fragment on the surface of the glass as probes and the other have probes as oligonucleotide probes on the microarray with 3 dimensions. We compared data properties and studied the toxicity of citrinin to yeast cells. Keywords: stress response
