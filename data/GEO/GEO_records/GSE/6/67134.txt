TITLE
Expression data from KSL and GMP cells of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 mice developed rapidly fatal myeloid leukemia compared to FLT3/ITD only mice, suggesting that overactivation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway via SmoM2 can drive myeloid disease progression We used the Affymetrix Mouse 430_2.0 microarray to detail global gene expression responsible for disease progression in sorted bone marrow cells and found that the Hedgehog signaling pathway contributes to disease progression by enhancing FLT3 signaling

DESIGN
KSL and GMP cells were FACS sorted from wild-type, FLT3/ITD and FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 bone marrow when the mice were around 3 months of age, when the FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 mice developed leukemia. RNA was extracted from the sorted cells and hybridized onto the Mouse 430_2.0 Affymetrix array.  Wild-type and FLT3/ITD mice that were used as controls were littermates of the FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 leukemic mice. Each sample consists of pooled cells from 3 mice.
