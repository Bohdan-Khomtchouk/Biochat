TITLE
Expression analysis of sk-hep-1(sk) cell and sk-hep-1-sh EZH2(sks) cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of EZH2 knocking down on whole genome gene expression level changes in  sk-hep-1 compared to sk-hep-1-sh EZH2.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in sk-hep-1 cell and sk-hep-1-shEZH2. The endogenous EZH2 was knocked down in sk-hep-1-shEZH2.
