TITLE
Kc167 Mcm2-7 Localization in HU

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Determination of the genome-wide distribution of the Mcm2-7 helicase by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the Drosophila Kc167 cell line at the beginning of S phase.  Kc167 cells were arrested at the G1/S transition with hydroxyurea (HU).  Goal was to evaluate changes in the genome-wide Mcm2-7 distribution throughout the cell cycle, and how this relates to the excess Mcm2-7 loaded onto chromatin in G1.

DESIGN
ChIP-Chip of Mcm2-7 in HU compared to input genomic DNA.  Biological Replicates: 2
