TITLE
Whole Blood Transcriptional Profiling Differentiates Between Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Human Rhinovirus Detection in Children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are among the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans but can be frequently detected also in asymptomatic subjects. We evaluated the value of gene expression profiles to differentiate asymptomatic detection from symptomatic HRV infection in children.

DESIGN
Previously healthy children < 2 years old (n=151) were enrolled at four study sites (Columbus, OH; Dallas, TX; Turku, Finland; and Malaga, Spain). Children were classified into: HRV- healthy controls (HC; n=37); HRV+ asymptomatic (n=14); HRV+ outpatients (n=30); and HRV+ inpatients (n=70). Whole blood RNA samples were hybridized into Illumina arrays.
