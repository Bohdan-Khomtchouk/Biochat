TITLE
Impact of food-deprivation on mammary transcriptome of lactating goats

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Animal nutrition considerably affects milk composition that influences its nutritional quality. Milk component synthesis and secretion by the mammary gland involve expression of a large number of genes whose nutritional regulation remains poorly defined. In this study, we examined the effect of food deprivation (FD) on the expression of 8379 genes in caprine mammary gland using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray. Twelve lactating goats were assigned to 2 groups based on their feeding level (control diet ad libitum vs. 48-h FD). We identified 161 genes whose expression was altered by FD. Most of these genes (88%) were downregulated, suggesting a stress response by the mammary gland. In particular, the decrease in expression of genes involved in milk protein, lactose, and lipid metabolism could contribute together with the shortage of nutrients to the drop in milk protein, lactose, and fat secretion. In addition, this study highlights modification of the expression of at least 14 genes that could be responsible for a slowdown in mammary cell proliferation and differentiation and/or an increase in programmed cell death in response to 48-h FD in goats.
