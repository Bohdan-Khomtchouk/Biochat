TITLE
TET-catalyzed 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regulates gene expression in differentiating colonocytes and colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-mC) and gene expression profiling of T84 cell differentiation; 5-hmC profiling of colon cancer colonocyte fractions

DESIGN
T84 cell differentiation was monitored as cells formed confluent monolayers in tissue culture
