TITLE
Gene expression changes during serum starvation-induced quiescence in human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a comparison of gene expression profiling microarray datasets generated from proliferating and serum-starved quiescent human normal diploid fibroblasts. 4 biological replicates of proliferative and quiescent fibroblasts were subjected to 4 individual dye-swap experiments. Data from these arrays were used in a publication to compare reproducibility between microarrays and RNA-seq; RNA-seq (2 replicates of each proliferative and quiescent fibroblasts) are available through the GEO (accession #: GSE65145). Correlations between both the microarrays and the RNA-seq dataset showed only moderate concordance (r =0.42) in genes exhibiting a â‰¥5-fold change. Examination of gene expression profiles from prolfierating and quiescent normal human fibroblasts using microarray technology

DESIGN
Analysis used proliferative expression as a baseline and quiescent samples were compared against this. Four independent arrays were used with dye swaps to make direct comparisions between quiescent and prolfierative gene expression levels.
