TITLE
Defining the microglia transcriptome in multifunctional protein-2 deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We purified whole brain microglia of MFP2 knockout mice and control mice utilizing percoll gradient and FACS sorting, followed by microarray analysis to define the molecular changes in MFP2 knockout mice at the endstage of the disease. We compared the microglia transcriptome of Mfp2-/- microglia to that of SOD1-G93A microglia isolated from spinal cord to define the microglia signature associated with a non-neurodegenerative environment. Results and conclusions: Mfp2-/- microglia acquire an activation state characterized by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).  In addition, activated microglia display reduced expression of genes that are normally highly expressed by surveillant microglia in steady-state conditions. The immunological profile of is heterogeneous and encompasses upregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. In contrast to the neurodegeneration-specific microglia profile in SOD1-G93A mice, Mfp2-/- microglia do not induce genes associated with phagocytosis, lysosomal activation and neurotoxicity.

DESIGN
4 MFP2 knockout and 4 control samples were subjected to microarray analysis.
