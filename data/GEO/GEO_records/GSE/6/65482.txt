TITLE
Ectopic CENP-A nucleosomes localize to transcription factor hotspots and subtelomeric sites in human cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of histone variant CENP-A in different cell lines vs. DHS profiles from same cell lines. Mock IPs included.

DESIGN
Profiles of ectopic CENP-A IP after pre-clearing with CENP-B IPs, or profiles of DHS regions from mid-log culture SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines, HeLa cervical cancer cell lines, and EpiCo normal colon cell line were generated using deep sequencing after Mnase-based ChIP, in replicates, on the Illumina platform.
