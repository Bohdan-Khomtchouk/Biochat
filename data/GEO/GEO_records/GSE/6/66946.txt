TITLE
Characterization of differential gene expression profiles between wild-type Ler and proatcape1 mutant seedlings upon salt stress.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To gain insight into how AtCAPE1 regulates salt response, we investigated the gene expression profiles of wild-type (Ler) and proatcape1 mutant seedlings in the presence and absence of 125 mM NaCl by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Ten seedlings were grown vertically on the mesh attached on 1/2 MS medium for 10 days. Seedlings with the mesh were transferred to a new petri dish and then covered by buffer-saturated filter papers with 1/2 MS liquid medium (Control) or with 125 mM NaCl (Salt). Salt-treated seedlings (n=10 for each treatment) were sampled after 12 h.  Three independent experiments were performed for the microarray analysis.
