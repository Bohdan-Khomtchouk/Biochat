TITLE
Transcript Profiling of the Aerobic and Anoxic Rice Coleoptile

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds can germinate in complete absence of oxygen. Under anoxia, the rice coleoptile elongates, reaching a length greater than that of the aerobic one. In this series, we compare the transcriptome of rice coleoptiles grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Lasanthi-Kudahettige, R, et. al. Plant Physiology (2007).
