TITLE
Invasion and metastasis related long non-coding RNA expression profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant expression of LncRNAs might be responsible for the HCC invasion and metastasis. we employed the LncRNAs microarray technology to study the LncRNAs expression profiles at genome-wide in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)tissue samples with early recurrence (less than 1 year, with invasion and metastasis out of liver) and late recurrence (longer than 2 years, without invasion and metastasis out of liver), which had different recurrent/metastatic potentials, by using normal liver tissue as control to screen the dysregulated LncRNAs which are potentially involved in the recurrence, invasion and metastasis process of HCC

DESIGN
two condition experiment, invasion and metastasis VS. non-invasion and metastasis HCC tissues and normal control tissues.
