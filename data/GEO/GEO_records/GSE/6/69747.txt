TITLE
Microarray analysis of 20 gene knockdowns (including each three replicates and 12 controls) of EGFR mutated H1650 cell line in order to unravel AMPK signal transduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of a AMPK-relevant gene network hierarchy based on transcriptome data upon gene knockdown

DESIGN
Knockdown of 20 genes in H1650 cell line following transcriptome analyses
