SUMMARY
Technical replicates from BC3 and BCBL1 cell lines were treated with DMSO or 5 micromoles of lenalidomide for 24 hours. NOTE: Detection p-values were neither computed nor used in this experiment.  All data was processed directly from IDATs and the proportion of present probes estimated from the negative and positive controls.
