TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in the intestinal metaplasia in Cdx2/IL-1beta mice vs IL-1beta alone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cdx2/IL-1beta mice have less intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction thanIL-1beta mice alone. This study was to identify a mechanism for this effect by examining differences in gene expression patterns when Cdx2 is co-expressed.

DESIGN
We dissected out intestinal metaplasia nodules from the squamocolumnar junction in Cdx2/IL-1beta mice and Il-1beta mice and measured gene expression on a Mouse Gene 2.0ST Affymetrix array in Oct 2013.
