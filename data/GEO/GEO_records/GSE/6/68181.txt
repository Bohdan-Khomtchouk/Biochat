TITLE
Rtr1 regulates global levels of RNA Polymerase II CTD phosphorylation during transcription elongation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase Serine 5 phosphorylation (H14 antibody) is examined in wt and rtr1 deletion conditions to see if deletion of rtr1 causes a redistribution of these marks across open reading frames.

DESIGN
Two replicates of RNA Polymerase Serine 5 phosphorylation (H14 antibody) and H3K36me3 are examined in wt and rtr1 deletion conditions.
