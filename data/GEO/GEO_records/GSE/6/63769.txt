TITLE
Genomic Run On (GRO): determination of the nascent transcriptional rates and mRNA levels in several yeast mutants (SAC3, SUS1, SRC1)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analyzed the effect of SAC3, SUS1 and SRC1 on the transcription rates, mRNA stabilities and mRNA levels by doing GRO experiments in a deletion mutants and the partial C-truncated version of Sac3 comparing with a wild type. Some data for mRNA amounts (sus1 ans src1 mutants) are not included because were already in GEO database: GSE920 and GSE6370 accession numbers.

DESIGN
This study focus on the transcriptional activity of RNA pol II in yeast genes. S. cerevisiae cells grown in YPD to exponential phase were subjected to Genomic Run On.  Data were normalized by the ArrayStat software. Home-made macroarrays containing entire ORFs were used.
