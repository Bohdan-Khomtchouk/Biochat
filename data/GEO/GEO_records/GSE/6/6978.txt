TITLE
Gene expression variation in lymphocyte subpopulations in response to low dose of ionizing radiations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphocytes are the standard cell of a majority of biodosimetry approaches because of their availability and radiosensitivity. But progresses remain to be performed to bring down the minimum threshold of dose sensitivity. To find a lymphocyte subtype able to respond to low doses of ionizing radiation, we examined gene expression variations in different lymphocyte subpopulations using the microarray technology. Blood samples were independently exposed to 0, 0.05 and 0.5 Gray of ionizing radiations. Three and 24 hours after exposure, CD56+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were negatively isolated. RNA from each condition was competitively hybridized on oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: Dose response, stress response, cell type comparison
