TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed in 1 dpa and 10 dpa fiber

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
A method was developed to isolate RNA from 1 dpa fiber. ESTs derived from this and other cotton mRNAs were sequenced and assembled into contigs. Contigs composed of EST unique to libraries of interest and unique singletons were represented on a microarray. Microarrays were hybridized with labed nucleic acids derived from 10 dpa fiber and 1 dpa fiber to identify genes differentially regulated during fiber initiation and fiber elongation. Genes with known expression in fiber were included to validate the microarray. Analysis of the gene ontology (GO) of differentially expressed genes suported previously reported aspects of fiber initiation such as cell wall remodeling. Transcription factors upregulated in fiber initials and elongating fiber were identified Keywords: cell type comparison
