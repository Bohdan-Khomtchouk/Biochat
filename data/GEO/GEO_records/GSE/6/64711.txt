TITLE
Advanced Age is Associated with Worsened Outcomes and a Unique Genomic Response in Severely Injured Patients with Hemorrhagic Shock

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed epidemiological, cytokine, and transcriptomic analyses on a prospective, multi-center cohort of 1,928 severely injured patients.

DESIGN
We wished to characterize the relationship of advanced age to clinical outcomes and to transcriptomic responses after severe blunt traumatic injury with hemorrhagic shock.
