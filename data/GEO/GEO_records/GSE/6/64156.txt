TITLE
A multi-scale approach reveals that NFkB cRel enforces a B-cell decision to divide.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptomes of individual small and large B cells after 24 h of stimulation were sequenced and genes upregulated in small or large cells were found and analyzed to provide a global charactarization of transcription patterns in growing B cells.

DESIGN
We identified 5 large and 5 small viable B cells from images of the C1 IFC containing captured cells. We prepared libraries for the 10 individual cells, a positive bulk control (containing diluted bulk cDNA), a negative control containing only the ERCC spikeins, and a 0h bulk control.
