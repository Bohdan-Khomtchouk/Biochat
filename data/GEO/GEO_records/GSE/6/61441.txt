TITLE
Epigenome analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissue versus matched normal kidney tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissue versus matched normal kidney tissue. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in tumor and adjacent normal kidney tissue samples from ccRCC patients. Samples included 46 paired fresh frozen ccRCC tumor and adjacent normal kidney tissues.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 92 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450 Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
