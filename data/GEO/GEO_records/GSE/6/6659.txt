TITLE
fiber transformation with inhibition of CaMK pathway(KN93 vs KN92)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression profile of day 3 of in vitro cultured FDB fibers with or without inhibition of CaMK signaling pathways(KN93 vs KN92), with amplified RNA (cRNA probes). Two indepenedent comparisons in conditions of culturing FDB fibers with or without slow-fiber-type pattern of electrical stimulation were both conducted. ----Un-stimulated culture: GSM153971, GSM153972, GSM153975, and GSM153976. ----Electric-stimulated culture: GSM153978, GSM153980, GSM153984, GSM153985, GSM153986, and GSM153987. Keywords: cell treatment
