TITLE
Gene expression data of cultured primary microglia from neonatal control and Cstb-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cystain B (Cstb) is a ubiquitously expressed cysteine protease inhibitor and mutations of the CSTB gene lead to the neurodegenerative disease progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundorg type (EPM1). We are interested in the microglia-specific, Cstb-dependent gene-expression changes in mice and in this data set, we include gene-level expression data from cultured primary microglia of control and Cstb-/- mice extracted from neonatal mice at P5 and we identified 156 differentially-expressed genes in Cstb-/- microglia.

DESIGN
We analyzed 8 samples in total and we compared 4 control microglia samples to 4 Cstb-/- microglia samples. Genes with a fold change > 1.3 and with p < 0.05 in T-test with BH correction were considered differentially expressed.
