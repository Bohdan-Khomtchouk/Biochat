TITLE
Spatial gene expression gradients underlie prominent heterogeneity of CA1 pyramidal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue and organ function has been conventionally understood in terms of the interactions among discrete and homogeneous cell types.  This approach has proven difficult in neuroscience due to the marked diversity across different neuron classes, but may also be further hampered by prominent within-class variability.  Here, we considered a well-defined, canonical neuronal population – hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells – and systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity.  Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we identified striking variability in CA1 PCs, such that the differences along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous expression gradients, producing a profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells.  This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits.

DESIGN
Hippocampal RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500, with three biological replicates per population
