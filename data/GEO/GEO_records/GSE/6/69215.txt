TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RACB-transgenic barley plant lines in interaction with Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
To analyze RACB- and Bgh (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei)-dependently expressed genes we used wild type and transgenic barley misexpressing the susceptibility factor RACB

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed at 12 hours post infection (hpi) and 32 hpi in untreated and Bgh-treated samples in three plant lines (wild type (WT); expressing constitutively activated (CA) RACB; RNAi RACB). In total 4 biological replicats were performed.
