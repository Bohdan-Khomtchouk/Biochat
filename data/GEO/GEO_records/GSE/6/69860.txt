TITLE
Genomic Analysis Reveals Distinct Mechanisms and Functional Classes of SOX10-Regulated Genes in Melanocytes [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-Seq analysis of SOX10, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in melanocytes to profile the genomic binding sites of SOX10 and the chromatin landscape. In parallel, we generated Sox10 haploinsufficient cell lines using gene knockout approaches and conducted microarray gene expression analysis to identify functional gene targets of SOX10 transcriptional regulation in melanocytes. We demonstrate that SOX10 predominantly engages “open” chromatin, binds to melanocyte enhancer elements and plays a central role in transcriptional activation and repression of functionally distinct classes of genes. Furthermore, we identified cis-regulatory sequence motifs of putative co-regulatory transcription factors that define SOX10-activated and SOX10-repressed target genes. Our results uncover novel mechanisms and roles of SOX10 in global transcriptional regulation of diverse regulatory pathways in the melanocyte lineage. These results indicated that SOX10 plays a role in activation and repression of distinct classes of genes.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression analysis in Sox10 haploinsufficient immortal melanocyte cell lines derived from 3-day-old Sox10LacZ/+; Ink4a-Arf null mice. Syngeneic control cells were melan-Ink4a-Arf-1.
