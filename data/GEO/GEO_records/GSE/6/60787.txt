TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of seminoma-like TCam-2 cells during transition into an embryonal carcinoma-like state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina 450k DNA methylation microarray analysis of seminoma-like TCam-2 cells xenografted in nude mice. 2120EP embryonal carcinoma cells served as control. TCam-2 cells acquire pluripotency and become epigenetically reprogrammed to an embryonal carcinoma-like state during in vivo growth. This analysis is part of the article 'BMP inhibition in seminomas initiates acquisition of pluripotency via NODAL signaling resulting in reprogramming to an embryonal carcinoma' by Nettersheim et al., 2015. PLoS Genetics

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from tumors of TCam-2 and 2102EP cells xenografted for 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks as well as 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. In vivo samples of TCam-2 cells were analyzed in biological duplicates. In vitro cultivated TCam-2 / 2102EP cells as well as 2102EP xenografted for 4 and 8 weeks were analyzed once.
