TITLE
Transcriptional response to UV treatment in several Arabidopsis thaliana accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
UV radiation is a ubiquitous component of solar radiation that affects plant growth and development. Analysis of natural variation in response to UV radiation revealed significant differences among natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the genetic basis of this is to a large extent unknown. Here, we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis accessions to UV radiation stress by performing RNA-sequencing of three UV sensitive and three UV resistant accessions. The genome-wide transcriptional analysis revealed a large number of genes significantly up- or down-regulated only in sensitive or only in resistant accessions, respectively. Mutant analysis of few selected candidate genes suggested by the RNA-sequencing results indicate a connection between UV radiation stress and plant-pathogen-like defense responses.
