TITLE
Impact of flanking chromosomal sequences on localization and silencing by the ncRNA XIST

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on clones of human cell lines carrying an inducible XIST transgene on 1p, 8p, or 12q to study the effects of allelic silencing in cis

DESIGN
Total gene expression and allelic changes were examined in HT1080 clones carrying an inducible XIST transgene on 1p, 8p, or 12q after induction by doxycycline. A replicate was done for the 8p clone treated with DOX. An additional 1p clone integrated with an empty vector, and an 1p, 8p, and 12q clone without induction were included as controls. ChIP was performed on the 8p clone to investigate the changes in H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation.
