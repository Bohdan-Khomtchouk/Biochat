TITLE
Early gene expression of regenerating zebrafish hearts following water or atropine treatment

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report global RNA expression profiles from whole zebrafish hearts 24 hours after ventricle amputation.  Zebrafish were exposed to atropine or water following surgery.

DESIGN
15 zebrafish hearts were pooled per microarray chip.  Amputated hearts of zebrafish exposed to atropine was compared to hearts of zebrafish exposed to water.
