TITLE
Expression data from NRK-52E cells treated with aristolochic acids for 6h, 24h and 72h

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we have examined the effect of sub-cytotoxic exposure to aristolochic acids (1.65µM) at 6h, 24h and 72h on the whole-genome expression profile in a rat proximal renal tubule cell line (NRK-52E). We used microarrays to detail the mechanism of toxicity and possibly carcinogenicity of aristolochic acids in rat renal proximal cells.

DESIGN
NRK-52E cells were cultured to confluence on 6-well plates. Cells were then exposed to aristolochic acid dissolved in DMSO (0.1%) at the IC10 concentration at 72h (1.65 μM) or DMSO only as control. After 6h, 24h and 72h the medium was removed and RNA was extracted from the cells. Three studies were conducted at each time point.
