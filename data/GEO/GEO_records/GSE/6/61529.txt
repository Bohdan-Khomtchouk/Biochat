TITLE
Encoding of Contextual Fear Memory Requires De Novo Proteins in the Prelimbic Cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Time dependent coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal cortical interactions are required for the long-term storage of memories. However, the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in encoding of long-term memories remains elusive. Here, we discover a critical role of PFC in the encoding of contextual memories in mice. We demonstrate that specific pools of mRNAs are translated in the PFC following one and six hours of behavioral training. Moreover, disruption of protein synthesis in the prelimbic region of PFC immediately after training inhibits encoding contextual fear memories, whereas disruption at six hours after training is ineffective. Thus, early protein synthesis in the PFC is necessary and critical for the encoding of contextual fear memories. These findings establish key role for the prelimbic cortex in encoding of contextual memories.

DESIGN
Examination of polyribosome associated mRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of 8 adult mice following one hour and six hour after contextual fear conditioning.
