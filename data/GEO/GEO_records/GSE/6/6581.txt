TITLE
Expression data from mammary glands of transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of our work was the comparison of human and mouse gene expression data and to identify a conserved breast tumor gene set. The results encourage the usefulness of transgenic mice as a model for human breast cancer formation and therapy. Keywords: Comparison
