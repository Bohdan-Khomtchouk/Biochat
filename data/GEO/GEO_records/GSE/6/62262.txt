TITLE
Differential expression of mRNAs in naïve, effector, and memory CD8 T cells of mir-150 KO and wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA-150 (miR-150) is mainly expressed in the lymph nodes and spleen and is highly up-regulated during the development of mature T and B cells. To understand the signal-transduction network for 'effector or memory T cells' and 'mir-150' in naïve, effector, or memory CD8 T cells of mir-150 knockout and wild-type mice, we analyzed gene expression profiles by microarray. The genetic background of the cells used in this study is CD8 T cells from spleen of the 8 week-old male C57BL/6J mice (for female: WT-memory_2 & KO-memory_2).
