TITLE
Mutant p53R273H regulated microRNA profiling in presence and absence of DNA damage in H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used a high-throughput small RNA deep sequencing followed by a systematic computational analysis to identify genome wide mutant p53R273H regulated miRNAs in both DNA damage dependent and independent context. Several miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks have been predicted that might contribute to mutant p53 GOF properties. Differentially regulated miRNA signature profile has been validated in the lung cancer patients harboring wildtype and mutant p53. We identified specific miRNA signatures for lymph node metastasis associated with p53 mutation in lung adenocarcinoma and also predicted the possible contribution of two mutant p53 regulated miRNAs in EMT process. Furthermore, this study identified a hitherto unknown miRNA in human which might act as one of the crucial downstream targets of GOF mutant p53 to confer oncogenic properties.

DESIGN
