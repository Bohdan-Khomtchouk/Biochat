TITLE
Hepatic gene expression in C56BL/6J mice fed a quercetin diet for 20 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Both the 0.05% and 1% querceitn diets did not significantly affect the body weight, fat accumulation, and blood components. However, 0.05% quercetin significantly increased the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio in the liver. Moreover, the 1% quercetin diet reduced the lipid peroxidation markers 8-isoprostane in plasma and malondialdehyde in the liver, epididymal adipose tissues, and small intestine. Although comprehensive gene expression analysis dot not detect the genes with significantly different expression levels among the groups of mice, RT-PCR analysis showed that the 1% quercetin diet significantly induced the expression of the antioxidant enzymes Gpx1, Cat, and Sod1 in the liver and Gpx1 and Cat in the epididymal adipose tissues. The transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was slightly induced in the nuclear fraction of the livers of mice fed the 1% quercetin diet. Quercetin may induce antioxidant enzymes by directly or indirectly activating the Nrf2 pathway in the liver.

DESIGN
Five-week-old male mice were fed a AIN-93G diet containing 0% (Control), 0.05% (0.05% quercetin diet), or 1% quercertin  (1% quercetin diet) for 20 weeks.
