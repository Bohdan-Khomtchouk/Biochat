TITLE
Gene expression profiles of starved mice and mice treat with TNF alpha

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis results from the interactions between disrupted lipid homeostasis and immune response but the molecular bridges between the major players are still a matter of controversy. We investigated the systemic effect of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a well established anorexia agent, in livers of mice exposed to 24h-cytokine/starvation. 10% of genes of the Agilent 10kb cDNA array is detected above level of detection in the mouse liver. 12% of these is modulated upon starvation while 22% is altered by TNF-α. Keywords: Disease state analysis
