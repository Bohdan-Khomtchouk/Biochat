TITLE
Target genes associated to siRNA mediated repression of Pea3 and Erm transcription factors in mammary cancerous cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pea3 and Erm are transcription factors belonging to the ETS family which are involved in tumorigenesis, particularly mammary oncogenesis. To elucidate the mechanism of Pea3/Erm induced tumorigenesis in mouse mammary cancerous MMT cells (ATCC CCL-51), we have down-regulated Pea3 or Erm expression in this cell line by using small interfering RNA and performed a microarray analysis using Applied Biosystems AB1700 technology to define target associated genes. Keywords: Comparative transcriptome hybridization, small interfering RNA, mouse mammary cancerous cells
