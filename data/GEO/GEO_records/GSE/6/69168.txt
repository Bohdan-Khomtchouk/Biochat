TITLE
Allelome.PRO A pipeline to define allele-specific genome features

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts from F1 reciprocal crosses to determine a biologically relevant allelic ratio cutoff, and define for the first time an entire allelome. Furthermore, we show that Allelome.PRO detects differential enrichment of H3K4me3 over promoters from ChIP-seq data validating the RNA-seq results.

DESIGN
Defining allele-specific genome features from F1 E12.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts
