TITLE
microRNA Expression Profiling of MIF-high and MIF-low Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma using Nanostring nCounter Platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified differentially expressed microRNAs between MIF-high and MIF-low tumor groups. These microRNAs were then investigated for their potential downstream targets using an integrative strategy, which combines miR-Walk target prediction module and mRNA expression array data to identify key MIF-induced signalling pathways driving tumor progresion and disease aggressiveness. Genes that associated with prognostic significance was then subjected to mechanistic study.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling of 69 pancreatic ductual adenocarcinoma was performed in two sets. The batch effect between the two sets of data was removed using Partek Genomic Suite
