TITLE
mRNA- and RISC-sequencing of mouse hearts overexpressing miR-133a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-133a-3p is a highly abundant cardiomyocyte-enriched microRNA whose expression is persistently decreased in response to pressure overload (or transverse aortic constriction, TAC) in mice. Overexpression of miR-133a in cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in vivo (under the control of the Myh6 promoter) decreases pressure overload-induced apoptosis and fibrosis. In previous studies using microarray platforms, we detected numerous mRNAs whose transcript levels were altered by either or both of miR-133a overexpression and pressure overload.  The data set presented here builds upon our previous study in these mice by examining mRNA-RISC associations (using Ago2-immunoprecipitated RNA) and global mRNA abundances via RNA-sequencing procedures, and tests the hypothesis that mRNAs targeted by overexpressed miR-133a are dissimilar between sham and TAC contexts.

DESIGN
Cardiac polyadenylated RNA (mRNA) profiles were generated from nontransgenic and transgenic mouse hearts of FVB/N background, on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.  Male mice 8-12 weeks of age were used in these studies, and subjected to sham surgery or 1 week of pressure-overload via transverse aortic constriction (TAC). 3 nontransgenic sham, 7 transgenic sham, 5 nontransgenic TAC, 4 transgenic TAC, each with mRNA-seq and RISC-seq (mRNA-seq of Ago2 immunoprecipitate) data.
