TITLE
Whole genome microarray analysis in myxoid liposarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify new key molecules in the pathogenesis of myxoid liposarcoma, we performed comparative gene expression profiling in myxoid liposarcoma and fat tissue samples.

DESIGN
Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on eight primary myxoid liposarcoma samples and an RNA pool of eight healthy fat tissue samples.
