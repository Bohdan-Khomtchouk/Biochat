TITLE
Robust Molecular Classification of Ependymal Tumors Across All Anatomic Compartments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ependymal tumors across age groups have been classified solely by histopathology. It is, however, commonly accepted that this classification has limited clinical utility based on its poor reliability. We aimed at establishing a reliable and reproducible molecular classification using DNA methylation fingerprints of the tumors. Studying a cohort of 500 tumors allowed for the delineation of nine robust molecular subgroups, three in each anatomic compartment of the central nervous system (CNS). Two of the supratentorial subgroups are characterized by prototypic fusion genes involving RELA and YAP1, respectively. Regarding clinical associations, the molecular classification proposed herein outperforms the current histopathological classification by far and thus might serve as a basis for the upcoming update of the WHO classification of CNS tumors. DNA methylation patterns in tumors have been shown to represent a very stable molecular memory of the respective cell of origin throughout the disease course, thus making them particularly suitable for tumor classification purposes. Methylation fingerprinting of a large series of ependymal tumors of all grades revealed a highly reliable way of classifying this clinically extremely heterogeneous group of malignancies. In fact, out of nine highly reproducible molecular subgroups identified in the supratentorial, infratentorial and spinal regions, only two harbor the vast majority of clinical high-risk patients (mostly children) for whom novel therapeutic concepts are desperately needed. Since this analysis can be performed from minute amounts of DNA extracted from archived material, it is ideally suited for routine clinical application.

DESIGN
We investigated a set of 562 ependymal tumors using the Illumina 450k methylation array.
