TITLE
Investigation about fibroblasts of different origins in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine if fibroblasts from different origin (skin, colon, tumors) were keeping their characteristic while extracted and cultured ex vivo for several passages. HUVEC was used as a control, being cells from a different background. Surprisingly, fibroblasts from different origins are losing their independant characteristic to cluster in a similar way after 5-6 passages in culture in vitro, showing an activated status.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts were extracted from human skin, colon normal stroma and colon tumor stroma. HUVECs were extracted from human samples at the same time. All cells, each group from 3 different patients, were grown on plastic for 5 passages and mRNA was extracted to perform RNASeq analysis.
