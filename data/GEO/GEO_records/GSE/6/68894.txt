TITLE
The effect of n-3 PUFA therapy on skeletal muscle gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of fish oil-derived n-3 PUFA therapy, which had statistically and clinically significant beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength, on skeletal muscle gene expression profile.

DESIGN
We selected 10 subjects with the largest hypertrophy response (change in thigh muscle volume) from the treatment group.
