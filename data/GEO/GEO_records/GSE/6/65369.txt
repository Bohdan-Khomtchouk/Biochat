TITLE
Analyzing human neural stem cell ontogeny by consecutive isolation of Notch active neural progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Decoding heterogeneity of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neural progeny is fundamental for revealing the origin of diverse progenitors, for defining their lineages, and for identifying fate determinants driving transition through distinct potencies. Here we prospectively isolated consecutively appearing PSC-derived primary progenitors based on their Notch activation state. We first isolate early neuroepithelial cells and show their broad Notch-dependent developmental and proliferative potential. Neuroepithelial cells further yield successive Notch-dependent functional primary progenitors, from early and mid neurogenic radial glia and their derived basal progenitors, to gliogenic radial glia and adult-like neural progenitors, together recapitulating hallmarks of neural stem cell (NSC) ontogeny. Gene expression profiling reveals dynamic stage specific transcriptional patterns that may link development of distinct progenitor identities through Notch activation. Our observations provide a platform for characterization and manipulation of distinct progenitor cell types amenable for developing streamlined neural lineage specification paradigms for modeling development in health and disease.

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) H9 were differentiated into 5 distinct populations of neural precursor cells (NPCs) over a time course of 200 days. Each neural precursor populations was then sorted for HES5 expression based on a GFP-HES5 reporter. Both the HES5 positive and HES5 negative populations were then subjected to microarray profiling in singlicate, as well as the hESCs using GeneChipPrimeView Human Gene Expression Array
