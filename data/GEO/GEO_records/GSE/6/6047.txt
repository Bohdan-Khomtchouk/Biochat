TITLE
Gene expression profiling suggests PCNSL to be derived from a late germinal center B cell.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular origin of primary lymphomas of the central nervous system (PCNSL), 21 PCNSL of immunocompetent patients were investigated by microarray-based gene expression profiling. Comparison of the transcriptional profile of PCNSL with various normal and neoplastic B cell subsets demonstrated PCNSL (i) to display gene expression patterns most closely related to late germinal center B cells, (ii) to display a gene expression profile similar to systemic diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL), and (iii) to be in part assigned to the activated B cell-like (ABC) or the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype of DLBCL. Keywords: PCNSL – DLBCL – gene expression profiling
