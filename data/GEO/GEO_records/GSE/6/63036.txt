TITLE
RBBP6 isoforms regulate the human polyadenylation machinery and modulate expression of mRNAs with AU-rich 3' UTRs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is mediated by a large multisubunit protein complex. Here we show that RBBP6 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 6), identified initially as an Rb- and p53-binding protein, is a component of this complex and functions in 3' processing in vitro and in vivo. RBBP6 associates with other core factors, and this interaction is mediated by an unusual ubiquitin-like domain, DWNN (domain with no name), that is required for 3' processing activity. The DWNN is also expressed, via alternative RNA processing, as a small single-domain protein (isoform 3 [iso3]). Importantly, we show that iso3, known to be down-regulated in several cancers, competes with RBBP6 for binding to the core machinery, thereby inhibiting 3' processing. Genome-wide analyses following RBBP6 knockdown revealed decreased transcript levels, especially of mRNAs with AU-rich 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) such as c-Fos and c-Jun, and increased usage of distal poly(A) sites. Our results implicate RBBP6 and iso3 as novel regulators of 3' processing, especially of RNAs with AU-rich 3' UTRs.

DESIGN
RBBP6 siRNA or control siRNA was transfected in MCF7 cells in duplicates and RNA was hybridized to GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix)
