TITLE
Expression data from intermediate monocytes from healthy donors and autoimmune uveitis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human peripheral monocytes have been categorized into three subsets based on differential expression levels of CD14 and CD16. However, the factors that influence the distribution of monocyte subsets and the roles which each subset plays in autoimmunity are not well studied. To compare the gene expression profiling 1) on intermediate monocytes CD14++CD16+ monocytes between healthy donors and autoimmune uveitis patients and 2) among 3 monocyte subsets in health donors, here we purified circulating intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes from 5 patients with autoimmune uveitis (labeled as P1-5) and 4 healthy donors (labeled as HD1-4) by flow cytometry and isolated total RNA to proceed microarray assay. In addition, we also purified CD14+CD16++ (non-classical monocytes) and CD14++CD16- (classical monocytes) from 4 healthy donors to do microarray. We demonstrate that CD14++CD16+ monocytes from patients and healthy control donors share a similar gene expression profile. The CD14+CD16++ cells (non-classical monocytes) display the most distinctive gene expression profiling when compared to intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes and classical CD14++CD16- monocytes.

DESIGN
Pheripharal blood from 5 autoimmune uveitis patients and 4 healthy donors were collected. Immediately after collection, we purified circulating intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes from 5 patients with autoimmune uveitis ( Sample 13-17; titled as P intermediate 1-5) and 4 healthy donors (Sample 1, 4, 7, 10; titled as HD intermediate 1-4) by flow cytometry and isolated total RNA to proceed microarray assay. In addition, we also purified CD14+CD16++ (Sample 3, 6, 9, 12; titled HD non-classical 1-4) and CD14++CD16- (Sample 2, 5, 8, 11; titled HD classical 1-4) from 4 healthy donors to do microarray. Please note that data processing was performed in two groups; [1] HD intermediate, classical and non-classical samples (total 12 samples) [2] HD intermediate samples reanalyzed with P intermediate samples (total 9 samples).
