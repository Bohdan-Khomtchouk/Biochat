TITLE
mTORC inhibition of neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)c cells cultured under hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression of the oxygen sensitive hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) subunits HIF-1a and HIF-2a occurs in many tumor types, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of mTOR complex in the regulation of HIF expression in cells cultured under hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)c cells were treated with DMSO or the mTORC complex inhibitor PP242 and cultured at hypoxia for 24, 48 or 72 hours.
