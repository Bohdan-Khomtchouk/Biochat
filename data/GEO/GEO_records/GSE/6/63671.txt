TITLE
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052 wild-type cells vs.Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052 degenerated strain cells

ORGANISM
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052

SUMMARY
The transcriptome analysis by microarray was applied on wild-type and degenerated strains of C. beijerinckii NCIMB8052 (WT-8052 and DG-8052, respectively) to elucidate its mechanism of degeneration during solvent fermentation. The comparison of gene expression pattern in relation to ABE production is expected to provide insights toward metabolically engineering of C. beijerinckii NCIMB8052 with prevention of degeneration and eventually enhancement of ABE production.

DESIGN
Two-fermentation time points (12h and 24h) experiments (wild-type cells vs.degenerated strain cells);Biological replicates: 3 replicates of wild-type cells at 12h;3 replicates of wild-type cells at 24h;3 replicates of degenerated cells at 12h;3 replicates of degenerated cells at 24h  .
