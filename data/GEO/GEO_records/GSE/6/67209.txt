TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in xenografts and organoids derived from human cholangiocarcinoma [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established xenografts and organoids derived from human cholangiocarcinoma. To investigate the signature of cancer stem cells, miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in cholangiocarcinoma xenografts and organoids (passage 7).

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were conducted in cholangiocarcioma xenografts and organoids (passage 7).
