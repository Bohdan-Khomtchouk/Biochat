TITLE
Optimized siRNAs with a minimal off-target effect facilitate the screening of essential genes in cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
siRNAs with dN are a promising and easy approach to characterize essential genes by minimizing the off-target effect in cancer cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HCT 116 cells after the transfection of siRNAs or blank control by deep sequencing, using HiSeq 2000
