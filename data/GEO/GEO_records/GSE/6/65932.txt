TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and snf[148] ovary Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparison of wild type and tumorous ovaries reveals that tumors inappropriately express a large number of testis genes

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of ovaries from 0-24 hour virgin wild type (WT) and 3 day old snf[148] females were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
