TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of FOXF1 expressing cells at E7.5 of embryonic development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the transcriptional profile of cells expressing FOXF1::VENUS and/or FLK1 in E7.5  mouse embryos carrying a foxf1::venus knock-in allele

DESIGN
Foxf1::venus E7.5 embryos were sorted based on FLK1 and FOXF1::VENUS expression (3 sorted populations, 2 biological replicates)
