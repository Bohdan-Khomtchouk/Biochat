TITLE
Gene expression profile of microglial cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Migroglia cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 3 h. The mRNA was isolated and the expression profiles of OGD-activated cells were compared with the profiles of resting cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analysed. mRNAs that were differentially expressed (increased or decreased in expression by â‰¥1.5-fold) between the OGD-activated and resting  cells were identified.
