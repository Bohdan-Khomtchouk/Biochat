TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of rhabdomyosarcoma tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the specific DNA methylation pattern of different rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) samples we performed a genome-wide study using Human DNA methylation platform (Agilent).

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiling was carried out in 15 RMS tumor samples using the Human DNA methylation microarray (Agilent) consisting of about 244,000 (60-mer) probes design to interrogate about 27,000 known CpG islands. Enriched-methylated dsDNA for each sample was labeled with Cy5 dye and the control genomic DNA for each sample was labeled with Cy3 dye using Agilent Genomic DNA labeling kit PLUS (Agilent).
