TITLE
SRp20 regulates Genome-wide Alternative RNA splicing events in MEF3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the effects of SRp20 on genome-wide RNA splicing in mouse cells, we utilized Exonhit SpliceArrayTM to compare genome-wide changes of RNA splicing and transcription in MEF3T3 mouse fibroblasts with or without ectopic expression of SRp20.

DESIGN
MEF3T3 tet-off cells were transfected with pRevTRE/T7-SRSF3 expression vector (pJR17) or pFLAG-CMV5.1 empty vector, each performed in triplicate. A mouse genome-wide splice-array assay was performed by using a service provider ExonHit Therapeutics, Inc (Gaithersburg, MD). Fifty ng of total RNA isolated from MEF3T3 cells with or without SRp20 overexpression was quality controlled and analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip platform.
