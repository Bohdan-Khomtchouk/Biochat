TITLE
Liver gene expression profiles of  interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis B Patients (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With 350 million carriers worldwide who may suffer from serious sequelae, including hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection remains an important health issue. Current antiviral therapies hardly eradicate the virus. Therefore, there are still imperative need to develop new therapeutic strategies and predictors for treatment response to cure the disease and avoid futile treatment. By taking the advantage of having the paired liver biopsy samples of IFNalpha responders before/after treatment and pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, we could characterize the intrahepatic expression profiles associated with necroinflammatory activity and the profiles/signature potentially predictive of response to IFNalpha therapy for CHB in this study.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from pairedliver tissues for gene expression analysis.  The gene expression profiles of seven paired liver biopsy samples of IFNalpha responders before/after treatment and other 3 pre- treatment samples were obtained by Affymatrix U133plus2 microarray. We also pooled samples of 11 responders  and 11 non-responders to perform affymatrix EXON ST 1.0 array.
