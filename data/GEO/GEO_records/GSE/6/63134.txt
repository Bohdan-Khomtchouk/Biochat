TITLE
The effects of HNF1b over-expression in PC3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and fine-mapping have identified several distinct variants within HNF1B associated with risk of prostate cancer, but its mechanism of action in this context is unknown.  To determine the effects of HNF1B in prostate cancer, we over-expressed HNF1B in PC3 cells to identify biological pathways affected by this change, and performed in vitro assays to validate our findings.

DESIGN
Technical replicates of each of PC3 cells expressing empty vector (EV) and PC3 cells over-expressing HNF1B were compared, using Illumina HT12 microarrays.
