TITLE
Expression analysis of effect of Intestine-specific knockdown of KLF5 on radiation induced intestinal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective was to determine the role of Kr√ºppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in radiation-induced intestinal injury. Mice with intestinal-specific knockdown of KLF5 (Cre+ mice) were generated and their response to radiation was compared with controls (Cre- mice). Mice were given 15 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). The mice intestines were harvested at 6h post TBI and screened for differentially expressed genes by microarray analysis. We identified 11,004 and 2,466 differentially expressed genes in non-irradiated and irradiated mice at 6h post TBI, respectively. KLF5 knockdown down-regulated genes related to DNA damage repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous end joining and the Fanconi anemia pathway, which may suggest a novel function of KLF5.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from four pooled intestine tissues of four experimental groups. The four experimental groups respectively were the 6h-cre+ group, 6h-cre- group, con-cre+ group and con-cre- group. Equal mass amounts of total RNA were pooled from each small intestine to yield a sample representing RNA from 3 separate mice in each group. One pooled sample in every group were tested with one chip. Each chip measures the expression level of 44,170 genes from C57BL/6 mouse (background) with three 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
