TITLE
Transcriptomic response of the Arabidopsis provascular tissue to Brassinosteroids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These data represents a microgenomic approach to dissect the response of the plant steroid hormone, brassinosteroid, in the provascular tissue of the arabidopsis thaliana primary roots. We used two different provascular markers, wooden leg (WOL) and corona (ATHB15) to profile the provascular response to BRs. We used a timecourse analysis with 4 different timepoint; 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hours treated with BRs in the WOL domain. Additional trasncriptomic responses of the ATHB15 domain were analyzed after 2 hours BRs treatment.

DESIGN
We perform timecourse profiling of pWOL (labeling stele cells) at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 hours after 10 nM BL treatment. Additionally we profile Athb15 (labeling provascular cells) at 2 hours after BL treatment. Note that for athb15 we did 3 replicates of the controls conditions.
