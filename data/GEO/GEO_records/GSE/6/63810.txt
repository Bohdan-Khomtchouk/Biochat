TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Comparison of C57BL/6J and BC027072 -/- Eye Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the single base pair analysis of the ocular transcriptome from wild type and BC027072 knockout animals. Comparison was analyzed to understand gene expression changes in a mouse model for early onset retinal degeneration which phenocopies a human form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa

DESIGN
Eye mRNA profiles were generated from 3 week-old C57BL/6J and BC027072 -/- in triplicate and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500
