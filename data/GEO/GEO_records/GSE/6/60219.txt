TITLE
Transcriptional landscape of different brain regions in a Rett syndrome mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We propose to investigate differential gene expression in Hippocampus and Frontal cortex of MeCP2 knock-out to gain more resolution on transcriptomic changes that occur in the Rett syndrome mouse model

DESIGN
Sequencing of RNA from Hippocampus and Frontal Cortex pool samples of MeCP2 knock-out and wild-type mice
