TITLE
RRBS assessment of global methylation alterations alterations in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RRBS we assessed global DNA methylation changes in two mouse models of oncogenic FLT3-driven leukemia in the presence and absence of Dnmt3a.

DESIGN
Mouse RRBS DNA methylation maps of Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias, Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias overexpressing Dnmt3a or GFP, FLT3-ITD leukemias, normal CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes, Dnmt3aKO thymocytes, heterozygous Dnmt3a/heterozygous Flt3-ITD knockin leukemias, and heterozygous Flt3-ITD knockin pre-leukemic bone marrow cells were obtained by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500.
