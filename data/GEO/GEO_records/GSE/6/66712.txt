TITLE
RNA-seq of the killifish N.furzeri during normal aging (cross-sectional and longitudinal study) and treatment with rotenone

ORGANISM
Nothobranchius furzeri

SUMMARY
The study consists of three parts: 1) normal aging in liver and skin (cross-sectional); 2) treatment with rotenone in brain, liver and skin; 3) longitudinal study of 45 fish with different ages at their death measured at two different time points by fin clipping

DESIGN
185 samples: 1) 50 normal aging samples: 2 tissues (liver and skin) * 5 age groups (5,12,20,27,39 weeks) * 5 replicates; 2) 45 samples: 3 tissues (brain, liver and skin) * 2 age groups (9,27 weeks) for controls and 1 age group for treatment group * 5 replicates; 3) 90 samples: 45 fish, each measured at 10 and 20 weeks (fin clipping)
