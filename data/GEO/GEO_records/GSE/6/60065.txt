TITLE
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived lin-CD34+CD45+ (iCD34) cell population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of lin-CD34+CD45+ (iCD34+) cell population from two normal bone marrow-derived (BM1K and BM9) iPSCs  and two CML (CML15 and CML17) iPSCs . CML iCD34+ cells have characteristics similar to primary CML leukemia stem cell in patients. Results provide insight into molecular profile characterized CML iCD34 and mechanism of its maintenance and drug resistance.

DESIGN
iCD34+ cell samples obtained from two control BM1K and BM9 iPSCs (both for the same normal donor) and CML15 and CML17 iPSCs (both from the same patient in chronic phase of CML). Each group was treated with DMSO (control) or 5 Î¼M imatinib. The complete phenotype for iCD34+ cells: lin-CD34+CD45+CD90+CD117+CD45RA-. This population also inclyde Rhodaminelow and ALDKhigh cells.
