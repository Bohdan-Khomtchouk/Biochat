TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of control and FOSL1 knockdown Rcho-1 trophoblast stem (TS) cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In hemochorial placentation, trophoblast stem cells differentiate into multiple lineages to aquire specific functions, such as invasive and endocrine phenotype. FOSL1 has been identified as a key regulator for trophoblast differentiation. We used microarray to detail mechanisms underlying FOSL1 signaling pathway in trophoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
3 replicates of differentiated Rcho1 TS cells expressing control shRNA; 3 replicates of differentiated Rcho1 TS cells expressing Fosl1 shRNA
