TITLE
UCP exposure of ovalbumin sensitized and challenged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the promoting effect of ultrafine particle inhalation on development and progression of allergic asthma, we selected an experimental approach involving exposure to ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) and gene expression profiling of lungs from mice with experimental, ovalbumin induced allergy. Comparative gene expression analysis was performed by hybridizing pooled cDNA samples from lavaged lungs of different groups. The results suggest that allergic sensitization may represent an susceptibility factor for effects of UCP on gene expression in the lung. In sensitized individuals UCP exposure, such as found in polluted air, thus may contribute to the development and/or aggrevation of allergic asthma.
