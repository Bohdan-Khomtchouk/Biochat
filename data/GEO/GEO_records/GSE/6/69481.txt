TITLE
Molecular expression profile reveals potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets incanine endometrial lesions

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), mucometra, and pyometra are common uterine diseases in intact dogs, with pyometra being a life threatening disease. This study aimed to determine the gene expression profile of these conditions, in addition to potential biomarkers for closed-cervix pyometra, the most severe condition

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 69 fresh endometrium samples collected from 21 healthy female dogs during diestrus, 16 CEH, 15 mucometra and 17 pyometra (eight open and nine closed-cervix). Global gene expression was detected using the Affymetrix Canine Gene 1.0 ST Array
