TITLE
Bovine granulosa cells of dominant follicles at 60 days postpartum; effect of negative energy balance on transcriptome

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Granulosa cells of dominant follicles originating from dairy cows with severe negative energy balance (BHBH) or mild negative energy balance (BHBL) were compared. Mild negative energy balance (BHBL) is the reference.

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment (BHBH and BHBL); Four pools of 3 biological replicates for each group (total = 12 cows for each group); Two technical replicates per pool (dye-swap).
