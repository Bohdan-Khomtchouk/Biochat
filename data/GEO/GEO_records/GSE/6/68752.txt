TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus gordonii strain Challis DL1 indicates a role for the biofilm-associated fruRBA operon in response to Candida albicans hyphae formation

ORGANISM
Streptococcus gordonii

SUMMARY
Multiple levels of interkingdom signaling have been implicated in maintaining the ecological balance between Candida albicans and commensal streptococci to assure a state of oral health. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial streptococcal response to the presence of C. albicans that can initiate oral surface colonization and biofilm formation, hypha-forming cells were incubated with Streptococcus gordonii cells for 30 minutes to assess the streptococcal transcriptome response. A genome wide microarray analysis and quantitative PCR validation of S. gordonii transcripts identified a number of genes, the majority of which were involved in metabolic functions, that were differentially expressed in the presence of hyphae.  The fruR, fruB and fruA genes encoding the transcriptional regulator, fructose-1-phosphate kinase, and fructose-specific permease, respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent fructose phosphotransferase system, were consistently up-regulated. An S. gordonii mutant in which these genes were deleted by allelic replacement, formed an architecturally-distinct, less robust biofilm with C. albicans than did parental strain cells. Complementing the mutant with plasmid borne fruR, fruB and fruA genes caused phenotype reversion, indicating that the genes in this operon played a role in dual species biofilm formation. This genome wide analysis of the S. gordonii transcriptional response to C. albicans has identified several genes that have potential roles in interkingdom signaling and responses.
