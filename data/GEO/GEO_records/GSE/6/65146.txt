TITLE
Expression data of caerulein-treated wild-type mice and KrasG12D-mutated mice at different stages of pancreatic regeneration after inflammatory injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Consecutive caerulein injections induce an acute pancreatitis in mice. Here, we recorded gene expression levels at different stages of  pancreatic regeneration in wild-type mice as well as KrasG12D-mutated mice. Tissue was collected from mice pancreata, cell sorting was not performed. t=0h refers to the time where caerulein was injected. control referes to NaCl-treated samples (no caerulein).

DESIGN
13 time points were used for wild-type mice, 9 time points were used for KrasG12D-mutated mice. Multiple replicates were generated for each time point. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
