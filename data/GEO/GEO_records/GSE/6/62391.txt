TITLE
A role for non-coding variation in schizophrenia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A large portion of common variant loci associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia reside within non-coding sequence of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate promoter and enhancer enrichment in schizophrenia variants associated with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). The enrichment is greater when functional annotations derived from human brain are used relative to peripheral tissues. Regulatory trait concordance analysis ranked genes within schizophrenia genome-wide significant loci, based on co-localization of a risk SNP, eQTL and regulatory element sequence. These include physical interactions of non-contiguous gene-proximal and distal elements bypassing the linear genome, which was verified in prefrontal cortex and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons for the L-type calcium channel (CACNA1C) risk locus. Our findings point to a functional link between schizophrenia-associated non-coding SNPs and 3-dimensional genome architecture associated with chromosomal loopings and transcriptional regulation in the brain.
