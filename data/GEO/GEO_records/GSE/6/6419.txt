TITLE
Expression data from mouse bladder urothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Host responses to intracellular UPEC communities We used laser capture microdissection and microarrays to identify urothelial transcripts differentially expressed in response to proximity to intracellular UPEC. Keywords: spatial/cell type analysis
