TITLE
Expression data from Dicer and Ago2-knockdown HeLa cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Dicer and Argonaute2 (Ago2) gene is involving in microRNA (miRNA) maturation. Knockdown of these genes has great impact on miRNA expression profiles. We used microarrays to detail the miRNA expression profiles in Dicer- and Ago2-knockdown HeLa cells and demonstarted that the significant difference between Ago2-knockdown and Dicer- and Ago2-co-knockdown HeLa cells were not found.
