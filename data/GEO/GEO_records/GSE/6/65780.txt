TITLE
Extensive translational regulation during seed germination revealed by translational profiling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analysed the translatome and transcriptome of  Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 WT  at five distinct physiological states during seed germination. The aim was to obtain a global overview of genes under translational control during seed-seedling transition.

DESIGN
Gene expression in dry seeds, 6, 26, 48 and 72 hours after imbibition were performed on both translatome and transcriptome level. The data was used to generate a dynamic map of genes translational relgulated during the transition from seed to seedling with 3 biological replicates for each stage.
