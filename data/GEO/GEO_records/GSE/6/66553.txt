TITLE
Identification of differentially spliced genes by wild type or S34F mutation of U2AF1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of differentially spliced genes by wild type or S34F mutation of U2AF1

DESIGN
Examination of effects on splicing events by overexpressing wipdtype or S34F mutation of two U2AF1 isoforms in A549 cells. All experimental conditions are performed in duplicate.
