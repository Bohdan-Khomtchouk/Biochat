TITLE
Differential gene expression in human THP-1 cell line undifferentiated, 3 days or 8 days differentiated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the capacity of THP-1 cells (differentiated to macrophagoid cells) to recognize  RNA sequences via pattern recognition receptors in vitro. Gene expression was analysed by RNA-Microarray. Cytokine production was analysed by ELISA assays. We used microarrays to investigate differential gene expression in THP-1 cell line undifferentiated in comparison with 3 days or 8 days differentiated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression patterns of THP-1 when differentiated.

DESIGN
THP-1 cells, undifferentiated, 3 days PMA-differentiated and 8 days PMA-differentiated
