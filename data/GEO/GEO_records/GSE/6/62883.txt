TITLE
Expression profiling of small, noncoding RNAs in physiologically hypertrophied rat hearts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Different studies revealed the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathological hypertrophy but their role during physiological hypertrophy is largely unexplored. Hence, this study is aimed at revealing the global expression profile of miRNAs during physiological cardiac hypertrophy. Methods: Chronic swimming protocol continuously for eight weeks resulted in induction of physiological hypertrophy in rats and histopathology revealed the absence of tissue damage, apoptosis or fibrosis. Subsequently, the total RNA was isolated and small RNA sequencing was executed in Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: Analysis of small RNA reads revealed the differential expression of a large set of miRNAs during physiological hypertrophy. The expression profile of the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qPCR. Conclusions: This is the first report to reveal the involvement of a large number of apoptotic miRNAs during physiological cardiac hypertrophy including the previously unknown cardiac players like miR-99, miR-100, miR-191, miR-181 and miR-19. Our data indicates that regulation of these apoptotic miRNAs can be one of the major key factor in determining pathological or physiological hypertrophy by controlling apoptosis, fibrosis and cell death mechanisms.

DESIGN
Heart small RNA profiles of 16-week old control and physiologically hypertrophied wistar rat were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000
