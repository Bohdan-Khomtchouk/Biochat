TITLE
Retinoic acid signaling targets within the embryonic zebrafish eye during photoreceptor differentiation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The signaling molecule retinoic acid (RA) regulates rod and cone photoreceptor fate, differentiation, and survival. The purpose of this study was to identify eye-specific genes controlled by RA during photoreceptor differentiation in the zebrafish.

DESIGN
6 samples; 3 replicates of 2 conditions
