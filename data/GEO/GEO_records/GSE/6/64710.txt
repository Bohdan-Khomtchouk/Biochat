TITLE
The identification of differentially downregulated genes in hypoxia or G9a overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially downregulated genes in hypoxia or G9a overexpression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling.

DESIGN
SNU484 cells expressing GFP, GFP-G9a or G9a-âˆ†SET vector under normoxic or hypoxic conditions were used to identify differentially downregulated genes.
