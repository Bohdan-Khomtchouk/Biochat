TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of FOP- or resFOP-iMSCs treated by several ligands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyzed differentially expressed genes  among FOP- or resFOP-iMSCs treated by several ligands: Activin-A, 100 ng/mL; BMP-7, 100 ng/mL; TGF-B3, 10 ng/mL

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expressions among  FOP- or resFOP-iMSCs treated 16h by several ligands
