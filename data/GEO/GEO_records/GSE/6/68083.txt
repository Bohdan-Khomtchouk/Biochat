TITLE
TAF10 interacts with the GATA1 transcription factor and controls mouse erythropoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have ablated TAF10 in the erythroid compartment only by crossing the TAF10lox mice with the EpoR-Cre mice and we have studied the development of the erythroid cells in vivo. TAF10 ablation led to embryonic death at E13.5 while at E12.5 there was a clear developmental defect which was reflected in the transcriptional profile of the fetal liver cells. Gata1-target genes were mostly affected and were responsible for the lethal phenotype.

DESIGN
mRNA from E12.5 fetal livers of TAF10lox/KO:EpoR-Cre+/- (TAF10KO) mice, TAF10HET and WT mice was profiled by NGS (Illumina).
