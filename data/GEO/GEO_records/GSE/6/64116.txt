TITLE
Time course of serum starved ARPE19 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells from the human retina pigment epithilium cell line, ARPE-19, were cultured in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.  Then, the supplemented media was replaced with serum free media.  Cells were collected and RNA prepared from the serum free cultures on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7.  Changes in gene expression were calculated using the day0 sample for reference.

DESIGN
The analysis compared RNAs from serum supplemented cultures to cultures grown in serum free media for 1, 3, 5, or 7 days.  Each array was hybridized to a day0 sample and one of the serum free day samples.  Each serum free day was hybridized to four arrays in a dye swap pattern.  The time course was repeated three times.
