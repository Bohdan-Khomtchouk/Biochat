TITLE
Microarray analysis of mouse gene expression in metronomic cyclophosphamide-treated rat glioma 9L xenografts implanted in scid mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclophosphamide (CPA) treatment on a six-day repeating metronomic schedule induces a dramatic, innate immune cell-dependent regression of implanted gliomas. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of innate immune cell mobilization and recruitment, or about the role of DNA damage and cell stress response pathways in eliciting the anti-tumor immune responses linked to tumor regression. To address these questions, we compared untreated and 6-day metronomic cyclophosphamide-treated rat 9L gliosarcoma xenografts by mouse microarray analysis to identify responsive mouse (host) cell-specific factors.
