TITLE
Stage-specific binding profiles of cohesin in resting and activated B lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Binding profiles of cohesin in resting mature murine splenic B lymphocytes and at two stages after cell activation were elucidated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing.

DESIGN
RAD21 binding profile in resting, 48h- and 96h-stimulated B cells were analyzed in three replicates and normalized to input DNA.
