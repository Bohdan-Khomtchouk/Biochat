TITLE
Helper T cell response to low amino acid environments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent observations about how cells sense amino acids have argued for preeminent roles of mTOR and the stress kinase GCN2 in allowing cells to estimate their amino acid needs. Here we used models of programmed immune microenvironments where helper T cells have to sense how much amino acids are available to engage in antigen-fueled proliferation. Contrary to current models, T cells activate mTOR in the competency phase of the cell cycle regardless of amino acid amounts, GCN2 or surface TCR. Instead, we found T cells use an amino acid sensing system to target IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation at the restriction point of cell cycle commitment. mTOR activity is subsequently reduced and specifically connected to SREBP activation. T cells can be pushed into cycle by increasing IL-2 even when no amino acids are available. Collectively, our studies reveal helper T cells use sequential and distinct pathways to measure local amino acid concentrations.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to measure the T cell transcriptional response to low leucine, arginine or lysine environments (with macrophages present, with or without cognate antigen stimulation).
