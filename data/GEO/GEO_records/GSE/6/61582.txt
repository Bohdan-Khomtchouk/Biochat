TITLE
Microarray of Mst1/2 deleted epithelial cells from E18.5 mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ShhCre;Mst1/2flx/flx (Mst1/2 D/D) mice were generated to conditionally delete Mst1 and Mst2 from epithelial progenitors during lung morphogenesis.  Lungs from E18.5 control and Mst1/2 D/D mice were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated to generate single cell suspension.  Epcam(+) cells were isolated using magnetic microbeads. Microarray analysis of mRNAs isolated from Epcam(+) epithelial cells from E18.5 control and Mst1/2 D/D mice was performed to identify transcriptional changes following deletion of the mammalian Hippo kinases (Mst1 and Mst2) from the embryonic lung.

DESIGN
The mammalian Hippo kinases, Mst1 and Mst2, were conditionally deleted in epithelial progenitors of the developing lung using ShhCre.  Epcam(+) epithelial cells were isolated from the lungs of E18.5 control and Mst1/2 deleted mice.  mRNA isolated from Epcam(+) epithelial cells was analyzed by microarray.
