TITLE
CDK7-dependent Transcriptional Addition in Basal-like Breast Cancer (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal-like breast cancer (BBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer that exhibits extremely high levels of genetic complexity and yet a relatively uniform transcriptional program. We postulate that BBC might be highly dependent on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of transcription. Utilizing a novel kinase inhibitor and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we show here that basal but not luminal breast cancer cells are exceptionally dependent on CDK7, a transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase. BBC cells are unique in their dependence on this transcriptional CDK and suffer apoptotic cell death upon CDK7 inhibition. An “Achilles cluster” of BBC-specific genes are extremely sensitive to CDK7 inhibition and frequently associated with super-enhancers. We conclude that CDK7 mediates transcriptional addiction to a vital cluster of genes in BBC and CDK7 inhibition may be useful therapy for this challenging cancer.

DESIGN
