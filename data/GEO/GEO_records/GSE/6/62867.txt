TITLE
A comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns between different tissues from patients with coronary heart disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in right coronary artery in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques, atherosclerotic-resistant internal mammary arteries, and great saphenous veins obtained from same patients with coronary heart disease. The resulting DNA methylation patterns were markedly different between all the vascular tissues. The genes hypomethylated in athero-prone arteries to compare with atherosclerotic-resistant arteries were predominately involved in regulation of inflammation and immune processes, as well as development. The great saphenous veins exhibited an increase of the DNA methylation age in comparison to the internal mammary arteries. Gene ontology analysis for genes harboring hypermethylated CpG-sites in veins revealed the enrichment for biological processes associated with the development. Four CpG-sites located within the MIR10B gene sequence and about 1 Kb upstream of the HOXD4 gene were also confirmed as hypomethylated in the independent dataset of right coronary arteries in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques in comparison with the other vascular tissues.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted genomic DNA from 24 samples was denatured, whole-genome amplified, fragmented and subsequently hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip.
