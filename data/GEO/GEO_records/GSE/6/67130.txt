TITLE
Robust axonal regeneration occurs in the injured CAST/Ei mouse central nervous system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) requires reactivating injured neurons’ intrinsic growth state and enabling growth in an inhibitory environment. Using an inbred mouse neuronal phenotypic screen, we find that CAST/Ei mouse adult dorsal root ganglion neurons extend axons more on CNS myelin than the other eight strains tested, especially when pre-injured.  Injury-primed CAST/Ei neurons also regenerate markedly in the spinal cord and optic nerve more than those from C57BL/6 mice and show greater spouting following ischemic stroke. Heritability estimates indicate that extended growth in CAST/Ei neurons on myelin is genetically determined, and two whole-genome expression screens yield the Activin transcript Inhba as most correlated with this ability. These screens are presented here.

DESIGN
Biological quadruplicate - Mouse tissue - Naïve Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) and 5 day post sciatic nerve crush DRG - x9 strains.
