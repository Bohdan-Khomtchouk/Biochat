TITLE
Predicting drug response in human prostate cancer from preclinical analysis of in vivo mouse models (I)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of mouse models of prostate cancer after treatment with rapamycin and PD0325901 combination therapy or standard of care docetaxel. The Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenflox/flox; KrasLSL-G12D/+ (NPK mice) was used in this study. Two months after tumor induction, mice were randomly assigned to vehicle (Veh) or treatments groups, such as rapamycin and  PD0325901 (RAPPD) or docetaxel (Docetaxel). For the treatment groups mice were administered rapamycin (10 mg/kg) and PD0325901 (10 mg/kg) or docetaxel (10 mg/kg) for 5 days (SHORT) or for 1 month (LONG). At the end of the treatment, mice were euthanized, tumors harvested and snap frozen for subsequent molecular analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tumors/tissues. Prostate tumors/tissues were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Total RNA was amplified and labelled for subsequent microarrays hybridization using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit.
