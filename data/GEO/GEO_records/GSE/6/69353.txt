TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiling of isolated class III Drosophila dendritic arborization sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Class III Drosophila dendritic arborization sensory neurons were isolated via magnetic bead sorting and total RNA isolated from the samples was used for gene expression profiling to explore molecular functions of this sensory neuron subtype.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of class III da neurons, isolated via magnetic bead sorting (using protocols as described in Iyer et al., 2009), was performed at the third instar larval stage of development.  40-50 aged-matched third instar larvae of genotype ppk-Gal4,UAS-mCD8::GFP,ppk-Gal80 (labels class III dendritic arborization sensory neurons (Iyer et al., 2013)) were used to perform independent class III-specific cell isolations.  These datasets were also directly compared with GSE46154 containing microarray datasets for class I and class IV dendritic arborization sensory neurons and age matched whole larval homogenate RNA.
