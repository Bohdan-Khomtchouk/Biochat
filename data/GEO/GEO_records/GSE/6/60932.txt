TITLE
Gene expression changes in limb buds of Nipbl-haploinsufficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multiple genes are dysregulated in hindlimb buds of Nipbl-deficient embryos.  In all, more than 1000 limb bud genes were found to be significantly altered in expression by microarray analysis of E10.5 mouse hindlimb buds. Small changes in expression (mostly decreases) were observed for genes involved in FGF, BMP, and SHH pathways, as well as numerous genes involved in the Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling pathway.  Genes involved in the Mediator complex,  Cohesin function, and Hox gene expression and functions  were also dysregulated in Nipbl deficient limb buds.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis using RNA extracted from E10.5 hindlimb limb buds harvested from stage-matched Nipbl+/- (n=12) and wildtype (n=12)
