TITLE
CXCR4 regulates extra-medullary myeloma through epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like transcriptional activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed EMD- and BM-prone and defined the presence of an EMT-like mRNA signature in both EMD- and BM-prone clones.

DESIGN
Evaluation of RNA sequencing of EMD- and BM-prone clones as compared to the parental cells the two clones were originated from.
