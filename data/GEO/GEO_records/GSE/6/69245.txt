TITLE
Wheat: Control vs. Pathogen-infected

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed kinase genes in Rhizoctonia cerealis resistant wheat lines CI12633/Shanhongmai compared with the susceptible wheat line Wenmai 6 via Agilent Wheat Gene Expression Microarray assay. Goal was to identify the kinase genes whose expression was higher in CI12633/Shanhongmai compared with the susceptible wheat line Wenmai 6

DESIGN
CI12633/Shanhongmai vs. Wenmai 6
