TITLE
The transcriptional landscape of early pancreatic development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreas organogenesis is a highly dynamic process where neighbouring tissue interactions lead to dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks that orchestrates endocrine, exocrine and ductal lineage formation. To understand the spatio-temporal regulatory logic we have used the Forkhead transcription factor Foxa2-Venus fusion (FVF) knock-in reporter mouse to separate the FVF+ pancreatic epithelium from the FVF- surrounding mesenchyme and blood vessels to perform a whole genome-wide mRNA expression profiling at embryonic day (E)12.5-15.5. This allowed us to annotate genes and molecular processes differentially regulated in these cell types and compartments of the pancreas to generate a dynamic transcriptional landscape.

DESIGN
Time-resolved profiling across four embryonic development days. Pancreata were FAC sorted by Foxa2-Venus Fusion (FVF) for each day with each 2-3 biological replicates.
