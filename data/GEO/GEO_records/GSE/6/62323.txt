TITLE
Genome-wide transcript profiling of Candida albicans PGA22 overexpression

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcript profiling from 3 biological replicates of C. albicans strains expressing PGA22 under the control of a tetracycline derivative-inducible promoter grown during 16h in the presence or absence of 50 µg/mL doxycycline (Dox)

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, untreated (-Dox) and Dox-treated (50 µg/mL during /16h in Yest Peptone Dextrose medium), 3 biological replicates
