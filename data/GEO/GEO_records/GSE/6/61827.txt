TITLE
Expression data from in vitro decidualized human uterine fibroblast cells (HuF cells) with or without NOTCH1 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Decidualization is a critical process for embryo implatation during which uterine stromal fibroblasts are transformed into large, epithelioid-like decidual cell. NOTCH1 is recepotor of Notch signaling that plays important roles for cell-cell communication, which involves gene regulatory mechanisms that control multiple cellular differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life. Here we silenced NOTCH1 by shRNA in HuF cells and studied how it affects decidualization

DESIGN
HuF cells were cultured, transfected with NOTCH1 shRNA via a lentivirus system, following by a in vitro induced decidualization by EPC cocktail (36 nM estradiol-17β and 1 μM medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 0.1 mM dbcAMP) for 6 days. RNAs were extracted then hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. There are four experimental conditions: 1) transfected with empty plasmid; 2) transfected with hNOTCH1 lentiviral-shRNA plasmid; 3) transfected with empty plasmid and treated with EPC cocktail; and 4) hNOTCH1 lentiviral-shRNA plasmid with subsequent treatment of EPC cocktail. HuF cells from two different patients were used in each group (HuF86P4 & HuF88P4).
