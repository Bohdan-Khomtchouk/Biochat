TITLE
Genetic Variation, Not Cell Type of Origin, Underlies Regulatory Differences in iPSCs [Expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of contribution of cell type of origin and individual to gene expression differences in iPSCs. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cell type of origin affects iPSC gene expression. Results show that individual has a much stronger effect than cell type of origin on differences between iPSCs derived from multiple individuals.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from feeder-free iPSCs derived from multiple individuals and tissues and their corresponding cell type of origin
