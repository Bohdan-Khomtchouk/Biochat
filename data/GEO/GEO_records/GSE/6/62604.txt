TITLE
Gene expression signature of the three major epidermal differentiation compartments: interfollicular epidermis (IFE), hair follicle (HF) and sebaceous gland (SG).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There are multiple stem cells in adult mammalian epidermis, but the mechanisms controlling lineage specification are poorly understood. To identify gene expression signatures of the three major epidermal differentiation compartments we micro-dissected individual SG, IFE and HF from adult epidermis. The RNA was isolated from age and sex matched wild-type mice and performed transcriptome analysis with Affymetrix Exon microarrays

DESIGN
We micro-dissected individual interfollicular epidermis (IFE), hair follicle (HF) and sebaceous gland (SG) from adult tail epidermis. The RNA was isolated from age and sex matched wild-type mice. Three biological replicates for each epidermal differentiation compartment were analyzed.
