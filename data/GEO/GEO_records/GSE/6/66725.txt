TITLE
Genomics of the ovine heart ontogeny during the perinatal period

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The period of development from the last two weeks of gestation through the first two weeks of life spans a period of great functional and metabolic challenge to the fetal and neonatal lamb heart. Important changes in gene expression occur to meet these challenges. On this study, septa from sheep hearts at 130 days gestation (n=6), term (n=8, gestational lenght is around 145 days) and 14-days-old lambs (n=8) were used to model the changes in gene expression patterns during the perinatal period using Agilent 15k ovine microarrays. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) determined five major patterns of co-expressed and functionally related genes during this critical period of cardiac transition.

DESIGN
Septum samples from the heart were collected from non-treated fetuses at 130 days of gestational age (GA130d, n=6) and term (n=8); and from naturally born 14-days-old lambs (Lamb, n=8). None of the ewes suffered gestational diseases or showed signs of impending labor.
