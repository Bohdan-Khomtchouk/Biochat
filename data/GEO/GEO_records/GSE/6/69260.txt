TITLE
Histone chaperone CAF-1 is essential for retrotransposon silencing by mediating histone H4K20me3 deposition in mouse preimplantation embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retrotransposons are widely spread in the mammalian genome and are usually silenced during development to avoid transposition-inducing mutations. But how they are repressed in embryos shortly before implantation remain to be identified, since the genome at this stage is globally hypomethylated. Here we show a histone chaperon, CAF-1, is responsible for retrotransposon silencing at the morula-blastocyst stages by depositing histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Knockdown of CAF-1 with a specific siRNA resulted in derepression of LINE-1, SINE-B2 and IAP associated with the decreased H4K20me3 level, and arrested embryonic development at the morula stage. The identical results were obtained with siRNAs against Suv420h1/2, H4K20 methyltransferases. Treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitors rescued at least a part of these embryos. Thus, CAF-1 ensures the genomic integrity of preimplantation embryos by establishing repressive histone marks in the multiple retrotransposon classes.

DESIGN
Comparative gene expression analyses using P150 knockdown (P150KD) embryos at morula stage were performed by microarray. P150KD embryos were produced with the injection of P150 siRNA into 1-cell embryos. As controls, siControl embryos were produced by the injection of control siRNA. These embryos were subjected to gene expression microarray.
