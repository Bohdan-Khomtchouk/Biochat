TITLE
High throughput quantitative whole transcriptome analysis of CC10- B4+ and Krt5-CreERT2 - labeled distal lung cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microfluidic single cell RNA-seq on adult isolated CC10-CreERT2 (negative) integrin beta4(pos) cells lung epithelial cells in order to determine the transcriptional profile of this putative progenitor population.

DESIGN
CC10-CreERT2 / tdTomato (negative) integrin beta4(pos) cells were isolated by FACS, as were Krt5-CreERT2 / tdTomato (positive) cells.  These cells were pooled and loaded onto the Fluidigm C1 device.
