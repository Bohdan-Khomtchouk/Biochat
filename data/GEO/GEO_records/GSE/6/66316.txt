TITLE
Expression data from adult male Sprague Dawley rat liver, investigating how pomegranate skin extract prevents non alcoholic fatty liver diseases

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pomegranate skin extract could prevent fatty liver due to high fat diet in adult male Sprague Dawley rat. There are 3 groups of rats, feeding chow diet, high fat diet and high fat diet combined with pomegrante skin extract. After 8 weeks feeding, high fat diet group developped fatty liver but the other two groups still have healthy liver. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the fatty liver development and preventive effect of pomegranate skin extract on fatty liver.

DESIGN
There are 3 treatment groups and 6 replicates for each group. The 3 treatment groups are control group feeding chow diet, high fat group feeding high fat diet and PE group feeding high fat diet and pomegranate skin extract. Rat livers were collecteded for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
