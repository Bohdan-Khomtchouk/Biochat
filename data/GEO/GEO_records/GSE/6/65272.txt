TITLE
Bacillus subtilis WalR (YycF) ChIP-chip  Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Identification of the specific WalR (YycF) binding regions on the B. subtilis chromosome during exponential and phosphate starvation growth phases. The data serves to extend the WalRK regulon in Bacillus subtilis and its role in cell wall metabolism, as well as implying a role in several other cellular processes.
