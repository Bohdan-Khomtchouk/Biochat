TITLE
Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of ionic liquid stimuli unveils enhanced secondary metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4

SUMMARY
The study aims essentially in the analysis of the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles induced by the presence of the tested ionic liquids  in the metabolism of Aspergillus nidulans. Focusing specially on the secondary metabolism, which genes are clustered.
