TITLE
MacroH2A1 ChIP-seq from H-RasV12 expressing senescent IMR90 human primary lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor suppressive mechanism typified by stable proliferative arrest, a persistent DNA damage response and the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). MacroH2A1, a tumor suppressive histone variant, is upregulated during OIS. Using ChIP-seq, we found that macroH2A1 undergoes dramatic relocalization during OIS. SASP genes are enriched in macroH2A1-containing chromatin and macroH2A1 is a critical component of the positive feedback loop that maintains SASP expression. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a feature of OIS that requires macroH2A1, leads to ATM activation. ER stress triggers a negative feedback loop reducing SASP expression by causing the ATM-dependent removal of macroH2A1 from SASP genes. MacroH2A1 represents a critical control point in the regulation of SASP expression during OIS by We demonstrate that SASP gene expression is regulated by the combined actions of a positive feedback loop that requires macroH2A1 and a negative feedback loop where ER stress leads to ATM activation critical for the removal of macroH2A1 from SASP genes and consequently their repression.

DESIGN
macroH2A1 ChIP and corresponding input samples from H-RasV12 OIS IMR90 cells were sequenced
