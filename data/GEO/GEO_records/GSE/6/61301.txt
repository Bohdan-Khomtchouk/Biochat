TITLE
Gene expression of 7 day combinatorial yohimbine and imipramine treated rat hippocampi

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats treated on 7 consecutive days with either 2 injections of vehicle (Ctl) (DMSO for yohimbine, saline for imipramine) or Y+I (2mg/kg Yohimbine + 20mg/kg Imipramine) were sacrificed 2 hours post the last injection and their hippocampi used for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Agilent one-color experiment,Organism: Rat, Agilent-Rat  8x60k Microarray Gene expression (AMADID: 028279), Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442)
