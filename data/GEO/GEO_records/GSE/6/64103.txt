TITLE
Genome profiling of fibrolamellar carcinoma [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare variant of HCC that most frequently affects young adults. Because of its rarity and an absence of preclinical models, the molecular biology of FL-HCC remains unclear. Our objective was to analyze chromosomal alterations and dysregulated gene expression in tumor specimens collected at a single center during two decades of experience with FL-HCC.

DESIGN
We analyzed 38 specimens from 26 patients by array comparative genomic hybridiziation (aCGH)
