TITLE
ADAR1 is required for differentiation and neural induction by regulating microRNA processing in a catalytically independent manner (iCLIP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used iCLIP to identify ADAR1 binding sites in embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
iCLIP in ADAR1 KD H9 cells infected with Flag tagged ADAR1 or ADAR1-E912A.
