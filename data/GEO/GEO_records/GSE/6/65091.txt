TITLE
Deep Sequencing of Typha angustifolia Small RNAs

ORGANISM
Typha angustifolia

SUMMARY
We used high-throughput sequencing to identify conserved and nonconserved miRNAs and other short RNAs in Typha angustifolia under control and cadmium stressed condition. A total of 114 conserved miRNAs and 41 novel candidate miRNAs encoded by 66 hairpin precursors were identified in both small RNA libraries. 4 conserved and 6 novel miRNAs showed specific expression, which, combined with function of target genes, suggests that miRNAs may play a role in plant Cd stress response.These results provide a framework for further analysis of miRNAs and their role in regulating Typha angustifolia response to cadmium stress.

DESIGN
Two small RNA libraries, with (Cd) and without (CK) cadmium-treatment, were sequenced by Illumina sequencing technology
