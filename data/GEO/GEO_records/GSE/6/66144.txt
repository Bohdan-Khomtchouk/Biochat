TITLE
Bisulfite-free and Base-resolution Analysis of 5-formylcytosine at Whole-genome Scale

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Active DNA demethylation in mammals involves TET-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). However, genome-wide detection of 5fC at single-base resolution remains challenging. Here we present a bisulfite-free method for the whole-genome analysis of 5fC, based on a selective chemical labeling of 5fC and subsequent C-to-T transition during PCR. Base-resolution 5fC maps reveal limited overlap with 5hmC, with 5fC-marked regions more active than 5hmC-marked ones.

DESIGN
Utilization of cyclization-enabled C-to-T transition of 5fC (hence “fC-CET”) to obtain genome-wide map of 5fC at single-base resolution WT and TdgKO mES cell lines.  Two non-enriched input DNAs (Input: preAI), two AI labeled samples (Input: AI), two pull-down output samples.
