TITLE
Prox1 downregulation is a prerequisite for the maturation and expansion of postnatal murine beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alterations in the expression of key transcription factors can be harmful for pancreatic beta cell homeostasis and could lead to diabetes. This study uncovered that Prox1 overexpression obstructs beta cell maturation and results in severe hyperglycemia. The function of β-cells is key for glucose homeostasis because they supply insulin to the entire body. Genetic or metabolic conditions that disrupt the complex physiology of β-cells can lead to diabetes mellitus, a prevalent life-threatening disease. Here we investigated whether sustained Prox1 expression is incompatible with β-cell development using a transgenic mouse approach, and report that β-cell maturation is drastically impaired in the presence of high levels of Prox1.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify gene expression profiles and pathways that are differentially activated when Prox1 is overexpressed in murine pancreatic beta cells.
