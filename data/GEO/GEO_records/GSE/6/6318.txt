TITLE
Analysis of the transcriptional response of Candida parapsilosis following exposure to farnesol

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
We used the results of a genome sequence survey to design and manufacture partial genomic microarrays that were applied to determining the transcriptional response of C. parapsilosis to the presence of exogenous farnesol. Keywords: drug response, farnesol,
