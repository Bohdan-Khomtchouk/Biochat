TITLE
Sensitive expression profiling of T-cell subsets reveals parallel post-thymic differentiation for CD4+ and CD8+ lineages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling has opened new directions of investigation in scientific research, however, the need for substantial amount of biological material to perform these experiments limits significantly its application range. Here, we have developed procedures to perform microarray analysis on amplified cDNA from single cells, including primary T lymphocytes, and applied this technology to the study of CD4 and CD8 lineage differentiation. Gene expression profiling was performed on samples of 1000 cells from 10 different subpopulations, defining the major stages of post-thymic CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Surprisingly, our data revealed that while CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells evolve differently at early stages of differentiation, they become increasingly similar as they reach late differentiation stages. This suggests that the functional heterogeneity of antigen experienced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells is located early during post-thymic differentiation, and that late stages of differentiation may represent a common end in the development of T-lymphocytes.
