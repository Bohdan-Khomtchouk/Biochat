TITLE
Molecular Features of Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer Cells by Genome-wide Gene-expression Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular features of clinical (Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancers) HRPCs, we generated the precise gene-expression profiles of 25 clinical HRPCs and 10 hormone-sensitive prostate cancers (HSPCs) by genome-wide cDNA microarrays combining with laser microbeam microdisection. Keywords: disease status analysis
