TITLE
An alternative pluripotent state confers interspecies chimaeric competency [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Here we show that by simple modulation of extrinsic signaling pathways, a new class of pluripotent stem cells, referred to as region selective epiblast stem cells (rsEpiSCs), could be efficiently derived from different stages of the early embryo. rsEpiSCs share features of primed pluripotency yet are distinct from EpiSCs in their molecular characteristics and ability to colonize post-implantation embryos. We performed RNA-sequencing experiments and examined the global gene expression profiles of EpiSCs, rsEpiSCs, in vivo isolated four regions of E6.5 mouse epiblasts: AP (anterior-proximal), AD (anterior-distal), PP (posterior-proximal) and PD (posterior-distal), human H1 ESCs, H1 rsESCs, H9 ESCs, H9 rsESCs, rhesus monkey ORMES23 rsESCs, and chimpanzee rsiPSCs.

DESIGN
Examination of global gene expression profiles in 2 pluripotent stem cell types across multiple species.
