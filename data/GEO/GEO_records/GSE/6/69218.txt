TITLE
Expression analysis of Clostridium difficile wild type and fur (ferric uptake regulator) mutant in high iron.

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile 630

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Clostridium difficile fur (ferric uptake regulator) mutant, compared to the wild type strain 630 erm. The fur mutant analyzed in this study is further described in Ho and Ellermeier (2015) J. Bacteriology

DESIGN
A microarray study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild type cultures of Clostridium difficile 630 erm strain and three separate cultures of a fur mutant strain (ltrA::ermR) were grown in Tryptone-Yeast Extract medium containing 0.25 mM ferric chloride .  Each chip measures the expression level of 3,786 of the 3,787 open reading frames of the C. difficile 630 genome with 18 probes (60 oligomers each) for each gene.
