TITLE
Gene expression induced in HEK293 by treatment with the differentiating agents all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl-cAMP (cAMP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This gene array analysis shows that the transcriptome of HEK293, representing low-differentiated human embryonic kidney cells, cultured in presence of tRA and cAMP differentiating agents, is consistent with a genetic program relevant to kidney development

DESIGN
Comparison of HEK293 cells grown in standard contitions or in presence of differentiating agents. Cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes, cultured for 3 days either in complete medium or in medium supplemented with tRA and cAMP, harvested, and spun down before RNA isolation. Comparative analysis allowed us to identify genes transcriptionally by tRA/cAMP.
