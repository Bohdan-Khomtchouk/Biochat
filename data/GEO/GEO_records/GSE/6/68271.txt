SUMMARY
To explore the roles of essential miRNAs in regulating self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which initiate from mammary epithelial stem cells (MaSCs). CD44+CD24-/low cells and MUC1-ESA+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A, and were verified as BCSCs and MaSCs by clonogenic assay and multipotential differentiation experiment in 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D cultures, respectively. Using microarray containing oligonucleotides corresponding to 509 miRNAs from human, mouse, and rat genomes. We obtained candidate miRNAs in regulating breast tumorigenesis. One representative miRNA (miR-200c) was proved to regulate stemness of BCSCs and MaSCs in vitro and in vivo by miR-200c agomir transfection. We validated that miR-200c negatively regulated PDCD10, an apoptosis regulator, in BCSCs and MaSCs.
