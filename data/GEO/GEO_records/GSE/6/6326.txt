TITLE
Histone H3 K4,36,79R 0 hr

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from two replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H3 K4,36,79R mutant.  Cells were grown in galactose media to give the 0 hour timepoint. Keywords: repeat
