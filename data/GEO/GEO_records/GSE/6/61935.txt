TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of sugarcane root in response to low-K stress

ORGANISM
Saccharum

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of low-K tolerance in sugarcane, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify sugarcane genes in response to low-K stress. seeldings were transplanted to low-K hydroponic (containing 0.1 mmol.L-1 K+) and the roots were collected at 0 (CK), 8, 24 and 72 h after exposure to low-K condition. The expressions of genes in sugarcane roots were detected by microarray analysis. Totally 1545 genes at 8 h, 1053 genes at 24 h and 3155 at 72 h differentially expressed under low-K stress, when the 2-fold change was adopted as the threshold for determining differentially expressed genes. Among these genes, a certain amount of transcription factors, transporters, kinases, oxidative stress-related genes and genes in Ca+ and ethylene signaling pathway were detected to differentially express.

DESIGN
Seeldings were treated with low-K hydroponic (containing 0.1 mmol.L-1 K+) and after 0 (CK), 8, 24 and 72 h exposure to low -K stress, the roots of sugarcane were collected. Four independent experiments were performed using roots collected at different time points
