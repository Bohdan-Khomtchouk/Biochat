TITLE
Analysis of gene expression  from fbn5-1 T-DNA insertion mutant of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in fbn5-1 T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutant. Fibrillins are lipid-associated proteins in plastids and are ubiquitous in plants. Fibrillins are known to accumulate and sequester carotenoids in chromoplasts during the development of flowers and fruits; however, little is known about the function of fibrillins in leaf tissues. Here we identified a novel protein fibrillin5 (FBN5) that is essential for plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that homozygous fbn5-1 plants were seedling-lethal, and XVE:FBN5-B transgenic plants expressing low levels of FBN5-B showed a lower growth rate and were smaller than wild-type. In chloroplasts, FBN5-B physically interacts with solanesyl-diphosphate synthase (SPS) 1 and 2, which synthesize the solanesyl moiety of PQ-9. Plants containing defective FBN5-B accumulated less PQ-9 and its cyclized product, plastochromanol-8, which is consistent with mutant phenotypes showing lower photosynthetic performance and higher levels of hydrogen peroxide. The role of FBN5-B in the FBN5-B/dimeric SPS complex is discussed with respect to biosynthesis of the solanesyl moiety.

DESIGN
4 replicats of wild-type as control and fbn5-1 T-DNA insertion mutants were analized.
