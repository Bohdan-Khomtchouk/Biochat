TITLE
RNA:DNA hybrids in the human genome have distinctive nucleotide characteristics, chromatin composition, and transcriptional relationships (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mapping of RNA:DNA hybrids in human cells reveals a number of characteristics of these non-canonical  nucleic  acid  structures.    A  directional  sequencing  approach  reveals  the  RNA component of the RNA:DNA hybrid to be purine-rich, indicating a thermodynamic contribution to the stability of these structures.  The RNA:DNA hybrids are enriched at loci with decreased DNA methylation  and  increased  DNase  hypersensitivity,  and  within  larger  domains  with characteristics of heterochromatin formation.  Studies of chromatin at RNA:DNA hybrids shows the  presence  of  the  ILF2  and  ILF3  transcription  factors,  supporting  a  model  of  certain transcription factors binding preferentially to the RNA:DNA conformation.  Overall, there is little to indicate a dependence for RNA:DNA hybrids forming co-transcriptionally, with results from the ribosomal DNA repeat unit instead supporting a model of RNA generating these structures in trans.  The results of the study indicate heterogeneous functions of these genomic elements and new insights into their formation and stability in vivo.
