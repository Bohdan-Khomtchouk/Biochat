TITLE
Restricted Dendritic Cell and Monocyte Progenitors in Human Cord Blood  and Bone Marrow

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In mice, two restricted DC progenitors, macrophage-dendritic progenitor (MDP) and common dendritic cell progenitor (CDP) demonstrate increasing commitment of DC lineage as they sequentially lose granulocyte and monocyte potential respectively. Identifying these progenitors has enabled understanding of the role of DCs and monocytes in immunity and tolerance in mice. In humans, however, restricted monocyte and DC progenitors remain unknown. Progress in studying human DC development has been hampered by lack of an in vitro culture system that recapitulates in vivo DC hematopoiesis. Here we report a culture system that supports development of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell progenitors into the three major human DC subsets, monocytes, granulocytes, NK and B cells. Using this culture system we defined the pathway for human DC development, and revealed the sequential origin of human DCs from increasingly restricted progenitors: a granulocyte-monocyte-DC progenitor (hGMDP) that develops into a monocyte-DC progenitor (hMDP) that develops into monocytes and a common DC progenitor (hCDP) that is restricted to produce the three major DC subsets. The phenotype of the DC progenitors partially overlaps with granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMPs). These progenitors reside in human cord blood and bone marrow but not in the blood or lymphoid tissues in the steady state.

DESIGN
We performed whole transcriptome expression analysis on monocytes and subsets of dendritic cells i.e. CD1c+ DCs, CD141+ DCs and CD303+ pDCs isolated from blood or differentiated in culture from cord blood CD34+ cells in presence of MS5 stromal cells and Flt3l, GM-CSF and SCF cytokines.
