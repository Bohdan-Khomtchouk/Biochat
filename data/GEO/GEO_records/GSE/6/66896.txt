TITLE
Disease-Associated SNPs From non-Coding Regions in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Are Located Within or Adjacent to Functional Genomic Elements of Human Neutrophils and CD4+ T Cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied ChIP-Seq on two histone marks: H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in healthy human neutrophils. After peak calling, we obtained the peak regions enriched with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone marks and identifed aciive enhancers (H3K27ac+/H3K4me1+) and H3K27ac active enhancers  (H3K27ac+/H3K4me1-) in human neutrophils and checked whether those enhancers are located in the LD blocks of 22 SNPs associtated with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.

DESIGN
Identification of active enhancers in human neutrohils
