TITLE
Gene expression changes in Hebeloma cylindrosporum- Pinus pinaster ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to Hebeloma cylindrosporum free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Hebeloma cylindrosporum

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to free-living mycelium . Ectomycorrhizal root tips and control mycelium were harvested after 3 weeks and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 150 bp were generated and aligned to Hebeloma cylindrosporum transcripts ( ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum ectomycorrhizal root tips and  free-living mycelium were generated by Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing (150bp). Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
