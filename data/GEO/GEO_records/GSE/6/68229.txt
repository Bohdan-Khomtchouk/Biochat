TITLE
Illumina sequencing of vaginal epithelial cells from women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or non-hormonal contraception

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The use of the hormonal contraceptive DMPA has been associated with a moderate increase in sexually transmitted infections, including HIV-1. To better understand the biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we report here the use of mRNA-sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 of vaginal epithelial cells from women using DMPA or controls. We found that women using DMPA demonstrate over 330-fold decrease in the anti-microbial peptide human beta defensin 3 (HBD3) and massive downregulation of genes involved in structural integrity, barrier function, and wound healing. CXCL6, CXCL1, and IL-1B among other inflammatory genes were up-regulated in the tissue of DMPA users compared to controls. Overall, these results demonstrate significant differences in basic epithelial functions following DMPA use.

DESIGN
Vaginal epithelial cells from four women using DMPA or non-hormonal contraception were isolated using laser capture microdissection for subsequent Illumina analysis
