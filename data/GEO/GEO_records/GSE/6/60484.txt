TITLE
Gene expression in human breast cancer cell lines regulated by CXCR6 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to further our understanding of the role that CXCR6 plays in breast cancer progression. Microarrays were searched for some genes that had correlated expression with CXCR6 mRNA. According to fold-change screening between restoring expression of CXCR6 and its respective control cells in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were shown.

DESIGN
The restoring of CXCR6 expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were respectively noted as MDA-MB-231-CXCR6 and MCF-7-CXCR6 cells and the respective controls were noted as MDA-MB-231-GFP and MCF-7-GFP cells.
