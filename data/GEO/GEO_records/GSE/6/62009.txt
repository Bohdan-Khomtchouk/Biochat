TITLE
Cytogenomic profiling of breast cancer brain metastases reveals potential for repurposing targeted therapeutics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization analysis for detection of copy number variation for cancer genes in breast cancer mestastatic brain tumors DNA was isolated and analyzed in a two-color experiment using Cancer CGH+SNP 180Kx4 arrays from Agilent and Agilent SureScan system: Cy5-labeled specimen DNA and Cy3-labeled reference Agilent (female) reference DNA

DESIGN
10 metastatic brain tumor specimens originating from breast cancer were analyzed (6 of which were only fresh frozen treated and 4 specimens were divided to run both fresh frozen and formalin fixed parafin embeded counterparts), also investigated were 4 matched primary breast cancer specimens (FFPE treated).
