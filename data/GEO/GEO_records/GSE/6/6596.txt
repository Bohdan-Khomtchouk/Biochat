TITLE
Comparison of gene expression data from human and mouse breast cancers: Identification of conserved breast tumor genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our work was the comparison of human and mouse gene expression data and to identify a conserved breast tumor gene set. The results encourage the usefulness of transgenic mice as a model for human breast cancer formation and therapy. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression data
