TITLE
Sustained expression of activated beta-catenin in dermal fibroblasts causes skin fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forced expression of activated beta-catenin in mouse dermal fibroblasts is sufficient to cause spontaneous, progressive skin fibrosis in vivo.  We generated triple-transgenic HoxB6CreERT/+; R26-YFP/+; CatnbÎ”ex3/+ " activated beta-catenin " mice and double-transgenic HoxB6CreERT/+; R26-YFP/+ littermate control mice.  We induced Cre activity (resulting in expression of activated beta-catenin in triple-transgenic mutant fetuses) by administering tamoxifen to the pregnant dam at embryonic day 16.5.  The activated beta-catenin mice developed fibrotic skin, characterized by elevated collagen deposition and increased fibroblast proliferation.  We performed RNA-sequencing to profile gene expression in the dermis of control and activated beta-catenin mutant mice with established skin fibrosis at 3 weeks of age.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were determined by paired-end sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2500) of total RNA from the dermis of 3 activated beta-catenin and 3 littermate control mice at 3 weeks of age.
