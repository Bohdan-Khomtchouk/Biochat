SUMMARY
Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) induces cell proliferation, cell migration, embryonic development, cell differentiation, angiogenesis and malignant transformation. The four forms of FGF-2 (Low Molecular Weight) and (High Molecular Weights) are alternative translation products, and have a different subcellular localization: the high molecular weight (HMWFGF-2) forms are nuclear while the low molecular weight form, (LMWFGF-2) is mainly cytoplasmic. Our previous work demonstrated NIH 3T3 cells expressing different FGF-2 forms, displayed a different phenotype, suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of FGF-2 may have different functions. Here we report a cDNA microarray-based study in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing different FGF-2 forms. Several candidate genes that affect cell-cycle, tumor suppression, adhesion and transcription were identified as possible mediators of the HMWFGF-2 phenotype and signaling pattern. These results demonstrated that HMWFGF-2 and LMWFGF-2 target the expression of different genes. Particularly, our data suggest that HMWFGF-2 forms may function as inducers of growth inhibition and tumor suppression activities.
