TITLE
Genome Wide Mapping of Foxo1 Binding-sites in Murine T Lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Forkhead box O (Foxo) family of transcription factors has a critical role in controlling the development, differentiation, and function of T cells. However, the direct target genes of Foxo transcription factors in T cells have not been well characterized. In this study, we focused on mapping the genome wide Foxo1-binding sites in na√Øve CD4+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we identified Foxo1 binding sites that were shared among or specific to the three T cell populations. Here we describe the experiments, quality controls, as well as the deep sequencing data. Part of the data analysis has been published by Ouyang W et al. in Nature 2012  (1) and Kim MV et al. in Immunity 2013 (2), and the associated data set were uploaded to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.

DESIGN
ChIP DNAs were prepared from T cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice using Foxo1 antibody and T cells isolated from Foxo1tag/tagbirA mice using Streptavin-coated beads. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared following a standard protocol.
