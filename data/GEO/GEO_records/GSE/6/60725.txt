TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of Human Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from epithelial tissues of different grades and stages of human breast cancer samples using mirVana kit and RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined in Agilent Bioanalyzer (2100) to assess the suitability for microarray assays. Sixteen samples were individually analyzed using miRCURYâ„¢ LNA arrays version 11.0 (Exiqon, Denmark). The LNA array slides were scanned using Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) and image analysis was carried out using ImaGene 8.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc., USA). The quantified signals were background corrected (Normexp with offset value 10 14 and normalized using global Lowess (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regression algorithm.
