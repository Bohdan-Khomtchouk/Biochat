TITLE
Testing gene expression changes in VCaP cells following PRMT5 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VCaP cells expressing either NTC shRNA or PRMT5 shRNA 1 or shRNA 2 were treated with 100ng/ml doxycycline for 5 days This experiment is designed to see which genes and pathways are modulated by PRMT5 knockdown in VCaP cells

DESIGN
VCaP cells  were treated with 100ng/ml doxyxycline for 3 days.
