TITLE
Epigenetic determinants of self-renewal in glioblastoma [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We over-expressed an epigenetic regulator in a glioblastoma (GBM) primary culture from an adult patient. These GBM cells have cancer stem cell phenotypes, as they have self-renewal properties and tumor initiation potential when transplanted in immunocompromised mice. ATAC-seq was performed on cells over-expressing the epigenetic regulator and control cells expressing EGFP.

DESIGN
ATAC-Seq on glioblastoma cells that over-express EGFP or an epigenetic regulator.
