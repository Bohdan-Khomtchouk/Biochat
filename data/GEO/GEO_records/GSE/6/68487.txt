TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisae strains overexpressing RNA-binding hnRNP Yra1

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with an imbalance proportion of Yra1, a component of THO/TREX. We used microarrays to the global impact of Yra1 overexpression and found that no general impact was observed.
