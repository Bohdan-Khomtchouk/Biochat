TITLE
The Nasal Gene Expression and Childhood Atopic Asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared genomic DNA methylation patterns and gene expression in African American children with persistent atopic asthma versus healthy controls. We identified 119 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 118 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) after adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, batch effects, inflation, and multiple comparisons (false discovery rate-adjusted q < 0.05). Genes differentially methylated include those with established roles in asthma and atopy, components of the extracellular matrix, genes related to immunity, cell adhesion, epigenetic regulation, and airway obstruction. Hypo- and hypermethylated genes were associated with increased and decreased gene expression respectively (P < 2.8x10-6 for DMRs and P < 7.8x10-10 for DMPs). Quantitative analysis of methylation-expression relationships in 53 differentially expressed genes demonstrated that 32 (60%) have significant (q < 0.05) methylation-expression relationships within 5kb of the gene. 10 loci selected based on the relevance to asthma, magnitude of methylation change, and asthma specific methylation-expression relationships were validated in an independent cohort of children with asthma.

DESIGN
case control design with nasal epithelial cells from 36 atopic asthmatic and 33 nonatopic nonasthmatic children from the inner city
