TITLE
miRNA expression data in 3rd mammary gland and mammary flank region at embryonic day 13.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs are not well known their expression and function in mammary gland development. To identify the miRNAs expression during mammary gland development, mammary bud were dissected at E13.5

DESIGN
miRNA-chip expression analysis was performed with RNAs of the 3rd mammary gland and mammary flank region between 3rd and 4th mammary gland from embryos of pregnant mice at emrbryonic day 13.5, using Agilent's miRNA microarray.
