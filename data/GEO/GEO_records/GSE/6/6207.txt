TITLE
miR-124 transfection time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This time course analysis is to study the targets and functions of miR-124. MiR-124 was overexpressed and the effect of miR-124 overexpression was compared to negative controls to identify downregulated genes and potential miRNA targets. Keywords: time course
