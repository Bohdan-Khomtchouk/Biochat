TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in medulloblastoma groups

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embryonal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) represent a highly malignant tumor group of medulloblastoma (MB), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) that frequently afflict children. In this study, we report transcriptome traits in MB by using gene expression microarray analyses. We also compare MB dataset with AT/RT cases and AT/RT-like cases.

DESIGN
22 MB cases are subjected to transcriptome analysis
