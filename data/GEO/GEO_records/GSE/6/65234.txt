TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen IgG and IgM reactivity in B6 and BXD2 mice with spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine B6 and BXD2 mouse sera IgG and IgM reactivity to linear peptide epitopes at different ages.  Serum from B6 or BXD2 mice was diluted at 1:200 for IgG-specific analysis or 1:1000 for IgM specific analysis and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens.
