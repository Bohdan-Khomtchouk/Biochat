TITLE
Heterochromatin assembly and transcriptome repression by Set1 in coordination with a class II histone deacetylase

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of S. pombe set1/COMPASS/H3K4 mutants, atf1 and set1 atf1 deletion mutants, set1 clr3 deletion mutants; ChIP-chip tiling microarray profiling of S. pombe Set1, Atf1, H3K4me3 in wt/atf1 deletion mutants, H3K9me2 in wt/set1 clr3 deletion mutants

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 60mer microarrays were used to assay gene expression in set1/COMPASS mutants in combination with atf1 and clr3 mutants, and to profile genome-wide binding of Set1, Atf1, H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 in S. pombe cells  (two-color mutant vs. wildtype, ChIP vs. input experiments).
