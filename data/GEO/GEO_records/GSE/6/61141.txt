TITLE
Phenotypic responses of differentiated asthmatic human airway epithelial cultures to rhinovirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of gene expression responses to human rhinovirus infection at 24 hours in air-liquid interface human airway epithelial cell cultures derived from 6 asthmatic and 6 non-asthmatic donors.  RNA-seq analysis identified sets of genes associated with asthma specific viral responses.  These genes are related to inflammatory pathways, epithelial remodeling and cilium assembly and function, including those described previously (e.g. CCL5, CXCL10 and CX3CL1), and novel ones that were identified for the first time in this study (e.g. CCRL1, CDHR3).   We concluded that air liquid interface cultured human airway epithelial cells challenged with live HRV are a useful in vitro model for the study of rhinovirus induced asthma exacerbation, given that our findings are consistent with clinical data sets.  Furthermore, our data suggest that abnormal airway epithelial structure and inflammatory signaling are important contributors to viral induced asthma exacerbation.

DESIGN
Differentiated air-liquid interface cultured human airway epithelial cell mRNA profiles from 6 asthmatic and 6 non-asthmatic donors after 24 hour treatment with either HRV or vehicle control were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
