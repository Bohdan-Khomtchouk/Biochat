TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of microRNA expression in Primary human Bronchial Epithelial cells (PBECs) from healthy or asthmatic subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare the base-line microRNA expression of asthmatic and healthy PBECs. PBECs were grown in-vitro up to passage 2 before harvest.

DESIGN
RT-qPCR based microRNA array expression profiling. PBECs were isolated from 5 healthy and 5 asthmatic donors. Total cellular RNA from each sample was processed and analyzed independently.
