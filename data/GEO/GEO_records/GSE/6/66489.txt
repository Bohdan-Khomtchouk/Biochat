TITLE
Differential gene regulation by miR-142-3p and miR-K10a isomiRs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compares changes in gene expression induced by four interrelated miRNAs with similar but staggered 5'-ends: miR-142-3p, miR-142-3p-1, miR-K10a, and miR-K10a+1. miR-K10a and miR-K10a+1 are co-expressed by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from HEK293 cells transfected with individual miRNAs including a negative control miRNA mimic.
