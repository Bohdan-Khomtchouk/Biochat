TITLE
To identify and study the regulation of cellulosic enzymes in a biomass degrading gut fungal isolate from horse (Piromyces sp. finn)

ORGANISM
Piromyces finnis

SUMMARY
Here, we develop a systems-level approach leveraging powerful next generation sequencing, proteomics and phenotypic studies to rapidly obtain an integrated view of lignocellulose degradation in the earliest free living fungi

DESIGN
RNA-seq of Piromyces grown on Glucose, Cellulose, Cellulobiose, Avicel, Filter paper, and time-course of transient glucose pulse (catabolite repression).  N > =2
