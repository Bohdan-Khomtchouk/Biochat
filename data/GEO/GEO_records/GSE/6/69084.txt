Replication timing of control and suv4-20h (KO and inducible mutant) cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although histone modifications have been implicated in many DNA-dependent processes, their precise role in DNA replication remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the regulation of histone H4-K20 methylation states, in particular for the trimethylation, is a critical determinant of licensing and time activation of replication origins in mammalian cells.
