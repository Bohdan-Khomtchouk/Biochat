TITLE
Expression profiles of liver tissues from wild-type and AID transgenic mice exposed to thioacetamide hepatotoxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AID is an intrinsic DNA mutator enzyme and contributes to tumorigenesis through the accumulation of genetic aberrations. To examine whether mutagenesis induced by AID during inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis depends on the transcriptional levels of the target genes, we performed the gene expression profiling of liver tissues from AID transgenic mice and wild-type mice with and without thioacetamide treatment.

DESIGN
AID transgenic mice and wild-type mice were administered with thioacetamide in drinking water for 6 months, and the gene expression levels of their livers are compared.
