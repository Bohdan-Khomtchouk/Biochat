SUMMARY
Molecular profiling of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm reveals a unique pattern and suggests selective sensitivity to nf-kb pathway inhibition

DESIGN
To better understand the pathobiology of BPDCN and discover new targets for effective therapies, the gene expression profile (GEP) of 25 BPDCN samples was analyzed and compared with that of pDCs, their postulated normal counterpart Raw matrix per probe not available. Raw matrix collapsed by gene available as suppplementary file (GSE62014_non-normalized.txt).
