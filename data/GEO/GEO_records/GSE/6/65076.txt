TITLE
Transcriptome analysis for cellobise-adpative C. glutamicum strains

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
To understrand the altered gene expressions of cellobiose-positive C. glutamicum over cellobiose-negative C. glutamicum

DESIGN
Total 7 samples were used to understand the altered gene expressions for C. glutamicum strains grown either on cellobisoe or glucose
