TITLE
Tiling microarray of Oryza sativa japonica at 46nt resolution

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcribed regions of japonica subspecies of the rice genome. A series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays that represent sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of all the 12 chromosomes were designed to measure genome-wide transcription. A total of 12253842 36mer oligonucleotide probes positioned every 46 nt on average were used for this purpose. The probes were synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of approximately 389,000 probes per slide. The arrays were hybridized with fluorescence-labeled cDNA reverse-transcribed from equal amounts of four selected poly(A)+ RNA population (seedling root, seedling shoot, panicle, and suspension cultured cells). Keywords: tiling array, genome-wide transcription
