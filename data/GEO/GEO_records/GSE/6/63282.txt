TITLE
ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses identify Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways as Prep1 targets in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Prep1 (Pknox1) homeodomain transcription factor is essential at multiple stages of embryo development. In the E11.5 embryo trunk, we previously estimated that Prep1 binds about 3,300 genomic sites at a highly specific decameric consensus sequence, mainly governing basal cellular functions. We now show that in embryonic stem (ES) cells Prep1 binding pattern only partly overlaps that of the embryo trunk, with about 2,000 novel sites, highlighting a change of targets between embryonic differentiated v. embryonic stem cells. RNA-seq identifies about 1800 genes down-regulated in Prep1- /- ES cells which belong to gene ontology categories not enriched in the E11.5 Prep1i/i differentiated embryo, including in particular the Wnt and Fgf pathways. Indeed, we find aberrant Wnt and Fgf expression levels in the Prep1-/- ES cells which agrees with a deficient embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiation. Re-establishment of the Prep1 level rescues the phenotype.

DESIGN
[ChIP-Seq] Examination of genome-wide Prep1 binding in mouse ES cells using ChIP-seq and Illumina GAII sequencing. [RNA-Seq] Examination of gene expression in wild type and Prep1-/- mouse ES cells using RNA-seq and Illumina GAII sequencing.
