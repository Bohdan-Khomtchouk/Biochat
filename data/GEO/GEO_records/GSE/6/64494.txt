TITLE
Differential gene regulation by the disease-associated short isoform of GATA1 (microarray)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional activiy of GATA1s was compared to GATA1 through gene expression analysis in a cell line model with both erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation.

DESIGN
G1ME cells were derived from Gata1- mouse ES cells and have both megakaryocyte and erythrocyte differentiation potential upon reconstitution of GATA-1 expression (Stachura 2006).  HA-tagged full length or short GATA-1 were expressed in G1ME cells grown in TPO via retroviral transductions.  The cells were sorted for GFP positivity 68 hours post-transduction and then were allowed to recover in normal growth medium for 4h.  Total RNA was then isolated using RNeasy kit from Qiagen 72 hours post-transduction.
