TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver tumor-initiating cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Goal and objectives: To study the requirement of HCV viral proteins and/or environmental factors (such as alcohol or obesity) in synergistic liver caner development in HCV Core or NS5A Tg mice given alcohol or high-cholesterol high-fat diet, mice were fed alcohol or high-cholesterol high-fat diet and liver tissues from these mice were examined for gene profiles.  Alcohol or obesity contributes to synergistic tumor incidence and HCV Core or Ns5a-induced effects.  Thus, analysis of gene profiling of these transgenic mice will identify the critical pathways to induce synergistic tumor formation caused by alcohol or obesity.

DESIGN
Liver samples for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain gene profiling data in order to increase understanding the pathways. To perform gene array and proteomic analyses, mice were fed alcohol or high-cholesterol high-fat for 12 months and euthanized after 12 months feeding. Livers were collected at the time of euthanasia.
