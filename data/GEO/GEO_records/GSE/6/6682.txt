TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana small RNAs sequences identified using high-throughput 454 sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine the extent to which the major small RNA pathways functions across the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, small RNA populations from several tissues of wild-type (wt) and mutant plants were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced using high-throughput 454 sequencing technology. Keywords: small RNAs, high-throughput sequencing
