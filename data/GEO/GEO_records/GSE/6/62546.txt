TITLE
Quantitative mRNA expression comparison of Hepatitis C Virus replicon (2a) on Huh7.5 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed transcriptome expression assisted non-directed proteome profiling (TEAnDPP) method to investigate host-pathogen interaction. Analysis of HCV replicon induced host-cell metabolism perturbation at gene expression level. Gene enrichment analysis on DEG revealed disulfide formation related genes were significantly enriched. Based on this observation, we addminitrated thiol reactive chemical probes to visualize reactive thiol profile in live cell, and observed unique reactivity profile. Using SILAC-based quantitative profiling method, we identified 26 proteins that are labeled by iodoacetamide probes. Among these proteins, we discovered t-plastin was upregulated in APC140 cells, and its knock-down experiment showed significant HCV replication inhibition effect. In short, TEAnDPP strategy demonstrated its usefulness in host-pathogen interaction study for HCV infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from APC140 (stable cell line expressing HCV2a replicon) was compared to vehicle cell line (Huh7.5).
