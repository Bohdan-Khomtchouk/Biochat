TITLE
Transcriptional responses to i.v. administered I-131 in various mouse normal tissues underlie diurnal variation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian rhythm study on transcriptional responses to i.v. administered 90 kBq iodine-131 after 24h in mouse kidney cortex and medulla, liver, lungs, spleen, and thyroid. Female BALB/c nude mice (n=4/group) were i.v. injected with 90 kBq 131I at three different times of day, i.e. at 9.00 am, at 12.00 pm, or at 3.00 pm, and killed under anesthesia after 24h following treatment for excision of organs. For each time of day, a control group (n=3-4/group) was i.v. injected with physiol. saline. The kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, and thyroid were excised, flash-frozen, and stored at -80Â°C until extraction of total RNA. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue samples and subjected to expression analysis using RNA microarray technology.

DESIGN
The study consisted of 6 groups in total, i.e. 3 groups (n=4/group) that were i.v. injected with 90 kBq 131I (at 9.00 am, 12.00 pm, or 3.00 pm) and 3 sham-treated control groups (n=3-4/group) that were i.v. injected with physiol. saline (at 9.00 am, 12.00 pm, or 3.00 pm); please note that the number of control animals varied between 3-4 animals per group, i.e. n=4 treated at 9.00 am, n=3 treated at 12.00 pm, and n=3 treated at 3.00 pm. Six tissues were analyzed per animal, i.e. kidney cortex, kidney medulla, liver, lungs, spleen, and thyroid.
