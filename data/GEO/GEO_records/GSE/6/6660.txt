TITLE
fiber transformation without CaMK pathway in electric-stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression profiles of day 3 of in vitro cultured FDB fibers with or without slow-fiber-type pattern of electrical stimulation, with inhibition of CaMK signaling pathways(KN93 or KN62), with amplified RNA (cRNA probes). ----CaMK inhibition (KN93): GSM154001, GSM154002, GSM154003, GSM154004, GSM154025, and GSM154026. ----CaMK inhibition (KN62)GSM154027, GSM154028, GSM154029, GSM154030, GSM154031, and GSM154032. ----Negative control (KN92): GSM154033, GSM154034, GSM154035, GSM154036, GSM154037, and GSM154038.
