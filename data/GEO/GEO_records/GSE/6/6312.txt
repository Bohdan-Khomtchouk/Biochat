TITLE
Genome wide mapping of transcription factor downstream targets using STAGE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying the chromosomal targets of transcription factors is important for reconstructing the transcriptional regulatory networks underlying global gene expression programs. We have developed an unbiased genomic method called sequence tag analysis of genomic enrichment (STAGE) to identify the direct binding targets of transcription factors in vivo. STAGE is based on high-throughput sequencing of concatemerized tags derived from target DNA enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We optimized the STAGE protocol and developed analysis methods to allow the identification of transcription factor targets in human cells. We used STAGE to identify targets of human transcription factors c-myc and STAT1. STAGE provides a means of identifying the chromosomal targets of DNA-associated proteins in any sequenced genome.
