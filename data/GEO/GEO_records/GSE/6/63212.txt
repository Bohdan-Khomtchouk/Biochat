TITLE
Murine hindlimb tissue: ischemic vs. control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unilateral femoral artery occlusion (right side) and a sham operation on the contralateral (left) side was performed in C57BL/6J mice under anesthesia by double ligation of the superficial femoral artery proximal to the deep femoral artery and distal femoral artery. Animal numbers are stated with the different experimental results. Total RNA was isolated from the distal adductor muscles by phenol-chloroform isolation (TRIzol, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at baseline and at 5 time points after femoral artery ligation (6h, 24h, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days) from 5 mice per time point. RNA was pooled in equal amounts, and microarray analysis for all identified murine miRNAs (miRBase 9.0) was performed by a service provider (LC Sciences, Houston, TX).

DESIGN
11 condition experiment. Biological replicates: 5 per condition, 5 pooled RNA replicates per array.
