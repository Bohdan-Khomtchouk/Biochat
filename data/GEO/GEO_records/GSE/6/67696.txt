TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for colonic lamina propria DCs of CD300a deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to CD300a deficiency on dendritic cells (DCs) in colonic lamina propria, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish CD300a deficiency on DCs in colonic lamina propria from those of WT mice.  Colonic lamina propria DCs were obtained by cell sorter from WT and CD300a deficient mice raised under SPF and GF condition. Expression of Ifnb1 was significantly higher in CD300a deficient DCs, quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Gene expression in WT and CD300a colonic lamina propria DCs raised under SPF and GF conditions were measured.  Colonic lamina propria cells were obtained from 5 mice in each conditions. Takara-Bio
