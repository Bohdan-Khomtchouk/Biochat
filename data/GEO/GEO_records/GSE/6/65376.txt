TITLE
Absence of heterozygosity due to template switching during replicative rearrangements [Agilent-043871 9q_others]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the size, genomic extent and gene content of complex rearrangements involving  chromosome 9q

DESIGN
To determine size, genomic extent and gene content for each rearrangement, we used a customized tiling-path oligonucleotide microarray spanning the entire chromosomal region of chromosome 9 long arm. A 4X180K Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) microarray was designed using the Agilent e-array website.
