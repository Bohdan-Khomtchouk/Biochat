TITLE
Two time-points for fertilized rice leaves in Tsukuba field in 2013

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We have previously demonstrated statistical modeling of gene expression under various environmental factors using field transcriptome data obtained from samples grown in a paddy field at Tsukuba, Japan. In this seires of experiments, we would like to improve the models for practical use. In order to do that, we have done field transcriptome assay in seven paddy fields at different sites in Japan (or, Sappro, Furukawa, Toyama, Tsukuba, Takatsuki, Furukawa, and Fukuoka). This data is from one of the places, Tsukuba. Time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf of fertilization in Tsukuba field in 2013. This experiment was performed to analyze the dynamics of field transcriptome data.

DESIGN
The submitted samples were field transcirptome data in a paddy field at Tsukuba in Japan. Leaf samples were harvested in a 6 hr(or 8hr)-interval for 13 times. This set corresponds to three-day time-seires data. Transplanting dates varied as reported in each sample record. The fertilizated rice leaves were collected at 10:40 and 16:40 with no replicate. Fertilizated rice leaves were collected at 10:40 and 16:40 with no replicate.
