TITLE
Transcriptional comparison between whole kidneys from E14.5 Wnt4 mutants and wildtype mice (MG_U74Av2 platform). (GUDMAP Series ID: 7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our laboratory's interest is in understanding the molecular principles that underlie the regional organization of the mammalian metanephric kidney. Our goal is to generate a detailed spatial map of the cellular expression of selected regulatory genes during mammalian kidney development.  The goal of this study is to identify a population of genes that are enriched in the renal vesicle (RV) and its derivatives using Wnt4 mutants. Keywords: mutant comparison
