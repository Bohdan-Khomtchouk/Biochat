TITLE
Gene expression profiles in livers with conditional knock out of autophagy related protein 7 (Atg7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression array analysis of mice livers with conditional deletion of autophagy related protein 7 (Atg7). Whole RNA from mice livers of 2 month old control (Atg7 FF), Olig1-CRE:Atg7 FF (conditional deletion in hepatocytes) and Alb-CRE:Atg7 FF (conditional deletion in hepatocytes/cholangiocytes) were analyzed. The results provide insight into the gene expression profile and role of autophagy in hepatocytes or hepatocytes/cholangiocytes in hepatic growth regulation and hepatocarcinogenesis.

DESIGN
total RNA isolated from whole livers of 2 month old mice (Atg7 FF, Olig1-CRE:Atg7 FF, Alb-CRE:Atg7 FF mice).
