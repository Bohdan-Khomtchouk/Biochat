Yeast magnesium starvation, 90 minutes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To learn about the cellular processes involved in Mg2+ transport and the mechanisms allowing cells to cope with low Mg2+ availability, we performed RNA expression profiling experiments, and followed changes in gene activity upon Mg2+ depletion on a genome-wide scale. A striking portion of genes up-regulated under Mg2+ depletion is also induced by high Ca2+ and/or alkalinization. Among the genes significantly up-regulated by Mg2+ starvation, Ca2+ stress and alkalinization are ENA1 (encoding a P-type ATPase sodium pump) and PHO89 (encoding a sodium/phosphate cotransporter). We show that up-regulation of these genes is dependent on the calcineurin/Crz1p signaling pathway. Similarly to Ca2+ stress, Mg2+ starvation induces translocation of the transcription factor Crz1p from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The up-regulation of ENA1 and PHO89 upon Mg2+ starvation depends on extracellular Ca2+. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy we demonstrate that removal of Mg2+ results in an immediate increase in free cytoplasmic Ca2+. This effect is dependent on external Ca2+. Results presented indicate that Mg2+ depletion in yeast cells leads to enhanced cellular Ca2+ concentrations, which activate the Crz1p/calcineurin pathway. We provide evidence that calcineurin/Crz1p signaling is crucial for yeast cells to cope with Mg2+ depletion stress. Keywords: stress response (magnesium starvation)
