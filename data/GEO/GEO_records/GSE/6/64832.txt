TITLE
UTX inhibition as selective epigenetic therapy against TAL1-driven T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-Seq in Jurkat T-ALL cells to identify UTX binding sites across the genome. We then compared UTX binding sites (this study) with  TAL1 binding sites (Data from Palii, 2011 GSE25000), and found a high degree of overlap between TAL1 and UTX in Jurkat T-All cells. Indeed, over 80% of TAL1 binding sites overlap with UTX.

DESIGN
Using ChIP-Seq, we identified UTX binding across the genome in Jurkat T-ALL cells. We then compared the binding sites of UTX and TAL1 (Data from Palii, 2011 GSE25000).
