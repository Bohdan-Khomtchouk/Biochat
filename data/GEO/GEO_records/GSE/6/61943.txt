TITLE
Expression of miRNAs in human colorectal carcinoma cells upon autophagy induction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profile of miRNAs during the response of human colon cancer cells (HT29s) to 5-FU treatment and nutrient starvation was examined using miRNA microarray analysis. Combining with the following real time PCR and bioinformatics analysis, the physiological importance of the miRNA-autophagy interconnection is far more likely to be elucidated.
