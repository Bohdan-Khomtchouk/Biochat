TITLE
RNAi of TbNMD3 in procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei lines

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei brucei

SUMMARY
A procyclic form Trypansome brucei RNAi line (PTT parental line, transfected with pALC14 incorporating a TbNMD3 gene fragment) capable of inducing depletion of TbNMD3 was analysed for mRNA expression by RNAseq

DESIGN
Cells were grown for 72 hours in culture; RNAi was induced in cells by the addition of 1 microgram/ml of tetracycline
