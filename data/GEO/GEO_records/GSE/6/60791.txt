TITLE
Gene expression profiles of erythroid progenitors treated with vehicle or the HDAC1/2-selective inhibitor ACY-957

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determine the effects of HDAC1/2-selective chemical inhibtion on the gene expression profiles of erythroid progenitors derived from human CD34+ bone marrow cells.

DESIGN
CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow of healthy normal donors were cultured in a 2-phase system. This system has been described previously (Sankaran, Menne et al. 2008).  Cells were expanded for 7 days in expansion media, followed by an additional 5 days culture in erythroid differentiation media in the presence of vehicle or ACY-957 (an HDAC1/2-selective inhibitor). Experiments were conducted in triplicate for each condition.  Each replicate experiment utilized cells from different donors.
