TITLE
Genome-wide DNase-seq profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (W303 strain)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Intact nuclei from an asynchronous population of W303 Saccharomyces cerevisiae in log-phase growth were subjected to a 16-minute DNase I digestion (0.1 U/μL) at 37 °C.  DNA was then recovered, and single-end Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the Crawford DNase-seq method (Song and Crawford, 2010).

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of DNase-seq were sequenced in single-end mode on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.
