TITLE
Expression data from Rhesus macaques (Macaca fuscata) brain

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Japanese macaques learn to use rakes to acquire food, and this learning is associated with rapid electrophysiological and morphological changes in the brain. To examine the molecular mechanisms of these plastic changes, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis with a cDNA microarray and identified many candidate genes.
