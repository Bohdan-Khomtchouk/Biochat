TITLE
Chronic haloperidol effects on gene expression in mouse [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluate the effects of chronic administration of antipsychotic haloperidol versus placebo in male, 8-week old, C57BL/6J mice. We used microarray to study gene expression changes after haloperidol treatment in mouse brain and liver

DESIGN
We examined whole brain from 20 mice (10 haloperidol-treated mice, 10 placebo-treated mice) and liver from 18 mice (9 haloperidol-treated, 9 placebo-treated) after 30 days of haloperidol treatment with slow-release pellets.
