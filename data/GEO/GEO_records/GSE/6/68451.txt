TITLE
MicroRNA data in the mouse liver at 48 hrs versus 0 hr post 70% partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs have been reported to control liver regeneration though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in the mouse liver at 48 hrs versus 0 hr post 70% partial hepatectomy.
