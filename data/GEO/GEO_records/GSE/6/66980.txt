TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana Growth is Negatively Regulated by the Class III Peroxidase AtPrx71 during Development and in Response to Cell Wall Damage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The cell wall is a crucial structure in plant cells, and modifications in its composition often have a major impact on growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of cell wall alterations on plant growth are largely unknown. It was previously shown that a reduction in the levels of de-esterified homogalacturonan, a major pectin component of cell walls, in Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing a fungal polygalacturonase or mutated in the QUASIMODO2 gene (qua2-1 plants), cause severe growth defects. Here we show that the class III peroxidase AtPrx71 is strongly up-regulated in these plants, as well as in response to alterations of other wall structural components, including treatments the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxaben. Analysis of atprx71 loss-of-function mutants and of plants overexpressing AtPrx71 indicates that this gene negatively affects Arabidopsis growth at different stages of development. Furthermore, lack of AtPrx71 partially suppresses the dwarf phenotype of qua2-1, suggesting that this protein contributes to the growth defects observed in plants undergoing cell wall damage. AtPrx71 appears to promote the production of reactive oxygen species in qua2-1 plants, as well as in plants treated with isoxaben. We propose that production of reactive oxygen species mediated by AtPrx71 negatively regulates Arabidopsis growth both during physiological development and in response to loss of cell wall integrity.

DESIGN
