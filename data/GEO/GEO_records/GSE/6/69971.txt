TITLE
aCGH in paired blood/tumor samples in Wilms Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array CGH analysis of paired blood and tumor DNA samples from 14 patients with sporadic Wilms tumor. Previously array CGH studies in WT have only been performed in tumor tissue samples. We herein describe a novel set of constitutional abnormalities and point to candidate genes that might be associated with WT development.

DESIGN
28 paired DNA samples of peripheral blood/fresh tumor tissue from 14 patients (10 males, 4 females) with histologically confirmed WT. All tumor samples were collected from primary tumors from patients treated with the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy following the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) WT 2001 trial protocol.
