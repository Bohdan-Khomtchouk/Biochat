TITLE
Expression data from mice CD11c circulating T lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD11c T cells remain an unknown cell population. Among up regulated genes related to the specific immune responseof CD11c T cells we aimed to detect adhesion molecules, chemokines receptors and other molecules associated with migration to genital tract. We used microarrays to detail the global set of gene expression underlying CD11c T cells and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes that distinct this cell population.

DESIGN
Circulating TEM cells were sorted from three female mice. Blood samples (≈500µl) were immediately lysed using a RBC lysis buffer. Each sample was sorted into two subsets, CD3+ CD62L- CD44High CD11c+ and CD3+ CD62L- CD44High CD11c-.  Total RNA from each of the six samples was analyzed with an individual Affymetrix  HT MG-430 PM Strip Array. Thus the study compared CD11c positive versus CD11c negative T cells, 3 paired sample sets each derived from one of the three different individual mice.
