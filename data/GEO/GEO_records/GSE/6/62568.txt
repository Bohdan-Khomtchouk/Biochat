TITLE
Control of breast cancer cell migration by a p63-regulated signaling network (RNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through analysis of a high-content screen we discovered that mir-203 can impair cell migration by suppressing p63 expression.  We further determined that p63 promotes motility by inducing the expression of multiple target genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA  isolated from cell lines with different rated of motility was compared.
