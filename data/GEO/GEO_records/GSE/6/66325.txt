TITLE
microRNA expression signatures for human primary NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined miRNA profiles of human NK cells from different cell compartments (peripheral blood, cord blood, and uterine deciduas) and of NKT and T cells from peripheral blood, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated microRNAs in different human NK cells.

DESIGN
For the microarray assay, RNAs from 6 donors with equal amount were pooled together to get each cell sample.
