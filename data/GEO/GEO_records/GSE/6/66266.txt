TITLE
Expression profling of Arabidopsis  sto2 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
STO2 is a novel MYB like protein which belongs to one of the most important transcription factors in planta. Microarray analysis of sto2 null mutant compared to Columbia with three-week-old soil-grown plants revealed that STO2 function in ABA and salt stress response.

DESIGN
To find the potantial downstream target of STO2 protein, microarray was performed and samples from expanding rosette leaves (from 3th to 6th leaves) of three-week-old soil-grown sto2 mutant plants with those of wild-type were collected. Both Wild-type (Col-0) and sto2 null mutant have three biological replicates, respectively.
