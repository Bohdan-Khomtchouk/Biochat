TITLE
Comparison of Renal Gene Expression from Dahl Salt-Sensitive (S) and the Renal Protective S.SHR(2) Congenic Strain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The study sought to investigate differences in onset and progression of renal disease in the Dahl salt-sensitive (S), S.SHR(2) congenic, and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) using a time-course. The data clearly demonstrates that the locus on chromosome 2 has a major and sustained ability to attenuate renal damage. As early as week 4, significant interstitial changes were observed between the S and the congenic which preceded any significant difference in proteinuria. Gene expression profiling was performed at week 4, 12, and 20 using kidney from the S and S.SHR(2) congenic to: (1) identify expression differences of positional candidates within the QTL region; (2) correlate temporal gene expression changes between the S and congenic with degree of renal damage; and (3) identify biochemical pathways potentially involved in the attenuated renal damaged observed in the congenic.  Gene pathway analysis (IngenuityÂ® Systems) performed at week 4, 12, and 20 revealed that pathways involved in cellular assembly and organization, cellular movement, and immune response were controlled differently between the S and congenic. Considering all the data, the chromosome 2 congenic appears to attenuate renal damage primarily through an altered fibrotic response. Keywords: time course
