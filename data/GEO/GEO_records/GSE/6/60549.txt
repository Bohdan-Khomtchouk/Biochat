TITLE
Regulation of Activation-Associated Transcripts Accumulation Rates during Monocyte-to-Macrophage Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled macrophage activation-associated transcripts using TaqMan assays in a Fluidigm 48.48 Gene Expression Array to identify transcripts with expression levels that were affected by differences in culturing conditions during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation.

DESIGN
48 samples: 12 sample types for 4 different human donors
