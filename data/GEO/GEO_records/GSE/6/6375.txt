TITLE
E2F4 and Myc ChIP-chip perfomed on Nimblegen hg17 ENCODE arrays

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
Identifying the chromosomal targets of transcription factors is important for reconstructing the transcriptional regulatory networks underlying global gene expression programs. ChIP-chip is a powerful technique to map chromosomal targets of transcription factors. We applied ChIP-chip to map downstream targets of the transcription factor E2F4 and c-Myc. E2F4 is a member of the E2F family of transcriptional regulators that functions as a repressor in quiescent and early G1 cells. c-Myc is a oncogenic transcription factor implicated in almost all aspects of tumorigenesis. We mapped E2F4 and c-Myc binding sites in 1% of the human genome using Nimblegen hg17 ENCODE arrays. Keywords: ChIP-chip
