TITLE
Transcriptional analysis between Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and a mutant altered in antibiotic production

ORGANISM
Streptomyces clavuligerus

SUMMARY
The objective was to analyze the differential expression between the wild strain and the Streptomyces clavuligerus  ΔclaR::aac mutant

DESIGN
Six experimental conditions were assayed, two strains (Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064, S. clavuligerus  ΔclaR::aac) in three culture times (22.5h, 46.5h and 60 h). Two biological replicates for each condition.
