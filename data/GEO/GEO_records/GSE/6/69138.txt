TITLE
Epigenome analysis of ischemic stroke patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide methylation study in whole-blood DNA from 404 ischemic stroke patient cohort, distributed across 3 ischemic stroke subtypes: Large-artery atherosclerosis (n=132), Small-artery disease (n=141) and Cardio embolic (n=127) . Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 404 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array
