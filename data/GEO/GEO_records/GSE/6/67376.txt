TITLE
Transcriptional analyses of mandarins seriously infected by “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus”

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
HLB is suggested to be caused by the phloem-limited fastidious prokaryotic α-proteobacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter spp.” Previous studies focused on the proteome and transcriptome analyses of citrus 5 to 35-week-after “Ca. L. spp.” inoculation. In this study, gene expression profiles was analyzed using mandarin of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. jiaogan leaves after 2-year infection with “Ca. L. asiaticus”.
