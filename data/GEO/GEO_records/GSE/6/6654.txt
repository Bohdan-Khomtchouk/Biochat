TITLE
slow/fast muscle with or without amplification

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the gene expression profiles of slow and fast skeletal muscle (soleus VS FDB) with either amplified RNA (cRNA probes) or original mRNA (cDNA probes). The fidelity of mRNA amplification method in identifying the gene expression profiles of our samples were validated. Keywords: cell type comparison
