TITLE
Influence of osmopriming on rape seeds germination

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic study of the impact of osmopriming on rape seeds (Brassica napus L.; cv 'Libomir') during priming process and after germination. The assays were replicated twice on two independent priming and germination experiments. Seeds were osmoprimed in PEG solution (-1.2 MPa osmotic potential) during 7 days, dried to initial  moisture content and then germinated for 7 hours on water. The analysis during different phases of priming procedure (soaking and drying), after whole osmopriming process and germination were done.

DESIGN
10 samples, four condition experiment; non dried primed seeds (Pnd) vs. dry unprimed seeds (UPd) (PEG soaking), non dried primed seeds (Pnd) vs dry primed seeds (Pd) (drying after soaking), dry primed seeds (Pd) vs. dry unprimed seeds (UPd) (full osmopriming process), primed seeds imbibed on water (P7h) vs unprimed seeds imbibed on water (UP7h) (germination after osmopriming). Biological replicates: 2 replicates for comparison PEG soaking, drying after soaking, full osmopriming process and germination after osmopriming.
