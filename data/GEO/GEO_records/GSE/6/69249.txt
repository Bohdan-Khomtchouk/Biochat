TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of enzalutamide- and/or olaparib-responsive gene expression in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of enzalutamide- and/or olaparib-responsive gene expression in prostate cancer cells. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that enzalutamide influences the expression of genes that are involved in important bioprocesses in prostate cance rcells, including DNA damage response genes and this effect may synergize with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in cytotoxicity to prstate cancer cells.

DESIGN
prostate cancer cells were pretreated with enzalutamide or vehicle control DMSO for 24 h, followed by treatment with enzalutamide, olaparib, enzalutamide+olaparib, or vehicle control DMSO for 48 h. Gene expression in enzalutamide+olaparib-treated cells was compared with taht in vehicle control- and single agent-treated cells.
