SUMMARY
E.coli K-12 W3110 was grown in LB medium and harvested at each time point. And time series microarray experiments were performed based on reference desgin. In reference design, the control sample is collected at one representative time point. Combining with data from sequential design, more acculate and reliable expression series could be collected. Keywords: Reference design
