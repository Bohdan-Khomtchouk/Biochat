TITLE
Comprehensive Epigenomic Analysis Reveals Dynamic Regulatory Programs Of Blood Development (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic hematopoiesis is regulated by the coordinated interaction between transcription factors and the epigenetic regulators driving developmental-stage specific gene expression but how this process drives hematopoietic specification and terminal differentiation is poorly understood. Here we generated RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq and ChIP-Seq data for histone marks and transcription factors from ES-cell derived purified cells representing six sequential stages of blood cell specification and differentiation. Our data reveal the binding patterns of specific transcription factors involved in the priming and maintenance of distal elements and inform how binding impacts on promoter activity. Functional studies based on these data uncovered a previously unrecognised role for Hippo signalling in mammalian hematopoietic specification. Finally, we present a dynamic core regulatory network model for hematopoiesis and demonstrate its utility for the design of reprogramming experiments. Our study represents a powerful resource for studying hematopoiesis and demonstrates how such data can advance our understanding of mammalian development.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data of histone modifications and transcription factors, and RNA-seq data obtained from purified cells representing five sequential stages of murine blood cell specification and differentiation. In the expression cufflink file linked at the bottom of the Series record, there is processed data for a HE Sample, extensively used in this study, but has been uploaded previously in Series GSE55310.
