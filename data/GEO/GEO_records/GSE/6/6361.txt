TITLE
Genome position and gene amplification - expressional profiling of methotrexate resistant colonies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the influence of genome position on propensity to amplify. First, we integrated a mutant form of DHFR into different positions in the human genome, challenged cells with methotrexate and then studied the genomic alterations arising in drug resistant cells. We observed site specific differences in methotrexate sensitivity, organization of amplicons and amplification frequency. One site was uniquely associated with a significantly enhanced propensity to amplify and recurrent amplicon boundaries, possibly implicating a rare folate sensitive fragile site in initiating amplification. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns and subsequent gene enrichment analysis revealed two clusters differing significantly in expression of MYC target genes independent of integration site. Keywords: Gene amplification, array CGH, chromosomal fragile sites
