TITLE
Aberrant hematopoiesis in Dnmt2 mutant mice [HTS 1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow samples from Dnmt2-/- and wildtype mice were used to identify differentially tRNA fragment expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Ambion). RNA were end-repaired with T4 PNK. Small RNA libraries were performed according to the protocol using NEB NEXT Small RNA library Prep Set for Illumina (Multiplex Compatible) E7330, and size-selected (120-170 base pairs) before sequencing.
