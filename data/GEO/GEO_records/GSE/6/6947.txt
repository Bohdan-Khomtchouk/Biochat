TITLE
Hepatopancreatic multi-transcript expression patterns in the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus during the molt cycle

ORGANISM
Cherax quadricarinatus

SUMMARY
Variations of hepatopancreatic transcript expression related to induced molt cycle were identified in male Cherax quadricarinatus using a cDNA microarray estimated to contain 2180 unique sequences. Molt induction was performed by X-organ sinus gland extirpation or by repeated 20-hydroxyecdysone injections. Manipulated males were sacrificed at premolt or early postmolt and a reference population at intermolt. Their isolated hepatopancreatic mRNA was hybridized onto the microarray and differentially-expressed genes were identified, sequenced, and annotated. Clusters of similarly expressed transcripts, in correlation with the four combinations of induction methods and molt stages were identified, containing both known and novel genes. Biologically interesting clusters were characterized by general shift of expression throughout premolt and early postmolt vs. intermolt, or by different premolt vs. postmolt expression. Several genes were differentially expressed in 20-hydroxyecdysone injected crayfish vs. X-organ sinus gland extirpated ones. Keywords: Physiological state analysis
