TITLE
Differentially expressed gene profiles before and after the ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with ovarian endometriomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To detect the differentially expressed genes and subsequently identify disease-related signatures and potential biomarkers for patients with ovarian endometriomas in the serum before and 3 months after the ultrasound-guided ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with ovarian endometriomas. we have employed the KangChen Bio-technology Corp. NimbleGen Human Gene Expression Microarray 12x135K. Among these, six genes showed statistical significance including IL6, CD36, JUNB, B4GALT1, HES1, and NR4A1, which were also validated by qPCR analysis.

DESIGN
The gene expression in human blood was measured before and 3 months after the ultrasound-guided ethanol sclerotherapy in the same patients with ovarian endometriomas.
