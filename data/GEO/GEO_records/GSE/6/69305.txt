TITLE
Gene expression profile of Trichophyton rubrum growth on protein substrates

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcription profile of germinant conidia growth on protein substrates to widen the knowledge about relevant genes for pathogenecity, and also it was verified an encoding gene of adhesin like protein, which was modulated during the growth of T. rubrum on keratin.

DESIGN
About 2.6 x 106 conidia/  mL solution was prepared from T. rubrum growth on Sabouraud for 15 days. The solution was inoculated in Cove's medium with nitrate and glucose (control), Cove's medium with 0.25% of elastin, and Cove's medium with 0.5% of keratin. These conditions were incubated for 24h, 36h and 72h.  Two independent experiments were performed for each condition.
