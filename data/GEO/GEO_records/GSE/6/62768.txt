TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of pigs exhibiting differential susceptibility to swine influenza (SIV) pathology in the lung

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in the lungs of pigs classified as Resistant (RES) or Susceptible (SUS) to influenza pathology based on clinical lesion scores. The aim of the experiment is to identify genes whose expression is associated with resistance/susceptibility to influenza pathology. These are a subset of animals selected from a larger experiment that investigated the effect of low (LBW) or high (HBW) litter birth weight phenotype on influenza pathology.

DESIGN
A two condition experiment: lung tissue RNA from RES and SUS SIV-infected pigs. 6 biological replicates for each condition, each hybridized with a reference to separate arrays. 12 arrays in total.
