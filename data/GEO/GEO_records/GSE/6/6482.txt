TITLE
mECK36: a cell and animal model of virally induced Kaposi's sarcoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transfection of a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) herpesvirus (KSHV) Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (KSHVBac36) into mouse bone marrow endothelial lineage cells generated a cell (mECK36) that induced KS-like tumors in mice. mECK36 formed KSHV-harboring vascularized spindle-cell sarcomas that were LANA+ and displayed a KSHV and host transcriptomes reminiscent of KS tumors. Keywords: Cell type comparison
