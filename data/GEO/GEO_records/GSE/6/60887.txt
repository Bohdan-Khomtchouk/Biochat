TITLE
gene expression profiles in KRAS mutant A549 cells after BI-2536 and fasudil combination treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the potential mechanisms of enhanced activity of combined inhibition of PLK1 and ROCK, we conducted a microarray analysis on gene expression profiles in KRAS mutant A549 cells. We used Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression array to  detail gene expression after indicated treatments and identified  the molecular mechanism during this process to facilitate further studies.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with vehicle control, BI-2536 (4 nM), fasudil (20 ÂµM), or the combination of BI-2536 and fasudil for 6 h. Samples were obtained from three independent biological replicates.RNA from each sample was labeled and hybridized using Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression array.
