TITLE
Global methylation alterations in Dnmt3aKO derived malignancies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test the long-term effects of lack of Dnmt3a on mouse HSCs, we established a cohort of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Dnmt3a-KO or WT HSC control cells. Dnmt3a deletion in purified HSCs transplanted alone leads to an array of hematologic disorders that models the spectrum of disorders seen in human malignancies. We investigated DNA methylation alterations in disease and control mice by RRBS. We generated an average of 23.81 million reads per sample (18.97 - 31.67 million) of which an average of 18.07 million could be mapped to the mm9 genome (2.78 - 26.42 million). We achieved an average CpG coverage depth of 31.79-fold (8.09 - 47.44-fold) and average bisulfite conversion efficiency of 99.91% (99.87 - 99.95%).

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of cells using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500
