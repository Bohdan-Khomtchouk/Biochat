TITLE
Widespread association between YAP/TAZ/TEAD and AP-1 at enhancers drives oncogenic growth [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify YAP/TAZ direct transcriptional targets and transcriptional partners, through ChIP-sequencing and gene expression profiling. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells growing at low confluence in standard growth conditions were transfected with the indicated siRNAs (Dupont et al., Nature 2011). The following day, growth medium was renewed and cells were incubated for 24 more hours, and then harvested for total RNA extraction. 4 independent biological replicates were plated, transfected and harvested in parallel for each siRNA. Raw .CEL files are the same as in GSE59230 (Enzo et al., EMBO J 2015), but gene expression levels have been quantified using Brainarray HGU133Plus2_Hs_ENTREZG_v17 custom chip definition files.
