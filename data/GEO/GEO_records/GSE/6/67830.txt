TITLE
Spinal gene expression signature in male wistar rats exposed to repeated psychological stress

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To test the effect of chronic water avoidance stress on spinal gene expression profile in male wistar rats.

DESIGN
Lumbar spinal cord samples were freshly isolated from rats exposed to daily water avoidance stress for 10 consecutive days. Samples were collected 24 hours after the last stressors.
