TITLE
Transcript profiles in longissimus dorsi muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue: A comparison of pigs with different post-weaning growth rates.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa domesticus

SUMMARY
The objective of this experiment was to use transcriptional profiling of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to develop a better understanding of the metabolic basis for poor weaned-pig transition. A total of 1,054 pigs were reared in commercial conditions and weighed at birth, weaning, and 3 weeks post- weaning. Transition average daily gain (tADG) was calculated as the average daily gain for the 3-week period post-weaning. Nine pigs from each of the lowest 10th percentile (low tADG) and the 60th-70th percentile (high tADG) were harvested at 3 weeks post-weaning. Differential expression analysis was conduced in both tissues using RNA-Seq methodology

DESIGN
mRNA profiling in two different tissues (skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) harvested at 3 weeks post-weaning
