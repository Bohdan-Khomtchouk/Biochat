TITLE
Whole genome expression microarray analysis in quadriceps of wild-type and NF90-NF45 double transgenic mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The complex of NF90 and NF45 is known to participate in transcriptional regulation, mRNA stabilization and microRNA biogenesis in vitro. However, the physiological function of the NF90-NF45 complex is still unclear. To elucidate its functions, we generated NF90-NF45 double transgenic (dbTg) mice. Robust expression of NF90 and NF45 was detected in skeletal muscle. As mentioned above, NF90-NF45 complex is involved in regulation of genes via transcription and RNA metabolism. To identify genes regulated by NF90-NF45, we performed comprehensive analyses of mRNA expression in quadriceps of wild-type (WT) and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profile in quadriceps comparing WT and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice.
