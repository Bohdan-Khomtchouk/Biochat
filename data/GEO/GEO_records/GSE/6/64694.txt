TITLE
Root-shoot mineral transport as a key target processes involved in Arabidopsis responsiveness to elevated [CO2] conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study we explain the physiological, biochemical and gene expression mechanisms adopted by nitrate-fed Arabidopsis thaliana plants growing under elevated [CO2], highlighting the importance of root-to-shoot interactions in these responses The transcriptomic approach (conducted at the root and shoot level) revealed that exposure to 800 ppm [CO2] conditioned the expression of genes involved in the transport of nitrate and mineral elements.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia 0 ecotype (col 0) plants grown under hydroponic conditions. The nitrogen (N) source was KNO3 at 0.75 mM concentration. 5 weeks exposure to CO2 treatments, previous to first flower were buds visible (see Supplemental Figure 1 for the image of the plants), in 3.9 growth stage ontology from the scale described by Boyes (2001).
