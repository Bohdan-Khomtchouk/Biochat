TITLE
Effects of selection for ethanol preference on gene expression (RNA-Seq) in the nucleus accumbens shell of HS-CC mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nucleus accumbens shell gene expression was assessed by RNA-Seq to determine effects of bidirectional selection for ethanol preference from a highly genetically diverse founder population.  We analyzed the data with both standard methodologies to detect differential expression, and coexpression network changes, and with novel methodologies to detect alternative exon usage, and coordinated splicing pattern changes due to selection.

DESIGN
48 samples of HSCC animals selected for high and low ethanol preference were analyzed (selection generation 4): 24 females (12 High, 12 Low) 24 males (12 High, 12 Low).
