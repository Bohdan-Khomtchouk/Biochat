TITLE
Differential antigen processing by dendritic cell subsets in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) process and present self and foreign antigens to induce tolerance or immunity. In vitro models suggest that induction of immunity is controlled by regulating the presentation of antigen, but little is known about how DCs control antigen presentation in vivo. To examine antigen processing and presentation in vivo we specifically targeted antigens to the two major subsets of DCs using chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Unlike CD8+ DCs that express the cell surface protein CD205, CD8- DCs, which are positive for the 33D1 antigen, are specialized for presentation on MHC class II. This difference in antigen processing is intrinsic to the DC subsets and associated with increased expression of proteins associated with MHC processing. Keywords: cell type comparison of wildtype and Flt3L melonom spleen DCs and splenic B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells
