TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between Nipponbare and 6-4 under two conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Nipponbare performs poorly in phosphorus (P) deficient soil whereas a Nipponbare-derived NIL containing the Pup1 allele of donor parent Kasalath is tolerant to P deficiency. In this experiment we compared gene expression patterns in roots of this NIL to Nipponbare, grown either in a P deficient or P fertilized soil. The aim is to separate constitutive differences in expression from those induced by P deficiency. Keywords: genotype comparison, constitutive differential expression
