TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of post-hatch breast muscle in legacy and modern broiler chickens reveals enrichment of several regulators of myogenic growth

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We report the results of comparative transcriptional profiling in the pectoralis major muscle of a modern production broiler line (Ross 708) and a legacy broiler line inbred since the late 1940s (Illinois) focusing on metabolic differences and differences in myogenic growth regulators

DESIGN
Differential gene expression analysis between Ross 708 and Illinois pectoralis major at two post-hatch time points (D6 and D21) that bracket critical inflection point in the allometric growth characteristics of the muscle
