TITLE
The G1 arrest and maintenance mechanism between the long-term G1-arrested and the G1-arrested cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non mitotic tumor cells are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we found a population that is viable but remains in the G1 phase for an extended period of time (up to 48 h) by Long-term time-lapse observations in Fucci-HCT116 cells and then we conducted DNA microarray-based comparative analyses between the RR (the long-term G1-arrested cells) and R (the G1-arrested cells) fractions, to determine the molecular basis of the G1 arrest/maintenance mechanism. This study is related to GSE34940.

DESIGN
The labeled cRNAs were hybridized on 4X44K v2 Agilent Whole Human Genome dual color Microarrays (G4845A) in two dye swap experiments, resulting in four individual microarrays.
