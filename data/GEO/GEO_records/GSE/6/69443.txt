TITLE
P/CAF mediates Pax3-FKHR dependent oncogenesis in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysing the differential expression of various genes upon knockdown of acetyltransferase P/CAF in Rh31 to identify its targets

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from three scarmble control siRNA and siP/CAF 72 hours post-transfection from Rh30 cells and analysed for the differential expression of genes involved in regulation of proliferation, grwoth, apoptosis and muscle development
