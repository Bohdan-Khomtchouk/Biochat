TITLE
Expression by CD133+ cells isolated from the adult human exocrine pancreas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression from CD133+ cells isolated from adult human exocrine tissue was compared to a CD133-depleted cell population

DESIGN
Islet-depleted exocrine tissue from three independent adult human cadaveric pancreata were cultured for four days in Miami media 1A. Following trypsinization, cells were isolated using anti-CD133 immunomagnetic beads to > 95% CD133+.  CD133-negative cells were further depleted of CD133+ cells to < 1% CD133+.
