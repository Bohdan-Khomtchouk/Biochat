TITLE
SK-NEP-1 treated with LBH589

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wilms tumor (WT) is an embryonic kidney cancer, for which histone acetylation might be a therapeutic target. LBH589, a novel targeted agent, suppresses histone deacetylases in many tumors. This study investigated the antitumor activity of LBH589 in SK-NEP-1 cells. LBH589 inhibited cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1  cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V, Tunel and Hochest 33342 staining analysis showed that LBH589-treated cells showed more apoptotic features compared with the control. LBH589 treatment inhibited the growth of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Arraystar Human LncRNA Array analysis of genes and lncRNas regulated by LBH589 identified 6653 mRNAs and 8135 lncRNAs in LBH589-treated SK-NEP-1 cells. The most enriched gene ontology terms were those involved in nucleosome assembly. KEGG pathway analysis identified cell cycle proteins, including CCNA2, CCNB2, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, CDKN1B and HDAC2, etc. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified important upstream molecules: HIST2H3C, HIST1H4A, HIST1A, HIST1C, HIST1D, Histone H1, Histone H3, RPRM, HSP70 and MYC.

DESIGN
SK-NEP-1 cells were treated with 100nM LBH589 and control group cells were treated with the same volume of DMSO 24 hours later. Human LncRNA Array analysis was performed by KangChen Bio-tech, Shanghai P.R. China. Briefly, RNA purified from total RNA after removal of rRNA was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA and cDNA was labeled and hybridized to the Human LncRNA Array v3.0 (8660 K, Arraystar). 30,586 LncRNAs and 26,109coding transcripts which collected from the most authoritative databases such as RefSeq, UCSC Knowngenes, Ensembl and many related literatures can be detected by the microarray.
