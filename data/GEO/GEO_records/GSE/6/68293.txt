TITLE
Gene expression microarray analysis on the dentate gyrus of alpha-CaMKII HKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously found that mice with heterozygous knockout of the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha-CaMKII HKO mice) show various dysregulated behaviors, including cyclic variations in locomotor activity (LA), suggesting that alpha-CaMKII HKO mice may serve as an animal model showing infradian oscillation of mood. We performed gene expression microarray analysis of dentate gyrus from alpha-CaMKII HKO mice. Mice were selected for the sampling such that their LA levels varied among the mice.

DESIGN
Dentate gyrus RNA isolated from alpha-CaMKII HKO mice.
