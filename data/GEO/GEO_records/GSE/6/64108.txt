TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in Drosophila tissues under Time-restricted Feeding (TRF)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing was used to assess the changes along a diurnal cycle in the transcriptome of Drosophila head, periphery (entire body except the head) or the heart at 3, 5 or 7 weeks of age under ad libitum feeding (ALF) or time-restricted feeding (TRF).

Next generation sequencing was used to assess the changes along a diurnal cycle in the transcriptome of Drosophila head, periphery (entire body except the head) or the heart at 3, 5 or 7 weeks of age under ad libitum feeding (ALF) or time-restricted feeding (TRF).
