TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiling of group-housed, less aggressive vs. single-housed, more aggressive male flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Social experience influences multiple behaviors of many animal species, including aggression. Social isolation often increases aggressiveness. To investigater the molecular basis of social influences on aggressiveness, we performed comparative gene expression profiling on heads from 6-day-old, single-housed, more aggressive and group-housed, less aggressive male flies. Keywords: social experience
