TITLE
RUNX1 transcription factor genome-wide occupancy in EML cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of RUNX1 transcription factor occupancy in mouse EML cells. RUNX1 antibody was use for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to reveal RUNX1 genome occupancy in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Examination of RUNX1 transcription factor occupancy in EML cells.
