TITLE
Identification of genes involved with P. aeruginosa biofilm antibiotic resistance by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to identify changes in the level of transcription of genes in P. aeruginosa drip flow biofilms in response to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin exposure. This data was evaluated and used to select strains that carry transposon mutations in genes that might play a role in antibiotic tolerance of biofilms. The strains were evaluated for defects in biofilm tolerance.

DESIGN
Four drip flow biofilm conditions with three replicates each: (1) baseline controls at 72 hours, (2) tobramycin treated for 12 hours past baseline, (3) ciprofloxacin treated for 12 hrs past baseline, and (4) no treatment for 12 hrs past baseline.
