TITLE
Genome-wide identification of BRAT- and PUM-associated mRNAs reveals PUM-independent functions for BRAT in translational repression and mRNA degradation during the Drosophila maternal-to-zygotic transition

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Here, we analyze the RNA-binding preferences of the Drosophila melanogaster BRAT protein using RNAcompete.

DESIGN
In the RNAcompete assay, purified GST-tagged BRAT is incubated with an excess of RNA pool and bound RNA from individual pulldown experiments are directly labeled and hybridized to a custom Agilent 244K microarray.
