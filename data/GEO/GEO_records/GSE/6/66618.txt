TITLE
Expression data from multiple myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melphalan-induced modulation of miR-221/222 levels in MM cells. Melphalan-resistant U266/LR7 cells showed the highest induction of miR-221/222 after drug exposure. To study the transcriptome perturbation induced in MM cells following the combination of miR-221/222 inhibitors plus melphalan we used the whole gene expression data

DESIGN
total RNA was obtained after single or combination treatment of the Melphalan-resistant U266/LR7 cells and the parental cell line U266/s
