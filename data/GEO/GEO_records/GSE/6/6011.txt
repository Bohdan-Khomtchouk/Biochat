TITLE
Expression data from quadriceps muscle of young DMD patients and age matched controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Albeit increased serum CK level and abnormal muscle histology are always present, boys with DMD are phenotipically indistinguishable from the normal ones at birth and, in their first years of life, acquire early motor milestones at normal times. A clear defect in muscle function becomes generally apparent by the end of the second year. As the disease is typically diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 7, the first two years are often considered and referred to as clinically presymptomatic. As a defined gene expression signature was shown to characterize these symptomatic patients we sought to investigate whether and to which extent alterations may be also present in muscle from presymptomatic DMD infants. To this aim, we used the Affymetrix technology to compare the individual expression profiles of 19 DMD patients with age at biopsy scattered along the first two years of the disease with those of 14 age matched controls. This approach allowed us to describe with high resolution the altered transcriptional state that characterizes this early, presymptomatic phase of the disease and highlight some molecular pathways as potential critical targets in the pathophysiology of the disease.
