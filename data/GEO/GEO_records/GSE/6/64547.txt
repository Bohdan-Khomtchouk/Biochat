TITLE
A mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and evolution of C4 photosynthesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Physiological and molecular evidences have shown earlier that low CO2 might have been a major driving force during the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, not only being a selection pressure but also as a signaling agent. However, a mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and C4 emergence is missing. In this study, using transcriptomics study in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrated that under long-term low CO2 treatments, the up-regulation of C4 related genes were linked to the up-regulation of genes involved in photorespiration, nitrogen assimilation and glycolysis. Plants under low CO2 also showed altered d13C. The carbonic anhydrase (CA), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS-GOGAT), which are required to reassimilate ammonia, were up-regulated under low CO2. Furthermore, under low CO2, genes involved in PEP regeneration from glycolysis were up-regulated while pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) was down-regulated, suggesting a route of PEP regeneration from glycolysis. All these results suggested that under long-term low CO2 treatment, the selection pressure to recapture the released ammonia from the increased photorespiration might have promoted the evolution of mechanisms for generation PEP from glycolysis and enhancement of enzymes catalyzing formation of oxaloacetate, one intermediate which can accept ammonia residue. These adjustments in metabolism provide a mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and evolution of C4 photosynthesis.
