TITLE
Genome-wide localization of ORC and MCM binding sites and identification of replication origins in S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
DNA replication of eukaryotic chromosomes initiates at a number of discrete loci, called replication origins.  Distribution and regulation of origins are important for complete duplication of the genome.  Here, we determined locations of Orc1 and Mcm6, components of pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), on whole genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a high-resolution tiling array.  Pre-RC sites were identified in 460 intergenic regions, where Orc1 and Mcm6 colocalized.  By mapping of 5-bromo-2â€™-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporated DNA in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), 307 pre-RC sites were identified as early-firing origins.  In contrast, 153 pre-RC sites without BrdU incorporation were considered to be late and/or inefficient origins.  Early and late origins tend to distribute separately in large chromosome regions.  Inactivation of replication checkpoint by deletion of Cds1 resulted in BrdU incorporation with HU specifically at the late origins.  An origin-exchange experiment showed that replication timing was not intrinsic to origin but dependent on its surrounding region.  Interestingly, pericentromeric heterochromatin and the silent mating type locus replicated in the presence of HU, while the inner centromere or subtelomeric heterochromatin did not.  Notably, MCM did not bind to inner centromeres where ORC was located.  Thus, replication is differentially regulated in chromosome domains. Keywords: ChIP-chip analysis
