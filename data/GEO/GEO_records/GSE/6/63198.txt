TITLE
High-fat diet decreases expression of genes controlling lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and skeletal system development in adipose tissue, along with increased expression of extracellular matrix remodeling- and inflammation-related genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified differentially expressed genes in epididymal white adipose tissue of high fat diet(HFD)-fed mice compared to low fat diet-fed mice using microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to lipolysis, fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial energy transduction, oxidation-reduction, insulin sensitivity, and skeletal system development were downregulated in HFD-fed mice, and genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM remodeling, and inflammation were upregulated. The top 10 up- or downregulated genes include Acsm3, mt-Nd6, Fam13a, Cyp2e1, Rgs1, and Gpnmb, whose roles in obesity-associated adipose tissue deterioration are poorly understood.

DESIGN
Total RNA of epididymal white adipose tissue was obtained from low fat diet (10 kcal% fat)- and high fat diet(45 kcal% fat)-fed mice and mRNA expression was measured using microarray analysis.
