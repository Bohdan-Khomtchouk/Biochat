TITLE
Integrative Molecular Concepts Modeling of Prostate Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using laser capture microdissection to isolate over 100 specific cell populations, we report the profiling of prostate cancer progression from benign epithelium to metastatic disease. By analyzing these expression signatures in the context of over 15,000 “molecular concepts”, or sets of biologically connected genes, we generated an integrative model of prostate cancer progression. Keywords: disease state analysis
