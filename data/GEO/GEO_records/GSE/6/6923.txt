TITLE
E. coli K-12 wild type with R1drd19 biofilm vs wild type without R1drd19 biofilm

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
E. coli K-12 wild type strains gene expression in biofilm cells with R1drd19 relative to that in biofilm cells of E. coli K-12 wild type strains without R1drd19. All the samples were cultured in LB or M9C glu on glass wool at different time. Keywords: biofilm
