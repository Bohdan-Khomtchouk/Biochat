TITLE
Phosphorylation events in the Multiple Gene Regulator of Group A Streptococcus (Mga) Significantly Influences Global Gene Expression and Virulence.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS15252

SUMMARY
We sought understand the molecular mehcanism of gene regulation by Mga and its contribution to GAS pathogenesis in serotype M59 GAS through whole transcriptome analysis of strains with phosphorylation mimicking substitutions in key histidine residues of Mga.

DESIGN
There were 6 strains analyzed, each in triplicate replicates: 1)wild-type GAS, 2)mga deletion strain 3)mga with alanine at H207 4)mga with aspartate at H207, 5) mga with alanine at H273 6)mga with aspartate at H273
