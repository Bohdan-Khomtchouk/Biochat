TITLE
miR-487b, miR-3963 and miR-6412 delayed myogenic differentiation in C2C12 mouse myoblast-derived cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We newly identified skeletal muscle differentiation-associated miRNAs by comparing miRNA expression profile between C2C12 cell and Wnt4-overexpressing C2C12 cell. miR-487b, miR-3963 and miR-6412 are significantly down-regulated in differentiating C2C12 cells, and transfection of  their mimics resulted in reduced expression of myogenic differentiation markers including Troponin T, myosin heavy chain fast and slow type.

DESIGN
Single analysis for each condition (proliferating C2C12 cells, differentiating C2C12 cells, proliferating Wnt4-overexpressing C2C12 subline cells
