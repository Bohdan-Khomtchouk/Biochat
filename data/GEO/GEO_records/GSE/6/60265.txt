TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood leukocytes from cattle infected with Mycobacterium bovis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we have analyzed the peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) transcriptome of eight natural M. bovis-infected and eight age- and sex-matched non-infected control Holstein-Friesian animals using RNA-seq. In addition, we compared gene expression profiles generated using RNA-seq with those previously generated using the high-density Affymetrix® GeneChip® Bovine Genome Array platform from the same PBL-extracted RNA

DESIGN
Identify changes occuring at the transcriptome level of PBL in response to M. bovis
