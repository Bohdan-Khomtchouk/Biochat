TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of withdrawal of miR-155 hyperexpression in miR-155-addicted tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of miR-155 in hematological tissue leads to the onset of lymphoma, and Tet-off shutdown of this overexpression reverses the disease phenotype in mir-155LSLtTA mice. This study compares the gene expression profiles of tumors with miR-155 overexpression and withdrawal.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA from 2 conditions: miR-155 overexpressing tumors and miR-155 overexpressing tumors from mice exposed to doxycycline (DOX) for 16hrs prior to harvest; samples in triplicate; tumors generated in flanks of nude mice by subcutaneous injection of splenic cells from diseased mir-155LSLtTA mice.
