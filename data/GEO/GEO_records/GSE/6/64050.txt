SUMMARY
This study describes a recurrent dicentric chromosome formed by telomere fusion between chromosome 20 and chromosome 22 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is the first description of a recurrent telomere fusion event in myeloid malignancy. The derivative chromosome is further characterised by the presence of nucleolus organiser region material from the chromosome 22 short arm, loss of the putative tumour suppressor gene at 20q12 and secondary rearrangements including gain or amplification of 20q material adjacent to the deletion encompassing 20q12. The presence of residual telomere sequence at the site of translocation in three of the four cases is compelling support for telomere fusion, and supports previous evidence that over half of dicentric chromosomes involving 20q are produced by telomere fusion events. We propose that the sequence of events producing this chromosome abnormality is initial formation of an unstable dicentric chromosome by 20q and 22p telomere fusion, followed by breakage-fusion-bridge cycles causing 20q12 deletion and 20q11.2 gain which provide a growth advantage to the cell. Selection of these clones contributes to leukaemogenesis. Finding recurrent patterns in the complex genome reorganisation events which characterise poor prognosis, complex karyotype AML and MDS will help us understand the mechanisms and oncogenic driver mutations in these poorly understood malignancies.

DESIGN
The sample consists of leukaemia specimens from three different cases of AML and MDS. The consistent feature was the presence of a dicentric chromosome formed from chromosomes 20 and 22.
