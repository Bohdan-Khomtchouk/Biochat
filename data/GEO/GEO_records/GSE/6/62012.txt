TITLE
CDK6 as key regulator of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell activation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) CDK6 and CDK4 have redundant functions in regulating cell-cycle progression. We describe a novel role for CDK6 in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (HSCs and LSCs) that exceeds its function as cell-cycle regulator. Although hematopoiesis appears regular under steady state conditions Cdk6-/- HSCs do not efficiently repopulate upon competitive transplantation and Cdk6-deficient mice are significantly more susceptible to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. We find that activation of HSCs requires CDK6, which interferes with transcription of key regulators including Egr1. The central role of Egr1 is supported by transcriptional profiling of HSCs. The impaired repopulation capacity extends to BCR-ABLp210+ leukemic stem cells. Transplantation with BCR-ABLp210+-infected bone marrow (BM) from Cdk6-/- mice fails to induce disease although recipient mice do harbor LSCs. Egr1 knock-down in cdk6-/- BCR-ABLp210+ LSKs significantly enhances colony formation underlining the importance of the Cdk6-Egr1 axis. Our findings define CDK6 as an important regulator of stem cell activation and as essential component of a transcriptional complex that suppresses Egr1 in HSCs and LSCs.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, Untreated or polyI:C-treated CDK6-/- cells versus untreated or polyI:C-treated wild-type cells. Biological replicates: 3 untreated replicates, 3 polyI:C-treated replicates.
