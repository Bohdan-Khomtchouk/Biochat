TITLE
RUNX1 and RUNX2 responsiveness in MCF7 breast cancer cells: relationship to estrogen signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of RUNX1 and RUNX2 responsiveness in the presence or absence of E2

DESIGN
RUNX1 was constitutively silenced in MCF7 cells, and kept in charcoal stripped serum for 48h prior to dox inducible re-expression of RUNX1 in MCF7/Rx1dox, or expression of RUNX2 in MCF7/Rx2dox cells. Global gene expression was profiled to define genes regulated by estradiol, RUNX1 (or RUNX2) or both.
