TITLE
Deep bisulfite amplicon sequencing and visualisation reveal diverse and heterogeneous DNA methylation patterns.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation at a gene promoter region has the potential to regulate gene transcription. Their patterns are often complex with the region showing multiple allelic patterns in a sample. This complexity is commonly obscured when DNA methylation data is summarised as an average percentage value for each CpG site (or aggregated across CpG sites). The methylation state at adjacent CpG sites is therefore lost when data is summarised this way. Methylation patterns can only be characterised by clonal analysis. Deep sequencing provides the ability to investigate clonal DNA methylation patterns in unprecedented detail and scale, enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of methylation patterns. However, the sheer amount of sequencing data requires new synoptic approaches to visualise the distribution of allelic patterns. We have developed an analysis and visualisation software tool " Methpat " , that extracts and displays clonal DNA methylation patterns from massively parallel sequencing data aligned using Bismark. We have performed multiplex bisulfite amplicon sequencing on a range of CpG island targets across a panel of human cell lines and primary tissues. Using Methpat, we demonstrate clonal diversity of epialleles analysed at specific gene promoter regions. We also describe the existence of DNA methylation within the mitochondrial genome.
