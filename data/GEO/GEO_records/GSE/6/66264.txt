TITLE
Myelodysplastic syndrome: NUP98-HoxD13 (NHD13) expression effect on hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1- haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) expressing the Nup98-HoxD13 (NHD13) fusion gene. NHD13 induces myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in mice. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the myelodysplastic phenotype

DESIGN
WT mouse HSCs were compared to an NHD13 mutant sequenced in triplicate on a HiSeq 2000
