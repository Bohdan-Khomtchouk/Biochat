TITLE
De novo assembly of the desert tree Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) based on RNA-Seq data provides insight into drought response, gene discovery and marker identification

ORGANISM
Haloxylon ammodendron

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the gene expression profiling for drought treated and control plants by using  NGS. Methods: The four RNA samples were pooled to one, using equivalent quantities of each sample for transctiptome sequencing. Meanwhile, the four RNA samples were used to construct the library for DGE sequencing. Results: Using Illumina sequencing technology, we generated over two billion bases of high-quality sequence data on H. ammodendron and conducted de novo assembly and annotation of genes without prior genome information. These reads were assembled into 79,918 unigenes (mean length=728 bp).In addition, DGE reads were mapped to the assembled transcriptome for gene expression analysis under drought stress. In total, 1,060 differentially expressed genes were identified.

DESIGN
H. ammodendron seedlings grew for one month, and then one set of seedlings were treated with a one-week (7d) stress, and the second set of seedlings was used as a control and received no treatment. Each treatment was with two replicates.
