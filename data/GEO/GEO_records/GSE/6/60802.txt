TITLE
Expression profiling of BIK-suppressed MCF-7 cells under the action of tamoxifen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the comparison between TAM-treated BIK-suppressed MCF7 cells vs. MCF.7 treated with TAM, we found some genes which have been associated with drug resistance.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MCF-7 cell groups: TAM (control), and siRNA BIK with TAM. Biological replicates: Tam (control), compared to siRNA BIK with TAM, independently grown and harvested. One replicate array.
