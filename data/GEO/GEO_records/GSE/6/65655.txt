TITLE
The effect of HOXB13 CRISPR knockout on the transcriptome in G401 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the expression profiles of G401 rhabdoid tumor of the kidney cell lines with and without the expression of the homeobox transcription factor HOXB13.

DESIGN
Single samples of G401-sg-control and G401-sg1-HOXB13 cells were subjected to RNAseq
