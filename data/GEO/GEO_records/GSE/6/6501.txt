TITLE
B.thetaiotaomicron wt versus KO2923, NMRI and B6

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Genome wide transcriptional comparison of B. thetaiotaomicron wild type vs. an isogenic mutant (BT2923::pGERM). Cecal populations of wt or BT2923::pGERM monoassociated 10d with B6 or NMRI gnotobiotic mice fed a standard-chow polysaccharide rich (PR) diet were profiled. Keywords: wild type versus knockout, in vivo
