TITLE
Next generation sequencing reveals gene transcription activities and alternative splicing events in germinating barley embryos

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare

SUMMARY
Seed germination triggers a transition of growth and metabolic activities from quiescent to active statuses. Germinating seeds is a good system to study many biological and biochemical processes including hormone metabolic activities and cell wall biosynthesis. Next generation sequence technology is used to study these processes. We have examined gene transcription activities and alternative splicing events in germinating embryos

DESIGN
We dissected barley embryos from four barley varieties at 2 time points 24 h and 48 h
