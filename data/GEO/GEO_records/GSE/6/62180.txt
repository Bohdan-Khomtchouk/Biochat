TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis rosette leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The focus of this study was to identify changes in host gene expression induced by the transcription-dependent function of the viral AC2 protein, and induced by the interaction of AC2/C2 with SnRK1.2 (AtAKIN11). We used microarrays to identify changes in host gene expression induced by the transcription-dependent function of the geminivirus-encoded AC2 protein, and induced by the interaction of AC2 with a host serine-threonine kinase, SnRK1. Distinct classes of genes were up- and down regulated during this process. For experiment 1, Arabidopsis rosette leaves were infused with Agrobacterium capable of expressing full-length Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) AC2 protein, a truncated version of AC2 lacking the C-terminal 29 amino acids (AC2del), or an empty vector control (530). In experiment 2, Arabidopsis rosette leaves were infused with Agrobacterium capable of expressing full-length Spinach curly top virus C2 protein, a truncated version of C2 lacking the C-terminal 29 amino acids (C2del), antisense (as) SnRK1.2 (AsAKIN11), or an empty vector control (530).

DESIGN
Infused Arabidopsis rosette leaves were selected at 1, 2 or 3 days post-infusion for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of plants at each time point in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we isolated total RNA from four individual plants, for three independent sets of plants infused with the different constructs. This resulted in three independent samples per treatment per time point.
