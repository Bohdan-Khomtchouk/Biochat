TITLE
Impact of age and hypoxia on proliferation and microRNA expression profile of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intro: Donor age has been widely demonstrated to affect the characteristic of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (BM-MSCs). The cellular features including decrease in cell proliferation, differentiation capacity and telomere length as well as increase of senescence may reduce the yield and clinical application for cell therapy. Methods: Expansion of BM-MSCs from young and aged donors under prolonged passage (P15) and hypoxic (5% O2) platforms was performed and the biological, cellular and miRNA profiles were assessed using Next Generation Sequencing. Results: miRNA sequencing revealed differential expression of hypoxia-inducible miRNAs when young donor MSC was cultured under hypoxia.Here, we demonstrate for the first time the link between age, hypoxia and microRNA expression and conclude that MSC isolated from both young and aged donors have a greater expansion potential when cultured under hypoxic condition.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of bone marrow MSC from young and aged donors expanded under normal and hypoxic culture condition were generated in triplicate by deep sequencing using TruSeq small RNA illumina
