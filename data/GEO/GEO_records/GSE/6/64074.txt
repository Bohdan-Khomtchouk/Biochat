TITLE
miRNA expreesion file in FOXP3 positive and negative SZ4 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The SZ-4 cell was originally identified in a Sezary disease patient and expresses FOXP3. There are different subclones of SZ4 cell which have different expression of FOXP3. Here, we used FOXP3 positive and negative SZ4 cell lines to do miRNA microarray.

DESIGN
We performed microarrays with two samples: SZ4 FOXP3+ and SZ4 FOXP3-
