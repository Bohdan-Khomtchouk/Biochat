TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of primary melanoma tumors (cohort II)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We performed global microRNA expression profiling of a cohort of primary melanoma patient samples linked to a well-annotated clinical database. The goal of this study was to identify microRNA that are associated to or correlated with various clinical parameters and patient outcomes. Candidate microRNA were identified for building prognostic models and functional testing.
