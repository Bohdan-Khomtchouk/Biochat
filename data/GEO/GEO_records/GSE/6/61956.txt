TITLE
Multiple influences of UNBS1450 on histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937  A high throughput transcriptomic analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of UNBS1450 on U937 cells at different time points. This study attemps to elucidate early effect of the compound in this cell line at times preceding the accumulation of apoptotic markers

DESIGN
We used 8 experimental conditions, comparing UNBS-treated cells to untreated ones after 0, 3, 6 and 9 hours of treatment. Four biological replicates were done, including dye-swaps.
