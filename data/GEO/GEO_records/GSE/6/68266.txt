TITLE
Expression data of mouse NIH3T3 and NIH3T3-k-ras transformed cell lines after Forskolin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forskolin treatment induces activation of protein kinase A. This activation protects transformed cells from death induced by glucose starvation. We used microarray to identify the mechanisms involved in such a pro-survival effect.

DESIGN
NIH3T3 and NIH3T3-K-ras were plated at 1mM glucose and then daily treated or not with 10uM FSK until 72h of growth. The microarray analysis has been performed at 72h in order to identify specific mechanisms associate with transformed cells survival.
