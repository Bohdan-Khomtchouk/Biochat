TITLE
Circular RNA Expression Profile of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Revealed by Microarray.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the potential involvement of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) oncogenesis, we conducted circRNA profiling in six pairs of human PDAC and adjacent normal tissue by microarray. Our results showed that clusters of circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in PDAC compared with normal samples, and provided potential targets for future treatment of PDAC and novel insights into PDAC biology.

DESIGN
Analyze circular RNA expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by microarray platform.
