TITLE
PLZF expression maps the early stages of ILC1 lineage development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Diverse populations of natural killer cells, which exert critical early cytolytic functions against virally infected cells, have recently been uncovered, raising issues of lineage relationships. We used expression of the transcription factor PLZF to identify the developmental intermediates of ILC1s, a subset of natural killer-like cells that are particularly abundant in the liver, and demonstrated a distinct precursor but parallel development and partial overlap with established classical NK stages. Using microarray analysis, we defined a set of PLZF-dependent genes that contributed to the lineage divergence between ILC1s and classical NK cells.

DESIGN
Liver lymphocytes from pools of PLZF+/+ or PLZF-/- mice were sorted into ILC1s and cNKs for RNA isolation and Illumina expression profiling.
