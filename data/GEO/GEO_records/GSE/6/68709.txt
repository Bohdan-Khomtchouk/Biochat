TITLE
Exposure of C. elegans to AOBr-containing surface water samples and to a M. aeruginosa batch culture

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Elevated levels of adsorbable organic bromine compounds (AOBr) have been detected in German lakes, and cyanobacteria like Microcystis, which are known for the synthesis of microcystins, are one of the main producers of natural organobromines. However, very little is known about how environmental realistic concentrations of organobromines impact invertebrates. Here, the nematode C. elegans was exposed to AOBr-containing surface water samples and to a Microcystis aeruginosa enriched batch culture (MC-BA) and compared to single organobromines and microcystin-LR exposures. Stimulatory effects were observed in certain life trait variables, which were particularly pronounced in nematodes exposed to MC-BA. A whole genome DNA-microarray revealed that MC-BA led to the differential expression of more than 2000 genes, many of which are known to be involved in metabolic, neurologic, and morphologic processes. Moreover, the up-regulation of cyp- and the down-regulation of abu-genes suggested the presence of chronic stress. However, the nematodes were not marked by negative phenotypic responses. The observed difference in MC-BA and microcystin-LR (which impacted lifespan, growth and reproduction) exposed nematodes was hypothesized to be likely due to other compounds within the batch culture. Most likely the exposure to low concentrations of organobromines appears to buffer the effects of toxic substances, like microcystin-LR.

DESIGN
Nematodes were exposed to filtrated samples of Lake Stößensee Berlin (August and October) and compared to the control-group (exposure to water). Furthermore, nematodes were exposed to filtrated M. aeruinosa batch culture samples and compared to another control-group (exposure to Z-Medium). Three samples (biological replicates) were prepared for each group.
