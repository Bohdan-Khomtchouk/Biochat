TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for NUP98 rearranged acute leukemias

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed lineage involvement by NUP98 translocations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Single cell analysis by FICTION (Fluorescence Immunophenotype and Interphase Cytogenetics as a Tool for Investigation of Neoplasms) showed that NUP98-translocations with various partners, i.e. NSD1, DDX10, RAP1GDS1, and LNP1, always affected a CD34+/CD133+ hematopoietic precursor. Interestingly, in MDS/AML myelomonocytes, erythroid cells, B- and T- lymphocytes belonged to the abnormal clone, while in T-ALL only CD7+/CD3+ cells were involved. The partner did not appear to play a major role in determining the leukemia phenotype as shown in AML and T-ALL with the same NUP98-RAP1GDS1 fusion. Additional hits, namely mutations of FLT3 and CEBPA in MDS/AML and mutation of NOTCH1 plus MYB duplication in T-ALL, were identified in leukemias with, respectively, myeloid or T-lymphoid phenotype.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Copy number and Copy neutral LOH analysis of with Affymetrix Cytogenetic 2.7 and Cytoscan HD SNP arrays was performed on 6 NUP98 rearranged leukemias.
