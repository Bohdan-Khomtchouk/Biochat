TITLE
Gene expression of human peripheral blood cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [dataset 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Factors responsible for radiographic severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in African-Americans are poorly understood.  We sought to examine genes whose expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is associated with radiographic severity of RA.

DESIGN
20 control samples (from individuals without RA) were compared with 10 early mild, 10 early severe, 10 late mild, and 10 late severe RA samples. All samples were obtained from African-American individuals.
