TITLE
Development of miRNA expression signatures for induction of histone deacetylase inhibitor (part 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the relationship between histone acetylation and miRNA expression, we performed miRNA arrays to detect histone deacetylase inhibitor (OBP-801) induced miRNA regulating AR expression in LNCaP and VCaP.

DESIGN
Agilent-041686 Unrestricted Human miRNA Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) was used according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols.
