TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of bone marrow cells from healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed whole-genome transcriptomic profiling of RNA from mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates taken from healthy individuals. This study complements GSE58335: transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals.

DESIGN
High-throughput sequencing was done using the Illumina GA IIx. The RNA is from previously published samples (Stirewalt et al., Genes Chromosomes Cancer, 2008, PMID:17910043)
