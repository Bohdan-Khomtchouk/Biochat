TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs in porcine placenta on gestational days 26 and 50

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Affymetrix miRNA arrays were used to generate miRNA profiles in placenta of Meishan and Yorkshire pigs on stages of initiation (gestational day 26) and establishment (gestational day 50) of placental folds development. The study allowed for the determination of the miRNAs that were differentially expressed in porcine placenta on different gestational day. This study will provide the information to better understanding of the role miRNAs in porcine placental development.
