TITLE
Profiling protease and protease inhibitor gene expression in tumors and their microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assist in the identification of proteases, their endogenous inhibitors, and proteins that interact with proteases or proteolytic pathways in biological tissues, a dual species oligonucleotide microarray has been developed in conjunction with Affymetrix, Inc. To investigate the performance of the array, gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas. The Hu/Mu ProtIn array is a valuable discovery tool for the identification of components of human and murine proteolytic pathways in health and disease, and has particular utility in the determination of cellular origins of proteases and protease inhibitors in xenograft models of human cancer. Keywords: gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas
