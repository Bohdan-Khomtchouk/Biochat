TITLE
Patterns of gene expression among murine models of hemorrhagic shock trauma and sepsis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The PT , PT + PP, and CLP murine models have unique transcriptomic respones 2 hrs, 1 and 3 days after injury

DESIGN
We used mouse microarrays to detail the molecular profile of the events that occur following injury in mice models
