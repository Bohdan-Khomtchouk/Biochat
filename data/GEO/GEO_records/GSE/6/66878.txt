TITLE
Induced of RBM24 expression effect on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key components in the determination of miRNA function, as they control different stages of miRNA biogenesis and their localization, degradation and activity. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of RBM24 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) carcinogenesis, we compared the miRNA expression profiles in RBM24 induced and control cells by using human miRNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 11 commonly upregulated and 12 commonly downregulated miRNAs in RBM24 induced cells. Among the 23 miRNAs, miR-25 ranked highest of all the commonly upregulated genes sorted in ascending order according to fold change values. RBM24 expression was controlled by tetracycline-off system in NPC cells.

DESIGN
microRNA profiling of RBM24 expression induced cells vs. repressed cells: The expression of RBM24 in HONE-1, 5-8F, and CNE-2 cells was induced by removing doxycycline or repressed by adding doxycycline.
