TITLE
Differential gene expression in neuroblastoma cells after treatment with vehicle control, JQ1, panobinostat, or combination of JQ1 and panobinostat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat induce synergistic anticancer effects We analyzed whether JQ1 and panobinostat synergistically modulate gene expression

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2) cells were treated with vehicle control, 1 microM JQ1, 10 nM panobinostat, or combination of JQ1 and panobinostat for 6 hours, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with Affymetrix microarrays.
