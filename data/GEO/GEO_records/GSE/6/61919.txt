TITLE
Epression profiling of miR-142 deficient CD19+ B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-142 gene is specifically and abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Mice that lack this miRNA gene develop immunodeficiency and display altered hematopoeisis. We used microarrays to detect whole transcriptome changes in miR-142 null B cells.

DESIGN
RNA from purified WT(n=3) and miR-142 KO (n=3) CD19+ B cells was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. Samples in WT and KO groups are biological replicates and were isolated in age and gender matched mice.
