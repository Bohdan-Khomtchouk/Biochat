TITLE
MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) reveals RybB sRNA targetome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Despite the overwhelming information about sRNAs, one of the biggest challenges in the sRNA field is characterizing sRNA targetomes. Thus, we develop a novel method to identify RNAs that interact with a specific sRNA, regardless of the type of regulation (positive or negative) or targets (mRNA, tRNA, sRNA). This method is called MAPS: MS2 affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing. As proof of principle, we identified RNAs bound to RybB, a well-characterized E. coli sRNA.

DESIGN
Identification of RNAs co-purified with MS2-RybB in a rne131 Î”rybB strain. RybB (without MS2) was used as control
