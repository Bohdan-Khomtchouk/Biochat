TITLE
MicroRNA profiling by array of human urinary sediments from IgAN patients

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We have performed a microRNA expression analysis in urine sediments from 18 IgAN patients, 6 healthy subjects and 8 disease controls(including 4 membranous nephropathy patients and 4 minimal change disease patients). Pathologic diagnosis of all IgAN patients was included in grades Iâ€“V by light microscopy according to the grading system of Lee et al. And we have identified a set of deregulated microRNAs with potential diagnostic value to identify patients with IgAN.
