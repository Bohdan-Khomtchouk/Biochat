TITLE
Hif2a-cardiomyocyte deficient mice response to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart of Hypoxia-inducible 2 alpha-deficient mice, specific in cardiomyocytes (Hif2aloxP/loxP Myosin Cre+)  subjected to myocardial ishcemia reperfusion. Hif2a belongs to the family of transcription factors, that regulate a transcriptional response to tissue hypoxia.

DESIGN
Untreated Myosin Cre+ and Hif2aloxP/loxP Myosin Cre+ mice were compared to wMyosin Cre+ and Hif2aloxP/loxP Myosin Cre+ mice  with 45 min ischemia followed by 2 hours reperfusion.
