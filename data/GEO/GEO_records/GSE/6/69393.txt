TITLE
Distinct Function for ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. The neural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 have been shown to play crucial roles in promoting the malignant behavior and survival of human SCLC cell lines. In this study, we find ASCL1 and NEUROD1 identify distinct neuroendocrine tumors, bind distinct genomic loci, and regulate mostly distinct genes. ASCL1 and NEUROD1 are often bound in super-enhancers that are associated with highly expressed genes in their respective SCLC cell lines suggesting different cell lineage of origin for these tumors. ASCL1 targets oncogenic genes such as MYCL1, RET, and NFIB, while NEUROD1 targets the oncogenic gene MYC. Although ASCL1 and NEUROD1 regulate different genes, many of these gene targets commonly contribute to neuroendocrine and cell migration function. ASCL1 in particular also regulates genes in the NOTCH pathway and genes important in cell-cycle dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate ASCL1 but not NEUROD1 is required for SCLC and LCNEC tumor formation in current in vivo genetic mouse models of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis performed on two ASCL1high and two NEUROD1high human SCLC cell lines to identify gene expression patterns in these cells. Also, we performed RNA-seq in mouse neuroendocrine lung tumors obtained from Trp53;Rb1;Rbl2 triple knockout model mice treated with Adeno-CMVCRE intratracheally.
