TITLE
A Genome-wide Gene Expression Analysis and Database in Transgenic Mice during Development of Amyloid or Tau Pathology

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project was to compare whole genome expression in 5 transgenic mice with human genes for dementia that result in either plaques or tangle pathology to the expression in wild-type control mice and to each other at different stages of disease progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum in four lines of ‘amyloid’ transgenic mice (mutant human APP and APP/PSEN1  genes) and ‘TAU’ transgenic mice (mutant human MAPT gene) as well as wild-type control mice at 8,16, 32 and 72 weeks
