SUMMARY
Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a therapeutic challenge on account of extreme primary resistance to apoptosis and fated acquired chemoresistance. In the current context of molecular classification of MM, the understanding of molecular mechanisms giving rise to these resistances should drive therapeutic choice trough personalized medicine. In order to study mechanisms of MM acquire resistance to VAs, we previously established three VA-resistant cell lines, CAL1R-VCR, CAL1R-VDS, and CAL1R-VRB, by long time exposure of the CAL1-wt MM cell line to IC50 (4nM) of VCR, VDS and VRB respectively. CAL1R-VAs cell lines consisted of polyclonal populations to respect biological diversity of tumour. Then, we searched for determine the resistance process impact on MM cells. We thus performed genome-wide analyses based on comparison of global transcriptomic profile of CAL1R-VAs cells to CAL1-wt. In this way, RNA extracted from each cell line was hybridized to Affimetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.00 GeneChips. After hybridization, microarray data were processed with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm. We then performed bioinformatic analyses of microarray data and in vitro investigations in the aim to identify genes and pathways that might predict drug resistance.

DESIGN
Melanoma model: CAL1 cell line. Treatments: vinorelbine (VRB), vincristine (VCR), vindesine (VDS). Etablishment of 3 resistant cell lines by long time exposure to vinka-alkaloids (4nM, 6-12 months): CAL1R-VRB, CAL1R-VCR, CAL1R-VDS. RNA extracted from a pooled population of each cell line were hybridized to Affimetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.00 GeneChips. Then, microarray data were processed with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm.
