TITLE
Chip-chip of Sir3 and of Sir2, and ChAP-chip of AAR from budding yeast cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (AAR) is a small metabolic molecule that is generated during NAD-dependent deacetylation by Sir2. Sir2 regulates gene expression, DNA repair, and genome stability. chromatin affinity-precipitation (ChAP) method was used to detect the chromatin fragments at which small molecules interact with binding partners. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Sir3  and of Sir2, respectively, applied with tilling array chip (ChIP on chip of Sir3 and of Sir2, respectively) and Chromatin affinity-precipitation of AAR applied with tilling array chip (ChAP on chip of AAR ) analysis demonstrated that an extended spreading of Sir3 and of AAR, but not Sir2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ysa1 deleted cells compared with those in wild type cells

DESIGN
Comparison the distributions of Sir3, of Sir2 and of AAR on silent heterochromatin of Ysa1 deletion cells vs those of wild type cells
