TITLE
A simple method for generating high-resolution maps of genome wide protein binding

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and its derivatives are the main techniques used to determine transcription factor binding sites. However, conventional ChIP with sequencing (ChIP-seq) has problems with poor resolution and newer techniques require significant experimental alterations and complex bioinformatics. Here we build upon our high-resolution crosslinking ChIP-seq (X-ChIP-seq) method and compare it to existing methodologies. By using micrococcal nuclease, which has both endo- and exo-nuclease activity to fragment the chromatin and thereby generate precise protein-DNA footprints, high-resolution X-ChIP-seq achieves single base pair resolution of transcription factor binding. A significant advantage of this protocol is the minimal alteration to the conventional ChIP-seq workflow and simple bioinformatic processing.

DESIGN
Using High-resolution X-ChIP-seq we determined the genome-wide binding profile of various DNA binding proteins.
