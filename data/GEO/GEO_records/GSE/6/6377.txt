TITLE
Plasticity of the systemic inflammatory response to acute infection during critical illness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diagnosis of acute infection in the critically ill remains a challenge. Changes in physiologic parameters and existing molecular diagnostics are not specific and microbiologic confirmation of infection can take days. As cellular first responders, preclinical studies indicate that circulating leukocytes are activated in response to bacterial infection, manifesting infection-specific transcriptional programs.  We hypothesized that circulating leukocyte transcriptional profiles can be used to diagnose infection and monitor response to therapy in the critically ill.
