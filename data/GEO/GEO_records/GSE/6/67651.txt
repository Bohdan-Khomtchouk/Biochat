TITLE
Expression data from fatty acid and bile acid receptor agonist treated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are unique endothelial cell typelining the sinusoids of the liver and we have shown that these cells respond in a unique matter when exposed to saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) and bile acids. We used microarray to analyze the transcriptional differences between the LSEC exposed to free fatty acids and bile acid receptor agonists to further shed light on their role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

DESIGN
The Murine Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell Line (TSEC) was treated with palmitic and oleic acid or the bile acid receptor agonist INT-767 for 8 hours. Total RNA was then harvested to determine transcriptional differences.
