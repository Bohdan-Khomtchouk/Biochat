TITLE
Effect of mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2 deficiency on the locations of DNA replication origins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are loaded to chromatin during G1-phase and define potential locations of DNA replication initiation. MCM protein deficiency results in genome instability and high rates of cancer in mouse models. Here we develop a method of nascent strand capture and release and show that MCM2 deficiency reduces DNA replication initiation in gene rich regions of the genome. DNA structural properties are shown to correlate with sequence motifs associated with replication origins and with locations that are preferentially affected by MCM2 deficiency. Reduced nascent strand density correlates with sites of recurrent focal CNVs in tumors arising in MCM2-deficient mice, consistent with a direct relationship between sites of reduced DNA replication initiation and genetic damage.  Between 10 and 90% of human tumors, depending on type, carry heterozygous loss or mutation of one or more Mcm2-7 genes which is expected to compromise DNA replication origin licensing and result in elevated rates of genome damage at a subset of gene rich locations.

DESIGN
Mcm2 deficient vs. wild type
