TITLE
The Nicotinic alpha6 Subunit Gene Determines Variability in Chronic Pain Sensitivity and Nicotine Anti- allodynia via Cross-inhibition of P2X2/3 Receptors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray-based expression genomics in 25 inbred mouse strains to identify dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-expressed genetic contributors to mechanical allodynia a prominent symptom of chronic pain. Expression genetics identifies a role for the Chrna6 (alpha 6-nicotinic receptor) gene in pain in mice and humans.

DESIGN
Dorsal root ganglion tissue across multiple inbred mouse strains, both male and female
