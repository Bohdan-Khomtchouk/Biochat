TITLE
The effect of MFNG knockdown on gene expression profile of xenograft tumor derived from MDA-MB231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mfng, a modulator of Notch signaling, is highly expressed in human claudin-low breast cancer (CLBC). To determine Mfng’s roles in CLBC pathogenesis,we knocked down Mfng in a CLBC cell line MDA-MB231, and found that Mfng knockdown altered Notch activation, decreased tumor sphere formation in vitro, and reduced tumor growth in xenograft model. To identify the potential downstream targets of Mfng during CLBC tumorigenesis, we compared the gene expression profiles between xenografts tumor derived from of MDA-MB231 cells carrying Mfng shRNA and the control vector.  Mfng, a modulator of Notch signaling, is highly expressed in human claudin-low breast cancer (CLBC). To determine Mfng’s roles in CLBC pathogenesis,we knocked down Mfng in a CLBC cell line MDA-MB231, and found that Mfng knockdown caused alteration in Notch activation, associated with decreased tumor sphere formation in vitro, as well as reduced tumor growth in xenograft model. We intend to compare gene expression profiles between xenografts of MDA-MB231 cells carrying Mfng shRNA and the control vector. This project seeks to identify potential downstream targets of Mfng in CLBC.

DESIGN
MDA-MB231 cells were transfected with shRNA against MFNG. Stable cell clones with knockdown of MFNG or corresponding control were selected and injected orthotopically into SCID mice. Total RNA was then extracted from the xenograph tumors for microarray analysis.
