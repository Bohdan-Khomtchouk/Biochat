TITLE
Mouse adapted strain CGH

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization of mouse adapted strains: 10700 pre-mouse SS1, SS1(A.L.)Sydney strain obtained directly from Adrian Lee, NSH79 Salama lab strain labeled as SS1-now know distinct, G27 obtained from Antonello Covacci. Genomic DNA from est strain (Cy5), genomic DNA from reference strains used for array fabrication (equimolar mix of 26695 and J99 genomic DNA) An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
