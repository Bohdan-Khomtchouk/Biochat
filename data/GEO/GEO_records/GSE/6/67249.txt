TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MTDH was identified to be a functional gene in cancer progression. We overexpressed the gene in MCF7 cells and explored its functions in cancer stem cell maintainance. We used microarrays to mine the genes that were regulated by MTDH after MTDH overexpression.

DESIGN
The MCF7 cells that were stably trasfected with empty vector or MTDH overexpressing plasmids were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to find the gene that were upregulated by MTDH.
