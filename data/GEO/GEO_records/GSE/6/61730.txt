TITLE
Transcriptome data of interacting Salmonella Typhimurium and human host cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The poly(A)+ and poly(A)âˆ’ fractions of interacting and non-interacting cells were used for distinct library preparation of interacting and non-interacting prokaryotic pathogen and eukaryotic host cells by deepSuperSAGE. Sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and one point of time post infection (early interaction) was additionally prepared by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) as alternative tag-based library preparation method.

DESIGN
10 deepSuperSAGE and 2 MACE libraries. Please consult the publication mentioned in the following for more details.
