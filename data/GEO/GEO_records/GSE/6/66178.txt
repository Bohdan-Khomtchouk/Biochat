TITLE
Sumoylation-deficient bone marrow derived dendritic cells transcriptomic analysis after LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow derived dendritic cells were generated from Ubc9[fl;-] and Ubc9[+/+] mice. After in vitro derivation in the presence of GM-CSF, dendritic cells were treated with tamoxifen for four days to cause CreERT2 activation, and induce Ubc9 floxed allele deletion. This allowed comparative transcriptomic analysis of Ubc9[+/+] and Ubc9[-/-] dendritic cells unstimulated or stimulated with 10ng/ml LPS for one hour and six hours.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of each conditions were used. Analyzed bone marrow derived dendritic cells were Ubc9 WT or Ubc9 KO. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with LPS 10 ng/ml for one hour and six hours.
