TITLE
Differential repression of TLR responses by PPARg and LXRs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transrepression mediated by PPARg and LXRs agonists (GW7845 and GW3965) in primary macrophages stimulated with LPS or poly I:C. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated from mice by peritoneal lavage 3 days following peritoneal injection of 2.5 ml 3% thioglycollate (DIFCO). Cells were plated in RPMI medium 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum, washed after 5 h the medium was removed and cells were fed with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with LPS (Sigma) a concentration of 100 ng/ml or poly I:C (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of receptor-specific agonists for PPARγ (GW7845) or LXR (GW3965) at 1 µM concentrations. Results suggest signal-dependent nuclear receptors transrepression pathways.
