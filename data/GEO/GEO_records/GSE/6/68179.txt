TITLE
Gene expression in the liver and colon of mice fed diets HH, LL, HL and LH

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mice fed a diet deficient in selenium and folate during weaning and in utero (LL), a diet deficient in selenium and folate during weaning but not in utero (HL), a diet sufficient in selenium and folate during weaning but deficient in utero (LH), and a diet sufficient in selenium and folate during weaning and in utero (HH)

DESIGN
2 colour microarray, reference design. Biological replicates: 6 per treatment group. The reference RNA was extracted from a whole pregnant C57 mouse and foetus.  The whole body was homogenised and RNA was extracted using an AllPrep(r) DNA/RNA/Protein mini kit (Qiagen, Cat number 80004).
