TITLE
Effect of miR-650 overexpression on gene expression profile of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, comparing cells transfected for 24h with Pre-miR-650 or nonsense control.

DESIGN
2 condition experiment: nonsense control versus miR-650 mimic - 3 biological replicates for each condition and control
