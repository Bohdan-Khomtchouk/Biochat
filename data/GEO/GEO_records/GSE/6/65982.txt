SUMMARY
S. mutans UA159 was cultivated in chemically defined medium. Changes in the transcriptome in response to the autoinducing peptides CSP and XIP were monitored for 30 minutes.

DESIGN
Time series of Streptococcus mutans UA159 cultivated in CDM after treatment with CSP, XIP or uninduced. Time points: before treatment, 5, 15, 30 min after treatment. Two biological replicates
