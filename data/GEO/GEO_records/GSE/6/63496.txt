TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of short fragment-enriched RNA in HeLa cells subjected to exosome depletion by RNAi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assay the effect of depletion of the RNA exosome on RNAs shorter than the standard length captured by RNA-seq ( > 200 nt), we created RNA-seq libraries using fragmented RNA and a linker-ligation-based protocol that does not deplete RNAs shorter than 200 nt. Note: these data relate to Figure 6E in Lubas, Andersen et al., Cell Reports 2014 (accepted)

DESIGN
These samples constitute RNA-seq libraries prepared to enrich for short RNA fragments such as snRNA and snoRNAs. Three different HeLa cell RNAi experiments were used to generate the RNA samples applied in the library construction: control transfected, hRRP40-depleted and triple-depleted of the known RNA exosome-associated ribonucleases (DIS3, DIS3L and hRRP6 knock-down). By these means the data offers reveal RNA exosome substrates via their up-regulation in the respective knock-downs NOTE: The 'Figure6E_RNAseq_DataTable_PlottedValues.txt' was generated from total 5 samples, with two additional published samples [SRP031620] and provided to better allow readers to fully replicate the analyses presented in the publication.
