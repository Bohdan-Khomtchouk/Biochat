TITLE
Mutant WT1 is Associated with DNA Hypermethylation of PRC2 Targets in AML and Responds to EZH2 Inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of THP1, THP1 expressing WT1 mutant, THP1 expressing IDH2 mutant, CTS cells and AML patient with WT1 mutant. The Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
