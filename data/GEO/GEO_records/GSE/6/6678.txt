SUMMARY
Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (aka infantile Batten disease) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of early childhood characterized by cortical atrophy, blindness and seizures, leading to premature death in the first decade. The disorder is caused by deficiency in a soluble lysosomal enzyme, palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). PPT1 knockout mice faithfully reproduce the features of the human disease, with motor deterioration, blindness, seizures, and death before 10 months of age. The progression of events leading from enzyme deficiency to organ failure is poorly defined. The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are of particular interest because of the similarities between the accumulated material and lipofuscin that is associated with normal aging. We will determine changes in gene expression that occur during the course of neurodegeneration in PPT1 knockout as compared to control mice. Gene expression profiling of brain tissue from PPT1 knockout mice as compared to normal controls will provide insights into the mechanism of neurodegeneration. Comparison of this profile with gene expression profiles associated with normal aging may provide insights into the contribution of lipofuscin to aging and neurodegeneration. PPT1 knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background will be sacrificed under CO2 and whole brains removed and frozen under liquid nitrogen.  Three mice will be used for each time point. Data points will be collected at 3 months, 5 months and 8 months of age. Normal age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 mice will be used as controls. Keywords: gene knockout
