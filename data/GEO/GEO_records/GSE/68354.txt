TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of an evolved and an ancestral  wine yeast strains presenting differences in the bioconversion of higher alcohols to acetate esters

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
An evolved strain (ECA5) presented two successive yields of bioconversion of higher alcohols to acetate esters, while its parental strain (EC1118) had a constant yield through the fermentation. Transcriptomic analysis was performed during wine fermentation in SM330 containing 8mg/L phytosterols, at  35 g/l and at 70 g/l of CO2 released. For ECA5, this corresponds to a sample before and one after the change of bioconversion yield. This analysis helped us to understand the different management of lipid source by the evolved strain, which is probably linked to a greater availability in acetyl-CoA.

DESIGN
Two strains (EC1118 and ECA5) were compared during wine fermentation at 2 released CO2 time point (35g/L and 70g/L). Each condition is in triplicat.
