TITLE
Expression data from brain tissue of Rattus norvegicus treated with chlorpyrifos (CPF)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus insecticide that despite imposed restricitions on its use by the EPA, is one of the most commonly used insecticides.  Although CPF is so widely used little is known about its effect on overall gene expression in vivo. DNA microarray technology was used to determine differential gene expression resulting from chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure. Keywords: Dose course

DESIGN
Male Fisher 344 rats aged 11-12 weeks were treated with varying doses of chlorpyrifos (CPF) and terminally sacced at 96 hours post-exposure in three separate experiments.  An approximate 30mg section of the frontal lobe of the brain was processed for total RNA extraction.
