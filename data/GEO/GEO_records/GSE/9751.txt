TITLE
Expression data from brain tissue of Rattus norvegicus treated with chlorpyrifos (CPF)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus insecticide that despite imposed restricitions on its use by the EPA, is one of the most commonly used insecticides.  Although CPF is so widely used little is known about its effect on overall gene expression in vivo. DNA microarray technology was used to determine differential gene expression resulting from chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure. Keywords: Dose course
