TITLE
Expression analysis of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (Capan-1, Panc-1, Panc-1+ve and Panc-1-ve) and pancreatic ductal cell line (HPDE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressing genes in whole genome wide analysis of aptamer SQ2 positive cells (Capan-1, Panc-1, Panc-1+ve) and SQ2 negative cells (Panc-1-ve and HPDE) Panc-1 +ve and Panc-1-ve cell lines were generated from  Panc-1 cell line based upon its hetergenous binding to aptamer SQ2. Detailed procedure of generation of these cell lines are described in Pooja Dua, Hye Suk Kang, Seung-Mo Hong, Ming-Sound Tsao, Soyoun Kim, and Dong-ki Lee. 2012 Alkaline Phosphatase ALPPL2 is a novel pancreatic carcinoma-associated protein. Cancer Research

DESIGN
A five chip study using total RNA recovered from Capan-1, Panc-1, Panc-1+ve, Panc-1-ve and HPDE cells. Each chip measures 45,033 genes with three  60 mer probe pairs per target.
