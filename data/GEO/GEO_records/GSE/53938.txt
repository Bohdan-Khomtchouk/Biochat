TITLE
The Demethylase JMJD2C/KDM4C Localizes to H3K4me3 Positive Transcription Start Sites (ChIP-seq KYSE150 cell line)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have mapped binding sites for the histone demethylase, JMJD2C/KDM4C/GASC1, and the effect of JMJD2C depletion on H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 distributions in KYSE150 cells.  The human esophageal carcinoma cell line, KYSE150, contains an amplification of the JMJD2C locus.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed using chromatin from control or JMJD2C-depleted KYSE150 cells and antibodies recognizing JMJD2C, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 or H3K36me3.
