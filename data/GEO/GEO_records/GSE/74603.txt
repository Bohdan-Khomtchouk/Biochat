TITLE
Palbociclib, PD0325901 and combination treatment induced gene expression in DLD1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional changes after treatment with Palbociclib, PD0325901 or combined treatment in DLD1 (colorectal cancer cell line). The aim of the study was to identify differentially regulated genes after the various treatment, particularly on the downregulated genes as these drugs are inhibitors of the CDK4/6 and MEK pathways and upon inhibition, should lead to the downregulation of pro-tumorigenic genes. Results provide important information on which transcription factors or genes that will be targeted by the inhibition of these 2 pathways

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from untreated, Palbociclib-, PD0325901- or combination- treated DLD1 at 24hour, 48hour and 72hour time points.

PLATFORM
