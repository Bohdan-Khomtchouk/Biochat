TITLE
Determination of mRNA transcripts in HeLa cells that are regulated by RENT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were treated with siRNA directed against Luciferase or RENT1 in duplicate (as described in Mendell et al., Science, 2002; PubMed ID:12228722).  Transcripts that are differentially expressed between the two experimental conditions are putatively regulated by RENT1. Keywords: repeat sample
