TITLE
Early developmental transcriptome of Musca domestica.

ORGANISM
Musca domestica

SUMMARY
Using mRNA next generation sequencing, we analyze the transcriptome of Musca domestica embryos through five stages of  early development: from syncytial blastoderm to dorsal closure stage.

DESIGN
We select 100 embryos for five developmental stages: syncytial blastoderm, cellular blastoderm, gastrula, germ band extension and dorsal closure. A total of 10 samples of mRNA were obtained, represent two biological replicates for each stage.

PLATFORM
GPL15805 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Musca domestica)
