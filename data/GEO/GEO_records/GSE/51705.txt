TITLE
ChIP-Seq experiments of KLF5, GATA4 and GATA6 in YCC3/AGS/KATOIII cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three transcription factors KLF5, GATA4 and GATA6 are recurrently amplified in multiple gastric cancer cohorts, representing one type of lineage-survival oncogenes in gastric cancer. ChIP-Seq analysis of these three factors in multiple cell lines revealed that significant number of genomic sites are co-occupied by KLF5 and GATA4 and/or GATA6. Integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and gene expression identified several targets of the three transcription factors in both cell lines and primary tumors, including HNF4A. These results suggest that KLF5, GATA4 and GATA6 interact and co-operate to regulate HNF4A and other genes to promote tumorigenesis in gastric cancer.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq experiments of KLF5, GATA4 and GATA6 were performed in three gastric cancer cell lines YCC3, AGS and KATOIII
