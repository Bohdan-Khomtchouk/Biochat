TITLE
Coordinated regulation of MAPK signaling pathway and microRNA in response to ionizing radiation in lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA regulates cellular responses to ionizing radiation (IR) through the translational control of target genes. We analyzed time-series changes in microRNA expressions upon γ-irradiation in H1299 lung cancer cell lines using microarray. Significantly changed microRNAs were selected based on ANOVA analysis, target genes of which were enriched to MAPK signaling pathway. Concurrent analysis of mRNA and microRNA uncovered that the expression of miR-26b and its target ATF2 mRNA were inversely correlated in γ-irradiated H1299 cells. The overexpression of miR-26b induced the suppression of ATF2 in γ-irradiated cells. When we inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway using SP600125, JNK inhibitor, the expression of miR-26b was induced even in γ-irradiated H1299 cells. From these results, we concluded that the expression of miR-26b was coordinated regulated by MAPK signaling pathway upon ionizing radiation, and MAPK signaling pathway was regulated by miR-26b in turn.
