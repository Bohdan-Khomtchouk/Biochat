TITLE
Gene expression signatures following nerve injury in a rat model (0h-9h)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to distinguish the gene expression differences among different time points after injury.

DESIGN
We generated proximal sciatic nerve (SN) tissues (0.5cm) at 0h, 0.5h, 1h, 3h, 6h and 9h after sciatic nerve resection.
