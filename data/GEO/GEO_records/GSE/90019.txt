TITLE
Analysis of transcriptional and epigentic changes induced by loss of Phf8 [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf8 is a histone demethylase with links to human behavior. Here we have performed a transcriptional analysis of Phf8 knockout embryonic stem and neural projenitor cells in vitro along with an analysis of the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in vivo. Our results suggest that knockout of Phf8 is largely compensated for. However, we did observe a misregulation of serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex, which may have disease implications.

DESIGN
mRNA was generated from WT and KO ESCs and NPCs in culture or from prefrontal corteces and ventral striata dissected from adult WT or KO mice.
