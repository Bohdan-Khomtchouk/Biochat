TITLE
Oncogenic BRAF regulates oxidative metabolism via PGC1Î± and MITF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression signatures were measured in logarithmic growing cultures Affymetrix HG-U133AV2 expression arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions using RNA extracted by Qiagen RNeasy from engineered human melanoma cells

DESIGN
Resulting expression signatures where derived based on phenotypic properties: tumor-like endpoints driven by MITF overexpression
