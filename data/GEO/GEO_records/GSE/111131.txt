TITLE
Hereditary Hearing Loss SNP-Microarray Pilot Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objectives: Despite recent advancements in diagnostic tools, the genomic landscape of hereditary hearing loss remains largely uncharacterized. One strategy to understand genome-wide aberrations includes the analysis of copy number variation that can be mapped using SNP-microarray technology. A growing collection of literature has begun to uncover the importance of copy number variation in hereditary hearing loss. This pilot study underpins a larger effort that involves the stage-wise analysis of hearing loss patients, many of whom have advanced to high-throughput sequencing analysis. Data description: Our data originate from Infinium HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 SNP-microarrays (Illumina) that provide useful markers for genome-wide association studies and copy number variation analysis. This dataset comprises a cohort of 108 individuals (99 with hearing loss, 9 normal hearing family members) for the purpose of understanding the genetic contribution of copy number variations to hereditary hearing loss.

DESIGN
To investigate the genome-wide controbution of copy number variation, we hybridized 108 individuals (99 with hearing loss, 9 unaffected family members) on the InfiniumHuman Omni1-Quad v1.0 SNP-microarrays (Illumina).
