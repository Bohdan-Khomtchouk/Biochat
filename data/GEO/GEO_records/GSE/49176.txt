TITLE
Gene expressional comparison of in vitro adipocyte models vs. in vivo eWAT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression level of 3T3-L1, PMEF and ES cell derived adipocytes to eWAT samples. We used microarray to investigate the gene expressional differences between different cellular models of adipocyte differentiation vs. in vivo eWAT tissues

DESIGN
3T3-L1 cells, Primary Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (PMEFs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were differentiated to adipocytes as it is described in details in the manuscript. eWAT tissues has been isolated from healthy wild-type mice. Each in biological triplicates.
