TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Fusarium graminearum Z-3639 in heat stress

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. To dissect cellular responses toward heat stress in the plant pathogenic fungus F. graminearum, we compared transcriptomes of the fungal cultures incubated in normal temperature condition (25 ºC) and in high temperature condition (37 ºC) for 15 min.

DESIGN
6 samples examined: 24 h-old mycelia from complete medium (CM) of Fusarium graminearum wild-type Z-3639 were incubated in normal temperature condition (25 ºC) and in high temperature condition (37 ºC) for 15 min.
