TITLE
The effects of different concentrations of phenanthrene on FHM liver

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
FHMs were exposed to three concentrations of phenanthrene (average measured 29, 287, 1006 ng/L) and fish were sampled after 48hr.

DESIGN
There were 20 samples analyzed  5) control liver tissues  5) 29 ng/L phenanthrene exposed liver tissues 5) 287 ng/L phenanthrene exposed liver tissues 5)1006 ng/L phenanthrene exposed liver tissues. There was a total of 20 microarrays processed. In this study, gene expression to a 'dose-response' was investigated after in vivo exposure of fish to phenanthrene.
