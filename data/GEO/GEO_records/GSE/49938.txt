TITLE
Re-specification of myeloid precursors from human pluripotent cells into engraftable multi-lineage progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitors, which were then re-specified using defined transcription factors to resemble hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) We used microarrays to establish the similarity between converted cells and purified human HSCs.

DESIGN
The samples analyzed were: starting embryoid body progenitors, transcription factor-converted cells, and primary HSCs and progenitors from fetal liver and cord blood. All samples were flow sorted for CD34+ and CD38- to compare across a similar population of primitive cells.
