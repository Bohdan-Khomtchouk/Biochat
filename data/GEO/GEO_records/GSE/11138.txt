SUMMARY
We used microarray analyses in human atherosclerotic plaque to identify network imply in the maintenance and progression of the pathology. To obtain a wide dynamic range we used the scanning method proposed by Skibbe et al. (Bioinformatics. 2006;22(15):1863-1870) performing three subsequent scansions for the same slide. We performed before low than medium and high PMT and laser intensity scansions to permit to detect differences in expression of high expressed genes from the first scansion and from low expressed genes from the last scansion. Data were total and lowess normalized, filtered and used to detect differentially expressed genes separately (low, medium and high). Differentially expressed genes were than integrated. Our data enhance the importance of both the inflammatory stress responses, controlled by central node STAT1 (inducing also the over-expression of the heat shock proteins HSP47 and HO-1), and caveolae system related to steroid hormone receptors. Since atherosclerosis affects aorta, coronary, carotid, and iliac arteries most frequently than any other body vessel there may be common molecular pathways involved in sustenance of this process. We integrated our DNA microarrays data with plaque carotid gene expression (Array Express databases E-MEXP-268) by meta-analysis method. We identified a series of common potential human atherogenic genes and were able to integrate them in functional networks involved in atherosclerosis. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway was confirmed by the up-regulation of IL-6, STAT1, ISGF3G and IL10RA genes in coronary and carotid plaques. These results and constructed functional network could be related to a central role for STAT protein and caveolae system to regulate the hypertension state.
