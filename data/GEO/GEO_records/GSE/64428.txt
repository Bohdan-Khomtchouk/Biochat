TITLE
Expression profiling of miR-294 and Mbd2 siRNA transfected Dgcr8-/- mESCs by high throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis on CTR, miR-294, and siMbd2 transfected Dgcr8-/- ESCs showed that Mbd2 is responsible for the change of expression of a significant portion of genes that are regulated by miR-290 cluster

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of CTR, miR-294 and siMbd2 transfected Dgcr8-/- ESCs were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using pair-end Illumina.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
