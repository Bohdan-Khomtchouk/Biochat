TITLE
Expression data from doxorubicin-treated Myxoid Liposarcoma cells and untreated control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite an improved survival of myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) patients, existing therapies have shortcomings including therapy resistance. To study the characteristics of therapy resistance in MLS, we treated three MLS cell lines with the commonly used chemotherapy drug doxorubicin and compared their gene expression profiles with untreated control cells.

DESIGN
Doxorubicin-treated and untreated samples from three different MLS cell lines were analyzed using an affymetrix array platform.

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
