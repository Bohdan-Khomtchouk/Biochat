TITLE
Expression data from leaves of Hordeum vulgare at seedling stage

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
A DNA microarray analysis detected large-scale changes of gene expression in response to Cd stress with a substantial difference between the two barley genotypes differing in Cd tolerance and accumulation. Cd stress led to higher expression of genes involved in transport, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-Cd-accumulating genotype. Novel transporter genes such as zinc transporter genes were identified as being associated with low Cd accumulation. We used microarrays to understand the mechanism of low Cd accumulation in crops which is crucial for sustainable safe food production in Cd-contaminated soils.

DESIGN
Barley leaves were selected at seedling stage in hydroponic experiment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain genes that were distinct differences in gene expression between the two genotypes after Cd treatment. To that end, we hand-selected barley leaves under control and Cd treatment conditions of two genotypes, i.e. leaves under control in low-grain-Cd-accumulating and Cd-sensitive genotyp W6nk2, leaves under control in high-grain-Cd-accumulating and tolerant genotype Zhenong8, Cd treated leaves in W6nk2, and Cd treated leaves in Zhenong8.
