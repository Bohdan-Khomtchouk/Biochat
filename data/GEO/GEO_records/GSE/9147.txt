TITLE
E-cadherin and EMT regulation by E47 transcription represor

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Expression profile analysis in MDCK-E47 cells in comparisom with MDCK CMV control cells Keywords: Genetic Modification (overexpression of E-cadherin repressors)

DESIGN
The Oncochip microarray platform v1.1 contains 9,726 clones corresponding to 6,386 different genes, and it includes 2,489 duplicate clones. Duplicate samples (different extrations of RNA)  were labeled with dUTP-Cy5 and hybridized against dUTP-Cy3-MDCK control cells. In addittion, one RNA extraction was labelled with dUTP-Cy3 and was hybridized againts dUTP-Cy5- CMV control cells
