Engineered ECMs modulate the expression profile of bone marrow-derived human MSC: implications for HSC self-renewal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bone marrow harbours multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that nurture haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an integral part of the bone marrow, and the aim of this study was therefore to (a) examine the effect of engineered ECM substrates on MSC gene expression over time, and (b) to determine the functional ability of ECM-cultured MSCs to support HSCs. ECMs were surface immobilised using films of maleic anhydride to covalently immobilise tropocollagen or fibrillar collagen type I to the substrate. Where indicated, collagen type 1 fibrils were supplemented with heparin or hyaluronic acid. All surfaces maintained MSC viability, though cell expansion was ECM dependent. Microarray analysis indicated that both time in culture and culture substrate were important factors regulating gene expression. Surprisingly, a number of MSC genes critical for the support of HSC self-renewal were down regulated during the study period. The functional effects of the different substrates were quantitatively assessed by determining cobblestone area-forming cell frequencies and colony-forming units (CFUs). Progenitor frequencies were similar for all substrates during the first 3 weeks in culture, but thereafter the reference material, plasma-treated polystyrene (PTP), outperformed ECM-based culture substrates, as predicted from expression studies. Likewise, PTP was able to maintain CFUs for extended periods, whereas HSCs rapidly exhausted themselves when cultured on any of the ECM substrates tested. The ability to regulate the expression of stromal factors using reconstituted ECM is exciting and warrants further studies to identify the ECM components/combinations that maximise the expansion of clonogenic HSCs.
