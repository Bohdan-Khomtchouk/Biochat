TITLE
Expression data from EBER1-overexpressing Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines KM-H2 and L428

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- encoded RNAs (EBERs) are aboundance in all EBV lantency, it was  found that EBERs may contribute to the oncogenesis. To study the role of EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) in Hodgkin lymphoma, we transfected Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, KMH2 and L428, with EBER1 and screen with microarrays to verify what is the possible role of the EBER1 in Hodgkin lymphoma.

DESIGN
We deliver EBER1-expressing plasmid (p9362-EBER1) or control plasmid (p9362) into the Hodgkin lymphoma, KM-H2 and L428,  and selected with GENETICIN to establish 4 stable clones: the EBER1-positive cell lines were named KE & LE, and the vector-only cell lines were named K9 & L9. We performed the microarray to show the effect of EBER1 on Hodgkin lymphoma. The data of KE was compare with K9 and LE was compare with L9.
