Expression data from EBER1-overexpressing Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines KM-H2 and L428

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- encoded RNAs (EBERs) are aboundance in all EBV lantency, it was  found that EBERs may contribute to the oncogenesis. To study the role of EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) in Hodgkin lymphoma, we transfected Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, KMH2 and L428, with EBER1 and screen with microarrays to verify what is the possible role of the EBER1 in Hodgkin lymphoma.
