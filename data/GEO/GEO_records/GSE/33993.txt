TITLE
Streptomyces griseus transcriptome analysis in liquid culture with delta adpA, encoding a global transcriptional regulator involved in morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism

ORGANISM
Streptomyces griseus

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by AdpA in liquid culture, transcriptome profiles between delta adpA strains with his-adpA and control delta adpA strains were analyzed.

DESIGN
Analysis used control delta adpA strain RNA as control samples for comparison to the his-adpA expressing delta adpA mutant strain.
