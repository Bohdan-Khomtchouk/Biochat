TITLE
To identify redox-dependent global regulator WhiB4 binding sites on Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
We have performed ChIP-Seq experiment for the redox-dependent global regulator WhiB4 in Mtb.

DESIGN
To understand the influence of WhiB4, we over-expressed FLAG-tagged WhiB4 in Mtb.
