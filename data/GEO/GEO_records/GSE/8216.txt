TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Cellulase induced hypersensitive reaction like response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Cellulase, a Type II secretion system secreted protein of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo; the casual of bacterial leaf blight of rice) is a potent inducer of   rice defense responses such as hypersensitive response like reactions (HR), callose depositions, cell death associated with nuclear fragmentations and impart functional resistance against further Xoo inoculation In order to understand the molecular events associated with cellulase induced HR in rice, whole genome transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips Keywords: Expression profiling of a hypersensitive reaction like response
