TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Cellulase induced hypersensitive reaction like response in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Cellulase, a Type II secretion system secreted protein of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo; the casual of bacterial leaf blight of rice) is a potent inducer of   rice defense responses such as hypersensitive response like reactions (HR), callose depositions, cell death associated with nuclear fragmentations and impart functional resistance against further Xoo inoculation In order to understand the molecular events associated with cellulase induced HR in rice, whole genome transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips Keywords: Expression profiling of a hypersensitive reaction like response

DESIGN
Leaves of 20 days old green house grown susceptible rice cultivar (Taichung Native-1; TN-1) were infiltrated with either 30-40μl of purified Xoo cellulase (5μg/ml) or with buffer (10mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0) alone (as described in Jha et al. 2007; MPMI vol 20, pp 31-40). The plants were shifted to a growth chamber (28oC; 80% relative humidity; 12/12h light/dark cycle) 48 hours before the treatment. 20-30 leaf pieces covering the infiltrated zone from each of the treatments were harvested 12 h after infiltration. Total RNA isolated from the pooled samples was subjected for expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip System. The experiment was repeated with three different biological replicates using RNA isolated from three batches of rice leaves treated with the freshly purified Xoo cellulase and the buffer
