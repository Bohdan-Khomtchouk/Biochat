TITLE
Prediction of response to FOLFOX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The patients who underwent surgery for primary lesions were examined. All patients had metastatic or recurrent CRC and received modified FOLFOX6. Responders and nonresponders were determined based on the best observed response at the end of the first-line treatment, mFOLFOX6. Gene-expression profiles of primary CRC were determined using Human Genome GeneChip arrays U133.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer were studied. To identify molecular signatures to predict response to mFOLFOX6 regimen, gene expression profiles were compared between Reponder and Non-responder. Some patients are overlapped with Bevacizumab therapy.
