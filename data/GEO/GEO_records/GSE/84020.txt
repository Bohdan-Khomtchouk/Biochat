TITLE
DNA methylation signatures of parental deprivation in peripheral tissues of male rhesus macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This study mapped the genome wide DNA methylation changes in whole blood and buccal swab samples of 2 year old male rhesus monkeys subjected to parental deprivation in their first months of life (surrogate peer-reared condition).

DESIGN
Equal numbers of control mother-reared (MR) and surrogate peer-reared (SPR) male monkeys whole blood (5 vs 5) and buccal swab samples (3 vs 3) were analyzed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with promoter tiling arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL22112 Agilent-037581 rhesus promoter tiling 2011 array (Feature number version)
