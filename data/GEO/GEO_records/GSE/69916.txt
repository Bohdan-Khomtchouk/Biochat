TITLE
Effect of MEG3 on p53 target genes in hepatoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) encodes a lncRNA which is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatoma cells, whose action is mediated by interaction with p53 protein to activate p53-mediated transcriptional activity and influence the expression of partial p53 target genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from hepatoma cells (HepG2 and SK-Hep-1) transfected with either control or MEG3 overexpression/knockdown constructs for global expression analysis.
