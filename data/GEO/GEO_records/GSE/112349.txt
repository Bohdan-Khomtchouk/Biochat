TITLE
Expression data from heat-damaged MHCC97H treated by HGF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Incomplete heat-damaged MHCC97H ususlly recurred. The mechanism of how residual HCC cells survive sublethal heat stress and develop rapid outgrowth remains poorly understood. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and downregulated genes under the treatment of HGF at different dosages.

DESIGN
Sample from heat-damaged MHCC97H treated by HGF for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to  identified distinct classes of up-regulated and downregulated genes during this process. To that end, we compared differential genes among three groups:  heat-damaged MHCC97H treated by HGF at 0 ng/ml, 2ng/ml, 10ng/ml.
