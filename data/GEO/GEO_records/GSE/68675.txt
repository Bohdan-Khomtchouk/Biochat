TITLE
Expression data from  wildtype and Tfr1 skeletal muscle KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tfr1 is important for iron uptake in red blood cells. We deleted Tfr1 in skeletal muscle to determine the role of Tfr1 in iron uptake in skeletal muscle. We used microarrays to identify global gene changes associated with deletion of Tfr1 in skeletal muscle

DESIGN
We used skeletal muscle and liver from wild type and Tfr1 skeletal muscle KO mice at postnatal day 5 and postnatal day 9. mRNA was extracted from the tissues, labaled and hibridized to Affymetrics microarrays.
