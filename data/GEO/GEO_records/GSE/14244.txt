TITLE
Hybrids assimilate organ-specific metastasis gene signatures from both parental cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Spontaneous cell fusion of MDA-MB-231 bone-metastatic subline Bm (i.e., SCP2) and lung metastatic subline Lm (i.e., LM2) gave rise to hybrid lines BLm-FACS or BLm-DRUG, as well as its single clones (#8, #12, #18). The hybrids acquired the metastasis tropisms from both parental cells. Expression profiles of the parental cells, the hybrids and several previously characterized MDA-MB-231 metastatic derivatives were compared. Hierarchical clustering showed the hybrids assimilated the organ-specific metastasis gene signatures from both parental cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison
