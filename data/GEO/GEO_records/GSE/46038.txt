TITLE
The effects of dietary selenium on selenocysteine incorporation and selenoprotein expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the effects of dietary selenium levels on translational control of selenoprotein synthesis in mouse liver.

DESIGN
Wild type mice and mice expressing a mutant Sec-tRNA gene (TrspA37G) were fed diets supplemented with 0, 0.1, or 2 ppm selenium for 6 weeks. Livers were harvested and ribosome and mRNA profiles were generated by deep-sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.
