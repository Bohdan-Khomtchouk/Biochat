TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in human macrophages in response to infection with recombinant A/WSN/33 influenza A viruses expressing wild type NS1 protein or its mutant R38A, K41A. [RPE]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (RPE) infected with influenza A viruses expressing wild type NS1 protein or its mutant R38A, K41A. The hypothesis tested was that R38 and K41 residues within viral NS1 protein are essential fro transctiptional control of cellluar gene expression. Cells were infected with influenza  A/WSN/33 viruses expressing wild type NS1 protein (WT), its R38A, K41A mutant (RK/AA) or non-infected (Mock)

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from RPE cells after 10 hours of infection with wild type or mutant influenza A virus (multiplicity of infection = 1)

PLATFORM
