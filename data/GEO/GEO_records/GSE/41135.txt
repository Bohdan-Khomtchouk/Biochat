TITLE
Expression analysis of tomato plants TYLCV resistant, susceptible and resistant line silenced in the hexose transporter (LeHT1) gene before and 7 days after inoculation of tomato with Tomato yellow leaf curl virus  (TYLCV).

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a resistance  susceptible  and  LeHT1-silenced resistance tomato plants, infected with TYLCV and compared to the non infected control. Two inbred tomato lines (named R and S) were used issued  from a breeding program  describe by Vidavsky and Czosnek, 1998, and Silencing of the hexose transporter gene LeHT1 and the properties of these plants have been described  by Eybishtz et al., 2010.

DESIGN
The array was designed to include all the known tomato genes retrieved from TIGR and Sol Genomics public databases. Following filtration for redundancies, 25,591 known genes and 7,335 uncertain or unknown genes were retrieved The data were transferred to Roche NimblGen company ( http://www.nimblegen.com/ ) who has generated a 60-mer oligonucleotide array where each of the ~30,000 tomato genes is represented by at least two specific probes, and unrelated controls. Each slide contains four arrays of ~70,000 oligos. TYLCV resistant and susceptible lines infection with TYLCV and LeHT1  silenced TYLCV resistant line infected with TYLCV
