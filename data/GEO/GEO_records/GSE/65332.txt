TITLE
Transcriptome changes for Hirschfeldia incana in response to lead exposure

ORGANISM
Hirschfeldia incana

SUMMARY
Experiments were achieved on Hirschfeldia incana, a Brassicaceae collected from metalliferous mine spoils as a Pb accumulator plant. Transcriptional profiling of roots and shoots from plants treated with lead were compared to plants treated in similar conditions without lead. Four weeks old H. incana seedlings were treated in hydroponic cultures with Pb during 3 days, by adding or not 100 ÂµM Pb(NO3)2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, lead treated vs. untreated. Biological replicates: 3

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
