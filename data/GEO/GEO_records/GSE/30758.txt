TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal cells from the uterine cervix in a nested prospective case control study within the ARTISTIC trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in normal cells from the uterine cervix (liquid based cytology samples), obtained from 152 women in a nested prospective case-control study within the ARTISTIC trial. Out of the 152 women, 75 developed a cervical intraepitelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) after 3 years of sample collection. The rest of women (77) remained disease free (CIN2-).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 152 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
