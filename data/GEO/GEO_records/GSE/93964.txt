TITLE
Expression data from human colorectal cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor suppressor candidate-3 (TUSC3/N33) is a subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase in the endoplasmatic reticulum and catalyzes N-glycosylation of membrane and secretory proteins. The aim of the study was to identify target genes for TUSC3 in human colorectal cancer cells. We used microarrays to reveal the global programme of gene expression in TUSC3-mediated glycan and protein processing at the endoplasmatic reticulum and identified distinct up- and down-regulated target genes involved in cell survival and apoptosis.

DESIGN
We transiently transfected SW480 cells in triplicates with empty vector (EV) or the putative tumor suppressor candidate-3 (TUSC3) and hybridized the cRNA to microarrays.
