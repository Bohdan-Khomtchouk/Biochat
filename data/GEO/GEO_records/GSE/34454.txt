TITLE
Expression data from transfection of SW1783 glioma cells with microRNA-376a* for 24 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enforced expression of miRNAs in cells leads to down-regulation of several mRNAs which harbour binding sites in their 3'UTRs for the overexpressed miRNA and represent potential target genes of the miRNA We transfected unedited miR-376a* (376a*A) and edited miR-376a* (376a*G) into SW1783 cells to identify transcripts down-regulated by each in comparison to control  miRNA transfection. The aim was to identify target genes subject to direct regulation by miR-376a*A and by miR-376a*G.

DESIGN
SW1783 cells (100,000) were transfected with 50 nM of miR-376a*A, miR-376a*G or miR-control. Following incubation for 24 hours, total RNA was isolated from transfected cells. For each (miR-376a*A or miR-376a*G), genes differentially expressed upon miRNA transfection were determined based on comparison with miR-control-transfected samples. Biological triplicates were used for each sample type.
