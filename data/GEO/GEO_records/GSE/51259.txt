TITLE
CD271 on melanoma cell is an IFN-γ-inducible immunosuppressive factor that mediates downregulation of melanoma antigens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have identified candidates for IFN-γ-inducible CTLs-suppressive factors in melanoma cells using cDNA microarray analysis

DESIGN
Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized from mRNAs extracted from melanoma cell lines that express melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) and HLA-A*0201 (526mel, 1833mel, 2487mel, and 501Amel), with or without pretreatment with recombinant human IFN-γ (rhIFN-γ, 1000 U/mL, 48hours).

PLATFORM
