TITLE
Single Cas9 nickase induced generation of NRAMP1 knockin cattle with reduced off-target effects

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified the main binding sites of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein in bovine fetal fibroblast cells (BFFs) in an unbiased manner.

DESIGN
In the present study, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed on catalytically inactive double mutant (D10A and H840A) Cas9 (dCas9)(Mali et al. 2013a; Yang et al. 2013) protein binding site detection in bovine fetal fibroblast cells (BFFs), followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq); we found that single Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)(Cong et al. 2013; Ran et al. 2013a)-mediated single-strand break (SSB) had the potential to restrict repair to the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway.
