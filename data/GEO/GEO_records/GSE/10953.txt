TITLE
Cellular pathways involved in the adaptation and progression of motor neuron injury in the mouse model of familial ALS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis has been applied to the study of ALS in order to investigate gene expression in whole spinal cord homogenates of SOD1 G93A mice and human ALS cases, although the massive presence of glial cells and inflammatory factors has made it difficult to define which gene expression changes were motor neuron specific. Recently, laser capture microdissection (LCM), combined with microarray analysis, has allowed the identification of motor neuron specific changes in gene expression in human ALS cases. The aim of the present study is to combine LCM and microarray analysis to study how motor neurons in the spinal cord of transgenic SOD1 G93A mice and transgenic SOD1 WT respond to stimuli determined by the presence of the human mutant protein throughout the evolution of the stages in motor neuron injury Keywords: Murine motor neurons

DESIGN
Motor neurons have been isolated from the spinal cord of G93A mice and non transgenic littermates at different time points and the transcription expression profile of the isolated motor neurons has been analysed
