TITLE
Molecular Signatures in Skin Associated with Clinical Improvement During Mycophenolate Treatment in Systemic Sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin gene expression signatures, including intrinsic subset, are associated with skin score/MRSS improvement during mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment.

DESIGN
Gene expression and intrinsic subset assignment were measured in SSc patients amd  controls at baseline, and from biopsies of MMF-treated patients.
