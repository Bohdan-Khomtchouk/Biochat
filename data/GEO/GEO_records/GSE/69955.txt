TITLE
Mouse ES cells expressing catalytically inactive Ring1B display impaired Ring1B and H3K27me3 deposition.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 and Ring1B was performed in WT mESCs and mESCs containing catalytically inactive Ring1B (I53A mutant). Cells expressing catalytically inactive Ring1B maintain the spatial distribution of Ring1B and H3K27me3 but at reduced levels. These findings support the notion that PRC2 recruitment is, in part, dependent on H2A ubiquitination (H2AK119ub).

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were performed for Ring1B and H3K27me3 ChIPs in WT and Ring1B I53A/I53A mouse ESCs. Input chromatin was sequenced for each replicate as a control for ChIP enrichment.
