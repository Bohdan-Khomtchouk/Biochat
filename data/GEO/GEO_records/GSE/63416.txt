TITLE
Inhibition of transcriptional elongation in the P5424 T cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We study the impact of inhibiting Pol II-Se2 phosphorylation on Pol II binding and histone modifications in the mouse T cell line P5424.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis via ChIP-Seq for total RNA Pol II binding, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in murine P5424 cells with tow conditions: KM05283 treatment (Inhibitor of Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation) or control DMSO.
