SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Richard Sandstrom ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track, produced as part of the ENCODE Project, contains deep sequencing DNase data that will be used to identify sites where regulatory factors bind to the genome (footprints). Footprinting is a technique used to define the DNA sequences that interact with and bind DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors, zinc-finger proteins, hormone-receptor complexes, and other chromatin-modulating factors like CTCF. The technique depends upon the strength and tight nature of protein-DNA interactions. In their native chromatin state, DNA sequences that interact directly with DNA-binding proteins are relatively protected from DNA degrading endonucleases, while the exposed/unbound portions are readily degraded by such endonucleases. A massively parallel next-generation sequencing technique to define the DNase hypersensitive sites in the genome was adopted. Sequencing these next-generation-sequencing DNase samples to significantly higher depths of 300-fold or greater produces a base-pair level resolution of the DNase susceptibility maps of the native chromatin state. These base-pair resolution maps represent and are dependent upon the nature and the specificity of interaction of the DNA with the regulatory/modulatory proteins binding at specific loci in the genome; thus they represent the native chromatin state of the genome under investigation. The deep sequencing approach has been used to define the footprint landscape of the genome by identifying DNA motifs that interact with known or novel DNA binding proteins.
