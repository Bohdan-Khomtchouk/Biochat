TITLE
Identification of calcineurin- and Crz1-dependent targets in Candida glabrata

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
In order to identify calcineurin pathway-regulated genes, we compared the genome-wide expression profile of wild-type with FK506-treated wild-type, cna1, and crz1 mutants. We expect that FK506-treated wild-type will have similar expression profile with that of the cna1 mutant. In response to calcineurin inhibitor FK506, the up- and down-regulated by FK506 were 113 and 87 genes, respectively (cutoff q < 0.001). The genes regulated by FK506 are largely overlapped (90%, 180/200) with those of cna1 mutant. Interestingly, FK506 induced 20 distinct genes other than that of the cna1 mutant. These genes encode proteins involved in plasma membrane ATP-bindding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters (PDR15, PDR5, and YOR1), amino acid transporters (ALP1 and YBT1), and transcription factors (CUP2 and INO2). We also identified 34 genes regulated by calcineurin and Crz1. These genes encode proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis (YPS5, YPS1, YSR3, YPC1, PIR1, HOR7, and NTE1), heat shock protein responses (SBA1 and GRE2), regulator of calcineurin (RCN2), and other functions.
