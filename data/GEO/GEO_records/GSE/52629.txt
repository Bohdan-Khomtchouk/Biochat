TITLE
Tumorigenic-enriched (TE) and lung-metastatic (LM) derivatives and parental populations from the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and CN34 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The LM2 derivative cell line is described in Minn et al. Nature 2005. The LM1a derivative cell line is described in Tavazoie et al. Nature 2008.

DESIGN
Tumorigenic-enriched (TE) and lung-metastatic (LM) derivatives and their respective parental populations, from the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and CN34 cell lines were transcriptomically compared in order to identify candidate regulators of breast cancer tumor re-initiation.
