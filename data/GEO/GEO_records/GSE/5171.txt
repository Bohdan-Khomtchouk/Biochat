TITLE
Transcription profiling of CD133/Prominin positive neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify expression of hematopoetic stem cell antigens in cerebral cortical derived neurospheres Keywords: Compared CD133 positive neurospheres to control GFP-positive neurospheres

DESIGN
We analyzed 12, dual labeled, 23K Mouse arrays where one channel (Ch1) represents the treatment (GFP or prominin positive neurospheres) and the other channel (Ch2) represents the universal embryonic mouse control "
