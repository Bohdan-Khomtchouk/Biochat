TITLE
Mammalian sperm exhibit epigenetic priming of embryonic and adult regulatory landscapes (BS-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian sperm genome is generally thought to be condensed and transcriptionally inert. Here we show that most promoters in mouse sperm contain elongating RNA polymerase II and are flanked by several positioned nucleosomes marked by a variety of active histone modifications. The sperm genome is bound by several transcription factors, including Nanog, Oct4, Mediator, condensin, and the pioneer factor FoxA1. These proteins are found at promoters, enhancers, and super-enhancers, many of which are active in mESCs or adult tissues. CTCF and cohesin are also present in sperm DNA, where they mediate interactions that organize the sperm genome into domains and compartments that overlap extensively with those found in mESCs. These results indicate that the sperm genome is rich in epigenetic information and   primed for its expression during embryonic and adult life, and suggest mechanisms by which environmental effects on the paternal germline can be transmitted trans-generationally.
