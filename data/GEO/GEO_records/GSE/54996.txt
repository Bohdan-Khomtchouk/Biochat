TITLE
DNA METHYLATION DURING αβ T CELL DEVELOPMENT IN THE HUMAN THYMUS [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thymocyte differentiation is a complex process which involves well-defined sequential developmental stages that finally result in the generation of mature αβ and γδ T cells. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and gene expression profiles at successive human thymus developmental stages from early T-cell progenitors to single positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations

DESIGN
Expression data sets were generated from two technical replicates per cell type. Samples were obtained from a pool of  3 individuals each.
