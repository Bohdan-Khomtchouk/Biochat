TITLE
Transcription profiles of WT and CreER-Raptor-flox/flox common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), or lineage negative (Lin-) stimulated with M-CSF for 12 hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myelopoiesis is impaired in Raptor-deleted mice (CreER-Rptor-flox/flox). To evaluate the transcriptional changes in myeloid precursors , we isolated CMP (Lin–Sca-1–c-Kit+CD34+FcγRII/IIImid), GMP (Lin–Sca-1–c-Kit+CD34+FcγRII/IIIhigh) and Lin (B220, Ly6C, Ly6G, CD3, Ter-119) negative cells (Lin–) from bone marrow of WT or CreER-Rptor-flox/flox mice. RNA was isolated from CMP and GMP immediately after sorting and Lin- cells were cultured for 12 hours with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) in 10% FBS and 1% P/S DMEM before RNA isolation. We used microarrays to compare the global transcription profiles of CMP, GMP, or Lin– stimulated with M-CSF for 12 hours from WT and CreER-Raptor-flox/flox mice.

DESIGN
We analyzed a total of 20 samples: CMP (6: 3 WT, 3 CreER-Rptor-flox/flox), GMP (6: 3 WT, 3 CreER-Rptor-flox/flox), Lin– + M-CSF (8: 4 WT, 4 CreER-Rptor-flox/flox)
