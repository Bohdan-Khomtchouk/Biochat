TITLE
Transcription profiling of A. thaliana L.er vs fe-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana Myb transcription factor, FE, acts as a key regulator of phase transition. In order to identify potential target genes of FE protein, we performed microarray experiments. Using fe-1 and transgenic plants overexpressing GR-tagged FE (35S::FE-GR), we compared transcriptional profiling of WT (L.er) vs fe-1 and Dex-treated 35S::FE-GR vs Mock-treated 35S::FE-GR. Transcriptional profiling of A. thaliana comparing WT (L.er) with the fe-1 mutant

DESIGN
WT (L.er) vs fe-1: 2 biological replicates. Dex vs Mock treatment of 35S::FE-GR (#5)

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
