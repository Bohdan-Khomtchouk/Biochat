TITLE
Angiopoietin-like 4 Increases Pulmonary Vascular Leakiness and Lung Tissue Damage during Influenza Pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
cANGPTL4 has been shown by our experiments to be associated to influenza-induced pneumonia pathogenesis. cANGPTL4 was produced in abundance during infection and inflammation and showed involvment in regulating blood vessel permeability. By using anti-cANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody, we want to see the overall effect of this antibody treatment, to evaluate the potential of anti-cANGPTL4 antibody as a possible treatment method for pneumonia, and also to gain more insight into the role of cANGPTL4 in infection and inflammation. We used microarrays to detail the global impact of anti-cANGPTL4 antibody treatment to see the possible mechanism pathways involved, as well as to identify the possible side effects caused by anti-cANGPTL4 antibody treatment to evaluate its potential as a treatment method.

DESIGN
Mouse lungs were harvested at different timepoints before and after antibody injection to see the changes caused by antibody injection as well as the overall trend during disease progression. To this end, we infected the mice and injected antibodies starting from day 13 post infection. We did the first harvest of lungs at day 12, before the antibody injection was started, to get a starting status to reflect the effect of antibody treatment. Samples harvested at day 14 post infection was analyzed to see the effect caused by antibody injection after 24 hours, and samples harvested at day 18 post infection was analyzed as the end point because our previous experiments showed significantly improved recovery at day 18 after antibody treatment.
