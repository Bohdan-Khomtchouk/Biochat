TITLE
The effect of PPAR-alpha agonist on the gene expression in mice hypothalamus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that bezafibrate, PPAR-alpha agonist, increased EEG delta oscillation throughout 24 hours and decreased body temperature especially in the later half of the dark period in mice. This DNA- microarray experiment was performed due to investigate the gene expression at ZT10, when body temperature showed no difference between nomal- and bezafibrate-treated mice, and ZT22, when body temperature showed the largest difference between the groups. Keywords: drug treatment, time course

DESIGN
Both bezafibrate-treated and control mice were decapitated at each ZT10 and ZT22. Total RNA were purified from the hypothalamus of these mice. The one GSM sample of microarray analysis was resulted from equal amount of total RNA mixture of 4 mice in the same condition. Hybridizations were performed using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome oligonucleotide microarray.
