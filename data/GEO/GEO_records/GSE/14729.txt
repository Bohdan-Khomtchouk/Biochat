TITLE
A transcriptomic analysis of super-hybrid rice LYP9 and its parental lines

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Using a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray designed based on known and predicted indica rice genes, we investigated transcriptome profiles in developing leaves and panicles of super hybrid rice LYP9 and its parental cultivar 93-11 and PA64s. We detected 22,266 expressed genes out of 36,926 total gene set collectively from seven tissues, including leaves at seedling and tillering stages, flag leaves at booting, heading, flowering, and filling stages, and panicle at filling stage. Clustering result showed that expression profiles between F1 and its parental lines were always more similar than that between the two parental lines. Out of the total gene set, 7,078 were shared by all sampled tissues and 3,926 (10.6%) were differentially-expressed genes (DG). As we divided DG into those between the parents (DGPP) and between the hybrid and its parents (DGHP), the comparative results showed that genes in the two categories, Energy metabolism and transport, were enriched in DGHP rather than in DGPP. The majority of genes were identified as additive expression, and non-additive expression only took a minority (0.53%-1.35%) of the total genes. In addition, we correlated the concurrence of DG and yield-related QTL, providing a potential group of genes as heterosis-related.

DESIGN
We investigated transcriptome profiles in developing leaves and panicles of super hybrid rice LYP9 and its parental cultivar 93-11 and PA64s for seven tissues, and there are at least three independent replicates for each sample pair.
