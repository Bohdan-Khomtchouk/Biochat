TITLE
Bird Factors integrate positional signals to coordinate asymmetric cell division and cell fate

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sorted for GFP+ cells using the enhancer trap J0571 with the UAS promoter driving the expression of different BIRD genes. Different genetic backgrounds are use and listed below.

DESIGN
Seedlings were grown for 5 days.  J0571 and J0571-UAS-BIRDS sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.
