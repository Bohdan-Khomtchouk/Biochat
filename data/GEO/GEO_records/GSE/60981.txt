TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of responsive gene expression by eIF2α phosphatase inhibitors in multiple myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mechano-regulation of eIF2α phosphatases in multiple myeloma cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was Guanbenz (GBZ) and Sal003, 2 different eIF2α phosphatases induce different responses in multiple myeloma cells . Results provide important information of the responses of multiple myeloma cells, such as specific mechano-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated specific cellular functions

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from control RPMI8226 cells and cells exposed to either 50 μM GBZ or 20 μM Sal003 for 24 hr in triplicate using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Quality and quantity of RNA was determined by Agilent Bioanalyzer.  Microarray hybridization was undertaken using Illumina® Whole-Genome Gene Expression Human HT-12 v4 expression and the data analysed by Partek Genome Suite 6.6 software.
