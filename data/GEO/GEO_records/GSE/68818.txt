TITLE
RNA-seq gene expression profiling in resting murine B cells from WT or KMT2D knockout mice, before and after stimulation with LPS, IL4, and anti-CD180

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Resting B cells were isolated from WT or KMTD KO mice by immunomagentic depletion of with anti-CD43 beads. Gene expression use determined by RNAseq in resting B cells or B cells stimulated with LPS, IL4, and anti-mouse CD180 for 3 days.

DESIGN
RNAseq was used to profile unstimulated resting B cells (n=3) and B cells stimulated for 3 days (n=3).
