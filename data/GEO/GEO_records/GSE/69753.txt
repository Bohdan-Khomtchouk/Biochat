TITLE
Long non-coding RNA landscape in human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the lncRNAs transcribed in the human primary monocyte cells. We performed deep RNA sequencing from four healthy individuals. In addition, the raw RNA-Seq data from 11 human monocyte samples were selected from public databases and generated a total ~1.7 billion reads. We identified ~ 8,000 lncRNAs from all the datasets of which more than 1,000 of them have not been previously reported in monocytes. We also validated a few of these novel lncRNAs in monocytes and other hematopoetic cell types. The other 11 datasets were taken from the following: ENCSR000CUC 6 samples E-MTAB-2399 4 samples GSM1526678
