TITLE
PLC/PRF/5 cells ChIP on CHIP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PLC/PRF/5 cells were harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by CHIP analysis performed on Aligent platform.

DESIGN
PLC/PRF/5 harbors p53 R249S mutation that was utilized for ChIP on CHIP analysis to identify p53-R249S specific DNA sequence.

PLATFORM
GPL8169 Agilent-014706 Human Promoter ChIP-on-Chip Set 244K, Microarray 1 of 2 G4489A (Probe name version) GPL8170 Agilent-014707 Human Promoter ChIP-on-Chip Set 244K, Microarray 2 of 2 G4489A (Probe name version)
