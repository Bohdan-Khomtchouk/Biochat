TITLE
Transcriptomics and proteomics show selenium affects inflammation, cytoskeleton and cancer pathways in human rectal biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were carried out on rectal mucosal biopsies from 22 healthy adults with either optimal (n=11, mean plasma Se =1.43μmol/l, s.e.m ±0.06) or sub-optimal (n=11, mean plasma Se = 0.86umol/l, s.e.m ± 0.01) plasma Se status. Plasma Se status was associated with altered expression of 254 genes implicated in cancer, immune function and inflammatory response, cell growth and proliferation, cellular movement and cell death; 69 out of 254 genes had their expression significantly correlated with Se status, including two selenoprotein genes (SEPW1 and SELK). Proteomics identified 26 proteins differentially expressed between the two Se groups, including cytoskeletal proteins and factors involved in immune and inflammatory response and cancer pathways. Results from proteomics and transcriptomics support each other and integration of the two datasets was consistent with a reduced inflammatory and immune responses and a cytoskeleton remodelling in the rectal mucosa of individuals with sub-optimal Se status.
