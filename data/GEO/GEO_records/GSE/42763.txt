TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving glatiramer acetate therapy [U133 Plus 2.0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptional effects induced by glatiramer acetate treatment (GA; Copaxone, 20 mg injected subcutaneously once daily) in blood monocytes of patients with relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). By using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we obtained genome-wide expression profiles of monocytes from 8 MS patients within the first two months of GA administration.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first and second GA injection as well as after 1 week, 1 month and 2 months. Total RNA of CD14+ monocytes isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) from each sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays to quantify the mRNA levels. This GEO entry provides the U133 Plus 2.0 microarray data.
