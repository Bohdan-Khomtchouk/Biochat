TITLE
Abundant transcripts from retrotransposons are unstable in fully-grown mouse oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
One physiological function proposed for RNA interference (RNAi) is to constrain expression of repetitive elements and thereby reduce the incidence of retrotransposition.  Consistent with this model is that inhibiting the RNAi pathway results in an increase in expression of repetitive elements in preimplantation mouse embryos.  Mouse oocytes are essentially transcriptionally quiescent providing a unique opportunity to assess the stability of repetitive element-derived transcripts in these cells.  We compared the transcriptome of freshly isolated fully-grown germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes to that of oocytes in which meiotic maturation in vitro was inhibited for 48 h by milrinone.  Consistent with the aforementioned function for RNAi is that the abundance of only a relatively small number of transcripts decreased in the cultured oocytes, when compared to changes that occur during maturation or following fertilization, and of those, several belonged to mobile elements. Keywords: untreated GV oocytes and GV oocytes cultured in milrinone for 48h
