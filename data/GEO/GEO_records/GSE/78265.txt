TITLE
Murine BCC Cells: dio3 interfered vs control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling of mouse basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cells comparing BCC cells transfected with a stealth for dio3 transcript or control stealth-RNA.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Stealth-D3 vs Stealth-CTR cells. Biological replicates: 3 Stealth-D3 and 3 Stealth-CTR, independently grown and harvested. Single RNA were pooled. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
