TITLE
Expression data from U87 xenograft tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
U87 xenograft tumors treated with scrambled siRNA (Tas_73, Tas_78) or siRNA against VDAC1 (Tas_57, Tas_61) We used microarrays to detail the global effect of siRNA against VDAC1 on subcotenous xenograft U87 cells tumors

DESIGN
U87 GBM xenograft treated with scrambled siRNA or VDAC1 siRNA were excised for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
