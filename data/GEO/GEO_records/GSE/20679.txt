TITLE
mRNA expression profile modified by microRNA mir-517a (MIR517A) in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression profile modified by stable transfection of microRNA mir-517a (MIR517A) in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7 Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Expression array, microRNA

DESIGN
microRNA mir-517a (MIR517A) was transfected to Huh-7 cells using GFP-expressing lentiviral vector. Infected cells were selected using flow cytometry and subjected to mRNA expression microarray experiment. The profiles were compared to controls cells infected with only GFP protein.
