TITLE
Expression data from Prkch-/-Apoe-/- mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine function of PKCh for atherosclerosis, we compared the gene expression profiles of control Apoe-/- and Prkch-/-Apoe-/- mice by microarray analysis. In peritoneal macrophages, higher expression of Arginase, type II gene were found in Prkch-/-Apoe-/- cells. Expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were upregulated in Prkch-/-Apoe-/- liver.

DESIGN
Mice used in this study were backcrossed onto C57BL/6J for more than 12 generations. Total RNA from pritoneal macrophages, aorta and liver of Apoe-/- and Prkch-/-Apoe-/- mice mice was prepared using ISOGEN and RNeasy Mini kits.  For cDNA synthesis from samples prepared from macrophages and liver, total RNA was added to poly-A control and treated with WT Expression Kit. cDNA was labeled using WT terminal labeling kit and hybridized with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform (GPL6246). For cDNA synthesis from samples prepared from aorta, total RNA pooled from 4 independent mice was used for biotin-labeled cRNA synthesis using one-cycle target labeling and control reagents (Affymetrix), and the labeled cRNA was subjected to hybridization with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 platform (GPL8321).
