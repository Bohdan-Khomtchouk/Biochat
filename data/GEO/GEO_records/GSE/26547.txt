TITLE
Molecular and metabolic effects of norUDCA in Abcb4 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify (i) target genes relevant for the disease development (WT vs. Abcb4-/- mice) and (ii) to gain insights into mechanisms leading to the reversal of chronic cholestatic liver injury in Abcb4-/- mice treated with the side-chain modified bile acid " norUDCA " (Abcb4-/- mice vs. norUDCA treated Abcb4-/- mice).

DESIGN
Samples were analyzed in duplicates for each genotype and treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL2995 ABI Mouse Genome Survey Microarray
