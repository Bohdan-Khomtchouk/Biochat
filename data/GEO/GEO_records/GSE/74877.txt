TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of different cell types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed whole-genome methylation analysis using 450K Illumina BeadArrays on different human cell types. In total 24 experiments were performed. Dermal fibroblasts, three different epidermal melanocytes (dark, medium and light pigmentation), epidermal keratinocytes, mammary fibroblasts, mammary epithelial cells, mammary endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells were analyzed in technical duplicates. Unmethylated DNA were analyzed in technical duplicates. Two different normal breast tissue samples were analyzed. Finally peripheral blood leukocytes and an enzymatically methylated sample were analyzed.

DESIGN
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of different cell types using Illumina Human Methylation 450K Beadchips.
