TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the adult carotid body stem cell niche

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The carotid body (CB) is a peripheral chemoreceptor organ that suffers a profound angiogenic and neurogenic process in response to hypoxemia, to contribute to physiological adaptation of the organism. We have previously described a subpopulation of neural crest-derived stem cells residing in the organ. These cells are responsible for hypoxia-induced neurogenesis. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this neurogenic process.

DESIGN
We have used neuronal cell-enriched neurosphere (NS) cultures vs. undifferentiated cell-enriched NS to study molecular pathways involved in the biology of these CB different cell types.
