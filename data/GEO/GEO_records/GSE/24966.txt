TITLE
The effects of novel adjuvant complex and CpG ODN on host immune response to recombinant Eimeria profilin vaccine

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study investigated the ability of two novel adjuvant formulations, QCDC (Quil A/cholesterol/DDA/Carbopol) and QCDCR (QCDC/Bay R1005), in combination with a recombinant profilin vaccine, to modulate host protective immunity and to alter new gene expression during experimental avian coccidiosis.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, Profilin only vs. Non-vaccination, Profilin only vs. Co-vaccination of QCDC plus profilin, Profilin only vs. Co-vaccination of QCDCR plus profilin, Biological replicates: 2 profilin only replicates, 2 Non-vaccination replicates, 2 QCDC plus profilin replicates, 2 QCDCR plus profilin replicates with dye-switching.
