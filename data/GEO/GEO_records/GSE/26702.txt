TITLE
Genome wide analysis of pancreatic gene expression by Interleukin 1β in human epithelial pancreatic Mia Paca-2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the pancreatic gene expression with IL-1β stimulation. Components of the integrin pathway were significantly altered with IL-1β which play critical role in the execution of apoptosis.The results revealed several important cellular pathways and the biological processes of the genes (Up and Downregulated) altered by IL-1β induction.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from cells incubated in the absence (Control) and presence of IL-1β (2ng/ml) for 36 hours. These were then subjected to microarray hybridisation in a WG_6_V3 bead chip, Illumina. Differentially expressed genes were functionally categorised into biological processess and cellular pathways using the PANTHER Classification system. The significantly emerging cellualr pathway was validated by Western Blot analyses.
