TITLE
mRNA profile of dG9a-depleted early embryo in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Immunocytochemical studies revealed that dG9a moves into nucleus after cycle 8 and appears to regulate gene expression by di-methylating H3K9 from cycle 8 to cycle 11. To determine which genes are regulated by dG9a during cycles 8-11, we examined mRNA levels by performing RNA-sequence analysis using early embryos (0-2 h after egg laying) of dG9a null mutant and wild type as a control

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of about 0-2h-old embryos of wild type (CantonS) and dG9a-depleted (dG9aRG5) strain

PLATFORM
GPL11203 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Drosophila melanogaster)
