TITLE
Identification of a novel Bromodomain / Casein Kinase II / TAF-containing complex as a regulator of mitotic condensin function

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ABSTRACT: Condensin is a central regulator of mitotic genome structure, with mutants showing poorly condensed chromosomes and profound segregation defects. Here we identify the fission yeast NCT complex, comprising the Nrc1 BET-family tandem bromodomain protein (SPAC631.02), Casein Kinase II (CKII) and several TAFs, as a novel regulator of condensin function (where NCT mutants restore the formation of segregation-competent chromosomes in cells containing defective condensin). Synchronous ChIP-seq shows that NCT and condensin bind similar genomic regions, but only briefly co-localize during the periods of chromosome condensation and decondensation. These results are consistent with a model where NCT targets CKII to chromatin in a cell cycle-directed manner to modulate the activity of condensin during chromosome condensation and decondensation.

DESIGN
DATA:  Study includes ChIP-seq of fission yeast H3-K4Me3, H3-K36Me3, TBP, Taf7, Nrc1, Cka1 from aynchronous cells; Nrc1 and Cut3 (representing condensin) from four synchronized cell-cycle stages estimated as G2/M, Metaphase, Anaphase and G1/S.
