TITLE
Interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae WW domains and proteins discovered using protein microarrays

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A total of 12 WW domains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were expressed and purified as fusion proteins to either GST or MBP.  The fusion proteins were chemically biotinylated and applied to duplicate protein microarrays.  Data processing revealed a total of 587 interactions between the domains and 207 proteins.  Most of these interactions have not been previously observed. Keywords: Protein microarray analysis of yeast WW domains

DESIGN
We analyzed a total of 12 WW domains from S.cerevisiae, each on duplicate protoarrays.
