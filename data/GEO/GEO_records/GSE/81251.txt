TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Kdm6a deficient brains in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kdm6a is an X-linked histone demethylase that activates gene expression via removal of the repressive methylation mark at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). In humans, KDM6A mutations cause Kabuki syndrome, a disorder characterized by intellectual disability and motor coordination deficits. To assess the role of Kdm6a in brain development and behavior, we generated a neuron-specific Kdm6a deficient mouse model using Cre-LoxP recombination. The mutant mice exhibited an adult-onset deficit in motor coordination. We then performed RNA-seq analysis to determine the mis-regulated genes that are listed in this dataset.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression was determined in the brain between 3 adult male Kdm6a deficient and 3 wild type littermate mice.
