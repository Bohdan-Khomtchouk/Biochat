TITLE
Gene expression in mouse tracheal basal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial basal cells (BCs) are an important stem cell population of the airways.  We purified BCs from a KRT5-GFP transgenic mouse line and used Affymetrix arrays to compare there gene expression to that of non-BC epithelium.

DESIGN
Three populations of cells were obtained by FACS: 1. KRT5-GFP-, lectin- columnar epithelium. 2. KRT5-GFP-, lectin+ BCs. 3. KRT5-GFP+, lectin+ BCs.  Three biological replicates of each sample were hybridized to Affymetrix microarray.
