TITLE
Gene expression profiles mas5D, ssa2D, hsf1-overexpressing and heat-stressed wild type Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The cells with the impaired Hsp40/Hsp70 chaperone complex Mas5/Ssa2 exhibit a transriptional response that is simillar to that of cells with the elevated levels of the heat-shock factor 1 (Hsf1) or heat-stressed wild type fission yeast cells

DESIGN
A total of 6 experimental conditions has been analyzed including control samples, no replicates were made

PLATFORM
