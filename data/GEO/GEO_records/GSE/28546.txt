TITLE
Molecular characterization of immortalization of human MSCs by a combination of p53 knockdown and TERT overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of p53 knockdown MSCs or p53 knockdown+TERT MSCs was compared with that of control MSCs. Our data show p53 knockdown prolongs the lifespan of MSCs, and a combination of p53 knockdown and TERT overexpression is sufficient to immortalize MSCs. The results provide important information about the molecular basis underlying p53 knockdown in MSCs and immortalization-related genes of MSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from p53 knockdown MSCs or p53 knockdown+TERT MSCs from three patients were compared with control MSCs.
