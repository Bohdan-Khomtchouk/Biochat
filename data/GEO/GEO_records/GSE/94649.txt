TITLE
Serum microRNA profile of human type 1 diabetes mellitus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate whether serum micoRNAs can be biomarkers for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, we analyzed the serum microRNA expression profiles in 6 patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus and 6 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. A difference was observed in 31 miRNAs between the patients and controls (fold change â‰¥ 2, P < 0.05)

DESIGN
6 serum samples from patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus and 6 serum samples from age- and gender-matched healthy controls

PLATFORM
GPL18402 Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
