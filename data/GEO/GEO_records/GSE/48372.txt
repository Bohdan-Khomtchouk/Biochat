TITLE
The PR/SET domain Zinc finger protein Prdm4 regulates gene expression in ES cells but plays a non-essential role in the developing mouse embryo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq using anti-GFP antibody to map genomic binding of Prdm4-EGFP in stably transfected mouse embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
Two independent ChIP-seq replicates for each of two independent Prdm4-EGFP expressing ES cell clones resulting in four anti-GFP ChIP-seq experiments.  These samples have paired mouse IgG control.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
