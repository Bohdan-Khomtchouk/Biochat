TITLE
T. thermophilus HB8 alternative sigma factor sigE (TTHB211) deletion mutant strain, TT medium, 8 h

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of sigE (TTHB211) deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TT) medium at 70 degC.

DESIGN
Three TTHB211 deletion mutant T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70 degC. Cells were collected after 8 h, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA were analyzed on a GeneChip.
