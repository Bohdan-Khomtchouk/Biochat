TITLE
Gene expression comparison between undifferentiated H9 cells and trophoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Undifferentiated H9 express high levels of c-Myc.  Upon differentiation, Myc levels decrease.  Gene expression analysis was carried out between these 2 cell types

DESIGN
H9 cells were treated with BMP-4 for 6 days in order to differentiate them toward a trophoblast lineage.
