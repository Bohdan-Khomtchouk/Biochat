TITLE
Retinoid X receptors orchestrate osteoclast differentiation and postnatal bone remodeling [RXR and PPARg]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data from nuclear receptors RXR and PPARg binding to the genome was visualized using Genome Browser (UCSC) in order to test their role in Mafb transcriptional regulation

DESIGN
RXR and PPARg ChIP was performed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages in basal conditions

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
