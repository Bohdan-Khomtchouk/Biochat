TITLE
Genes differentially expressed in Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 SCV

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 30-84

SUMMARY
To better understand transcriptional changes in the SCV, RNA-seq analyses were conducted by comparing a SCV mutant to the wild-type. Transcriptomic profiling identified more than 1000 genes indicating a significant reprograming of gene expression in the SCV mutant. In accordance with observed phenotypes, genes involved in metabolism functions, motility and phenazine production were downregulated; whereas, oxidative stress and iron uptake genes were significantly upregulated.

DESIGN
A total of 5 samples were analyzed in AB medium + 2% casamino acids, Pseudomonas chlororaphis wild type strain (3 replicates);  Pseudomonas chlororaphis SCV mutant (2 replicates).

PLATFORM
