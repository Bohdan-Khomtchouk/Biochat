TITLE
MiR-9-3p augments apoptosis induced by H2O2 through down regulation of Herpud1 in glioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are short, single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules that function as regulators of tumor progression in various cancers, including glioma. The present study sought to investigate the biological functions of miR-9-3p in glioma progression. The results of a microRNA microarray indicated that microRNA-9-3p (miR-9-3p, miR-9*) is down-regulated in high-grade (grades III and IV) gliomas compared with non-tumor tissues. These results were confirmed with real-time PCR. The miR-9-3p expression level was associated with age and tumor grade. Herpud1 was regulated by miR-9-3p in glioma cells and tissues and was identified as a miR-9-3p target with luciferase reporter assays. Glioma cells transfected with miR-9-3p mimics or HERPUD1-RNAi had more apoptotic cells than them in control after induced by H2O2. Our results indicated that low expression of miR-9-3p results in a high level of Herpud1, which may protect against apoptosis in glioma.

DESIGN
Total 4 samples were analyzed. Two were glioma tissues and two were controls.
