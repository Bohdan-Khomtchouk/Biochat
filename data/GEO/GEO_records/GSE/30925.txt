TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium: control vs. T2 toxin treatment

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of log and stationary phases of S. Typhimurium, comparing untreated controls with T2 toxin-treated samples.

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. Trplicate arrays were carried out for each of the 4 conditions: untreated log phase, untreated stationary phase, T2 toxin treated log phase and T2 toxin treated stationary phase.

PLATFORM
