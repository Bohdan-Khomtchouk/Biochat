TITLE
Expression data from thymic epithelial cells of 5-6 weeks old C57BL/6J mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Defects in thymic epithelial cell development causes autoimmune diseases due to breakdown of central tolerance, including skin inflammation. IKKa may be essential to link central tolerance to skin inflammation. We used microarrays to examine the global gene expression with or without kinase inactive IKKa, and identified a distinct set of down-regulated genes in the presence of kinase-dead IKKa in thymic epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Thymic epithelial cells were isolated from 5-6 weeks old mice. Total RNAs were extracted, and then subjected to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array.
