TITLE
Expression profiles of human primary osteoblasts (HOB) and MET transformed osteoblast clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied MET-transformed human primary osteoblasts (MET-HOBs), which we previously turned into osteosarcoma cells by LV driven over-expression of MET oncogene. We obtained distinct MET transformed HOB clones  derived from independent events of transgene integration. To characterise the phenotype of the MET-HOB clones we used oligonucleotide microarrays. Expression profiles of MET-HOBs and parental HOBs were compared.

DESIGN
To characterise the phenotype of the MET-HOB clones we used oligonucleotide microarrays
