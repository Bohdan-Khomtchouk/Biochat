TITLE
Fibrinogen promotes autoimmunity and demyelination via chemokine release and antigen presentation [Mm]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of the mechanism by which fibrinogen, a central blood coagulation protein drives immunological responses targeted to the CNS. Results identify the factors involved in the regulation and provide mechanistic basis. We subjected fibrinogen-injected corpus callosum to microarray to determine the genes involved in innate and adaptive immune responses by fibrinogen deposited in the CNS after blood-brain barrier disruption.

DESIGN
Corpus callosum tissues were isolated from mice received stereotactic injection of fibrinogen or ACSF at 12 hr. Tissues were subjected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix microarrays. Two ACSF and two fibrinogen samples were generated.
