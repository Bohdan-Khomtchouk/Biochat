TITLE
Expression from early pre-hematopoietic progenitors from mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) are originated during embryonic development from endothelial-like cells located in the ventral side of the dorsal aorta around day E10-12 of murine development. This region is called AGM for Aorta/Gonad/Mesonephros and refers to the tissues around the hemogenic aorta. Cells that emerge from the endothelium and show hematopoietic traits can be distinguished by the expression of the c-kit receptor and finally acquire the CD45 marker.

DESIGN
AGM regions were obtained from E11.5 embryos by dissection and digested with 0.1% collagenase. Cells were stained with anti-CD31, anti-ckit, anti-CD45 and anti-Ter119 antibodies. Sorting of the CD31+CD45-Ter119- population was performed, and cells were separated into c-kit+ and c-kit-. 3 replicates each of c-kit+ and c-kit- cells.
