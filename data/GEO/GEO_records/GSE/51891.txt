TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of Smad2 and Eomesa binding in zebrafish blastulas

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Study of Smad2 and Eomesa genomic binding in zebrafish blastulas, their relationship to eachother and the relaptionship between genomic binding and Ndr1 and Eomesa responsive genes as identified by microarray and RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Replicate ChIP samples with associated input for Smad2 and Eomesa - 4x ChIP samples (2 per factor); 2x input samples

PLATFORM
