TITLE
Hyperactive mTOR and MNK1 phosphorylation of eIF4E confer tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence through selective mRNA translation reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen resistant translational reprogramming is shown to be mediated by increased expression of eIF4E and its increased availability by hyperactive mTOR, and to require phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209 by increased MNK activity.

DESIGN
Polysome profiling examining eIF4E knock-down in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells (MCF7)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
