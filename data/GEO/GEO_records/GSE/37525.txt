TITLE
Genome-wide identification of enhancers in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In an effort to identify the compendium of regulatory elements that govern myogenic differentiation, we generated chromatin state maps based on the recruitment of factors (p300 and PolII) and histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) that typify enhancers in myoblasts and myotubes. We found a remarkable concordance between the location of these newly defined, active enhancers and MyoD1 binding events. In addition, we found a striking association between the position of enhancers and RNA polymerase II recruitment, which resulted in the expression of previously disclosed non-coding RNAs, as well as potentially new transcripts identified ab initio, throughout the enhancer region.

DESIGN
Mapping of H3K27ac and p300 in growing myoblasts (MB) and fully differentiated myotubes (MT). Mapping of c-Jun in growing myoblasts (MB).
