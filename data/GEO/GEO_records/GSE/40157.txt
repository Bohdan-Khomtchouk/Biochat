TITLE
MDA-MB-231 cells: shMUC4 transfected vs. Control SCR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of MUC4-associated expression of genes by comparing MUC4 knockdown (MDA-MB-231-shMUC4) and control (MDA-MB-231-SCR).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MUC4 knockdown cells vs. control. Biological replicates: 2 control, 2 sh-MUC4 transfected, independently grown and harvested. one replicate per array.
