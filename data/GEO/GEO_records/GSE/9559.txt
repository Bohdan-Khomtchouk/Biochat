TITLE
Phenotypically concordant and discordant monozygotic twins display different DNA copy number variation profiles (BAC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The exploration of copy number variation (CNV), notably of somatic cells, is an understudied aspect of genome biology. Any differences in the genetic make-up between twins derived from the same zygote represent an extreme example of somatic variation. We studied 19 pairs of monozygotic twins with either concordant or discordant phenotype using two platforms for genome-wide CNV analyses and show that CNVs exist within pairs in both groups. These findings impact our views of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in monozygotic twins, and suggest that CNV analysis in phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins may provide a powerful tool in identifying disease predisposition loci. Our results also imply that caution should be exercised with the interpretation of disease causality of de novo CNVs found in patients based on analysis of a single tissue in routine disease-related DNA diagnostics Keywords: copy number variation, concordant and discordant monozygotic twins
