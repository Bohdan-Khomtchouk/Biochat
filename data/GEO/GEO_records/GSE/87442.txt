TITLE
Expression profiles of the aquatic midge larvae (Chironomus tentans) under the sublethal-dose of chlopyrifos and atrazine exposure

ORGANISM
Chironomus tentans

SUMMARY
The aquatic midge, Chironomus tentans, is a keystone species in aquatic ecosystem and used as a model organism to assess chemicals toxicity in aquatic environment. To characterize midge’s cellular and molecular responses to pesticides, we established cDNA library with 10,000 cDNA elements representing 2,456 C. tentans unique genes. Blast2go identified 49 genes potentially involved in xenobiotics metabolism, including 24 cytochrome p450s (CYPs), 14 esterases (ESTs) and 11 glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs). Based on 2,456 unique genes, a cDNA microarray was developed to monitor gene expression profiles in 4th instar larvae under chlopyrifos (0.1 µg/L and 0.5 µg/L) and 1000 µg/L atrazine 48-hr exposure. We identified 149, 435 and 244 genes were significantly differentially expressed (p-value ≤0.05 with expression ratios ≥2.0) after 0.1 µg/L, 0.5 µg/L chlopyrifos, and 1000 µg/L atrazine application, respectively. Sixteen insect detoxification genes (11 CYPs, 3 GSTs and 2 esterases) were validated by qPCR and their expressions were significantly either up- or down-regulated under chlorpyrifos and atrazine exposure, especially the expression of 10 CYPs were significantly induced after chlopyrifos and atrazine exposure. The up-regulated CYPs might be involved in xenobiotic activation and/or degradation. Furthermore, we also found 5 differentially expressed hemoglobin genes. The expression changes of hemoglobins might be an adaption mechanism of C. tentans to hypoxic condition caused by xenobiotic exposure. This study provides a platform for further functional studies of pesticide-insect interactions in C. tentans.

DESIGN
Chironmous tentans 4th instar larvae were exposed to chlopyrifos (0.1 µg/L and 0.5 µg/L) and 1000 µg/L atrazine 48-hr, respectively. The gene expression of whole body after exposure were monitored by custome designed cDNA microarray. Four independent experiments were performed using five insect whole body samples.
