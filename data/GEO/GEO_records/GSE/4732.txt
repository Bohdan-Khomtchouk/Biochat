TITLE
Expression Data from Burkitt Lymphoma Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Burkitt Lymphoma patient samples using gene expression to create a molecular definition of the disease. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: clinical history design

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from patients with Burkitt lymphoma and gene expression profiling was used to create a molecular definition of the disease. The molecular definition was then used to predict the disease in an independent set of patients with atypical Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
