TITLE
Differentially expressed genes and chromosomal alterations in ovarian cancer cell lines sensitive or resistant to a Src-inihibitor, saracatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to detect predictive markers related to a Src kinase inhibitor (saracatinib) sensitivity in ovarian cancer. Cell proliferation assays assigned 18 ovarian cancer cell lines to sensitive or resistant to this drug. Using baseline gene expression data from these 18 cell lines, we sought to identify differentially expressed genes correlated with saracatinib sensitivity. We also used SNP array data from 7 cell lines to detect differentically affected genomic locations.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used for 18 ovarian cancer cell lines. Copy number analysis with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 7 ovarian cancer cell lines.
