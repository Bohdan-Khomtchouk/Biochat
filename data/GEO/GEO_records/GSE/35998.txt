TITLE
Gene expression of murine B cells activated via TLR4 or TLR4 + CD40: Group1 naïve B cells, Group2 LPS activated B cells 24h, Group3 LPS + anti-CD40 activated B cells 24h, Group4 LPS activated B cells 72h, and Group5 LPS + anti-CD40 activated B cells 72h.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine B cells can be activated via the surface receptors TLR4 and CD40. For a global assessment of differences in gene expression between these two different modes of B cell activation a genome wide transcriptome analysis was performed. In order to dissect different gene expression profiles of B cells, activation was induced by LPS or LPS + anti-CD40 for 24h and 72h. Both activation states were compared to each other but also to naïve B cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of naïve B cells, B cells activated with LPS and B cells activated with LPS + anti-CD40. Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 whole genome arrays were performed in quadruplicates for naïve B cells, B cells activated via TLR4 for 24 h and 72 h, and B cells activated via TLR4 + CD40 for 24 h and 72 h (20 arrays in total). To obtain genes significantly regulated upon stimulation with LPS, the expression profiles of naïve B cells, B cells activated with LPS for 24 h, and B cells activated with LPS for 72 h were compared to each other. After total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, cDNA extraction, the biotinylated cRNA was transcribed, fragmented, and 15 µg cRNA hybridized in quadruplicates for each of the five groups to the 20 GeneChip arrays: Group1 naïve B cells, Group2 LPS activated B cells 24h, Group3 LPS + anti-CD40 activated B cells 24h, Group4 LPS activated B cells 72h, and Group5 LPS + anti-CD40 activated B cells 72h. All chips were imported into BioRetis ( http://www.bioretis-analysis.de ) and are open to the community now. If you want to obtain one or more lists of HPCDA significant genes you should click on a link of single chips (e.g. GSM879034) to get a description how to manage this.
