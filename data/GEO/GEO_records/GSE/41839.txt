TITLE
Expression data from control and LRF (leukemia/lymphoma related factor)-deficient mouse LT-HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LRF, which is encoded by the ZBTB7A gene and formerly known as POKEMON (POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor), was originally identified as a PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) homologue interacting with BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6). LRF is a transcription factor that is broadly expressed in hematopoietic lineage cells, but its expression is particularly high in erythroblasts and germinal center (GC) B-cells. The goal of this study is to assess the effect of LRF loss on the LT-HSC transcriptome. Nine days after injection of adult mice with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (pIpc) to activate Cre, total RNAs were isolated from double-sorted LT-HSCs from LRF Flox/+ Mx1-Cre+ and LRF Flox/Flox Mx1-Cre+ mice and processed for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression microarray analysis of FACS-sorted LT-HSCs (LSK IL7Ra-Flt3-CD150+CD48-) to assess the effect of Lrf loss on the LT-HSC transcriptome. Zbtb7a Flox/+ Mx1-Cre+ mice were used as a control to normalize the potential effects of Cre recombinase. LT-HSCs were FACS-sorted from three Lrf knockout (Zbtb7a Flox/Flox Mx1-Cre+) and two control (Zbtb7a Flox/+ Mx1-Cre+) mice, nine days after the first pIpC injection.
