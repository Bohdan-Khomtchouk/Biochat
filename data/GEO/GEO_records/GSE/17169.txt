TITLE
bulked RILs with high and low grain number per panicle derived from 2 cultivars at panicle primordia stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptome profiling of bulked RILs with high and low grain number per panicle derived from 2 cultivars at panicle primordia stage The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes responsible for grain number per panicle by combining QTLs analysis with expression analysis.   Microarray analysis of RNA extracted from the panicle primordia showed 20 differentially expressed genes, respectively.  The differentially expressed genes were shorted to 4 on the basis of their occurance in the QTL region (responcible for grain number regulation) detected in RIL population derived from Pusa 1266 and Pusa Basmati 1.

DESIGN
RNA from the stage '0' panicle primordia of 10 RILs with high grain number and 10 with low grain number were bulked and analysed in two different biological replications  (A and B) making total four samples
