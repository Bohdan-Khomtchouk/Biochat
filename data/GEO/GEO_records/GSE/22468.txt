TITLE
Nocturnal expression data of Synechococcus in WT and kaiABC-null strains

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, most of genes are downregulated in the dark, while 10% of genes are upregulated. Here, we employed high-density oligonucleotide arrays to explore comprehensive profiles of genome-wide Synechococcus gene expression in wild type and kaiABC-null strains under continuous dark (DD) conditions. We found that expression profile of a subset of genes on the genome in DD was dramatically affected by kaiABC-nullification, and the magnitude of dark-induction was dependent on time when cells were transferred from light to DD Keywords: timecourse data (0-12 h) under continuous darkness after dark:light cycles from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 wild type and kaiABC-null strains

DESIGN
Wild type (WT) and kaiABC-null (DkaiABC) S. elongatus PCC 7942 strains were analyzed under continuous dark (DD) conditions after two 12h:12h light:dark (LD) cycles using Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip CustomExpress Arrays) representing predicted 2,515 protein-coding genes on the genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, which can be used also to the almost homologous strain, S. elongatus PCC 7942: Two independent experiments in WT and Dkai strains under DD (hours 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12).
