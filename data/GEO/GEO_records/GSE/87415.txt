TITLE
Environment-dependent regulation of spliceosome activity by the LSM2-8 complex in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the role of LSM2-8 complex in the Arabidopsis tolerance to abiotic stresses. LSM2-8 controls gene expression reprogramming at the post-transcriptional level by promoting the splicing of pre-mRNA. This function is selectively achieved over selected transcripts depending on stress nature.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiling through RNA-seq of Col-0 and lsm8-1 plants exposed to low temperatures (4ÂºC, 24h) or high salt conditions (150 mM NaCl, 10h).

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
