TITLE
Reactivity of commercial antibodies targeting human histone H2B N-terminal tail on the Intel array platform

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the Intel array platform and map the H2B epitopes bound by commercial antibody reagents.  We also tested the ability of SET7 PKMT to methylate Intel array peptides. We diluted antibody reagents 1:1000 and incubated dilutions on the silicon-based Intel array platorm.

DESIGN
We mapped antibody binding epitopes and SET7 PKMT methylation target peptides using a novel, silicon-based array platform with 8820 individual peptide features comprising every possible contiguous peptide from 1-21 a.a. in length within the 21-mer N-terminal tail of human histone H2B.

PLATFORM
GPL14939 Intel array v1
