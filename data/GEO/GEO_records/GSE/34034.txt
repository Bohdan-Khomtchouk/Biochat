TITLE
Reactivity of commercial antibodies targeting human histone H2B N-terminal tail on the Intel array platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the Intel array platform and map the H2B epitopes bound by commercial antibody reagents.  We also tested the ability of SET7 PKMT to methylate Intel array peptides. We diluted antibody reagents 1:1000 and incubated dilutions on the silicon-based Intel array platorm.
