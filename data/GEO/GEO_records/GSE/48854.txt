TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Atasf1 mutants in comparison with wild type.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ASF1 is a conserved histone chaperone with affinity to histone H3-H4.  Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes two ASF1 homologues, which play redundant roles in S-phase progression and cell proliferation in plant development. Here, in an attempt to obtain the knowledge of ASF1 role in transcriptional regulation, we perform the transcriptome analysis of each asf1 single mutant (Atasf1a and Atasf1b) as well as Atasf1ab double mutant in comparison with wild type (WT).

DESIGN
12-day-old seedlings of wild-type (WT), each single mutants and double mutant grown in normal growth condition were used for RNA extraction and microarray. Duplicate samples were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
