TITLE
Gene expression in response to progestin R5020

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer cell lines containing the progesterone receptor respond to progestins, altering expression of a subset of genes. In a previously published experiment of inducible knock-down of histone H1 isoforms with an shRNA-expression lentivector  (GSE12299), we modified the breast cancer cell line T47D with different vectors. Here, we explored response to progestin R5020 of control cells generated with the empty shRNA-expression vector.

DESIGN
Stable breast cancer-derived cell lines containing the empty vector for inducible shRNA expression were grown for two days in the absence of serum. Progestin R5020 or vehicle was added for 6 hours, in duplicate, and RNA was extracted for microarray hybridization.
