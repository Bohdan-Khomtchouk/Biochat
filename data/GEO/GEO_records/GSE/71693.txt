TITLE
Murine Kidney Papilla Cells: Control GFP- vs. GFP+ label retaining cells. Cell populations were separated by FACS.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse kidney papilla cells comparing control GFP- cells with GFP+ labeled cells. Mouse kidney papillae were dissected. GFP- and GFP+ cell populations were isolated by FACS. The latter represent slow cycling label retaining cells (LRCs).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GFP- vs. GFP+ label retaining cells cells. Biological replicates: 5 control GFP- replicates, 5 GFP+ label retaining cell replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
