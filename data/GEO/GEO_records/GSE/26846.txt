TITLE
Expression data from human lung cancer cell lines with NEDD9 overexpression or NEDD9 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NEDD9 is important for lung cancer metastasis. However, the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Using the microarray data generated with human lung cancer cell lines with either NEDD9 overexpression or NEDD9 knockdown, we  plan to idnetify important signal pathways regulated by NEDD9. This may explain how NEDD9 excutes its function in lung cancer. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human lung cancer cell line A549, which has LKB1 loss-of-function mutation and increased expression of NEDD9, was used for two individual NEDD9 knockdown. Human lung cancer cell line CRL-5907, which has wild-type LKB1 and low NEDD9 expression level, was used for NEDD9 overexpression. The microarray was done in A549 cells, A549 cells with two different NEDD9 knockdown; CRL-5907 cells and CRL-5907 cells with NEDD9 overexpression.
