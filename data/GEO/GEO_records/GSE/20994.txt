TITLE
Melanoma Cancer miRNA Blood Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes peripheral blood profiles of melanoma cancer patients. Since miRNAs are known to be valuable diagnostic markers we asked whether respective patterns of melanoma patients can be detected in peripheral blood samples rather than in biopsies. The project aimed at an improved understanding of complex profiles rather than single markers. Thus, a high-throughput technique was necessary, profiling all known miRNAs integratively. Top markers have been validated by using qPCR.

DESIGN
n = 22 normal controls and n = 35 melanoma cancer samples have been screened for the complete miRNA repertoire. The melanoma samples have been collected by two clinicians using the same procedure. Please note that each miRNA has been measured in seven replicates and the median of the replica has been computed.
