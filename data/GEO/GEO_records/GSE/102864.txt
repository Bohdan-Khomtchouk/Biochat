TITLE
PTP4A1 phosphatase is overexpressed in systemic sclerosis fibroblasts and promotes TGFb signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that silencing of tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A1 attenuates pro-fibrotic TGFb signaling in human dermal fibroblasts

DESIGN
Cell-permeable antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (ASO) was designed against the pre-mRNA splicing junction between intron 2 and exon 3. ASO treatment enabled nearly complete knockdown of PTP4A1. Next, using next generation sequencing, we determined the transcriptional profile of 3 normal human dermal fibroblast lines lines treated with PTP4A1 ASO (PRL-1 samples), compared to the same lines treated with a control non-targeting ASO (Vivo samples).
