TITLE
The large non-coding RNA ANRIL, which is associated with atherosclerosis, periodontitis and several forms of cancer, regulates ADIPOR1, VAMP3 and C11ORF10 (lncRNA ANRIL exon 13)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are regulated from the lncRNA ANRIL (EXON 13), we designed inducible short hairpin RNA constructs and stable integrated them into HEK cells Changes of gene expression after induction were determined at 48h and 96h by genome-wide mRNA expression analysis.

DESIGN
Tetracycline stimulated shRNA silencing of ANRIL in T-Rex 293 HECK and T-Rex HeLa cells at defined time points.
