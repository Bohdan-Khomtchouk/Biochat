TITLE
Evaluation of covS polymorphisms on group A streptococcal global gene expression

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sp. 'group A'

SUMMARY
We sought to determine how single amino acid changes in the active site of CovS autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of the response regulator CovR affect the gene expression profile of group A streptococcus

DESIGN
There were 6 strains analyzed, each in quadruplicate replicates: 1) wild-type GAS; 2) covS deletion strain; 3) covS with alanine at AA 280; 4) covS with valine at AA 281; 5) covS with valine at AA 284; 6) covS with alanine at AA 457

PLATFORM
GPL19691 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Streptococcus sp. 'group A')
