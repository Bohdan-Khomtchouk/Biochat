TITLE
H3K36me3 occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing from control(APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice intestinal cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Setd2 catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3. We conduct ChIP sequencing in chromatin landscape induced by Setd2 depleted in mouse intestinal cells to understand the H3K36me3 genome-wide alterations.

DESIGN
Samples were from control(APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice intestinal cells. The chromatin was prepared and followed by ChIP-Seq analysis by Active Motif, Inc. using the antibody against H3K36me3(abcam).

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
