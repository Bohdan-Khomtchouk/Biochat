TITLE
Gene expression and alternative splicing in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
27 sample pairs were conducted exon microarrays and 25 sample pairs were retain for our further alternative splicing analysis. 260 genes showed differential expression in more than 50% of our samples and 21 genes among them were validated by real-time PCR. Six genes with splicing events, which were firstly found in gastric cancer, were confirmed by RT-PCR. Keywords: Transcriptome analysis
