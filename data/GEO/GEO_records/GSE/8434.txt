TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by Errb (Nr3b2) in stria vascularis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles were compared in microdissected lateral walls of the inner ears from Errb mutant mice and wild type littermate controls.  The goal is to identify transcriptional targets of Errb and candidate genes for inner ear diseases. Keywords: genetic mutant analysis
