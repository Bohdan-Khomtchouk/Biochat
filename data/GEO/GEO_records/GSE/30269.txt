TITLE
An integrated transcriptome analysis to the characterization of host responses against infectious laryngostracheitis virus vaccine infection in chicken embryo lung cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Host gene expression of chicken embryo lung cells infected an infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) vaccine strain comparing control uninfected lung cells. Goal was to identify the changes of host gene expression by ILTV vaccine infection.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, uninfected chicken embryo lung cells vs. vaccine infected chicken embryo lung cells. Biological replicates: 1 control uninfected sample, 1 vaccinal ILTV infected experimental sample at each 1, 2, 3 and 4 dpi.

PLATFORM
