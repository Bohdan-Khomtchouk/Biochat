TITLE
Tfe3-bound regions in naive pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The bHLH transcription factor Tfe3 is a powerful regulator of pluripotency and we report a genome-wide analysis of Tfe3 occupancy in mouse ES cells. Nuclear localization of Tfe3 is inhibited by a protein complex containing the tumor-suppressor Folliculin (Flcn) and we also determine Tfe3 binding sites in ES cells expressing an shRNA targeting Flcn. Specificity is controlled for by using unspecific IgGs and ES cells expressing an shRNA targeting Tfe3.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profiling of Tfe3 in ES cells

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
