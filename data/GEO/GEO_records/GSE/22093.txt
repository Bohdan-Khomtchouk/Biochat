TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer FNA biopsies from patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assess if distinct biological processes might be associated with chemotherapy sensitivity in the different clinical subsets of breast cancers. We performed gene set analysis (GSA) using functionally annotated gene sets corresponding to almost all known biological processes in ER-positive/HER2negative and ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer, respectively.

DESIGN
Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to afymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
