TITLE
Helminth-induced arginase-1 exacerbates lung inflammation and disease severity in tuberculosis.  

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression in CD4+ cells sorted from naïve or D30 Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice and incubated  in vitro in the presence or absence of Schistosoma egg antigen. We found genes associated with Th1 function, T cell signaling, T cell costimulation and T cell activation were downregulated in SEA-treated cells, while expression of Th2 cytokines was below the threshold for detection.

DESIGN
RNAseq results for 3 replicates for naïve or CD4+ T cells from M.tuberculosis-infected mice treated with or without Schistosoma egg antigen in vitro.
