TITLE
Expression data from outflow region at E9.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A high concentration of maternal retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A, is well known as a teratogenic agent which can cause developmental defects. Our previous studies have shown that the maternal administration of RA to mice within a narrow developmental window induces outflow tract (OFT) septum defects, which closely resembles human transposition of the great arteries (TGA), although the responsible factors and pathogenic mechanisms of the TGA induced by RA still remain unknown. To identify the candidate genes involved in the altered development of the OFT in RA-induce TGA model, we isolated the RNA from E9.5 control and RA-treated OFT regions, and performed a microarray analysis.
