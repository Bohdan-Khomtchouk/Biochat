TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) reveals sex chromosome location and gene movement in stalk-eyed flies (family Diopsidae), Sphyracephala beccarii

ORGANISM
Sphyracephala beccarii

SUMMARY
We utilized Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH), using probes designed from de novo assembly of a testes transcriptome, to identify genes located on the sex chromosomes and autosomes of a stalk-eyed fly, Sphyracephala beccarii. Analysis of X chromosome gene content revealed the evolution of a neo-X chromosome that originated prior to the diversification of the family. Comparison of X-linkage across three species spanning the phylogenetic breadth of the family indicates abundant chromosomal gene movement, particularly for genes expressed exclusively in the testes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, female vs. male DNA, for one species with 3 biological replicates

PLATFORM
