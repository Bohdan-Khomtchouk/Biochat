TITLE
Molecular characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Bruno/CELF RNA binding proteins

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs intricate post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in different stages of its life cycle. Despite the importance of post-transcriptional regulation, key elements of these processes, namely RNA binding proteins (RBPs), are poorly characterized. In this study, the RNA binding properties of P. falciparum proteins were characterized including two putative members of the Bruno/CELF family of RBPs (PfCELF1 and PfCELF2), dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (PfDHFR-TS), and adenosine deaminase (PfAda).The mRNA targets of these P. falciparum proteins were investigated by ribonomics using DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Two-condition ribonomic experiment, RBP vs. Mock enrichment of mRNAs. Ribonomic experimental replicates: 4-7 for each RBP, 5 for Mock. One replicate per array.
