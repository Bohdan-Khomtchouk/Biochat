TITLE
miR-126 governs human leukemia stem cell quiescence and therapeutic resistance [Illumina]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play a central role in disease progression and recurrence due to their intrinsic capacity for self-renewal and chemotherapy resistance. Whereas epigenetic regulation balances normal blood stem cell self-renewal and fate decisions, mutation and dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers are now considered fundamental to leukemia initiation and progression. Alterations in miRNA function represent a non-canonical epigenetic mechanism influencing malignant hematopoiesis; however, the function of miRNA in LSC remains undetermined. Here we show that miRNA profiling of fractionated AML populations defines an LSC-specific signature that is highly predictive of patient survival. Gain-of-function genetic analysis demonstrated that miR-126 restrained cell cycle progression, prevented LSC differentiation, and increased LSC self-renewal. miR-126 promoted chemo-resistance, preserving LSC quiescence in part through suppression of the G0-to-G1 gatekeeper, CDK3. Thus, in AML, miRNAs influence patient outcome through post-transcriptional regulation of stemness programs in LSC.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 8227 cells and treated with miR-126 sponge or miR-126-containing viral particles (and corresponding controls).
