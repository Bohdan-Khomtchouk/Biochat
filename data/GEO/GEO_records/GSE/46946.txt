TITLE
Expression data from two year old newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem of Populus tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
We take the two year old plant for sampling. Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to elucidate the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus tomentosa newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem.

DESIGN
Populus tomentosa newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. CB2009304-A and CB2009304-B from newly formed developing xylem, CB2009304-G and CB2009304-H from lignified xylem.

PLATFORM
GPL4359 [Poplar] Affymetrix Poplar Genome Array
