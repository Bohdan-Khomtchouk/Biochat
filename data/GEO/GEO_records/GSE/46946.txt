TITLE
Expression data from two year old newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem of Populus tomentosa

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We take the two year old plant for sampling. Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to elucidate the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus tomentosa newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in newly formed developing xylem and lignified xylem.
