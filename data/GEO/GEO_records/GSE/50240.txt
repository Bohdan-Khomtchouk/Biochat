TITLE
Red blood cells from mice on high fat diet induce macrophage activation during phagocytosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied macrophage gene expression from mice fed chow diet (C) or 60% high fat diet (HF), that phagocytized C-RBC, HFD-RBC, or no RBC. Macrophages from mice on HF diet were activated toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype.  In macrophages isolated from CD mice, RBC phagocytosis yielded a gene expression pattern similar to HF macrophages. Incubation of HF-RBC with macrophages resulted in a significantly more pronounced upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines as compared to C-RBC.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C57BL/6 mice fed either C or HF diet.  Phagocytosis was performed in vitro with C-RBC or HF-RBC; macrophages not exposed to RBC served as a control.  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST microarray chips were used to assess the gene expression profile.
