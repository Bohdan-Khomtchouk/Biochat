TITLE
RNA-seq of human fibroblasts during normal aging and during aging with rotenone perturbation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblasts at different population doublings were treated with low amounts of rotenone (mild stress) and compared to untreated fibroblasts. Two different cell lines were used (MRC-5, HFF). Illumina sequencing (HiSeq2000) was applied to generate 50bp single-end reads. Jena Centre for Systems Biology of Ageing - JenAge (www.jenage.de)

DESIGN
60 samples: 3 biological replicates for each group: MRC-5 cells at 4 different population doublings (PD) with and without rotenone; HFF cells at 6 different population doublings with and without rotenone
