SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine IGF2BP3 RNA targets in human B-cell Acute Lymphocitic Leukemia cell models.

DESIGN
Included are iCLIP-seq libraries for IGF2BP3 from RS4;11 and REH B-ALL cell samples and RNA-seq data sets from control and IGF2BP3 knockdown RS4;11 B-ALL cell lines

PLATFORM
