TITLE
The RNA binding protein IGF2BP3 promotes hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation by targeting leukemogenic pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine IGF2BP3 RNA targets in human B-cell Acute Lymphocitic Leukemia cell models.

DESIGN
Included are iCLIP-seq libraries for IGF2BP3 from RS4;11 and REH B-ALL cell samples and RNA-seq data sets from control and IGF2BP3 knockdown RS4;11 B-ALL cell lines
