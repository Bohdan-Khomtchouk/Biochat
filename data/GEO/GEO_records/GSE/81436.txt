TITLE
The ortholog of DDM1 is mainly required for CHG and CG methylation of heterochromatin and is involved in DRM2-mediated CHH methylation that targets mostly genic regions of the rice genome

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 display functional specificities that define distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the rice genome
