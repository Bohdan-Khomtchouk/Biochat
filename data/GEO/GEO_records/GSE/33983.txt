TITLE
Array comparative genomic hybridization in oral cavity (head and neck) squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide high resolution assay of copy number in a series of frozen, microdissected head and neck cancers originating from the oral cavity. The objective was to characterize areas of amplification and deletion in head and neck cancers arising from the oral cavity subsite.

DESIGN
31 tumors were snap frozen at the time of surgical resection, microdissected to > 70% tumor content, and DNA extracted.

PLATFORM
GPL8736 Agilent-021529 Human CGH Whole Genome Microarray 1x1M (G4447A) (Feature Number version)
