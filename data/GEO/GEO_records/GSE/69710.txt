TITLE
NOVA2 and NOVA1 HITS-CLIP in wild-type mouse cortex (E18.5)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse cortex samples from E18.5 wild-type were subjected to HITS-CLIP to detect NOVA2 and NOVA1 binding positions on RNA

DESIGN
Mouse cortex samples were UV-irradiated and subjected to NOVA2 and NOVA1 HITS-CLIP (detailed desription in accompanying paper)
