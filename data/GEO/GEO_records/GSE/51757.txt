TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation and expression identifies CIMP in myelodysplastic syndrome [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated, we have employed the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K.And we validated selected genes in cases and controls. eventually we estalished CIMP of MDS.

DESIGN
The gene expressions of four cases and four controls were measured.

PLATFORM
GPL14550 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name Version)
