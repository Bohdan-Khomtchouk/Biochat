TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines exposed to DMSO control and UF010

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was treated with DMSO or UF010, a novel HDAC inhibitor for 24 hours. The impact of UF010 treatment on global gene expression was determined. We used Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA-2_0) to analyze genes that were up or downregulated upon UF010 exposure.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DMSO (control) or 1.0 ÂµM of UF010 for 24 hours.Total RNAs were isolated for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
