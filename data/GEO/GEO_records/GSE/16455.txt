TITLE
Indolent MCL identified by genomic and gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive neoplasm with poor outcome. However, some patients have an indolent disease (iMCL) and may not require intensive treatment at initial diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria to recognize these patients are not available. We hypothesized that the analysis of the genetic and expression features of the tumors may help to identify patients with an indolent clinical evolution and provide biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting.

DESIGN
Seven patients with an iMCL that did not require chemotherapy for more than 2 years were compared to 15 conventional MCL (cMCL) that needed systemic therapy at diagnosis. MCL were compared with other leukemic lymphoid neoplasms including 17 CLL, 7FL, HCL and 2HCLv.
