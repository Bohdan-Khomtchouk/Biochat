TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type (WT) and dek37 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dek37 mutant affects cis-splicing of maize mitochondrial nad2 intron 1 . Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of mitochondrial  pathway associated genes.

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 18DAP WT and dek37 mutant were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
