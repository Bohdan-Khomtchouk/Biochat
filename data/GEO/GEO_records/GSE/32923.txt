TITLE
The NIH Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Database (Agilent, mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the extent to which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) faithfully recapitulate the characteristics of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) under (undiff)erentiated condition, KSR condition and FBS condition and how both compare to somatic tissues under these conditions, we employed whole-genome transcriptome analysis on all twenty one hESC lines available on the pre-2008 NIH Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry, eight human iPSCs derived at NIH by retroviral transduction of human fibroblasts and twenty human somatic tissues.  One standard culture protocol was used in conjunction with rigorous quality control.  Expanded description of methods used and are available at: http://stemcelldb.nih.gov.

DESIGN
230 samples:  44 human ESC (UNDIFF), 16 human iPSC (UNDIFF) 44 human ESC (KSR), 15 human iPSC (KSR), 44 human ESC (FBS), 15 human iPSC (FBS), 1 human Brain, 1 human Placenta, 1 human Skeletal Muscle, 1 human Heart, 1 human Liver, 1 human Lung, 1 human Kidney, 1 human Esophagus, 1 human Ovary, 1 human Testes, 1 human Spleen, 1 human Adipose, 1 human Thyroid, 1 human Thymus, 1 human Small Intestine, 1 human Prostate, 1 human Cervix, 1 human Colon, 1 human Bladder, 1 human Trachea) and 32 processing controls (UniRef).
