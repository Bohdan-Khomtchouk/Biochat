TITLE
KDM4A depletion by siRNA in HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine genes affected by depletion of KDM4A in HEK293T cells This data was used in Van Rechem et. al. Cancer Discovery 2014 to demonstrate that depletion of KDM4A did not alter expression of genese associated with translation.

DESIGN
The experiment uses two different shRNA constructs; shKDM4A.2 in a pSuper backbone and shKDM4A.6 in a pLKO backbone.  A corresponding empty vector control was conducted for each backbone.  Each shRNA was compared to its own control.
