TITLE
CTL differentiation: WT vs. IL-2Ra deficient CTL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of WT and IL-2Ra-deficient CTL (P14) isolated 8 days after inffection with LCMV.  The goals of the study are to assess the impact of IL-2 signals on effector and memory CTL differentiation.

DESIGN
This is a 2-condition experiement comparing WT P14 Tg T cells eight days after LCMV infection to IL-2Ra-deficient P14 Tg T cells isolated at the same time from the same host.  Cells are isolated via FACS-sorting form the spleen.
