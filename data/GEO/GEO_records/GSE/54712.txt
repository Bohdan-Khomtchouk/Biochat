TITLE
Transcriptional changes taking place during differentiation of H460-derived CSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer Stem Cells derived from human non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC) H460 cells were differentiated by culturing them in the presence of Foetal Bovine Serum under adherent conditions. Changes in gene expression profiles were determined at 3, 9 and 24 hours of differentiation

DESIGN
Expression profiles were determined for H460C cells undifferentiated of after 3, 9 and 24 hours of differentiation. Each sample type was hybridized to in-situ oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K). One channel per slide.  Each differentiated population was compared to undifferentiated cells. Biological replicates: 2
