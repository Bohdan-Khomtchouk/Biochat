TITLE
Arabidopsis EDM2 Promotes IBM1 Distal Polyadenylation and Regulates Genome DNA Methylation Patterns [BS-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A forward genetics screen led to the identification of the putative chromatin regulator EDM2 as a cellular anti-silencing factor and regulator of genome DNA methylation patterns. EDM2 contains a composite PHD finger domain that recognizes both active H3K4 and repressive H3K9 methylation marks at the intronic repeat elements in genes such as the histone H3K9 demethylase gene IBM1, and is necessary for maintaining the expression of these genes by promoting mRNA distal polyadenylation. Because of its role in maintaining IBM1 expression, EDM2 is required for preventing CHG methylation in the bodies of thousands of genes.Our results thus increase the understanding of anti-silencing, genome methylation patterns, and regulation of alternative RNA processing by intronic heterochromatin.

DESIGN
Col-0 and edm2-4 total genomic DNAs are extracted from leaves and then subjected to bisulfite convertion and sequencing in accordance with standard protocol.
