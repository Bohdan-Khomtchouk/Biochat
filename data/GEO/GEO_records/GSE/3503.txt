TITLE
Rapid tRNA decay can result from lack of non-essential modifications

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A microarray tiling approach was utilized to assay tRNA modifications by comparing hybridization affinity of tRNA-modification mutants to wild-type across all annotated yeast tRNAs. Keywords: Assaying noncoding RNA modifications

DESIGN
Complementary probes were tiled on average every 5 bases across all tRNAs as well as other noncoding RNAs including 50 bases of flanking genomic sequence.  Probes were normalized to a uniform melting temp of 55 degrees celsius and concatenated to 60 bases.
