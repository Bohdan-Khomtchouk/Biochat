TITLE
Rapid tRNA decay can result from lack of non-essential modifications

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A microarray tiling approach was utilized to assay tRNA modifications by comparing hybridization affinity of tRNA-modification mutants to wild-type across all annotated yeast tRNAs. Keywords: Assaying noncoding RNA modifications
