TITLE
A genome-wide screen identifies competitive growth advantage for human epidermal stem cells with activated YAP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide pooled RNAi screens for genes that confer a clonal growth advantage or disadvantage on epidermal stem- and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells What we know from our cell biology is that a shRNA underrepresented at t=14 targets a gene that confers growth advantage.

DESIGN
Genome-wide screening of 2 primary cell lines using Decode shRNA library.  Genomic DNA purified from cells at t=0 and after cells were cultured for two weeks (t=14).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
