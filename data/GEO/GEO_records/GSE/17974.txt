TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of early transcriptional events induced by cytokine IL-4 in human cord blood CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this dataset was to study in detail the transcription kinetics initiated by cytokine IL-4 in early differentiation of Th2 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from activated and IL-4 & anti-IL-12 treated cord blood CD4+ T cells, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of the cultures, compared to cells which were only activated. 57 samples were analyzed from three biological replicates of the culture. Two of the samples were discarded from the further data analysis due to compromised quality (samples 8=Th0.4h.1 and 11=Th2.6h.1).
