TITLE
Methylation of Polycomb target genes in intestinal cancer is mediated by inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using glutathione peroxidase, Gpx1 and Gpx2, double knockout (Gpx1/2-KO) mice as a model of inflammatory bowel disease predisposing to intestinal cancer, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin changingâ€™s in the mouse ileum during chronic inflammation, aging and cancer. We found that inflammation leads to aberrant DNA methylation in Polycomb target genes, with 70% of the ~250 genes methylated in the inflamed tissue being PcG targets in embryonic stem cells and 58% of the methylated genes being marked by H3K27 trimethylation in the ileum of adult wildtype mice. Acquisition of DNA methylation at CpG islands in the ileum of Gpx-1/2-KO mice frequently correlated with loss of H3K27 trimethylation at the same loci. Inflammation-associated DNA methylation occurs preferentially in tissue-specific silent genes and, importantly, is much more frequently represented in tumors than is age-dependent DNA methylation. 60% of aberrant methylation found in tumors is also present in the inflamed tissue. In summary, inflammation creates a signature of aberrant DNA methylation, which is observed later in the malignant tissue and is directed by the PcG complex.

DESIGN
In our study we used mice Gpx1/2-ko with B6 and B6.129 genetic background which are characterized by different level of inflammation in ileum and different tumor susceptibility. DNA methylation was analyzed by using MIRA-assisted Microarrays approach. Changing of the DNA methylation in intestinal epithelium during inflammation and tumorgenesis in Gpx1/2-KO mice were compared to healthy control mice with matching age. Aged dependent DNA methylation was study by comparing DNA methylation between 28-days-old healthy control mice with 8-month-old mice. To detect DKO-specific DNA methylation, we compared the changing DNA methylation in liver from Gpx1/2-KO mice with liver from control mice at age 28 days and 8 month. Association of the inflammation dependent DNA methylation with Polycomb targets and loss of H3K27me3 were verified by ChIp-on-ChIp experiments using H3K27me3 antibodies.
