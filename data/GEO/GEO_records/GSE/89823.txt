TITLE
Context-dependent role of ARF for response to chemotherapy in muscle invasive bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling analysis (RNAseq) of mouse bladder epithelium from wildtype mice (Arf+/+; p53+/+; Pten+/+) or bladder tumors from Arf-wild-type (Arf+/+; p53f/f; Ptenf/f) or Arfnull (Arff/f; p53f/f; Ptenf/f) mice that had been treated with vehicle or cisplatin

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bladder epithelium or bladder tumors. Bladder tissues or tumors were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
