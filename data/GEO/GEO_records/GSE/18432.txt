TITLE
Aerobic cultivation vs Respiratory conditions

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
The effect of respiration (aerobic cultivation in the presence of heme and vitamin K2) was compared with unsupplemented aerobic cultivation with Lactobacillus plantarum.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, aerobic vs respiring cells. Biological replicates: 3 aerobic cultures, 3 respiring cultures, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.  Respiring cultures are called reactor 1-3; Aerobic cultures are called reactor 4-6 In the subsequent analysis data from reactor 4 were not used. There was likely a mistake made during quenching. This was concluded as new labeling/hybridisation gave same (bad) results (128a); slide 128b was dye-swap.

PLATFORM
GPL9359 WCFS Lactobacillus plantarum 11K 60-mer array, Version 2
