TITLE
Expression data from FDFT1 overexpression lung cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FDFT1 catalyzes the first reaction in the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, we demonstrated that FDFT1 down-regulation by two shRNAs significantly reduced cell migration and invasion in highly invasive lung cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as in lung metastases in vivo. We used microarrays to detail the FDFT1 regulated gene expression underlying invasion-metastasis cascade and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Lung adenocarcinoma cells with FDFT1 overexpression were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
