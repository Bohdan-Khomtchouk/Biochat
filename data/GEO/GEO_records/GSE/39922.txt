TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of macrophage gene expression upon Bcl3 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By binding to specific DNA elements, known collectively as “κB sites”, contained within the promoters/enhancers of target genes, NF-κB regulates gene expression. We found that the identity of the central base pair (bp) of κB sites profoundly impacts the transcriptional activity of NF-κB dimers.  RelA dimers prefer an A/T bp at this position for optimum transcriptional activation (A/T-centric) and discriminate against G/C-centric κB sites.  The p52 homodimer, in contrast, activates transcription from G/C-centric κB sites in complex with Bcl3 but represses transcription from the A/T-centric sites.  The p52:Bcl3 complex binds to these two classes of κB sites in distinct modes permitting recruitment of coactivator, corepressor, or both coactivator and corepressor complexes in promoters containing G/C, A/T or both G/C and A/T-centric sites.  Therefore, through sensing of bp differences within κB sites, NF-κB dimers modulate biological programs by activating, repressing and altering expression of effector genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with Bcl3 siRNA knockdown or mouse scramble siRNA knockdown were subjected to LPS stimulation.
