Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Abstract: We have developed an Entamoeba histolytica genomic DNA microarray and used it to develop a transcriptional profile of 1,971 E. histolytica (HM-1:IMSS) genes. The arrays accurately detected message abundance and 31-47% of amebic genes were expressed under standard tissue culture conditions (levels detectable by Northern blot analysis or RT-PCR respectively). Genes expressed at high levels ( approximately 2% of total) included actin (8.m00351), and ribosomal genes (20.m00312). Moderately expressed genes ( approximately 14% of total) included cysteine proteinase (191.m00117), profilin (156.m00098), and an Argonaute family member (11.m00378). Genes with low-level expression ( approximately 15% of total) included Ariel1 (160.m00087). Genes with very low expression ( approximately 16% of total) and those not expressed ( approximately 52% of total) included encystation-specific genes such as Jacob cyst wall glycoprotein (33.m00261), chitin synthase (3.m00544), and chitinase (22.m00311). Transcriptional modulation could be detected using the arrays with 17% of genes upregulated at least two-fold in response to heat shock. These included heat shock proteins (119.m00119 and 279.m00091), cyst wall glycoprotein Jacob (33.m00261), and ubiquitin-associated proteins (16.m00343; 195.m00092). Using Caco-2 cells to model the host-parasite interaction, we verified that host cell killing was dependent on live ameba. However, surprisingly these events did not appear to induce major transcriptional changes in the parasites. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
