TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Drosophila Kr-h1 mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) was performed to identify Kr-h1 target genes. Message RNAs were extracted from wildtype and kr-h1[7] homozygous 3rd instar larvae at 100 hr after egg laying (two biological replicates for each genotype).

DESIGN
Examination of transcript levels between wildtype and kr-h1 mutant larvae at 100 hr after egg laying

PLATFORM
GPL16479 Illumina MiSeq (Drosophila melanogaster)
