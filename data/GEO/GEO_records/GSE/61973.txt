TITLE
Expression data from PARK2 overexpression in U251 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PARK2 (PARKIN) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose dysfunction has been associated with the progression of Parkinsonism and human malignancies, and its role in cancer remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated its role in glioma. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon PARK2 overexpression in U251 cells

DESIGN
U251 cells with PARK2 overexpression or control (GFP) were subjected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
