TITLE
Histone H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation analysis in ES cells, Mefs and induced pluriptent cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mefs were transduced with Oct4 , Sox2, Klf4 and c-myc to induce pluripotency. The histone  H3 K4 and H3 K27 trimethylation status was compared genome wide in ES cells, MEFs, and induced pluripotent cells (iPS). Keywords: ChIP-Chip
