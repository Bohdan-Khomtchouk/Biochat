TITLE
Microarray to identify the differentially expressed genes in CFG treated SKOV3 cells compared with control cells under TGFbeta condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The compound fuling granule (CFG) is a traditional Chinese drug which has been used to treat ovarian cancer in China for over twenty years. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer effect remains unclear. In this study, microarray data analysis was performed to search for differentially expressed genes in CFG-treated ovarian cancer cells. Several cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes were identified. The microarray analyses also revealed that CFG potentially regulates EMT in ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
9 samples are analyzed, and 3 samples for each group,
