TITLE
Max as a biological blockade that restricts meiotic process in ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored Max ablation-mediated up-regulation of germ-related genes, especially meiosis-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells which were cultured either under conventional mouse ES medium or 2i condition using inhibitors against MEK and GSK3b.

DESIGN
Effect of culture conditions (conventional mouse ES medium or 2i condition) on the expression profile of germ-related genes in Max expression ablated ES cells were examined using inducible Max-null ES cells in which Max gene had been homozygously disrupted, but carries Max cDNA in ROSA26 locus with tetracycline-off system.
