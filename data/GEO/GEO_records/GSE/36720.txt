TITLE
mRNA expession profiles in prostate carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant cells that survive repeated radiation fractions undergo molecular changes and may differ in treatment response to subsequent molecular-targeted therapy.  We assess changes in cell lines of varying p53 status after various fractionation regimens to determine if p53 influences gene expression and if multi-fractionated radiation can induce molecular pathways changes. Differences in gene expression exist between cell lines and after varying radiation regimens that are p53 dependent.  As the duration of changes is at least 24 hours, it may be possible to use radiation-inducible targets for molecular-targeted therapy rather than depend on the presence of mutations, thus enhancing efficacy of targeted agents.

DESIGN
Whole genome gene expression of 78 samples from three human prostate carcinomal cell lines exposed to various radiation protocols.  Three biological replicates were run for each treatment.
