TITLE
Extraneous Genes of Mentally Retarded Subject in Terms of Microarray a gene expression profiling technology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Searching for new genes involved in Mental Retardation. This research has also leaded to the identification of set of extraeneous up and down regulated genes of mentally retarded male and female subjects by comparing with normal reference.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin® RNA Blood Midi kit, Total RNA was amplified and purified using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit, 750 ng of labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to each Human HT12 expression v.4 bead array for 16-18 h at 58°C, Arrays were scanned with an Illumina bead array Reader confocal scanner, All data analysis and visualization of differentially expressed genes was conducted using R 2.15.0.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
