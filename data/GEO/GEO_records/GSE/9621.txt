TITLE
Comparison of global gene expression between Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains 383 and 2192

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
At mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5), unique gene expression patterns were observed between these two strains with 3.4% of the transcripts (188/5570) expressed differentially. Of the 188 significantly varied ( > 1.8 fold) genes, 115 were up-regulated in 383 while 73 were up-regulated in 2192. Keywords: Different strains of bacterium

DESIGN
The goal of this experiment was to identify the differentially expressed genes from two genetically similar but phenotypically distinct P. aeruginosa strains 383 and 2192. Two strains were isolated two days apart from the sputum of the same cystic fibrosis patient. Following proper culture RNA was extracted from the two strains. Affymetrix GeneChip Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used to examine the gene expression paterns of the two strains.
