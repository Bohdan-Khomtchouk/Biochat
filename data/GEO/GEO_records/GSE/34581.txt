TITLE
Comparison of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha developmental and temporal knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to distinguish those genes regulated following acute HNF4alpha depletion compared to a developmental knockout model where gene compensation may comfound results. Expression profile of livers from 8 week old male Hnf4alpha Flox mice that express either albumin cre or the tamoxifen inducible ErT2-albumin cre for liver-specific deletion. Mice were fed a control diet or tamoxifen diet in the case of the ErT2-albumin cre to induce recombination.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, H4N  vs H4T vs H4EN vs H4ET vs H4CN vs H4CP. Biological replicates: 4 samples each group.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
