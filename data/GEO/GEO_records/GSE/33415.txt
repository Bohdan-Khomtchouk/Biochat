TITLE
Microarray of barley genes in wheat-barley chromosome addition lines

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare ; Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Transcript levels of barley genes were examined in the wheat-barley chromosome addition lines having one of six barley chromomes, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H and 7H.    ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Seungho Cho.  The equivalent experiment is BB8 at PLEXdb.]
