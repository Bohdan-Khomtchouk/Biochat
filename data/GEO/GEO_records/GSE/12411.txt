TITLE
Time course expression data from E.coli cells induced with differential amounts of IPTG

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
In this work expression of two rhsA elements, ext-a1 and daORF-a1, was differentially induced using IPTG. RhsA is a member of multigene rhs family and can code for five different open reading frames (ORFs), referred to as genetic elements. The functions of rhsA and the different ORFs it codes are not well understood. We used microarrays to study the effect of over-expression of two rhsA elements, ext-a1 and daORF-a1, on E. coli cells. Keywords: time course
