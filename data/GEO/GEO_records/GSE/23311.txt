TITLE
DNA Methylation Analysis in Human Chorionic Villus and Maternal Blood Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of DNA methylation in 12 human chorionic villus samples and 12 human maternal blood cell samples

DESIGN
We performed a genome wide analysis of DNA methylation first trimester CVS samples and gestational age matched MBCs.  We analyzed DNA samples obtained from 12 CVS samples and 12 MBC samples. Data were generated using two high-throughput approaches: the Infinium “humanmethylation27” platform marketed by Illumina and a custom Agilent-based platform. We then compared these data with genome wide transcription data for the same tissues. This Series covers only the Illumina HumanMethylation27 part of the study.
