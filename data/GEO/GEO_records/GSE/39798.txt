TITLE
Identification of transcription factors potentially involved in the juvenile to adult phase transition in rough lemon (C. jambirhi Lush.)

ORGANISM
Citrus jambhiri

SUMMARY
The main objective of the present study was to identify citrus transcrition factors putatively involved in the juvenile to adult transition in citrus. A  oligonucleotide microarray containing 1152 putative unigenes of citrus transcription factors was used.

DESIGN
Rough lemon (C. jambirhi Lush.), were analyzed in two diferent developmental stages, junenile and adult. Four replicates for each sample category  were generated and for each genotipe juvenile versus adult samples were compared . Comparative transcriptomic hybridization
