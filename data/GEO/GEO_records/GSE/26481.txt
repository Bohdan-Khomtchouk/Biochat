TITLE
Glycosyl-T expression in NB cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Ladisch's work focuses on the establishment of the biological significance of gangliosides that are shed by tumor cells, particularly those involved in pediatric cancers, including brain tumors and neuroblastoma. These studies are directed toward illuminating the hypothesis that shed gangliosides enhance tumor formation, possibly both by inhibiting the antitumor immune response and by enhancing growth factor-induced signaling and proliferation of fibrobalsts and vascular endotheilial cells in the tumor microenvironment. Delineation of the signaling pathways affected by ganglioside exposure is currently under study.

DESIGN
The effect of retinoic acid on the mRNA levels of ganglioside glycosyltransferases in neuroblastoma cells in vitro Experiment to determine mRNA expression for ganglioside glycosyltransferases in NB cells (untreated versus treated with ATRA) using the Glyco-gene Chip by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. Human NB cell lines LAN-5 were incubated with 10 ÂµM of all-trans retinoic acid or untreated as control, and total RNA harvested after 24 hours, 72 hours and 120 hours of exposure to retinoic acid. We performed three independent experiments on either cell line so that for each cell line and each time point three replicates were be obtained (total: 18 chips). Glycosyltransferases of particular interest are LacCer synthase, GlucCer synthase, GM3 synthase, GD3 synthase, GM2/GD2 synthase, GD1b/GM1a synthase, GT1b/GD1a synthase and GQ1b/GT1a synthase.
