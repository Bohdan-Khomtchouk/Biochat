TITLE
Anaerobic Degradation of Phenylacetate By the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon, Ferroglobus placidus

ORGANISM
Ferroglobus placidus

SUMMARY
Comparison of acetate- to phenylacetate-grown F. placidus cells to identify genes that are potentially involved in anaerobic phenylacetate degradation by this unique hypertherophilic archaeon.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown with 1 mM phenylacetate (experimental condition) and two separate cultures of Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 grown on 10 mM acetate (control condition).  Each chip measures the expression level of 2613 genes from Ferroglobus placidus DSM 10642 with nine 45-60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
