TITLE
Genomic characterization of osteoblastic differentiation of MC-3T3E1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of murine MC3T3-E1 cells induced to undergo synchronized osteoblastic differentiation in vitro.

DESIGN
MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in vitro for up to 28 days in the presence of 8-glycerol phosphate and ascorbic acid to induce osteoblastic differentiation.  Total RNA was isolated after 2, 5, 10 and 28 days in culture to sample proliferating preosteoblasts (Day 2), growth arrested preosteoblasts (Day 5), differentiating osteoblasts (Day 10), and mature osteoblasts (Day 28).  Timing of sample collection was based on direct measurements of cell number, alkaline phosphatase expression, type 1A collagen synthesis, and matrix mineralization in parallel cultures.  Triplicate samples from each time point were hybridized to slide arrays printed with the Operon Mouse Oligo set, version 2.0.
