TITLE
ChIP-seq of Tcfap2c in Neu mammary cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumors were harvested from mice carrying the rat activated Neu-oncogene and made into a single cell suspension. ChIP-SEQ was carried out as previously described in Kulak MV, Cyr AR, Woodfield GW, Bogachek M, Spanheimer PM, Li T et al. Transcriptional regulation of the GPX1 gene by TFAP2C and aberrant CpG methylation in human breast cancer. Oncogene 2013; 32: 4043-4051. Tcfap2c and RNA Pol II peaks can be found on their respective tracks.

DESIGN
2 ChIP-Seq data in Neu-oncogene activated mouse.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
