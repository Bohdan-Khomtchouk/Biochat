TITLE
LGG treatment on YANC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
YAMC (young adult mouse colon) cells are a conditionally immortalized mouse colonic intestinal epithelial cell line derived from the Immortimouse.Prior to each experiment, cells were plated at a density of 7.5 x 105 cells per p100mm dish.Cells were treated with LGG (the probiotic Lactobacillus GG ) conditioned media overnight, then harvested the following day. RNA were extracted with Trizol and purified with Qiagen kit. Affymetrix microarray chip Mouse 430A containing 19,000 murine genes was run in duplicate(experiment on 7-24-03 and 1-22-04 ). Data were analyzed using Affymetrix Genechip Operating Software (GCOS, Version 1.0) In each case; LGG treatment was compared to mock treatment controls.  Results are expressed as fold change of treated cells as compared to controls, as calculated using GENESPRING software (Version 4.2.1, Silicon Genetics, Mountain View, CA), Statistical analysis was performed using D chip. DNA microarray experiments demonstrate that epithelial cell hsp70 is one of the most highly upregulated genes in response to LGG-CM treatment Keywords: repeat sample
