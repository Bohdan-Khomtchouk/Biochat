TITLE
PTHrP-responsive genes in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is overexpressed in many cancer types. This secretory protein can induce hypercalcaemia of malignancy by mimicking the action of calcium-regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTHrP may also be involved in the regulation of migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. It can either stimulate signal cascades, such as the cAMP pathway, or act on not yet defined targets in the nucleus. In this study, we analyzed the effect of PTHrP-specific siRNA on gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were either transfected with the PTHrP-specific siRNA (siPTHrP) or a control siRNA (siLuc). Differences in gene expression pattern in siPTHrP- vs. siLuc-treated cells were measured by microarray analysis. More than 200 differentially expressed genes were found. Some of these genes have important functions in carcinogenesis. Keywords: siRNA knock-down analysis

DESIGN
Three independent transfection experiments were performed. Cells were transfected with siPTHrP or siLuc by electroporation, grown for three days and harvested for isolation of total RNA. RNAs were subjected to microarray analysis. The RNAs of experiment 1 are designated as siLuc 1 and siPTHrP 1, those of experiment 2 as siLuc 2 and siPTHrP 2 etc.. To identify siPTHrP-responsive genes, the siPTHrP- and siLuc-RNAs of the same experiment were compared.
