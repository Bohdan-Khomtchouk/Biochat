TITLE
Effect of Sidt2 deficiency on skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effect of Sidt2 protein deficiency on skeletal muscle, we developed skeletal musclespecific Sidt2 gene knockout mouse model using Cre under the control of the MCK promoter We used microarrays to detail the changes of gene expression.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscles from Sidt2f/f and Sidt2f/fCre mice  of two-month-old were compared.
