TITLE
Delineating Tumor-infiltrating Antigen Presenting Cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare tumor-infiltrating antigen presenting cell populations by global transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to help further delineate sub-populations of infiltrating myeloid cells in tumor. Methods: Four tumor antigen presenting cell populations were sorted from digested B78chOVA (melanoma variant) tumors in biological triplicate Results: RNA was extracted from the 4 groups (n=3 per group) and prepared for RNAseq.  Sequencing yielded ~405 million reads with an average read depth of 33.7 million  reads/sample.  Reads were then aligned to the mouse genome (UCSC mm10) and those  that mapped uniquely to known mRNAs were used to assess differential expression.
