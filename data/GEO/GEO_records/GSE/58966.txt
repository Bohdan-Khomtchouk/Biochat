TITLE
GATA2 shRNA Expression in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor GATA2 regulates chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer. We report a novel GATA2 transcriptional program that has implications for chemotherapy resistance disease and aggressiveness in castration resistant prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptional network changes induced in human Ch-CRPC cell lines by two shRNA mediated knock down of GATA2 versus random shRNA control

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
