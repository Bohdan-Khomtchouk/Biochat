TITLE
RNA expression at chromosome 8q24 in human colon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An inherited variant on chromosome 8q24, rs6983267, is significantly associated with cancer pathogenesis. We present evidence that this region is a transcriptional enhancer, that the risk region physically interacts with the MYC proto-oncogene, and that the alleles of rs6983267 differentially bind transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2). These data provide strong support for a biological mechanism underlying this non-protein coding risk variant.

DESIGN
Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from colon tissue in 5 individuals.  cDNA and DNA were analyzed on separate tracks, with the genomic DNA used to identify sprurious cross-hybridization

PLATFORM
