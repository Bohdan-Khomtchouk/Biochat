TITLE
CD98 marks a subpopulation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells with stem cell properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The application of compounds specifically targeting the cancer stem cells (CSCs), in addition to routinely used therapeutics, would likely improve the clinical outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The previously described monoclonal antibody K984 (now found to recognize CD98) was used to identify, select and isolate a specific tumor subpopulation. These cells were molecularly characterized and subjected to serial transplantation experiments to determine the CSC properties. We show that CD98high cells, in contrast to CD98low cells, are able to generate tumors in immunodeficient mice and that the CD98high subpopulation expresses high levels of cell cycle control and DNA repair genes, while the CD98low fraction shows expression patterns that represent the more differentiated cells forming the bulk of the tumor.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of CD98high cells (n=4 fractions) of VU-SCC-OE xenograft tumors compared to CD98low cells (n=3 fractions) from the corresponding tumors.
