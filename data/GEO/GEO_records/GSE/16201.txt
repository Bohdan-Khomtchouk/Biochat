TITLE
Breast tumor gene expression profiling for assessment of sufficient tumor cells for microarray diagnostic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of breast cancer primary tumor was performed to identify gene expression that is related to the presence of sufficient tumor cells. These gene profile can be used for identification of tumor samples that are eligible for microarray diagnostics.

DESIGN
A cohort of 403 early-stage primary breast cancer tumors was analyzed against a breast cancer reference pool
