TITLE
DNA methylation in postmortem brain samples from autism cases and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the Illumina 450KMethylation BeadChip to measure DNA methylation at 485,512 loci across the genome for 40 postmortem brain samples. The purpose of our study was to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with autism. Samples included 16 temporal cortex brain tissue samples (6 cases and 10 controls), 11 prefrontal cortex brain tissue samples (6 cases and 5 controls), and 13 cerebellum brain tissue samples (7 cases and 6 controls).

DESIGN
We bisulfute converted DNA from the 40 brain tissue samples, processed, and hybridized them to the Illumina Infinium 450K HumanMethylation450 BeadChip as specificed by the manufacturer.
