TITLE
Genetic loci that regulate healing and regeneration in LG/J and SM/J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MRL mice display unusual healing properties. When MRL ear pinnae are hole punched, the holes close completely without scarring, with re-growth of cartilage, and reappearance of both hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Studies using (MRL/lpr x C57BL/6)F2 and backcross mice first showed that this phenomenon was genetically determined and that multiple loci contributed to this quantitative trait. The lpr mutation itself, however, was not one of them. In the present study, we examined the genetic basis of healing in the Large (LG/J) mouse strain, a parent of the MRL mouse and a strain that shows the same healing phenotype. LG/J mice were crossed with Small (SM/J) mice and the F2 population was scored for healing and their genotypes determined at > 200 polymorphic markers. As we previously observed for MRL and (MRL x B6) F2 mice, the wound healing phenotype was sexually dimorphic with female mice healing more quickly and more completely than male mice. We found quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes (chr) 9, 10, 11, and 15. The heal QTL on chrs 11 and 15 were linked to differential healing primarily in male animals, whereas QTL on chrs 9 and 10 were not sexually dimorphic. A comparison of loci identified in previous crosses with those in the present report using LG/J x SM/J showed that loci on chrs 9, 11 and 15 co-localized with those seen in previous MRL crosses, whereas the locus on chr 10 was not seen before and was is contributed by SM/J.

DESIGN
Illumina v6 arrays used for tissue from punched SM/J and LG/J ear holes. Triplicate samples were used for each strain and each timepoint.
