TITLE
Soleus Muscle of Aged PAPP-A-Deficient Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice deficient in pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) have extended lifespan associated with decreased incidence and severity of degenerative diseases of age, such as cardiomyopathy and nephropathy.  In this study, the effect of PAPP-A deficiency on aging skeletal muscle was investigated.

DESIGN
Whole-genome expression profiling was performed on soleus muscles from 18-month-old wild-type and PAPP-A knock-out mice of the same sex and from the same litter ('womb-mates').
