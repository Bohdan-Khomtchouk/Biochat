TITLE
The affect of specific ablation of Runx3 from Esam splenic dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Esam/CD4+ dendritic cells are part of the innate immunity essential for priming and activating of CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 responsive genes Esam dendritic cells were freshly sorted from macs enriched splenic DCs taken from 6 weeks old mice. Four samples from four mice were sorted and analyzed where in each littermates pair consisted of a control and Runx3 conditional KO. Mice lacking Runx3 specifically in the DC compartment were produced by crossing Runx3fl/fl mice onto CD11c-Cre mice. This mating scheme generated Runx3fl/fl/CD11c:Cre (CD11c-DC-Runx3Î”) mice.
