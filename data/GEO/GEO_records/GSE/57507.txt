TITLE
The role of microRNA miR-17-92 in MYC oncogene addiction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-17-92 mediates the MYC oncogene addiction in a conditional mouse lymphoma model. To identify targets of miR-17-92 in this model, miR-17-92 was expressed in the conditional lymphoma cell lines using MSCV-puro.

DESIGN
Both control and  miR-17-92-expressing conditional lymphoma cell lines were treated with doxycycline (DOX) (20ng/ml) for 48 hours to shut off MYC expression.
