TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type and Rfx2-/- Testicular Transcriptomes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: This study was carried out to determine the consequences of the Rfx2-/- genotype on spermatogenesis in the mouse Methods: DNA was extracted from decapsulated testes of 21 day old mice. ChIP sequencing was used to determine the binding sites of RFX2. Results: ChIP-Seq analysis identified ~880 binding sites of RFX2 near TSS. Conclusion: Spermatogenesis undergoes complete arrest just prior to the end of the round spermatid period of sperm development in mutant mice. Sequencing results showed that approximately 105 genes were downregulated 2 fold or more in the testes of mutant mice. Comparison of similar studies of targeted mutations in genes for other transcription factor demonstrate that Rfx2 has a large and nearly unique set of genes that depend on it directly or indirectly. A large number of downregulated genes are identified with cilia function.

DESIGN
Testicular RFX2 binding sites were determined by deep sequencing using testes from 2 independentWT mice
