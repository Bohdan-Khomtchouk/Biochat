TITLE
cDNA array expression profile apetala3

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles of wild-type and apetala3 inflorescences. This series contains the data for three replicate experiments performed with three sets of biologically independent samples. Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were used as follows: Set 1:	wild type-Cy5		mutant-Cy3 Set 2:  	wild type-Cy3		mutant-Cy5 Set 3:	wild type-Cy5		mutant-Cy3 Keywords: repeat sample
