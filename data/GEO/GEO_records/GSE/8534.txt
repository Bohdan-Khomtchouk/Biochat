TITLE
50uM Casodex treatment of PC-346C Prostate Cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression changes following 50uM Casodex treatment were investigated to determine regulatory targets commonly overlooked in gene function specific microarrays and for comparison of the effects the wild-type AR expressing PC-346C cells against the mutant androgen receptor (AR) LNCaP cell line. Keywords: Expression response to treatment, will be used with another array dataset for cell type comparison.

DESIGN
PC-346C Prostate Cancer cells were treated for a period of 48h with or without 50uM Casodex following a 36h seeding period. At the selected time point, total RNA was harvested from the cells for hybridization and analysis by Nimblgen Systems Inc using the homo sapiens gene expression array.
