TITLE
Global gene expression responses to low doses of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accumulating data suggest that the biological responses to high and low doses of radiation are qualitatively different, necessitating the direct study of low dose responses. Most such studies have utilized 2-dimensional culture systems, which may not fully represent responses in 3-dimensional tissues.  To gain insight into low dose responses in tissue, we have profiled global gene expression in EPI-200, a 3-dimensional tissue model that imitates the structure and function of human epidermis, at 4, 16 and 24 hours after exposure to high (2.5 Gy) and low (0.1 Gy) doses of low LET protons. The most significant gene ontology groups among genes altered in expression were consistent with effects observed at the tissue level, where the low dose was associated with gradual recovery and tissue remodeling, while the high dose resulted in loss of structural integrity and terminal differentiation.  Network analysis of the significantly responding genes suggested that TP53 dominated the response to 2.5 Gy, while HNF4A, a novel transcription factor not previously associated with radiation response, was most prominent in the low dose response.  Thus, these studies address the molecular basis of response to low versus high dose low LET radiation exposure.

DESIGN
Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured at 4, 16 and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.1 and 2.5 Gy of protons. Three independent experiments were performed in the each time (4, 16 and 24 hours) using one tissue sample per a data point.
