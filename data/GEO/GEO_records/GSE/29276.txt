TITLE
Gene expression patterns in response to GATA2 (WT and mutants) in HL-60 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GATA2 mutants were discovered in families predisposed to MDS/AML and in sporadic cases of CML-blast crisis. Promyelocytic HL-60 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors that express GATA2 WT or T354M, 355delT or L359V mutants upon addition of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT). Microarrays were performed to identify GATA2 WT signatures and differences caused by these mutations.

DESIGN
HL-60 cells transduced with GATA2 (WT, T354M, 355delT and L359V) lentiviruses were treated with 4HT for 24 hours and RNA isolated and gene expression measured on Affymetrix microarrays.
