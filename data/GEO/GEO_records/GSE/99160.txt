TITLE
MicroRNA-202 maintains spermatogonial stem cells by inhibiting cell cycle regulators and RNA binding proteins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As miRNAs regulate gene expression either by inhibiting translation or by initiating mRNA degradation, we performed RNA sequencing to identify genes regulated by miR-202, using a Cas9/double gRNAs mediated and doxycycline induced knockout approach.

DESIGN
We carried out RNA-Seq analysis of miR-202 induced knockout single clonies of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) with or without treatment of doxycycline. Two single clonies (iKO-SC-1 and iKO-SC-2) were included for each condition.
