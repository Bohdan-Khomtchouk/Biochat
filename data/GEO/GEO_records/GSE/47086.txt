TITLE
Analysis of copy number variations among Chinese cattle breeds

ORGANISM
Bos taurus ; Bos grunniens ; Bubalus bubalis

SUMMARY
Here we describe a genome-wide analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) in Chinese domestic cattle by using array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). We conducted array CGH analysis on 30 male cattle individuals, animals from consisting of 12 breeds of Bos taurus/Bos indicus, 1 Bos grunniens and and two ones of Bubalus bubalis breeds for with beef, and/or dairy or dual purpose. We identified over 470 candidate CNV regions (CNVRs) in Bos B. taurus/B. indicus; 118 candidate CNV regions (CNVRs) in B. grunniens, 139 CNVRs in B. bubalis. Furthermore, based on the Y haplotypes of B. taurus/ B. indicus, Wwe also identified 69, 337, and 251 candidate CNV regions (CNVRs) in the sub-groups of Y1, Y2 and Y3 haplotypes.

DESIGN
The custom aCGH chips that interrogated the whole genome CNVs were build for 30 cattles from diverse Chinese cattle breeds with Angus as reference sample.
