TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Nf1-haploinsufficiency in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common monogenic tumor-predisposition disorder that arises secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Haploinsufficiency of NF1 fosters a permissive tumorigenic environment through changes in signalling between cells; however, the intracellular mechanisms for this tumor-promoting effect are less clear. We hypothesized that the genetic effects of NF1-haploinsufficiency may be discerned by comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiling in somatic, non-tumor cells from NF1-affected and â€“unaffected individuals. As a cross-species filter for heterogeneity, we compared the results from two human kindreds to whole-genome transcriptional profiling in spleen-derived B-cells from age- and gender-matched Nf1+/- and wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Total RNAs obtained from spleen-derived B-cells from age- and gender-matched Nf1+/- and wild-type mice were used for whole-genome transcriptional profiling as a cross-species filter for changes specific to NF1-haploinsufficiency.
