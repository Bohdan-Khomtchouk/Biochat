TITLE
An analysis of genomic structural alteration in three human ES cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate frequencies of genomic structural alterations, we performed an analysis using a SNP genotyping array (Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 DNA Analysis BeadChip Kit) for three human ES cell lines, namely, SEES-1, SEES-2, and SEES-3. Samples were collected after 4 to 60 passages to detect structural mutations occurred during the cell cultivation processes. Our results suggested a higher genomic stability of the ES cells compared to some well-known normal cell lines.

DESIGN
Several samples were collected after 4 to 60 passages and subjected to the SNP genotyping array. We searched for structural mutations occurred during the culture of the ES cells.
