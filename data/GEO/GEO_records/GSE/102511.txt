TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of 15 normal lung parenchyma (NL), 17 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and 16 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples from 17 patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to characterize expression profiles signifying the development of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) from normal lung parenchyma (NL), and its progression to lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD).

DESIGN
We performed transcriptome sequencing of 48 samples, comprising NLs, AAHs and LUADs, from 17 patients. Sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform afterwhich gene profiles differentially expressed among the three groups were determined.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
