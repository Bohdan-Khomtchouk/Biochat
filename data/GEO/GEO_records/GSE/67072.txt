TITLE
Effect of S534A substitution in the p65 subunit of Nfkb on response to 1µg LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT mice and Nfkb/p65 S534A were exposed to 1µg/kg LPS and their gene expression measured. Affymetrix Mouse 1.0ST chips were used to measure gene expression

DESIGN
Gene expression of the following mouse livers were characterized WT untreated (n=4). S534A treated with 1µg/kg LPS (n=4). WT treated with 1µg/kg LPS (n=4).
