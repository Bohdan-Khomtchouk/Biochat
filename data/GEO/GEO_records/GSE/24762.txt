TITLE
Genomic expression study of regenerated endothelial cells in high cholesterol-fed and fish oil-rich groups

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Experiments on primary cultures of native and regenerated endothelial cells demonstrated genomic changes in the latter related to vasomotor control, coagulation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix. However, the genomic changes caused by the combination of either hyperlipidemia or supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids and endothelial regeneration are unknown.The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that endothelial regeneration process is affected differentially at the genomic level by the exposure to either high cholesterol or PUFA-rich diet in vivo.

DESIGN
This study consists of three treatment groups, the control (n=8), high cholesterol-fed (CHL;n=6) and PUFA-rich (FO; n=6) groups. Native (LCX) and regenerated (LAD) samples of each animal from each treatment group was analyzed and followed by statistical analysis (paired t test) of all the animals from each group. The analytical results (N vs R) from each group would then be compared to that of the control group. Native cells from control group would also be compared to the native cells of the other animal groups (CHL/FO). Supplementary files: Comparisons of fish oil vs ctrl and high cholesterol vs ctrl.
