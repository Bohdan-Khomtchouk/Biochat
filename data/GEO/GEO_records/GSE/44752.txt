TITLE
The human Gut Chip “HuGChip”, an explorative phylogenetic microarray for determining gut microbiome diversity at Family level

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Bacteroides fragilis ; Blautia coccoides ; [Clostridium] leptum ; Lactobacillus acidophilus ; uncultured bacterium

SUMMARY
A phylogenetic microarray targeting 66 families described in the human gut microbiota has been developped aud used to monitor the gut microbiota's structure and diversity. The microarray format provided by Agilent and used in this study is 8x15K. A study with a total of 4 chips was realized.

DESIGN
Arrays 1 and 2: Hybridization with 100ng of labelled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from a mock community sample and 250ng of labelled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 1 faecal sample. Each Agilent-030618 array probe (4441) was synthetized in three replicates. Arrays 3 and 4: Hybridization with 250ng of labelled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 2 faecal samples. Each Agilent-40558 array probe (4441) was synthetized in three replicates.

PLATFORM
