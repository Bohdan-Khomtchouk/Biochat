TITLE
Gene expression of HEK 293 cells transfected with Vector (PCMV), Aire, or MBD-VP16

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing Vector only(PCMV), Aire, or MBD-VP16 with the goal of comparing the global gene expression profiles in the Aire and MBD-VP16 groups We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile.

DESIGN
HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing Vector only(PCMV), Aire, or MBD-VP16 and 72 hrs post transfection total RNA was collected for microarray analysis.
