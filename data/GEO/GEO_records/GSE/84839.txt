TITLE
Microarray expression profile analysis of long non-coding RNA in androgenetic alopecia: a study of Chinese men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examined the genome-wide expression levels of lncRNAs in androgenetic alopecia tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues by microarray analysis. We identified numerous lncRNAs that were differentially regulated between androgenetic alopecia and paired normal tissues.

DESIGN
Collected 3 pairs of male scalp androgenetic alopecia tissues and adjacent normal tissues, then extracted mRNAs from the tissues and transcripted the mRNAs into cRNAs. Then, cRNAs were hybridized onto the Human LncRNA Expression Microarrays. And then analyzed the results.
