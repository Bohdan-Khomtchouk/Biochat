TITLE
High throughput sequencing of B.henselae infected and non-infected I. ricinus salivary glands

ORGANISM
Ixodes ricinus

SUMMARY
In order to select genes that are differentially expressed in salivary glands during Ixodes ricinus infection by Bartonella henselae we compare the transcriptome of infected and non-infected salivary glands

DESIGN
I. ricinus from a pathogen free colony were infected -or not- with B. henselae at the larval and then the nymphal stage and salivary glands of the resulting females adult were dissected for RNA extraction. 454 sequencing was performed on pooled conditions in order to obtain a reference databank. Infected and non-infected samples were then sequenced separatly with illumina, blaston teh reference datbank and compared.
