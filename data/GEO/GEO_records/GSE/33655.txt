TITLE
Whole-transcript expression data for uveal melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G protein alpha q and 11 are mutated in 90% of uveal melanoma and they activate the MAPK pathway. Using expression microarray analysis, we identified a unique MEK dependent transcriptional signature with genes that are involved in proliferation and tumor cell invasion.

DESIGN
Uveal melanoma cells were profiled on Illumina Human HT-12 arrays per manufacturer's instructions
