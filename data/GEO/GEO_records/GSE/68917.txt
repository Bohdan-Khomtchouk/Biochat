TITLE
Functional cortical neurons and astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of human cortical spheroids (hCSs) derived from pluripotent stem cells using Illumina cDNA microarrays. The goal of the study is to assess the developmental maturity and the regional identity of those hCSs at two distinct time points with expression profiles and compare the expression pattern with in vivo data. Results show that those hCSs can map transcriptionally to in vivo fetal development.

DESIGN
Use transcriptional profiling to assess the developmental maturity and the regional identity of hCSs at two distinct time points.
