TITLE
CD34 gene silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of CD34 antigen in haematopoietic commitment, we silenced the CD34 gene expression in CD34+ stem/progenitor cells using a siRNA approach. Keywords: treatment comparison

DESIGN
To maximize siRNA transfection efficiency, we utilized the NucleofectorTM technology (Amaxa). CD34+ cells were transfected with a mixture of 4 siRNAs targeting CD34 mRNA and with a non-targeting siRNA as a negative control. The expression level of CD34 antigen on control cells (MOCK and negative control treated cells) and CD34siRNA treated cells was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis at 24 and 48h post-nucleofection.
