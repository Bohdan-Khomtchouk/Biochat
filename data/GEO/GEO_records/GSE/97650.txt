TITLE
Mural lymphatic endothelial cells regulate meningeal angiogenesis in the zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analyse gene expression in mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs)

DESIGN
Adult zebrafish brains were dissociated using Liberase and lyve1 Dsred postive cells FAC sorted into Trizol LS.  RNA was extracted and amplified before sequencing.  Samples were prepared in triplicate, with 6 brains used per samples.
