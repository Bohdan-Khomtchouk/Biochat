TITLE
IP of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) enriched DNA fragments from control and PB treated mouse livers (1 day)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-mC is an epigenetic modification of the DNA base cytosine with roles in gene silencing events, imprinting and X inactivation. Phenobarbital (PB) is a well studied non-genotoxic carcinogen with roles in epigenetic perturbation.  We profile 5mC in both control mouse livers as well as in the livers of 1 day PB treated mice. 5mC is largely found to reside in the bodies of active genes and promoter levels are perturbed upon PB induced gene activation events. 5-mC is assocated with promoters fo silent genes. Upon PB exposire a handfull of genes are induced which reveal decreases in promoter 5mC levels

DESIGN
comparison of 5-mC profiles in 5 control and 5 PB exposed mouse livers (dose: 1day PB)

PLATFORM
