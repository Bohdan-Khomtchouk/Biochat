TITLE
Changes in glycogene expression during maturation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the expression of glycosyltransferases in dendritic cells and the changes in expression associated with maturation.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from 5 different immature and mature dendritic cells subsets, with and without LPS from 2 different donors (20 different samples); (iDC, IL-10 iDC, Dexamethason iDC, Vitamin D3 iDC, im. macrophage), (mDC, IL-10 mDC, Dexamethason mDC, Vitamin D3 mDC, m. macrophage) were sent to both Microarray Core (E) and Core(C). The RNA was purified on an RNeasy Column, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the Glycov3 microarrays.
