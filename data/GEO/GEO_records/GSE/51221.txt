TITLE
Transcriptional response to TNF-alpha in a panel of 17 human melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A panel of 17 human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF and NRAS mutation status was stimulated with TNF-alpha for 72 hours. The goal of the study was to correlate the transcriptional response in BRAF versus NRAS mutated melanoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from a panel of 17 human melanoma cell lines treated for 72 hours with TNF-alpha or left untreated. Gene expression profiling was done using the Illumina Human HT12 v4 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
