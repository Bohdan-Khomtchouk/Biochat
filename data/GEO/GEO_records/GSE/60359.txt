TITLE
ISG15 in regulation of interferon responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed how lack of ISG15 influences the levels of transcripts after IFNa stimulation. Expression data from ISG15 deficient patients (P1, P2, P3) and control (C1, C6, C16) hTert fibroblasts

DESIGN
HTert-immortalized fibroblasts from C1, C6, C16, P1, P2 and P3 were treated with 1000U of IFN-Î±2b for 12 h, washed with PBS and left to rest for 36 h, after which relative mRNA levels were assessed
