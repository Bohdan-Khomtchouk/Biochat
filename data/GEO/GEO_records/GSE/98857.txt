TITLE
Epigenetical regulation in zebrafish heart regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Hitological and ultrastrucural observations show that zebrafish can restore the strcuture od the damaged heart heart via cell conversion. Dynamic immunohistochemistry analyses indicate that H3K9M3 and H3K9Ac may invlove the processes of cytoplasmic remodeling and nuclear reorganization.We then employ ChIP-seq to identify the targets of the two histone marks.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was used to analyze chromatin-binding sites by two histone marks:H3K9M3 and H3K9Ac at 0dpa, 6dpa and 9dpa

PLATFORM
GPL18413 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Danio rerio)
