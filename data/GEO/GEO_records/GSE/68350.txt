TITLE
Expression analysis of M.tb H37Rv after treatment with DTT (reduced) for 3 hrs

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Effect of Thiol reductive stress (DTT 1mM) on M.tb Rv was studied.

DESIGN
DTT reduced at 1 mM concentration was added to log pahse culture of M.tb H37Rv. After Three hours RNA was isolated and  hybridization was done on  HRI-UMNDJ Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4.8K CAG_Mtb microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL4057 PHRI-UMNDJ Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4.8K CAG_Mtb
