TITLE
RNA expression changes in MDA-MB-231 cells following MEK inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular responses to MEK inhibition in cancer cells are complex and dynamic. We performed a time-series experiment to measure global RNA expression changes following treatment with the MEK inihibor U0126

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were grown in low-serum conditions. Treatment with U0126 was initiated in the presence of EGF. RNA was harvested at multiple time points during the course of 48 hours.
