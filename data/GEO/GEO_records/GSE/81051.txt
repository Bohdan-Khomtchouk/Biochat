TITLE
Differential gene expression profiling of resting Vs proliferating Treg cells from NOD mice G-BMDC-T-cell co-cultures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Resting and proliferating Treg cells from NOD mice G-BMDC-Treg co-cultures were sorted out and anlyzed for differential gene expresion pattern. Proliferating Treg cells had increased expression of )X40, Notch and IL-2R related genes inaddition to Foxp3 and its functional partners genes.

DESIGN
Resting Vs prolifrating Treg cells.
