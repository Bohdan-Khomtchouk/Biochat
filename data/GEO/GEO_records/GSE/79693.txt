TITLE
Expression data from human placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDMSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
When PDMSCs were induced to heptocytes in vitro, cells mophology, stem cell markers, mitochondrial metabolism will change according to the differentiated status.But dedifferentiation reverses differentiated cells to a more primitive phenotype and PDMSCs will retain the multilineage potency. Furthermore, it will leads to the alteration of gene expression pattern. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying dedifferentiation and hepatogenic differentiation prcocesses, we intend to identify distinct classes of differentiated genes during these processes.

DESIGN
Human PDMSCs at passage 5 were induced to hepatocytes for 11 days, then the inductive medium was replaced by general culture medium for 1 day. Then human PDMSCs, hepatogenic PDMSCs at 11 days, dedifferentiated PDMSCs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To that end, we hand-selected cells at three time-points: before hepatogenic induction (P), hepatogenic PDMSCs at 11 days (H) and dedifferentiated PDMSCs for 1 day (DH) .
