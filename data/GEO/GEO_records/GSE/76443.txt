TITLE
Gene expression data from SW1990 cells stably expressing Fbw7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fbw7 plays a negative role in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis and progression. To further clarify the function and mechanism that Fbw7 plays in pancreatic cancer,mRNA microarray assays were performed to identify the genes and signaling pathways that were changed upon Fbw7 overexpression.

DESIGN
Fbw7 overexpressing SW1990 cells were cultured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mRNA microarrays. These were compared against the control,which were infected by empty control lentiviral particles.
