TITLE
Phenotype and RNA-Seq-Based Transcriptome Profiling of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in response to Tea tree oil

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used in our study to elucidate the mechanism of Tea tree oil (TTO) as a potential antibacterial agent to evaluate differentially expressed genes and functional network analysis in S. aureus ATCC 29213 biofilms.

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus  biofilm cells were exposed for 60 minutes to TTO at concentration of 1/2Ã—MBIC (1 mg/ml).2 samples including 2 control samples are analyzed.
