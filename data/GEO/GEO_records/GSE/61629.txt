TITLE
Expression data from patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Polycythemia Vera (PV), Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) (untreated)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to assess gene expression in patients with ET, PV, and PMF before treatment with IFNalpha2.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from whole blood and amplified to biotin-labeled aRNA and hybridized to microarray chips. Background correction, normalization, and gene expression index calculation were performed with the robust multi-array (rma) method. The regularized t-test limma was used to calculate differences in gene expression between patients and control subjects.
