TITLE
Blood genomic expression profile for ischemic stroke (IS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stroke is a “brain attack” cutting off vital blood, and consequently the nutrients and oxygen vital to the brain cells that control everything we do. Stroke is a complex disease with unclear pathogenesis resulting from environmental and genetic factors. To better understand IS´s etiology, we performed genomic expression profiling of patients and controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 20 IS patients and 20 sex- and age-matched controls using Affymetrix microarrays.
