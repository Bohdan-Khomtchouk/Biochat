TITLE
Difference expression analyses before and after human fucosyltransferase gene 1 transfection into ovarian  cancer clear cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
75% ovarian epithelial tumor overexpresses Lewis y antigen, which notably strenthen such malignant biological behaviors as metastasis, drug resistance and proliferation. The key enzyme of Lewis y synthesis is human fucosyltransferase gene 1(hfut1).  Through transfecting hfut1 into Lewis y low expressing cell line RMG-I, we got a pair of cell lines. We hypothesized that Lewis y antigen plays a major role in ovarian canceration . Using gene arrays, we comprehensively profiled mRNA differential expression between fut1-pretransfected and posttransfected clear cell of human epithelial OvCa. We expected that over-expression of lewis y antigen would lead to higher expression of genes associated with growth, metastasis,proliferation and so on.

DESIGN
we established ovarian tumor cell line RMG-I-H by stably transfecting  human fucosyltransferase gene 1 into cell line RMG-I. RMG-I-H overexpresses Lewis y antigen, which is known as a cancer-related tetrasaccharide antigen. We profiled for gene expression both cells pretransfected and posttransfected.
