TITLE
Gene Profiling in the Livers of Wild-Type and PPARalpha-Null Mice Exposed to Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unlike the PPARalpha agonist W14,643, PFOA is capable of inducing effects independently of PPARa. Genes altered in the PPARalpha-null mouse following exposure to PFOA included those associated with fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, xenobiotic metabolism, and cell cycle progression. The specific signaling pathway(s) responsible for these effects is not readily apparent but it is conceivable that other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily such as PPARbeta/delta and CAR may be involved. Keywords: dose response
