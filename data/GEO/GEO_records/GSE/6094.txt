TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 time course with Agilent Arrays

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Using our newly designed C. acetobutylicum arrays we analyzed the mRNA changes during a time course experiment (up to 66 h) paying special attention on the study of the late timepoints. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Samples were taken from a Bioflow II reactor at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 48, 54, 58, and 66 hrs after bioreactor inoculation. Two slides per timepoint were hybridized on a dye swap configuration. The control mRNA was generated by combining samples taken at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 48, 54, 58, and 66 hrs after bioreactor inoculation. For timepoints 6, 8, 14, 32, 38, 66 our internal quality control check suggested a larger than normal variation of the intensities in the control channel and a third slide was hybridized. The discarded slides are GSM141189, GSM141203, GSM141222, GSM141229 and GSM141242.
