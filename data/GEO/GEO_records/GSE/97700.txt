ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
12plex_vitis_2011-02 - 12plex_vitis_2011_02_24h - Biological question (15 lines max): Identification of grape genes regulated in response to resistance inducer treatments. This transcriptomic analysis should provide insight in the mode of action of the compounds under study and yield generic data relevant to grape defense reaction. - Identification of grape genes regulated in response to resistance inducer treatments.
