TITLE
Host response transcriptional profiling of typhoid fever infected Nigerian children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were able to obtain distinct gene expression profile between children with typhoid fever and other bacteremic infections.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood of Nigerian children with typhoid fever and other bacteremic infection were obtained in Paxgene tubes.  Total RNa were extracted using Paxgene blood RNA kit and 4x44K (G4112F) human GE array were processed according to standard Agilent procedures
