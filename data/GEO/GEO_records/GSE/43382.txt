TITLE
Gene-expression change along with differentiation stage from human iPS cells to astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
gene-expression change along with differentiation stage from human iPS cells to astrocytes is unkown. We used microaray to investigate gene-expression change along with differentiation stage from human iPS cells to astrocytes, and to confirm similarity between human primary astrocyte and iPSC-derived astrocytes.

DESIGN
comparison along with differentiation stage from human iPS cells to astrocytes
