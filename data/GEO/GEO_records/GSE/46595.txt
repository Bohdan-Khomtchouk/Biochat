TITLE
Integrated epigenomic analyses of enhancer as well as promoter regions in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand epigenetic changes in the distal regulatory as well as proximal regions, we performed RNA-seq, MBD-seq, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq on gastric tissues and cell lines

DESIGN
MBD sequencing of normal tissue (n), purified gastric cancer (sc), and cultured gastric cancer cell (dc) were generated by deep sequencing, in five samples from three patients (csc1, csc2, csc3) and two replicates (csc1_sc2, csc1_sc3), using Illumina GAIIx.
