TITLE
Genome wide analysis of liver histone H3K9 acetylation after partial hepatectomy in glucose-treated and control mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the results of AcH3K9 ChIP-Seq on regenerating liver harvested 12 h after partial hepatectomy (PH) from mice treated with supplemental parenteral dextrose (to delay onset of PH-induced hypoglycemia) or vehicle (as control).

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of delaying PH-induced hypoglycemia on histone H3K9 acetylation in regenerating liver.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
