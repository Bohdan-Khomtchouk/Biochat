TITLE
poplar bent study-TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS OF POPLAR STEM ACCOMMODATION TO REPEATED BENDING Species: Populus tremula x Populus aba

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
affy_pop_2011_08 - poplar bent study - genes regulated by PtaZFP2 in absence of mechanical stress - genes regulated by PtaZFP2 after one bending.Species: Populus tremula x Populus alba-- The laboratory previously established a poplar transgenic line overexpressing PtaZFP2 under the control of an estradiol-inducible promoter. - the experiment, conducted on 3-month-old hydroponically-grown poplars, consists in the comparison of WT poplars treated with estradiol and the PtaZFP2-overexpressing line treated with estradiol. We also compared unbent and bent PtaZFP2-overexpressing poplars. The applied strain is quantitatively controlled (Coutand & Moulia, 2000, JExpBot; coutand et al., 2009, Plant Physiology) - 27 arrays - poplar; gene knock in (transgenic)

DESIGN
27 samples are wt; for this experiment only the bending comparaison are studied.
