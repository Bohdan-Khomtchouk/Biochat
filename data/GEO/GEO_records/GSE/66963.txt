TITLE
Gene expression profiling of SF1 in mouse uterus tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic silencing of Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF1) is lost in endometrial tissue in endometriosis and this is hypothesized to result in de novo local steroidogenesis favoring growth and inflammation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial specific transcriptional and functional role of SF1 in vivo by utilizing a mouse model in which SF1 was conditionally expressed in the uterus. SF1 expression resulted in the development of cystic endometrial glands and infertility. Endometriosis induction by auto-transplantation of a biopsy of uterine tissue sutured to the mesenteric membrane resulted in 4-fold increase in size ectopic lesions from SF1 expressing mice. Microarray analysis demonstrated SF1-regulated genes are involved in several pathways including epithelial and tube development, migration of lymphocytes and leukocytes, cellular movement and vascular development.
