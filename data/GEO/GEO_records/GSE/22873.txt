TITLE
Ager (Rage) and Myd88 deletion in resected mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of resection of mouse livers on survival serve as a model for the effect of resection of human livers, which are performed for both the purposes of removing sick tissue and for transplanting healthy tissue. When less than 70% of a mouse liver is resected, the mouse usually lives. However, when more than 70% is resected, there is an increased probability that the mouse will die. We have found that deletion of Ager (Advanced Glycation End products receptor) (Rage) increases the chance of mouse survival relavtive to WT. Conversely, the deletion of Myd88 decreases the chances of survival, as does the simultaneous deletion of both Ager and Myd88. To understand these genotype/phenotype relations, we performed gene expression measurements.

DESIGN
Gene expression of livers of WT C57BL/6 mice, Ager-null C57BL/6 mice, Myd88-null C57BL/6 mice, and Ager-null/Myd88-null C57BL/6 mice, all 10-12 weeks-old and sacrificed 2 hours after 85% liver resection, were compared. 4-6 replicates each group.
