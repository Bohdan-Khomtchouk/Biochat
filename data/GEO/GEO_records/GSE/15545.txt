TITLE
Gene expression profiling of distinct serotypes of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
To further confirm the genetic diversity and virulence evolution of A. pleuropneumoniae To determine the gene sets with different expression levels (high, normal and low, respectively) Keywords: serotype comparison

DESIGN
A. pleuropneumoniae strains were grown in TSB medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and 10% (v/v) filtered cattle serum at 37°C. The intensities were normalized and transformed into log2 value. The values for each time point were averaged and the genes with log2 ratio > =1 or < =-1 were selected as differentially expressed genes.
