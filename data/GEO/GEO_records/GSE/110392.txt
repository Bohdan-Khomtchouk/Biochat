TITLE
RNA-seq data of mouse cerebral cortex in control and UTX conditional knockout groups

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that UTX deficiency increases neural progenitor cells (NPCs) proliferation, decreases terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we discover that impairment of cortex development caused by lack of UTX is less significant in males than in females. And further knockdown of UTY in male UTX-deficient cortex makes the phenotype consistent with the femaleâ€™s. In order to understand the amount of gene expression, gene expression differences, as well as differences in gene patterns and functional clustering and other aspects of the situation after UTX conditional knockout in cortex, we conducted RNA-seq.

DESIGN
There are two samples: one is control and the other one is UTX conditional knockout cortex, both of the samples are harvested from female.

PLATFORM
