TITLE
Differential gene expression in the mesenteric fat among crossbred beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Steer mesenteric fat transcriptome. Evaluation of the naturally occurring transcriptome variation in mesenteric fat among beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of mesenteric fat were examined for expression differences that contribute to cattle feed efficiency.
