TITLE
Different toxicity mechanisms for citrinin and ochratoxin A revealed by transcriptomic analysis in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to reveal the genomic response of yeast cells to the related mycotoxins citrinin (CIT) and ochratoxin A (OTA). Both mycotoxins can be produced by the same filamentous fungi and co-contaminate the same foodstuff. However, it is not known whether CIT and OTA share the same toxicity mechanisms or not. We performed transcriptomic profiling experiments using microarray hybridization of a pdr5 mutant strain exposed separately to CIT or OTA and exposed to a combination of both toxins. A yeast pdr5 mutant was used, because it is significantly sensitized to both toxins. We find that CIT and OTA cause the rapid activation of largely non-overlapping gene sets. The most prominent functional group of CIT-activated genes corresponds to the cellular response to oxidative stress, while OTA-activated genes belong predominantly to  single organism developmental processes and meiosis/sporulation. The combined exposure of CIT and OTA revealed a mixed response of functional gene groups. Our results demonstrate that CIT and OTA have distinguishable and independent biological effects with oxidative stress being a hallmark for CIT toxicity and the deregulation of developmental genes being the principal feature for OTA toxicity.

DESIGN
Gene expression in yeast cells was measured under four conditions: control, citrinin (200ppm), ochratoxin A(200ppm), and a combination of both mycotoxins (100ppm of each). Samples were taken at 30 (ochratoxin A and combined treatment) and 60 min (control and citrinin).  Four replicates were performed for each condition.
