TITLE
Expression profiling of splenic dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) play a vital role in innate immunity. Transcriptome of DCs isolated from mouse spleen was obtained and deposited here. Keywords: Spleen, DCs

DESIGN
We sought to determine the expression profile of splenic CD11c+ cells. RNA was extracted from DCs sorted from mouse spleen (CD11c+ cells) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
