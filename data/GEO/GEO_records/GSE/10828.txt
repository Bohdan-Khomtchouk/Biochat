TITLE
Vastus lateralis muscle of patients with an acute COPD exacerbation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further unravel the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the loss of muscle function during an acute exacerbation, a cross-sectional microarray study was designed to compare the gene expression profile of the vastus lateralis muscle in patients with an acute COPD exacerbation and in stable COPD patients. Keywords: cross-sectional patient study
