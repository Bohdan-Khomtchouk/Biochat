TITLE
Copy number variation analysis on a non-Hodgkin lymphoma case-control study identifies an 11q25 duplication associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent GWAS have identified several susceptibility loci for NHL. Despite these successes, much of the heritable variation in NHL risk remains to be explained. Common copy-number variants are important genomic sources of variability, and hence a potential source to explain part of this missing heritability. In this study, we carried out a CNV analysis using GWAS data from 681 NHL cases and 749 controls to explore the relationship between common structural variation and lymphoma susceptibility. Here we found a novel association with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) risk involving a partial duplication of the C-terminus region of the LOC283177 long non-coding RNA that was further validated by quantitative PCR. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), known somatic deletions were identified on chromosomes 13q14, 11q22-23, 14q32 and 22q11.22. Our study shows that GWAS data can be used to identify germline CNVs associated with disease risk for DLBCL and somatic CNVs for CLL/SLL.

DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide CNV analysis of 681 NHL cases and 749 controls from the San Francisco Bay Area, genotyped using the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip array. Signal intensity data in the form of log R ratio (LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) values were obtained directly from the Beadstudio software. Quality control filtering was used to exclude unreliable samples, resulting in a final dataset of 619 NHL cases (205 FL, 242 DLBCL, 172 CLL/SLL) and 730 controls.
