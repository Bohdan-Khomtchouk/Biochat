TITLE
C57BL/6 C3H/HeJ apoE-/- mice - gene expression in aorta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J (B6) and C3H/HeJ (C3H) exhibit a marked difference in their susceptibility to atherosclerosis and the arterial wall has proven to be a source of the difference in atherosclerosis susceptibility.  Genome-wide gene expression analysis was conducted in aortic walls of the two strains.  Total RNA was extracted from aortas of 6-week-old female B6 and C3H apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice fed a chow or Western diet.  1514 genes in chow fed mice and 590 genes in Western fed mice were found to be differentially expressed between the two strains.  RNA was extracted from aorta using a Trizol protocol.  Total RNA was pooled in an equal amount from 4 mice for each group. Standard Affymetrix procedures were performed using 8ug of total RNA. Microarrays were used to detect gene expression in aortic walls of two apoE-deficient mouse strains when fed a chow or western diet. Keywords: atherosclerosis, arterial walls, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Inbred strains, Hyperlipidemia, and Western diet

DESIGN
4 groups of mice were studied: C57BL/6 apoE-/- mice on chow diet (03-62_BC), C57BL/6 apoE-/- mice on Western diet (03-62_BW), C3H/HeJ apoE-/- mice on chow diet (03-62_CC), and C3H/HeJ apoE-/- mice on Western diet (03-62_CW). Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age onto a chow diet. At 4 weeks of age, mice were switched onto a western diet or continued the chow diet for 2 additional weeks.
