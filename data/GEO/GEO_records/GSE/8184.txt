TITLE
Profiling Single and Repeated Immobilization Stress Responses in Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling single and repeated immobilization stress responses in gene expression in rat adrenal medulla Keywords: Stress responses

DESIGN
Immobilization stress (IMO) was performed with 2-hour once and 2-hour daily for 6 days repeated. Control groups were not exposed to stress (absolute controls). Following the last IMO, rats were euthanized by decapitation and both adrenal medulla tissues were dissected from the animal. Total RNA were isolated and the array experiments were done by Affymetrix. Data analysis will be performed by GeneTraffic program.
