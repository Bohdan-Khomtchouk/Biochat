TITLE
Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal signals to activate dormant neural stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through single cell transcriptome analysis, we uncovered molecular signatures of CD133+/GFAP- ependymal (E) cells, CD133+/GFAP+ neural stem (B) cells, Dlx2+ neuroblasts (A cells), and Sox10+ oligodendrocyte progenitors (O cells) in the adult mouse forebrain neurogenic zone. prominent hub genes of the gene network unique to ependymal CD133+/GFAP- quiescent cells are enriched for receptors of angiogenic factors and immune-responsive genes. Administration of VEGF activated CD133+ ependymal stem cells lining not only the lateral, but also the 4th ventricles, and together with bFGF, elicited subsequent neural lineage differentiation and migration.

DESIGN
Examination of 28 single cells and 4 populations of 10 cells from adult mouse forebrain neurogenic zone.
