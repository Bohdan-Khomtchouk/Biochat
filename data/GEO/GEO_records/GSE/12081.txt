TITLE
High-throughput pyrosequencing of endogenous small RNAs from Solanum lycopersicum leaf and fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Comparison of the endogenous small RNA content of tomato leaves and fruits.

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts was ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to 454 high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.454.com for details of the sequencing technology. Note: Raw data files were not available from 454 at the time this experiment was carried out.
