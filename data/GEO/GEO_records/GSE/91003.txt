TITLE
Oas1b-dependent Immune Transcriptional Profiles of West Nile Virus Infection in the Collaborative Cross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied the cause-effect relationships between the transcriptomics and phenotypic outcomes within the CC-F1 population, which allowed us to identify novel genetic signatures. Our results indicate that Oas1b status as wild type or mutant, and overall Oas1b gene dosage, link with novel innate immune gene signatures that impact specific biological pathways for the control of flavivirus infection and immunity.

DESIGN
Microarrays were performed on spleen samples from mice collected at days 2,4,7,12 post-infection with west nile virus or from mock-infected animals.
