TITLE
Gene expression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) strain ES10-5 evolved under salt stress for 5000 generations

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression changes in a DvH genotype ES10-5, a strain isolated from population ES10 which has been evolved under salt stress for 5000 generations. The gene expression was compared to a gentype ES9-11 isolated from ES9 evolved under the same condition for 1200 generations and the ancestral strain. The genotype ES10-5 was characterized in this study. ES9-11 was isolated and characterized in Zhou A et al., 2013.

DESIGN
Basal gene expression changes in salt-stressed evolved genotype 5000g-ES10-5 was examined and compared with salt-stress evolved genotype 1200g-ES9-11 and ancestor at mid-logarithmic phase in standard growth medium LS4D. The transcriptional responses to high salinity in evolved genotypes ES10-5 and ES9-11 and ancestor were characterized by comparing the gene expressions at mid-logarithmic phase under high salinity (LS4D+300 mM NaCl) to standard growth condition LS4D. Total RNA isolated from three replicates of salt-stress evolved 5000g-ES10-5,1200g-ES9-11, or ancestral DvH was labeled with Cy3 and co-hybridized with Cy5-labeled DvH gDNA to the individual array on a custom 12-plex NimbleGen oligonucleotide array.
