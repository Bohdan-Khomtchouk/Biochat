TITLE
Mouse tumors: Chaos3 Mammary Tumors (MTs) vs. Controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CNV profiling of tumors obtained from our Chaos3 mouse model for spontaneous breast cancer. The goal of this experiment was to determine copy number variations that were specific to MTs derived from this mouse model, when comapared to non-MTs.

DESIGN
15 tumor samples (12 MTs and 3 non-MTs) were analyzed against reference wild-type DNAs from C57Bl/6J and C3HeB/FeJ
