TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Human Primary Monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the gene expression pattern of human primary monocyte, an essential component of the innate immune system, from healthy subjects using RNA-Seq analysis

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from classical (CD14++CD16âˆ’) monocytes of 6 healthy subjects. Deep poly-adenylated paired-end RNA-Seq was conducted on extracted RNAs.
