SUMMARY
DNA Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently mutated in various hematopoietic malignancies; however, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that DNMT3A mutational ‘hotspot’ at Arg882 (DNMT3A-R882H) cooperates with constitutively activated RAS in transforming murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo and inducing acute leukemias in vivo. DNMT3A-R882H potentiates aberrant transactivation of ‘stemness’ gene expression programs, notably transcription factors Meis1, Hox-A, Mn1 and Mycn. Mechanistically, R882-mutated DNMT3A directly binds to cis-regulatory elements of these genes and induces focal CpG hypomethylation reminiscent of what was seen in human leukemias bearing DNMT3A R882 mutation. Furthermore, DNMT3A-R882H induced DNA hypomethylation facilitates gene enhancer/promoter activation and recruitment of Dot1l-associated transcription elongation machineries. Inactivation of Dot1l represses DNMT3AR882H-mediated stem cell gene dysregulation and acute leukemogenicity. In this dataset, we provided gene expression profiling data for (1) RH-RAS leukemia stem cells (RH-RAS LSCs), (2) LSCs transformed by MLL-AF9, (3) LSCs transformed by NUP98-JARID1A, and (4) Dot1l inhibitor-treated RH-RAS LSCs.

DESIGN
Gene expression data were generated using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Microarray (Affymetrix) for four independently derived RH-RAS LSC lines (termed as LSC RH-RAS #1, #2, #3 and #4), two RH-RAS LSC lines (LSC RH-RAS #1 and # 3) treated with 1 µM SGC0946 (a Dot1l-specific small-molecule inhibitor) for 4 days, one MLL-AF9-transformed progenitor line and three NUP98-JARID1A transformed progenitor lines.
