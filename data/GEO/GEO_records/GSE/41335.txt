TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Retinoic acid and 9 cis retinoic acid in zebrafish.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We are presenting the application of toxicogenomics in the evaluation of the toxic effects of retinoic acid and one of its isoforms the 9-cis retinoic acid. The main goal is to distinguish the pattern of action of the both chemical compounds and their action in an extended exposure. The results suggest a different pattern within the days and the chemicals. Representatives of each GO functional groups were selected and quantified by real-time PCR to validate the microarray data and to differentiate the action of retinoic acid compounds studied.

DESIGN
Two different treatments were performed in this study. Zebrafish fertlized embryos were exposed to retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, during 24h and 72h. 3 biological replicates were performed per treatment.
