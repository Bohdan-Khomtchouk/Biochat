TITLE
Rice gene expression using Agilent custom 8X60K Microarray

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We designed an array based on the release 7 of Michigan State University (MSU) rice genome annotation database ( http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu ). The array was used for investigating the expression divergence and regulation between two contrasting rice genotypes under high salinity stress.

DESIGN
The expression analysis was carried out using 14-day old whole seedlings from both japonica and indica rice lines. Two samples from NaCl treatment (0h and 8h) for each line were collected for the analysis. Two biological replicates were carried out for both control and NaCl treatments, resulting in a dataset of 8 microarrays.
