TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling of Oct4/Klf4/Sox2 (3Factor, 3F) + IL6 iPS clones derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used heterokaryon cell fusion based reprogramming and identified the cytokine IL6 as a potential regulator of reprogramming to pluripotency. We generated iPS clones using the four reprogramming factors (4F) Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc. In addition, iPS clones were generated using only three factors (3F: Oct4, Klf4, amd Sox2) with the addition of the cytokine IL6 to reprogramming culture conditions. Global RNA-Seq of the 3F + IL6 derived iPS clones was done for comparison with 4F-derived iPS clones, mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

DESIGN
This study includes 8 samples: 2 independently derived 3F + IL6 iPS clones, 2 independently derived 4F iPS clones, 2 biological replicates of mouse D3-GFP ES cells, and 2 biological replicates of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The latter 6 samples are provided as references for the 3F + IL6 iPS clones. Poly-A RNA was isolated and prepared for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit (v2) to generate 50bp reads. Reads were aligned to mm10.
