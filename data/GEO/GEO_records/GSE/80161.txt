TITLE
Tonic stretch of human lung cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptomes of 4 human lung cell types that were subjected to control (non-stretch) and 30% tonic stretch conditions for 4 hours and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from cells under control (time-matched) or 30% stretch conditions (4 hours or 24 hours) performed in technical replicate experiments. human lung alveolar A549 cells, human lung bronchoepithelial 16HBE14o- cells, human fetal lung fibroblasts CCL-153, human juvenile lung fibroblasts CCL-151

PLATFORM
