TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of gastric cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of gastric cancer cell lines. The Illumina Goldengate DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 1,505 CpG CpGs in 20 gastric cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 20 gastric cancer cell lines were hybridised to the Illumina Goldengate Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL9183 Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I
