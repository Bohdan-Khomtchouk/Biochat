TITLE
miRNA high-throughput sequencing of follicular thyroid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report data obtaibed from high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in 20 samples of follicular thyroid tumors. We analyzed a total of 4.7Â±1.5million reads per sample with 3 different pipelines. The main goal was to evaluate the usefulness of next generation sequencing in small RNA profiling and the concordance of its results with microarrays and qPCR. Additionally we verified published follicular thyroid tumor biomarkers in the set of our samples.

DESIGN
Small RNA expression profiling  with High Throughput Sequencing of 20 thyroid tumor samples, performed on an Illumina HiScan-SQ.
