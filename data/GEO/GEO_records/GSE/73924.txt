TITLE
The Properties of Genome Conformation and Spatial Gene Interaction and Regulation Networks of Normal and Malignant Human Cell Types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work, we generated hundreds of millions of Hi-C paired end sequence reads for three different human cells (RL follicular lymphoma cell line, primary tumor B-cells from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient, and MHH-CALL-4 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) using the Hi-C technique. An in-house Bioinformatics software pipeline was developed and applied to map sequence reads to the human reference genome, producing a large data set of high-quality and high-resolution chromosome contacts. Our computational analysis on these data reveal some interesting properties of human genome conformation, including conformational conservation and variation of the genomes of different cells, intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, aberrant chromosomal translocation, spatial gene clusters, spatial gene-gene interactions, and spatial gene-regulatory-element interaction. Furthermore, we derived spatial interactions between functional elements (genes, transcription factor binding sites) from the chromosomal interaction data. The data were then used to generate chromosome-/genome-wide gene-gene interaction networks, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) â€“ TFBS networks, and gene-TFBS networks. Remarkably, the connectivity in both networks shows the hallmark features of scale-free networks, suggesting that spatial interactions of gene-gene, gene-TFBS, and TFBS-TFBS in a genome are far from random.
