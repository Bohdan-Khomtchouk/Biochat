TITLE
Heat, Cold and Stress adaptation in Potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato seedlings were subjected to cold, heat and salt stress. Expression profiles were captured at three different time-points, 3h, 9h and 27h from two different tissues, roots and leaves. The experiment was preformed independently three times. Commercially available true potato seeds (Variety Gilroy) were germinated on rafts floating on hydroponic medium in Magenta boxes. Plants were grown for 5 weeks prior to stress application under long day conditions (16h light and 8h dark) at 25C with gentle agitation. To initiate stress the medium was replaced with fresh medium pre-chilled to 4C (cold stress), pre-heated to 35C (heat stress) or supplemented with 100mM NaCl (salt stress). Cold and heat stress were maintained for the duration of the experiment by placing the Magenta boxes on ice or in a water-bath at 35C. For every individual sample two boxes of plants were used pooling a total of 6 plants per sample. For each time-point a single control sample was used by changing the media in a similar way as for the stress induction. A total of six boxes were combined for the pooled reference samples. Plants were harvested at the appropriate time and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Roots and aerial tissue was separated prior to freezing. The tissue was stored at -80C freezer until isolation. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy isolation kit. The intactness of the RNA was verified on gel and the concentration was adjusted to 3ug/ul by ethanol precipitation and re-suspension.
