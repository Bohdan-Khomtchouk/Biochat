TITLE
B-ALL relapse analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison of RNA expression profiles from leukemic cells of 8 single B-ALL patients at diagnosis and relapse. For all patients, clonality of the blast cells at diagnosis and relapse was demonstrated to be the same (Germano, G., del Giudice, L., Palatron, S., Giarin, E., Cazzaniga, G., Biondi, A., Basso, G., Clonality profile in relapsed precursor-B-ALL children by GeneScan and sequencing analyses. Consequences on minimal residual disease monitoring. Leukemia, 2003). The study protocol was approved by the Research committee of the AIEOP and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before samples were taken. RNA extracted from BM samples was used for microarray analysis. The blast cell infiltration both at diagnosis and relapse was 75% and mononuclear cell were isolated using a Lymphoprep density gradient (1.077 g/ml, Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). RNA was extracted from blast cells at diagnosis and relapse and both samples were hybridized on an MWG 30K Human Array A (MWG, MÃ¼nchen) after direct labeling using two different fluorochromes (Cy3 and Cy5) for the respective samples.
