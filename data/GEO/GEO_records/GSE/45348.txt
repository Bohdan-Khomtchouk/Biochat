TITLE
Left-right transcriptomic differences in adult male mouse heart ventricles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Left and right heart ventricles of adult male mice were profiled to determine the differences in gene expression, control, coordination and signaling fabrics

DESIGN
Two-sides (L= left, R = right) gene expression profiling experiment in adult mouse male (M) ventricles (V). 4 biological replicates: MVL1-4, MVR1-4.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
