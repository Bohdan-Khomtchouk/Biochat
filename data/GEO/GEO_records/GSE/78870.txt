TITLE
microRNA expression profiling of response to first-line aromatase inhibitor therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main goal of the study is to define miR expression levels related to clinical and biological parameters. Now in particular, miR expression levels of fresh frozen (estrogen receptor-positive) primary tumors were related to PIK3CA genotype and with progression-free survival in breast cancer patients with metastatic breast cancer that received first-line aromatase inhibitor therapy.

DESIGN
Primary breast cancer specimens (N=106) were analyzed for the expression of 768 miRs. The miRs were normalized against the median level of 314 reference assays.

PLATFORM
GPL20662 TaqMan microRNA Low-Density Array pools A an B version 2.0
