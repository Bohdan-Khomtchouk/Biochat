TITLE
Upregulation of CD11A on hematopoietic stem cells denotes the loss of long-term reconstitution potential

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression patterns between phenotypic mouse HSCs (Lin- KIT+ SCA-1+ FLK2- CD150+ CD34-) separated into CD11A- and CD11A+ fractions. A link to our analysis of these populations can be found here ( ).

DESIGN
Mouse HSCs were subdivided based on expression of CD11A into positive and negative subfractions, and gene expression patterns analyzed by the Gene Expression Commons (gexc.stanford.edu)
