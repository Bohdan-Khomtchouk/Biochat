TITLE
Depletion of Erk1 and Erk2 MAP kinases in primary human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the effect of RNAi-mediated MAP kinase cascade signaling blockade in primary human keratinocytes.  Two sets of siRNA targeting different regions of the Erk1/2 genes were used, enabling identification of off-target siRNA effects.

DESIGN
Primary human keratinocytes were electroporated with scrambled control siRNA, a pair of siRNA oligomers against Erk1 and Erk2 (set A), or an independent pair of siRNA oligomers against Erk1 and Erk2 (set B).  Four days after electroporation, RNA was harvested.  Three biological replicates were performed for each of the three siRNA groups.
