TITLE
CD133+ colon cancer cells are more interactive with the tumor microenvironment than CD133- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD133-positive colorectal cancer cells exhibit enhanced tumorigenicity over CD133-negative cells. The CD133+ cells are more interactive with and responsive to their stromal microenvironment because they also express the cognate receptors, such as CXCR4, for ligands produced by their neighboring carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, such as SDF-1 (stromal-derived growth factor).

DESIGN
we isolated and separately cultured both the carcinoma cells and CAF from the same patient tumor.  Three samples (CD133+, CD133-, Carcinoma associated fibroblasts) in triplicate for a total of 9 samples.
