TITLE
Retinoic acid (RA) induction time-course to profile gene expression during mES cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine ES cell gene expression before RA induction are used to compare gene expression for time-points of 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours post-induction.

DESIGN
KH2 ES Cell RA Differentiation Time-course
