TITLE
Gene expression profile of TCR Vdelta1 positive gammadelta T cells expressed CD161

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the difference between CD161-negative TCR Vdelta1 and CD161-positive TCR Vdelta1 cells, we performed GeneChip analysis of these two types of cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors.   Such analysis identified 192 genes that were expressed at two-fold or higher levels on CD161-positive TCR Vdelta1 cells than on CD161-negative TCR Vdelta1 cells. Expression of three genes (CCL3, CCL4 and CD161) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
CD161-negative and CD161-positive TCR Vdelta1cells of three healthy volunteers were isolated from freshly peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
