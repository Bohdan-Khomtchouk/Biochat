TITLE
Expression profile of early stage in OKS mediated reprogramming regulated by Sox2 and Klf4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Klf4 and Sox2 are among the core reprogramming factor, and have different function in reprogramming. Klf4 is supposed to trigger MET in the early stage of reprogramming ,Sox2 is well known plutipotent relative gene. Klf4 and Sox2 play important role in induced reprogramming. We performed this experiment to identify the targets regulated by Sox2 and Klf4 respectively.

DESIGN
We perform a expression profile analysis at Day3 between OK plus TetOn-Sox2 infected MEFs and OS plus TetOn-Klf4 infected MEFs in iCD1(a optimized medium for robust reprograming) medium with or without Dox.
