TITLE
Gene expression signature of colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
lncRNAs contributes to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Analysis of tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 6 colorectal cancer patients was conducted. Results indicate insight into molecular signature of the tumorigenesis of CRC.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues in 6 CRC patients.
