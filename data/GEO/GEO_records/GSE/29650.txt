TITLE
Gene Expression analysis of castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone metastases tissue from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients at the RNA level in relation to expression of constitutively active androgen receptor variants termed AR-V7 and AR-V567es.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from frozen bone metastases samples were analyzed using a gene expression array and further to reveal differences in-between sample groups according to expression of AR-V7 and AR-V567es mRNA levels. Samples were defined to have high (AR-V high) or low (others) expression of those variants, respectively, for definition and more information please see HÃ¶rnberg et al PLoS One April 2011 Vol 6 Issue 4 , link and PMID below.
