TITLE
Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Methylation Differences in Muscle and Fat from Monozygotic Twins Discordant for Type 2 Diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monozygotic twins discordant for type 2 diabetes constitute an ideal model to study environmental contributions to type 2 diabetic traits. We aimed to examine whether global DNA methylation differences exist in major glucose metabolic tissues from twelve 53â€“80 year-old monozygotic discordant twin pairs.

DESIGN
DNA methylation was measured by the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip in 22 (11 pairs) skeletal muscle and 10 (5 pairs) subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. No replicates were included.
