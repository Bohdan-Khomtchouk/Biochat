TITLE
Expression data from normal Prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the LNCaP cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genomic regions which display concordant gene expression in prostate cancer, we performed expression profiling of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. These expression arrays were integrated ChIP-on-chip studies of active and repressive epigenetic marks in same cells to discover and characterise regions of Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Duplicate expression arrays of PrEC and LNCaP
