TITLE
Dkk4 and Eda regulate distinctive developmental mechanisms for subtypes of mouse hair-2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dkk4 transgenic mice in Tabby background lack hair follicle formation. Gene expression profiling showed significant down regulation of Shh pathway genes at E16.5 and E17.5, the secondary hair follicle induction stages. Keywords: development or differentiation design,genetic modification design

DESIGN
To define target genes of Dkk4 during secondary hair follicle induction, we  carried out microarray experiments with mouse back skin samples that from 2  developmental time points including E16.5 and E17.5 of Tabby and Tabby background Dkk4 transgenic mice.
