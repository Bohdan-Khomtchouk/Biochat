TITLE
Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of colon inflammation in interleukin-10 gene-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A total of 30 male IL10-/- (B6.129P2-Il10 < tm1Cgn > /J) and 30 male C57 control (C57BL/6J) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). All mice were between 28 and 35 days of age at the start of the study. For convenience and consistency in reporting, their age was defined as 35 days or 5 weeks of age. The mice were housed individually in standard shoebox size cages containing untreated wood shavings and maintained in an air-conditioned animal room with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Animals had free access to water and were fed an AIN-76A standard powder diet prepared in-house. This study was approved by the AgResearch Ruakura Animal Ethics Committee in Hamilton, New Zealand according to the Animal Protection Act (1960) and Animal Protection Regulations (1987) and amendments. Four days after arrival, all mice were inoculated orally with a mixture of Enterococcus faecalis strains and bacteria commonly found in the intestinal lumen to obtain a more consistent and reproducible intestinal inflammation. Mice were randomly assigned to five sampling groups (7, 8.5, 10, 12 and 14 weeks of age).

DESIGN
For the comparison of gene expression levels, colonic RNA of IL10-/- and C57 at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared because of a low HIS variability in the colon within those time points. A reference design with 15 arrays was used, where each individual RNA sample was hybridized with a reference sample onto the array, in a total of 3 or 4 biological replicates per treatment. Reference RNA was prepared by pooling equal amounts of purified total RNA extracted from small intestine, colon, kidney, liver and fetuses from normal, healthy Swiss mice.
