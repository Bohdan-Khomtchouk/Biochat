TITLE
Dlx1 and Rgs5 in the Ductus Arteriosus: Vessel-specific Genes Identified by Transcriptional Profiling of Laser-capture Microdissected Endothelial and Smooth Muscle Cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Closure or patency of the ductus arteriosus is a critical event in neonatal life. We aimed to identify genes that are specifically expressed in the ductus arteriosus versus (the non-closing) aorta Gene expression profiling of laser-captured microdissected cells offers the opportunity to study gene expression profiles in cells of different embryonic origin

DESIGN
Comparative microarray analysis of laser-capture dissected endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the rat ductus arteriosus and aorta at embryonic age E18 and E21.
