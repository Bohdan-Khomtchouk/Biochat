TITLE
Knockdown of mineralocorticoid receptor or glucocorticoid receptor on human endometrial stromal cells and decidualization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify mineralcorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent gene networks in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells.

DESIGN
Genome-wide microarray analysis was performed on primary cultures established from 4 different patients.  Stromal cell cultures were subjected to either GR or MR siRNA knockdown or control non-targeting siRNA then decidualized for four days before harvesting and RNA extraction for microarray analysis.
