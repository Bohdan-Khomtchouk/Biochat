TITLE
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 data for Type II Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type II Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (Type II EATL) is an aggressive intestinal T-cell lymphoma with poor prognosis and has not been molecularly profiled. Through targeted amplicon sequencing, we identified a large portion of Type II EATL samples that harbor mutations in the STAT5B, JAK3 and GNAI2 genes. Genome-wide DNA copy number profiling of Type II EATL tumors and matched normal samples was performed to determine copy-number changes in this disease.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP6 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on gDNA extracted from 4 tumors and 4 matched whole blood samples.
