TITLE
Gene expression data from Mt/Gi vs Mt root tissues

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula ; Rhizophagus intraradices

SUMMARY
Most vascular flowering plants have the ability to form mutualistic associations with soil fungi from the Glomeromycota. The resulting symbiosis is called an arbuscular mycorrhiza and they are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. Significant alteration occurs at physiological and molecular levels in both symbionts. To gain a better understanding of the AM symbiosis, we use a 16000 feature oligonucleotide based array to examine gene expression in an arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, M. truncatula/G. intraradices. Keywords: Medicago truncatula, Mycorrhizal, Glomus intraradices, microarray profiling

DESIGN
30 days after inoculation, the Mt/Gi and mock-inoculated (Mt) root tissues were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridized to the Medicago Genome Oligo Set Version 1.0 microarray. Six slides including three biological replicates and three dye-swap labeling replicates were hybridized for the experiment.
