TITLE
Gene expression data from Mt/Gi vs Mt root tissues

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Most vascular flowering plants have the ability to form mutualistic associations with soil fungi from the Glomeromycota. The resulting symbiosis is called an arbuscular mycorrhiza and they are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. Significant alteration occurs at physiological and molecular levels in both symbionts. To gain a better understanding of the AM symbiosis, we use a 16000 feature oligonucleotide based array to examine gene expression in an arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, M. truncatula/G. intraradices. Keywords: Medicago truncatula, Mycorrhizal, Glomus intraradices, microarray profiling
