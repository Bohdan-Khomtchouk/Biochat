TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in response to mercury toxicity in rice roots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To gain more insight into cellular responses to mercury, we have undertaken a large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during mercury stress.More transcripts were responsive to mercury during short (pooled from 1- and 3-h treatments) , as compared to long (24 h) exposures. After short exposures, these induced genes can be divided into different functional categories, mainly on the basis of cell wall formation, chemical detoxification, secondary metabolism, signal transduction and abiotic stress response. Molecular mechanisms for the mercury toxicity in rice roots.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, short exposures and long exposures. Comparison of mock control and rice seedlings treated with 25mM Hg during short (pooled from 1- and 3-h treatments), as compared to long (24 h) exposures.; Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (short and long exposures), 3 Hg-treated replicates (short and long exposures).
