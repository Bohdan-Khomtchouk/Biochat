TITLE
Methotrexate activates aspects of inflammation in EA.hy 926 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-folate drug used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The changes induced by MTX were profiled within EA.hy 926 cells grown in normal (Hi) and low (Lo) folate. Several inflammatory genes were up regulated and several mitosis related genes were down regulated.

DESIGN
Hi and Lo cells were grown to confluence and maintained in fresh medium for 24 hours prior to treatment with 0.5uM MTX for 48 hours.
