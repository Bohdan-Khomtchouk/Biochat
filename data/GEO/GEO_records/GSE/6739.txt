ChIP-chip analysis of Dosage Compensation complex members SDC-3 and DPY-27 in C elegans wild type embryos.

SUMMARY
Among organisms with chromosome-based mechanisms of sex determination, failure to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes is typically lethal. In C. elegans, XX hermaphrodites halve transcription from each X chromosome to match the output of XO males1. Here, we mapped the binding location of the condensin homolog DPY-27 and the zinc finger protein SDC-3, two components of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC)2,3. Strong foci of DCC binding were observed on X, around which broader regions of localization were centered. Binding foci, but not adjacent regions of localization, were distinguished by clusters of a stereotypic 10-bp DNA sequence, suggesting a recruitment-and-spreading mechanism for X recognition. In contrast to the Drosophila DCC, the C. elegans DCC was bound preferentially upstream of genes, suggesting modulation of transcriptional initiation and transcription-coupled spreading. A mechanism for tuning DCC activity at specific loci was indicated by stronger DCC binding upstream of genes with high transcriptional activity. These data provide a basis for understanding how proteins involved in higher-order chromosome dynamics can regulate transcription at individual loci.
