TITLE
Expression from Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300-lac during low and 2M NaCl exposure

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300

SUMMARY
S. aureus has the propensity to survive a range of NaCl challenge conditions We used commercially available Affymetrix S. aureus GeneChips (part number 900514) to compare the gene expression properties of wild type cells during growth at no or high (2M) NaCl.

DESIGN
S. aureus strain USA300-lac cells were grown to late exponential phase growth in the absence or presence of 2M NaCl, total bacterial RNA was isolated and subjected to GeneChip hybridization and analysis.  We sought to determine the regulatory effects of high NaCl.
