TITLE
Circadian expression data of Synechococcus in WT, rpoD6-null, sasA-null and rpaA-null strains

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, most genes show rhythmic expression controlled by the Kai-based clock under continuous light conditions (LL). We found that rpoD6-null mutants impaired expression of clock-controlled genes peaking at hours 8-10 in LL, while sasA-null or rpaA-null mutants each arrested the expression profiles at subjective dawn.

DESIGN
Time-course data (0-24 h) of wild type (WT), rpoD6-null, sasA-null and rpaA-null S. elongatus PCC 7942 strains analyzed under continuous light (LL) conditions after two 12h:12h light:dark (LD) cycles using Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip CustomExpress Arrays) representing 2,515 predicted protein-coding genes on the genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, which can be used also for the almost homologous strain, S. elongatus PCC 7942.
