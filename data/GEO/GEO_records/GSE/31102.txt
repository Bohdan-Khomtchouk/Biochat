TITLE
Expression data from GW8510 treatment of pancreatic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of insulin in terminally differentiated non-beta pancreatic cell types could be important for treating type-1 diabetes. We observed that the kinase inhibitor GW8510 up-regulated insulin expression in mouse pancreatic alpha cells. Gene-expression profiling and gene-set enrichment analysis of GW8510-treated alpha cells suggested coordinate up-regulation of the p53 pathway, which was further implicated in induction of insulin transcript.

DESIGN
In order to determine a potential mechanism of insulin induction by GW8510, we treated mouse alpha cells (aTC1) and beta cells (bTC3) with 3.3 ÂµM GW8510 or 0.1% DMSO for five days, and performed gene-expression profiling followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Three biological replicates were included per condition. GW8510 treatment in each cell line was compared to DMSO-treated control.
