TITLE
Expression data from MLL-AF6 positive leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The MLL gene on chromosome 11 fuses to the AF6 gene on chromosome 6 in a balanced chromosomal translocation that is characetristic of certain adult and pediatric human leukemias. We established a murine leukemia model of MLL-AF6 using the retroviral MLL-AF6 contruct in a bone marrow transplantation system.

DESIGN
Leukemic bone marrow cells from a sacrificed moribund mouse were thawed and RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and purified further using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) under standard conditions and and hybridized onto Affymetrix arrays.
