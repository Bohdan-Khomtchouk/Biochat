TITLE
Expression data from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) transfected with mimic-miR-23b or mimic-NC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found microRNA miR-23b was down-regulated in local inflammatory tissues of autoimmune disease such as RA, SLE and related mouse models such as CIA, lpr, EAE. Re-expression of miR-23b significantly inhibits autoimmune pathogenesis of CIA, Lpr and EAE. To identify potential targets of miR-23b, we use microarray gene-expression analysis to identify transcripts which could be repressed by miR-23b. RA: rheumatoid arthritis,  CIA: Collagen-induced arthritis, SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus, EAE: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis

DESIGN
We tansfected fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) with mimic-miR-23b or mimic-NC.Cells were collected and total RNA was extracted for the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
