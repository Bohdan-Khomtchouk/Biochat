TITLE
Mouse granule cell neuron transcriptional response to wild-type West Nile virus (WNV-NY) and mutant virus WNV E218A (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for transcriptional analysis in triplicate wells using wild type West Nile virus (WNV NY99 clone 382; WNVWT) and mutant virus (WNVE218A) in mouse granule cell neurons. This data set comprises two complete biological replicate experiments conducted in the same conditions and with data processed independently.

DESIGN
Granule cell neurons from day 6 C57Bl/6J mouse pups are infected with plasmid-derived wild type West Nile virus NY99 clone 382 (WNVWT) or plasmid-derived isogenic E218A mutant West Nile virus NY99 clone 382 (WNVE218A) with multiplicity of infection (MOI) 250.  Three technical replicates were performed at each of 1, 8, 12 and 24 hrs post infection. Time matched mocks done in triplicate are treated with mockulum: cell media concentrated through ultracentrifugation and diluted as virus. mRNA is sampled at all time points; microRNA is sampled at 12 hours post-infection. There were two independent biological replicates of the entire procedure, distinguished by sample name prefixes ('WGCN002' and 'WGCN003') and the biological_replicate characteristic field.
