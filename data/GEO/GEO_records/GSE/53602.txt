TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Transcriptional Components in Colon carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discovery of the genome-wide location of proteins using ChIP-Seq has allowed global mapping of the key transcription factors and chromatin regulators that control gene expression programs in various cells. Many DNA-associated processes are targeted for disease therapy. CDK8 is a kinase component of the Mediator co-activator complex and is often over-expressed in colorectal cancer. This study investigates the genome-wide localization of CDK8 in human colorectal cancer cells.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against H3K27ac and CDK8 as well as whole-cell extract (WCE) DNA controls.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
