TITLE
Effect of H19 Knockdown by siRNA on gene expression in C2C12 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to characterize the global changes in gene expression in C2C12 cells due to siRNA knockdown of long non-coding RNA H19

DESIGN
Control siRNA or siRNA specific for mouse H19 were transfected into day1 differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in triplicates. 40 H later total RNAs were isolated and subjected with microarray analysis.
