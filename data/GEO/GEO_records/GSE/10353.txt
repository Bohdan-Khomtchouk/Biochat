TITLE
comparisons wt-mutants 2 -Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment. Gene profiling in microRNA mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - comparisons wt-mutants 2  - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - Ler, dcl1-9, hen1-1 and hasty were grown for 12-day on MS solid medium ,seedlings were then transferred in MS liquid medium and harvested 2 days after. Keywords: gene knock out
