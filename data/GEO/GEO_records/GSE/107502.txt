TITLE
Defining the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Kinome Response to GSK1120212 (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LCCC1122 is a window trial in stage I-IV TNBC patients scheduled to undergo definitive surgery (either lumpectomy, mastectomy or surgical resection of oligometastatic disease). Enrolled patients will receive 1.5 -2.0 mg of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor GSK1120212 (trametinib; MekinistÂ®) orally once daily for 7 days (with treatment initiation dependent on surgical schedule) prior to their surgery, with pre- and post- treatment tissue analyzed for kinome response and resistant signatures. A single blood sample will be obtained for determination of plasma GSK1120212 concentration prior to surgery. Of note, the initiation of study treatment is defined by the surgical schedule; there will be no delays in standard treatment for the purposes of this study.

DESIGN
28 samples representing 12 patients including pre-treatment needle core biopsies and post-treatment surgical resections Raw data submitted to dbGaP (phs001405.v1.p1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap ) because of patient privacy concerns.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
