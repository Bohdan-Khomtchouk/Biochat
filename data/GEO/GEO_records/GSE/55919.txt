TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of live and hybridized J1 and NIH-3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
J1 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were grown in standard media conditions. Hybridized cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde; permeabilized in 70% ethanol; incubated for 12 hours at 30C in an RNA preserving hybridization (RPH) buffer (300 mM Sodium chloride, 30mM Sodium citrate, 2.1M Ammonium sulfate, 25% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml E. Coli tRNA, 500 μg/ml BSA); and reverse cross-linked for 1 hour at 50C with Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Proteinase K (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 500 μg/ml Proteinase K).

DESIGN
The fold change between J1 and NIH-3T3 cells was compared for live and hybridized samples (one replicate per sample).
