TITLE
Histone H4 acetylation in wild-type, ASF1, SET2 and ASF1 SET2 deletion yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-on chip assays to measure the change in histone acetylation over the yeast genome, in  ASF1, SET2 and ASF1 SET2 deletion yeast strains compared to the wild-type control. ChIPs of AcH4 from wild-type, ASF1, SET2 and ASF1 SET2 deletion yeast strains were normalized to the H3 enrichment.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. Deletion mutant vs. WT cells. Biological replicates=3 per IP per cell type.
