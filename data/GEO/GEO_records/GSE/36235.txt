TITLE
A p53-like like transcription factor similar to Ndt80 controls the response to nutrient stress in the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
The xprG gene encodes a putative transcriptional activator involved in the regulation of extracellular proteases in response to nutrient stress in Aspergillus nidulans.  To investigate whether XprG is required for expression of other genes in response to carbon starvation, we used microarrays provided by the PFGRC.  These experiments indicate that the expression of many genes, including the sterigmatocystin gene cluster and other secondary metabolism genes, genes involved in asexual and sexual development and genes induced during autolysis, is altered in an xprGdelta mutant.  Many of these genes are known to be regulated in response to carbon starvation.  The results indicate that XprG may play a major role in the response to carbon limitation.

DESIGN
An xprG+ (wt) strain and xprGdelta gene knockout strain (ko) were compared after transfer to medium containing 1% glucose (C)  or carbon-free medium (NC) for 16 hours.  The effect of the two nutrient conditions on each strain were also investigated.

PLATFORM
GPL15294 TIGR PFGRC Aspergillus nidulans version 1 array designed primarily based on strain FGSC A4
