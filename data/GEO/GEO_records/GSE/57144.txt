TITLE
Development of lncRNA and Mrna expression signatures for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our lncRNA and mRNA expression  approach to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC), we have employed lncRNA and mRNA microarray expression     profiling as a discovery platform to identify lncRNA and mRNA expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues and normal     pancreatic  tissues from PDAC  donors and other duodenum diseases donors.

DESIGN
analyze mRNA and lncRNA expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by microarray platform

PLATFORM
GPL13825 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent-033010)
