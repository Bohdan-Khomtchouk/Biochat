TITLE
Experimental characterization of the human non-sequence-specific nucleic acid interactome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The interactions between proteins and nucleic acids have a fundamental function in many biological processes well beyond nuclear gene transcription and include RNA homeostasis, protein translation and pathogen sensing for innate immunity. While our knowledge of the ensemble of proteins binding individual mRNAs in mammalian cells has greatly been augmented by recent surveys, no systematic study on the native proteins of human cells differentially engaging various types of nucleic acids in a non sequence-specific manner has been reported. We designed an experimental approach to cover the non sequence-specific RNA and DNA binding space broadly, including methylation, and test for its ability to interact with the human proteome. We used 25 rationally designed nucleic acid probes in an affinity purification mass spectrometry and bioinformatics workflow to identify proteins from whole cell extracts of three different human cell lines. The proteins were profiled for their binding preferences to the different general types of nucleic acids. The study identified 746 high confidence direct binders, 249 of which were devoid of previous experimental evidence for binding nucleic acids. We could assign 513 specific affinities for sub-types of nucleic acid probes to 219 distinct proteins and to individual domains. The evolutionary conserved protein YB-1, previously associated with cancer and gene regulation, is shown to bind methylated cytosine preferentially conferring YB-1 a potential epigenetic function. Collectively, the dataset represents a rich resource of experimentally determined nucleic acid-specific binding proteins in humans and, indirectly, for other species.
