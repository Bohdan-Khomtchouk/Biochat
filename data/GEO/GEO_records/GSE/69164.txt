Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals that ECM-Receptor Interaction contributes to the venous metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common kind of liver cancer in the world. Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is one of the most serious complications of HCC and strongly correlated to a poor prognosis for HCC patients. However, the detailed mechanisms of PVTT development still remains to be explored. In this study, we presented the large scale transcriptome analysis of 11 HCC with PVTT patients by RNA-sequencing. The dysregulated genes between HCC and PVTT suggested that the ECM-Receptor Interaction was correlated to the venous metastases of HCC. Among all the recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 6 skipping of RPS24, which is likely to be a cancer driver. We also identified five common fusion genes between HCC and its corresponding PVTT samples, including ARID1A-GPATCH3, MDM1-NUP107, PTGES3-RARG, PRLR-TERT and C9orf3-TMC1. All of the findings broaden our knowledge in PVTT development and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment for HCC patients with PVTT.
