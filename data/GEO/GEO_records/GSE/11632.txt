TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Tmprss6-deficient mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Matriptase-2 (Tmprss6), a recently described member of the TTSP family, is an essential regulator of iron homeostasis. Tmprss6-/- mice display an overt phenotype of alopecia and a severe iron deficiency anemia. These hematological alterations found in Tmprss6-/- mice are accompanied by a marked up-regulation of hepcidin, a negative regulator of iron export into plasma.

DESIGN
Tmprss6-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. Total RNA was extracted from liver samples from control and Tmprss6-deficient male mice after o/n fasting. Transcriptional profiling was analyzed using GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
