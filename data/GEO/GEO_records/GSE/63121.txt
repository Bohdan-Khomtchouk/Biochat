TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiles in 15 paired of gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues to determine the differentially expressed microRNA in gastric cancer tissue.s

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 30 tissues (15 paired of gastric cancer vs.normal tissues) was used for microarray analysis.
