TITLE
Solexa sequencing of small RNAs in Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV)-infected grouper cells

ORGANISM
Epinephelus tauvina

SUMMARY
We applied Solexa sequencing technology to identify Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) encoded microRNAs during its infection. A small RNA library arising from SGIV infected grouper cells (GP) was constructed and sequenced. We recovered 6,802,977 usable reads, of which 34,400 reads represented the small RNA sequences encoded by SGIV. Among them, 16 novel SGIV encoded miRNAs were identified by a computational pipeline. Generally, these 16 miRNAs are dispersed throughout the SGIV genome, while three of them are located within open reading frame 057L (ORF057L) region. Meanwhile, We identified 138 conserved microRNA genes between grouper fish and zebrafish.

DESIGN
18-30 nt small RNAs from SGIV-infected GP cells were sequenced in one Solexa lane.
