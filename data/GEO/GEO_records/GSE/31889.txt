TITLE
ChIP-chip from Drosophila egg chambers using MCM2-7 antibody

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the MCM2-7 replicative helicase followed by hybridization to genome-wide tiling microarrays demonstrated that MCMs localize to the follicle cell amplicons at stages of replication initiation

DESIGN
Comparison of MCM2-7 ChIP sample compared to input DNA for Drosophila egg chambers
