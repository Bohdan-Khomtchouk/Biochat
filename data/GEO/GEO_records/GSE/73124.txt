TITLE
Genome wide profiling of the RNAPII, γH2AX, H3K4Me1, H3K4M2 and H3K4Me3 in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the RNAPII and γH2AX occupancy genome wide by ChIP-Seq in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC80 MEF cells. We found that a week after MLL2 excision (FC/FC cells), a group of genes present higher levels of γH2AX and RNAPII near the TSS, as compared to the control (F/F cells).  H3K4Me1, H3K4M2 and H3K4Me3 levels near the TSS were also studied.

DESIGN
There is a total of 52 samples. 3 independent replicates for each experiment were performed. H3, H2AX and IgG ChIPs were used for normalisation or as controls.The experiments were performed using immortalised mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in which both MLL2 alleles were targeted by the loxp system (F/F cells). Tamoxifen treatment of the F/F cells for 24 hours results in the excision of both MLL2 alleles (FC/FC cells).
