TITLE
Oligouridylate binding protein 1b functions in plant heat stress tolerance

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand affected genes by overexpression of origouridylate binding protein 1b (UBP1b) under heat stress conditions, transcriptional profiling of UBP1box and control plants were analyzed under normal and heat stress (40Â°C) conditions using Arabidopsis custom microarrays.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted using UBP1b-ox and Venus control plants subjected to non-stress and heat-stress condition for 1 h.
