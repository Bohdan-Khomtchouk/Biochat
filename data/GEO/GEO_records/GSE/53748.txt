TITLE
Morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism responses of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to simulated microgravity based on comparative transcriptomics.

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) wild type strain exposed to simulated microgravity condition by clinorotation, we constructed a whole genome microarray to screen simulated microgravity sensitive genes using the Agilent eArray 5.0 program. The genechip was custom designed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Agilent, 8*15K). The genome sequences were downloaded from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?Db =genome & Cmd = Search & Term = NC_003888, NC_003903.1, NC_003904.1. Each gene was represented by one 60-nt oligonucleotide probe, and 680 genes associated with morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism out of the total 8116 genes were replicated 9 times each.

DESIGN
Cells of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) wild type strain were harvested from the colonies grown in JCM42 agar medium at 28°C for 96h (4d) under simulated microgravity and 1g control conditions. Total RNA was extracted to conduct the microarray hybridization experiments. Three independent experiments were performed in which ASM_1A, ASM_2A, ASM_3A were the test group samples and ANG_1A, ANG_2A, ANG_3A were the control group samples. Differentially expressed genes were selected with P＜0.05, FC≥2.0 by T-test methods using the independent three sets data.
