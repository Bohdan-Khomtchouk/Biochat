TITLE
Feedback Inhibition of CREB Signaling Promotes Beta Cell Dysfunction in Insulin Resistance.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Although persistent elevations in circulating glucose concentrations promote compensatory increases in pancreatic islet mass, unremitting insulin resistance causes a deterioration in beta cell function that disrupts glucose balance and signals the progression to diabetes 1. Glucagon like Peptide 1 (GLP1) agonists improve glucose tolerance in insulin resistance, although some individuals are unresponsive to treatment.  Here we show that increases in GLP1 during feeding promote beta cell function in part through the PKA-mediated activation of CREB and its coactivator CRTC2 2. Mice with a knockout of CRTC2 in beta cells have impaired oral glucose tolerance due to decreases in circulating insulin concentrations. CRTC2 was found to promote beta cell function in part by stimulating the expression of the transcription factor MafA. Chronic hyperglycemia associated with high fat or high carbohydrate diet feeding disrupted cAMP signaling in pancreatic islets. Indeed, prolonged elevations in circulating glucose concentrations interfered with CREB signaling by activating the mTOR pathway and triggering the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1)-dependent induction of  the Protein Kinase A Inhibitor beta (PKIB), a potent inhibitor of PKA catalytic activity 3. As disruption of the PKIB gene restored glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in obesity, our results demonstrate how cross-talk between nutrient and hormonal  pathways contributes to loss of pancreatic islet function in insulin resistance.

DESIGN
Rat insulinoma cells were used to interrogate the impact of glucose exposure and CREB activity on cAMP dependent gene regulation in the pancreatic beta cells
