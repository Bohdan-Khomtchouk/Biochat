TITLE
rpl24b/WT polysome loading and transcript levels (Arabidopsis thaliana)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the contribution of the RPL24B protein, a component of the large 60S ribosomal subunit, to the translation of specific mRNAs, we compared the ribosome occupancy of mRNAs in wild type Arabidopsis and the rpl24b/stv1-1 T-DNA insertion mutant. RNA was fractionated using sucrose gradients into polysomal and nonpolysomal RNAs. We also determined overall total transcript levels.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

DESIGN
Each plant sample was analyzed for the mRNA abundance in total mRNA, polysomal mRNA, and nonpolysomal mRNA. Three biological replicates were collected. The rpl24b mutant was compared with wild type.
