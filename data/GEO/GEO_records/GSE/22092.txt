TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the early-stage CD34+ differentiation process

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the early events regulating lineage-specific hematopoietic differentiation, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of CD34+ human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) subjected to differentiation stimulus.

DESIGN
CD34+ cells were cultured for 12 and 40 hours in liquid cultures with supplemented media favoring myeloid or erythroid commitment. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was employed to generate four independent libraries. CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Progenitor Cells with no differentiation stimulus were used as a control library.
