TITLE
To find out lncRNAs contribute to the development of gallbladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular mechanisms in the development of gallbladder cancer, we employed this microarray to identify lncRNAs associated with gallbladder cancer.

DESIGN
9 pairs of  gallbladder cancer tissues and paired normal gallbladder tissues were collected after colecystectomy.
