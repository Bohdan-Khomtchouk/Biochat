SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular mechanisms in the development of gallbladder cancer, we employed this microarray to identify lncRNAs associated with gallbladder cancer.

DESIGN
9 pairs of  gallbladder cancer tissues and paired normal gallbladder tissues were collected after colecystectomy.
