TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Abatacept treated Rheumatoid Arthritis patients according to response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify specific gene expression profiles able to predict the response  of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate /abatacept (Aba). Thirty six RA patients were received Abatacept. The drug efficacy was evaluated with the DAS28 score after 6 months of treatment according to the EULAR response criteria. Among 36 Aba RA patients, 17 were responders and 19 were classified as no-responders.  A blood sample was carried out in patients just before the first injection of treatment in PaxGene tubes.

DESIGN
Two color experiments : patient(Cy5)/Control pool (Cy3).
