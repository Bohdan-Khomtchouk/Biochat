TITLE
Expression data from wild type and globally hypomethylated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) during their differentiation as embyroid bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the role of DNA methylation during differentiation, we performed genome-wide expression analysis of undifferentiated wild type, dnmt1-/- and triple knock out (TKO; dnmt1-/-, dnmt3a-/-, dnmt3b-/-) ESCs as well as respective embryoid bodies (EBs) at two stages of differentiation

DESIGN
We generated EBs from wild type, dnmt1-/- and TKO ESCs using the hanging drop method and performed affymetrix microarray expression analysis at three time points; i) in the undifferentiated ESC state (d0), ii) early EB differentiation (d4) and iii) later EB differentiation stage (d16).
