TITLE
Gene expression in fetal gubernaculum and testis of wildtype (LE/wt) and cryptorchid (LE/orl) rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Long Evans/orl (LE/orl) rat is an animal model of inherited undescended testis (UDT).  To explore genetic mechanisms of UDT, we studied differential gene expression in LE/orl and LE wild type (LE/wt) fetal gubernaculum and testis.

DESIGN
Fetuses were harvested from timed matings of LE/wt and LE/orl rats at gestational day (GD) 17, 18, 19, and 20.  Single gubernaculum and testis were removed from male fetuses and total RNA was isolated from each organ.  Left organs were used, except for GD 20 fetuses where both right and left gubernacula were included.   For female fetuses, the right and left gubernacula from a single fetus were pooled before RNA isolation.  A total of 54 samples were hybridized to GeneChips; 34 gubernacular samples and 20 testes samples.  There were 13 sample groups, each included biological replicate arrays.  The sample groups were (1) female LE/wt GD18 gubernacula n=4, (2) male LE/wt GD18 left gubernacula n=4, (3) male LE/wt GD19 left gubernacula n=4, (4) male LE/wt GD20 left gubernacula n=4, (5) male LE/wt GD20 right gubernacula n=3, (6) male LE/orl GD18 left gubernacula n=4, (7) male LE/orl GD19 left gubernacula n=4, (8) male LE/orl GD20 left gubernacula n=4, (9) male LE/orl GD20 right gubernacula n=3, (10) male LE/wt GD17 left testes n=5, (11) male LE/wt GD19 left testes n=5, (12) male LE/orl GD17 left testes n=5, and (13) male LE/orl GD19 left testes n=5.
