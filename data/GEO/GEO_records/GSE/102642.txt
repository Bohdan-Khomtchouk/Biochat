TITLE
Gene expression of ectoplacental cones of early post-implantation embryos (6.5 days post-coitus) from control and obese dams

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a low-input strand specific total RNA library preparation kit to obtain transcriptomes from sexed ectoplacental cones of embryos from control and diet-induced obese dams.  We compared expression profiles to determine which genes and pathways are altered in the tissue that will go on to develop into the placenta and extraembryonic tissue.

DESIGN
Examination of impact of diet-induced obesity on gene expression in the early post-implantation mouse embryo.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
