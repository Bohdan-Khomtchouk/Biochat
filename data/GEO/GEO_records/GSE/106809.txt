TITLE
Expression analysis of control and Ccp6-depleted D3 ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially expressed genes in  Ccp6-depleted D3 ESCs

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using D3 ESCs. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray were performed in accordance with the Affymetrix Mouse Gene2.0 analysis protocol (Affymetrix).

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
