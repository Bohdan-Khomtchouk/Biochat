TITLE
Gene Expression profiling of transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator TN-XXL in muscle and brain tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Engineering of genetically encoded calcium indicators predominantly focused on optimizing fluorescence changes, but effects of indicator expression on host organisms have largely not been addressed. Here, we report biocompatibility and wide-spread functional expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator TN-XXL in a transgenic mouse model. To validate the model and to characterize potential effects of indicator expression we assessed both indicator function and a variety of host parameters such as anatomy, physiology, behavior and gene expression profiles in these mice. We also demonstrate the usefulness of primary cell types and organ explants prepared from these mice for imaging applications. While we do find mild signatures of indicator expression that may guide further indicator development the “green” indicator mice generated provide a well characterized resource of primary cells and tissues for in vitro and in vivo calcium imaging applications. Using expression profiling we could detect a number of transcripts regulated predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle of TN-XXL transgenic mice but only very few showed a level of regulation of a factor of two or higher and thus the majority of these changes were considered physiologically irrelevant. Remarkably this regulation occurred in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in brain. This suggests that skeletal muscle TnC as calcium sensing moiety within the indicator may be bio-orthogonal in brain but may lose some of this advantage in muscle tissue where it is derived from.

DESIGN
Factorial design comparing transgenic mice with wild type littermates in three different tissues (hippocampus, skeletal and heart muscle)
