TITLE
Time-Dependent Gene Profiling Indicates the Presence of Different Phases for Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Retina

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the present study was to investigate time-dependent changes in gene expression, following induction of IR in the rat retina, and to characterize the affected pathways, networks and processes.

DESIGN
6 biological replicates with two treatments (Sham control and Ischemia reperfusion) and 3 time points (0h, 24h and 7day)
