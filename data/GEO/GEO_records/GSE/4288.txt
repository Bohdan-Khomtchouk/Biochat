TITLE
Polysomal, free mRNP, and total cellular mRNA of J774.1 before and after LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide(LPS) dramatically activates macrophages. So far, dozen of papers indicated that many proinflammatory molecules are transcriptionaly regulated during response. Despite of this,translational regulation is not fully elucidated especially in a comprehensive fashion. In this series, we investigated expression profiles of translation active (polysome) inactive (free mRNP) mRNAs of a typical mouse macrophage cell line, J774.1. Moreover, we also measured total cellular RNA level as a reference. Keywords: time-course

DESIGN
Triplicates for each time points are included.
