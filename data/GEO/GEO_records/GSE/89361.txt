TITLE
Genome-wide effect of STING-mediated activation in T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using wild type mice and mice deficient for STING, we compared genome-wide expression of RNA in response to STING activation with DMXAA

DESIGN
To look for the role of STING-mediated pathway in activation of T cells, we activated naïve T cells with DMXAA, a synthetic agonist of STING, together with activation of TCR. To define a STING-specific effect, STING-deficient animals were used as a control. We isolated naïve T cells from peripheral lymph nodes, negatively selected them using magnetic beads coated with antibodies, and activated cells for 4 hours in specified conditions. Next, we isolated RNA and made library using TruSeq kit (Illumina) for the library construction.One replica of each sample is provided
