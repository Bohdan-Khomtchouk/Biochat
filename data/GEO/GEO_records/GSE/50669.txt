TITLE
Identification of microRNAs and transcript targets in Jatropha seeds

ORGANISM
Jatropha curcas

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs or miRNAs are endogenously encoded small RNAs that play a key role in diverse plant biological processes. Jatropha curcas L. has received much attention as a potential oilseed crop for the production of renewable oil. Here, a sRNA library from mature seeds and three mRNA libraries, from three different stages of seed development, were generated by deep sequencing in order to identify and characterize miRNAs and pre-miRNAs of J. curcas. Computation analysis allowed the identification of 180 conserved miRNAs and 41 precursors (pre-miRNAs), as well as 16 novel pre-miRNAs. The predicted miRNA target genes are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including cellular structure, nuclear function, translation, transport, hormone synthesis, defense and also lipid metabolism. Some of pre-miRNA and miRNA targets have different abundance among the three stages of seed development. A search for sequences that produce siRNA was performed indicating that J. curcas siRNAs play a role in nuclear functions, transport, catalytic process and diseases resistance. This study presents the first large scale identification of J. curcas miRNAs and their targets in mature seeds based on deep sequencing and contributes to understand the function of these miRNAs.
