TITLE
Expression profiles of IRF-1 silenced ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer cells treated with CDDP showed up-regulation of IRF-1 and IRF-7. The expression of putative IRF-1 target genes was modulated. CDDP triggered nuclear translocation of IRF-1 and IRF-1 silencing re-orchestrated the expression profiles of CDDP treated cells.

DESIGN
Using microarrays, we evaluated the expression profiles of IRF-1 silenced SK-OV-3.
