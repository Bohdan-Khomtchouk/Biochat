TITLE
Copper(II) Sulfate treatment with 10 mM for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The effect of the heavy metal copper on the expression of a wide spectrum of genes was analyzed by using a DNA microarray.  Gene expression profile of bakerâ€™s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in a media containing sub-lethal concentration of cupric sulfate was compared with those of yeast grown in a normal media.  Among about 6200 ORFs of yeast, 143 ORFs were induced more than two-fold to resist against copper toxicity after exposure to copper.  As was expected, FRE1, FRE7, and CTR1, genes controlled by Mac1p, were strongly down-regulated.  Copper metallothionein CUP1-1 and CUP1-2 were induced more than 20-fold.  Some genes related to sulfur metabolism and oxidative stress response were also up-regulated.  This DNA microarray technology indicated that plasma membrane, cell wall, protein, and DNA, were molecular targets of copper toxicity. Keywords: stress response
