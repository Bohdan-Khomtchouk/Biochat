TITLE
Analysis of human myeloma cell lines expressing beta 3 integrin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of these experiments was designed to compare gene expression in human myeloma cell lines expressing beta 3 integrin vs counterpart cell lines that do not express beta 3 integrin. Keywords: Gene expression,cell lines, siRNA

DESIGN
Phenotype characterization of both primary and cultured myeloma plasma cells was assessed by flow cytometry (FACScanto, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using a panel of MoAbs or antisera to the following markers: CD138, CD38, CD56, k/l chains, CD20, CD44, CD54, alphav and beta3 chains. The microarray analysis was performed on: myeloma bone resorbing cell lines alphav-beta3 positive and the same cell line silenced for the integrins; myeloma non bone resorbing cell lines negative for the expression of avb3.
