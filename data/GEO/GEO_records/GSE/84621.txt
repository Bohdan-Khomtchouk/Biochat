TITLE
Identification of miRNAs from Glehnia littoralis by high-throughput sequencing and their response to salt stress

ORGANISM
Glehnia littoralis

SUMMARY
Glehnia littoralis is a perennial herb growing on the sandy beaches. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of small RNA was performed to identify miRNAs and their response to salt stress in G. littoralis. As a result, 37 conserved miRNAs belonging to 13 families and 37 novel miRNAs were identified. Among the 74 miRNAs, the expression levels of miR-156b*, miR-171, miR-171*, and miR-319 were downregulated and that of miR-399a, miR-399a*, miR-399b, miR-399b*, novel-9 and novel-14* were upregulated under salt stress. Target prediction of salt-responsive miRNAs indicated that these miRNAs exerted a role by regulating specific stress-responsive genes, such as SPLs. However, a lot of target genes of salt-responsive miRNAs were uncharacterized, which implied that there might be some new miRNA-mediated reguatory of salt response in G. littoralis.
