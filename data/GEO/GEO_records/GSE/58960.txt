Expression data from embryonic stem cells differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotency-associated transcription factor Foxd3 is required for maintaining pluripotent cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its function are largely unknown. Here, we report that Foxd3 maintains the ESC identity through counteracting differentiation induction of Calcienurin-NFAT signaling. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying overexpression of Foxd3 and NFATc3 in ESCs or deletion of Foxd3 in ESCs

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the mESCs under the following conditions:1) a control group transfected with an empty vector; a Foxd3 overexpression group; a NFATc3 overexpression group and a combination group with Foxd3 and NFATc3 overexpression 2) Foxd3fl/fl:Cre-ERT cells treated with Tamoxifen for 0 day and 2 days.
