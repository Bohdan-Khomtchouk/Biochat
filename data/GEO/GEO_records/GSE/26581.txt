TITLE
5'-monophosphate-independent small RNA sequencing from ego-1(om84) and control L3, L4, and adult C. elegans hermaphrodites

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Cellular RdRPs play a critical role in the development of many organisms.  Using high-throughput small RNA and messenger RNA sequencing we found that the Caenorhabditis elegans RdRP, EGO-1, is required to produce small RNAs antisense to a number of germline-expressed genes through several developmental stages.  We found that these genes fall into distinct classes including genes required for kinetochore and nuclear pore assembly, as well as the production of histone-modifying and centromeric proteins.  We also found several RNAi-related genes to be targets of EGO-1.  Finally, we show a strong correlation between the loss of small RNAs and the rise of mRNA levels in ego-1 mutant animals.
