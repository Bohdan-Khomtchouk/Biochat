TITLE
Transcriptomics profiles of patient-matched normal kidney and ccRCC pairs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC, but its effect on epigenetic landscape has not been elucidated previously. We describe the genome-wide cis-regulatory landscapes of VHL-deficient ccRCC tumors by comparing the epigenetic changes in terms of histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3)  with the transcriptomics profiles in 10 pairs of normal kidney and ccRCC tissues.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiles of 10 patient-matched normal kidney and ccRCC pairs
