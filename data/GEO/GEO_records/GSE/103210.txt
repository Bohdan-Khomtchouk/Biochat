TITLE
Comparison of the RNA expression profiles of CD14+ monocytes from human peripheral blood with derived dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) obtained by exposure with GM-CSF/IL4 and GM-CSF/IL4/PGE2, respectively, during 6 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of RNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) following GM-CSF/IL4 and GM-CSF/IL4/PGE2 incubation for 6 days using the Agilent Human GE v3 8x60K array (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to three sets of samples of monocytes (MOs) and derived DCs and MDSCs following incubation with GM-CSF/IL4 and GM-CSF/IL4/PGE2, respectively, for 6 days.
