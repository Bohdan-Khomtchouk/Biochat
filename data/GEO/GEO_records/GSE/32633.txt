TITLE
Jasmonic acid-responsive genes in suspension-cultured rice cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in various developmental processes and defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses. We identified JA-responsive genes in suspension-cultured rice cells 2-12 h after treatment using rice 44k microarray.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in rice cells treated with JA for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h was compared with that in untreated control using two-color method with two biological replicates.
