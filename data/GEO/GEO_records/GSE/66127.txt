TITLE
The Effects of Nanog HD Mutants on Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined global gene expression patterns of mouse embryonic stem cells overexpressing EGFP, Nanog wild-type, or Nanog L122A mutants in normal, " -LIF " or " +RA " culture conditions by RNA-seq experiments. In “+RA” culture conditions, the expression patterns of the RA-responsive genes were slightly different in WT transfectants and more different in L122A transfectants compared with EGFP transfectants. These results suggested that L122A transfectants showed partial resistant activity against RA-induced differentiation, which was not found in WT mNANOG transfectants.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different transfectants from mouse embryonic stem cell, RF8 line, in 3 different culture conditions.
