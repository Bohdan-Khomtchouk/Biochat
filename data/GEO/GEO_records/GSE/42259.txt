TITLE
Notch Pathway Activation Targets AML Cell Homeostasis and Differentiation: THP1 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from untreated or Dll4-Fc treated THP1 cell line.  We used Dll4-Fc stimulation of AML cells to study whether Notch activation has an impact on AML. We analyzed THP1 cell line in vitro treated with Dll4-Fc or vehicle control to determine genes affected by Notch activation.

DESIGN
THP1 cell line was cultured on plate coated with 30 nM Dll4-Fc or vehicle for 48 hours prior to RNA extraction and hybridization to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix arrays.
