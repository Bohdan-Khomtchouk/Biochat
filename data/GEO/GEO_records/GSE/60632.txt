TITLE
Synthetic mRNA switches for detection and purification of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We designed microRNA-responsive, modified mRNA switches (miR-switches) that quantitatively control their own translation level by determining the miRNA activities. We found that the three miR-switches (i.e., miR-1-, miR-208-, and miR-499-switches) enable to purify cardiomyocytes differentiated from hPSCs with high efficiency, accuracy, and safety. The purified cardiomyocytes were engrafted in mouse heart and did not form tumor. Simultaneous purification of two different cell types, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, was also performed by transfecting the mRNA responding to the both miR-208 and miR-126, into heterogeneous cell population derived from hPSCs. In addition, selective induction of apoptosis in noncardiomyocytes triggered by miR-1/208-Bim switch enriched cardiomyocytes without cell sorting. The mRNA switch could purify desired cell types and control cell death pathways by monitoring the miRNA expression dynamics during cell fate conversion.
