TITLE
Expression data from whole blood samples of Rwandan adults with mild malaria with matched sample thirty days later (convalescence)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Host factors governing mild disease in adults who have developed clinical immunity to Plasmodium falciparum may provide insights for disease altering vaccine or interventions, to prevent severe malaria We used microarrays of whole blood samples during mild malaria and compared them in a paired analysis to whole blood microarray 30 days later. (n=19 pairs)

DESIGN
3mL of whole blood was immediately placed in Tri-Reagent BD, frozen; high quality pairs were selected, were randomly selected for hybridization and analysis. Sense strand cDNA was generated from total RNA using the Ambion® WT Expression Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and labeling was done with the GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for use with the GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix). The array image was generated by a high-resolution GeneArray Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
