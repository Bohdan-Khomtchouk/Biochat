TITLE
Differentiated expression profiling between CD8+CD28+ T cell subset and CD8+CD28- T cell subset using long non coding RNA microarray in five healthy Chinese nonagenarians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain the differentiated profiling of long noncoding RNA expression between CD8+CD28+ T cell subset and CD8+CD28- T cell subset, we have detecte lncRNA profiling between within-individual T cell subsets to identify differentiated lncRNA profiling in five apperant healthy Chinese nenogenarians who were cytomegalovirus-seropositive carriers. Human peripheral blood monocytes from these apperantly healthy CMV-seropositive nonagenarians was gathered. CD8+CD28+ T cells and CD8+CD28- T cells were further isolated using flow cytometry. Differentiated lncRNA profiling was compared between  CD8+CD28+ T cells and CD8+CD28- T cells using lncRNA microarry  detection within-individually. 586 lncRNAs were found significantly upregulated while 1113 lncRNAs were found significantly downregulated comparing CD8+CD28+ T cells with CD8+CD28- T cells in these Chinese nonagenarians with CMV seropositivity. Expression of ENST00000446590,NR_121652,NR_045006,ENST00000428936,NR_110375 from this differentiated profiling which were identified as previously domumented ageing-related lncRNAs were quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming lncRNAs take critical role in regulating T cell immunosenesence in healthy nonagenarian Chinese CMV carriers. Diffentiated lncRNA profiling was in-pair compared between total RNAs isolated from CD8+CD28+ T cells and CD8+CD28- T cells within-individually in Chinese nonagenarian CMV carriers.
