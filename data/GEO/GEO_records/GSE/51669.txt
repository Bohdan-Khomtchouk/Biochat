TITLE
Expression data from the stomach of mice treated with dexamethasone.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids are used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions but they also cause many side-effects. We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression induced in the stomach upon oral glucocorticoid treatment.

DESIGN
Female wildtype Balb/c mice were treated for three days with 50 mg/l dexamethasone (dex) via the drinking water. Control mice were left untreated. The stomach was dissected and RNA prepared from the corpus.
