TITLE
Human telomerase RNA processing and quality control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of HeLa cells treated with siRNA against the RNA exosome components hRRP40, hRRP6, hDIS3, and hRRP6/hDIS3 or the splicing inhibitors Isoginkgetin and spliceostatin A, respectively.

DESIGN
Stranded, ribo-depleted RNA seq profiles of HeLa cells treated with exosome targeting siRNAs or splicing inhibitors using Illumina HiSeq. All experiments were carried out in triplicate starting with independent cell cultures

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
