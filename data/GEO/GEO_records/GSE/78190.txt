TITLE
Gene expression data from OVA-immunized WT and Rptor-/- follicular regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells maintain homeostasis of humoral immunity by suppressing germinal center responses. TFR cells are differentiated from conventional regulatory T (Treg) cells, but underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We did microarray experiments to elucidate the transcriptome changes due to Rptor deficiency in Tfr cells. These data clearly demonstrate that Tfr-associated genes were down-regulated in Rptor-null Tfr cells, indicating that Raptor regulate Tfr generation by strengthening Tfr signatures.

DESIGN
We first sorted WT (1 sample, pooled from 4 mice) and Rptor-null Tfr cells (2 samples, each sample pooled from 8 mice) at day 8 after OVA immunization. Then, we extracted RNA, which were subsequently sent to microarray analysis.
