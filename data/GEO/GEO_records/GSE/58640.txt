TITLE
Analysis and expansion of the eosinophilic esophagitis transcriptome by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized RNA sequencing to expand and better define the molecular entities involved in the transcriptional programming within the eosphagus in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing data performed on esophageal biopsy specimen from 6 healthy controls and 10 patients with active EoE

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
