TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild type, ar21 and i4g1 mutants in developing seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To explore transcriptional regulations between lipid metabolism and eIFiso4G1, we performed RNAseq analysisin ar21 an i4g1 single mutants.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from wild type, ar21 and i4g1 mutants seeds at 13 days after flowering (DAF) with two biological replicates for each line.
