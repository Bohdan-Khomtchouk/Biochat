TITLE
The novel antisense Bcl-2 inhibitor SPC2996 causes rapid leukemic cell clearance and immune activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SPC2996 is a novel locked nucleic acid (LNA) phosphorothioate antisense molecule targeting the mRNA of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein. We investigated the mechanism of action of SPC2996 and the basis for its clinically observed immunostimulatory effects in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with relapsed CLL were treated with a maximum of six doses of SPC2996 (0.2-6mg/ kg) in a multicenter phase I trial. Microarray-based transcriptional profiling of circulating CLL cells was carried out before and after the first infusion of SPC2996 in eighteen patients. We used microarrays to characterize global  gene expression changes  of circulating CLL cells in response to SPC2996 infusion in 18 patients Key word : Response to therapeutic agent

DESIGN
We performed microarray-based gene expression profiling in serial peripheral blood samples from 18 individual CLL patients before and after treatment with SPC2996
