TITLE
In silico analyses  of survival-associated microRNA signatures in pediatric osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in children, adolescents, and young adults.  In contrast to other childhood malignancies, no biomarkers have been consistently identified as predictors of outcome.  This study was conducted to assess the microRNAs (miRs) expression signatures in pre-treatment osteosarcoma specimens and correlate with outcome to identify biomarkers for disease relapse

DESIGN
The cohort consisted of 25 patients of 70% Mexican-American ethnicity. High-throughput RT-qPCR approach was used to generate quantitative expression of 754 miRs in the human genome.
