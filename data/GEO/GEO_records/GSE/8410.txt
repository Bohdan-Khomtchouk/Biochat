Age Map, Cerebral Cortex (A)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the transcriptional changes in different brain regions and spinal cord associated with aging and either a caloric restricted (CR) or ad libitum (AL) diet. cDNA microarray and quantitative PCR analyses were used to examine the transcriptomes of various neuronal tissues in young, middle aged and old mice. Mice of both genders were examined as well as the effects of their placement on either caloric restricted (CR) or ad libitum (AL) diets. Keywords: age-, gender-, and diet- comparison

DESIGN
67 mice were compared according to age, gender, and diet
