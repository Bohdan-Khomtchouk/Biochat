TITLE
ChIP-chip for histone modifications in hESCs and differentiated hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify how histone modifications are differentially marked at promoter and enhancer elements in hESCs before and after differentiation to understand the regulatory mechanisms that defined pluripotency and early differentiation.

DESIGN
ChIP for promoter and enhancer histone modifications were conducted relative to input DNA in hESCs and hESCs treated with BMP4
