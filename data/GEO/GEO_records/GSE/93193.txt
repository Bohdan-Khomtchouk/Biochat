TITLE
Inhibition of CDK8 Mediator Kinase Suppresses Estrogen Receptor Signaling and Growth of Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hormone therapy targeting estrogen receptor (ER) is the principal treatment for ER-positive breast cancers but many cancers develop resistance to anti-estrogens. Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a transcriptional regulator of several oncogenic pathways. Expression levels of CDK8 and ERα are inversely correlated in breast cancers suggesting a functional association between CDK8 and ER. CDK8 inhibition by selective small-molecule inhibitors, by shRNA knockdown or by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout suppressed estrogen-induced transcription, with no significant effects on ERα protein expression or phosphorylation. CDK8 inhibition also abrogated the mitogenic effect of estrogen on ER-positive breast cancer cells and potentiated growth inhibition by the ER antagonist fulvestrant. In vivo, administration of a CDK8 inhibitor suppressed ER-positive breast cancer xenograft growth and augmented the effects of fulvestrant with no apparent toxicity. CDK8 inhibitors also suppressed the development of estrogen independence in ER-positive breast cancer cells. These results identify CDK8 as a novel drug target for breast cancer therapy.
