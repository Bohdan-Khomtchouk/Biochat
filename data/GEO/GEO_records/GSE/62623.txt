TITLE
Gene expression in mouse blood following low dose-rate or acute x-ray exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Radiation biodosimetry can play a critical role in the response to a large-scale radiologic emergency, and gene expression profiles have shown promise for providing biodosimetric information. This study was designed to test if gene expression could be used to distinguish between doses received from acute exposures and more protracted exposures, such as those that would result from fallout. Mice were exposed to whole body X-rays at low dose rate (LDR, 3.09 mGy/min) for 6, 12, or 24 hours (1.1, 2.2, or 4.4 Gy), or to equivalent doses delivered at high dose rate (HDR, 1.03 Gy/min). Global gene expression was measured in their blood 24 h after the start of exposure, and genes with the potential to classify samples by radiation dose and dose rate were identified.

DESIGN
Data consist of 48 samples, representing 6 independent samples each from 3 doses delivered as either acute or low dose rate x-rays, plus 12 controls representing both acute and low dose rate sham treatments.
