TITLE
S. coelicolor M145 SMM medium time course study (Culture # 1)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species is controlled by a complex genetic and biochemical network of global and pathway specific regulators. Details of their precise interactions in mediating temporal and spatial expression of secondary metabolite genes remain poorly defined. In this study, we employed whole-genome microarrays to investigate the temporal transcriptome profiles of S. coelicolor A3(2) wild type and regulatory mutants.

DESIGN
The time-course study involved analysis of 9 samples (14hr, 15hr, 16hr, 17hr, 18hr, 19hr, 20hr, 21hr, 40hr). Samples (14hr, 15hr, 17hr, 20hr, 40hr) were analyzed on 2 arrays. Samples (18hr, 19hr, 21hr) were analyzed on 3 arrays. Genomic DNA of S. coelicolor wild type (M145) was used as a reference for all the arrays. cDNA was labeled with Alexa647 and genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3.
