TITLE
Human resistin alters lung mRNA expression from helminth-infected lungs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal: To examine the effects of human resistin during helminth infection. Methodology: To examine the function of human resistin (hResistin), we utilized transgenic mice expressing the human resistin gene along with its entire regulatory region (hRetnTg+). Following infection with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, whole lung RNA was sequenced in hRetnTg+ mice, control hRetnTg- and na√Øve mice. Conclusion: In hRetnTg+ mice, many genes involved in inflammation and the immune system, specifically toll-like receptor signaling and chemokines, are significantly upregulated, suggesting that human resistin promotes TLR signaling and inflammation during helminth infection.

DESIGN
Examination of whole lung mRNA from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected lungs at day 7 in mice expressing human resistin
