TITLE
Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying of herb pair Daji and Gancao with different combination designs acting on hepatocellular carcinoma ascites mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The differentially expressed genes among the blank control, ascites mouse model, Daji (DJ)/ Gancao (GC)-synergistic treatment and DJ/GC-antagonistic treatment groups were identified to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the herb pair DJ and GC acting on ascites mice.

DESIGN
In the study, 50 male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, namely, normal control group, model group, Daji/Gancao-synergy group, Daji/Gancao-antagonism group, Daji group. Normal control group and model group were intragastrically administrated with normal saline, while other 3 groups were intragastrically administrated with corresponding doses.
