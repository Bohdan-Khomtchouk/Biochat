TITLE
RNA-seq of postnatal day 0 (P0) wild-type and Satb2-/- cortices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to compare gene expression of P0 wild-type and P0 Satb2-/- cortices. Total RNAs were isolated from P0 cortices dissected from wild-type and Satb2-/- mice (n=3 for each genotype), following Qiagen RNAeasy kit instruction.Sequence libraries were made following Illumina RNA TruSeq library preparation guide.The libaries were pair-end sequenced (50nt per end). Differentially expressed genes were identified by DESEQ.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from P0 cortices (3 control and 3 mutants), and sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
