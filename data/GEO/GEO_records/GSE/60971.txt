TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of normal human keratinocytes in response to genistein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on the assessment of the role of this isoflavone in regulation of expression of psoriasis-related genes stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that genistein modulates activity of psoriasis-related genes, by reducing the expression efficiency of genes revealing enhanced activity in psoriatic cells, and by stimulating the expression efficiency of genes revealing decreased activity in psoriatic cells. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of genistein at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by this substance.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human immortalized keratinocyte (HaCaT) subjected to 24 or 48 hours in vitro exposure to 30, 60 or 100 ÂµM genistein, or 0.05%DMSO (K).

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
