TITLE
polyA depleted RNA-seq from H1-hESC (ENCSR000COT)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from the whole cell fraction of independent growths of the human embryonic stem cell line H1-hESC. They are stranded PE76 Illumina GAIIx RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted and DSN normalized  Poly-A- RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
