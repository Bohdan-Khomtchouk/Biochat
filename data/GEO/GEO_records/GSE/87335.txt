TITLE
Treg cell gene expression signature in B16 melanoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression signature of Treg cells in B16 melanoma was measured and compared to B16-infiltrating CD4+ Tconv cells and CD8+ T cells as well as splenic Treg cells, CD4+ Tconv cells and CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
We isolated regulatory and conventional CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells from B16 melanoma and spleen of mice. Cells were isolated, pooled and target cells were purified by FACS. RNA was extracted and gene expression measured.
