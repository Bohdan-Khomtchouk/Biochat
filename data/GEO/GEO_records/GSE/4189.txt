TITLE
The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network that regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A) We profiled gene expression changes during ES cell differentiation B) We profiled gene expression changes when Pou5f1 or Nanog is knockdown upon RNAi Keywords: Array Based

DESIGN
A) Mouse ES cells were induced to differentiate by 3 different chemical treatments. The RNAs were hybridized onto custom-made microarrays. B) We used siRNA to knockdown Pou5f1 or Nanog in mouse ES cells. The RNAs from control and knockdown cells were hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays
