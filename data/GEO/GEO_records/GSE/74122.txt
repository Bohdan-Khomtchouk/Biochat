TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mice lung tissue [S100A8 time course]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recombinant-murine S100A8 were used at 10 mg/50 ml in Hanks Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) or control HBSS administered onto the nares of BALB/C mice. To assess direct effects, mice were sacrificed 1, 4, 6, or 12 h post-inhalation of S100A8. Because S100A8 is reported to initiate proinflammatory responses by ligating TLR4 and/or RAGE, a quantitative PCR array was developed to analyze 49 genes, selected to reflect potential acute inflammatory changes induced by ligation of these receptors.

DESIGN
Expression of inflammatory genes was evaluated with the RT-qPCR array. Relative quantities of mRNA in duplicate samples were obtained using the LightCyclerÂ® 480 Software 1.5 and the Efficiency-Method.

PLATFORM
GPL21042 UNSW Mouse RT-qPCR array (I)
