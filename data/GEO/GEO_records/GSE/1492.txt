TITLE
Gene expression profile of abf1-1 mutant at 36 degrees C

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The abf1-1 mutant and wild type cells were grown at 30 degrees C in YPAD until OD600 reached 1.0-1.2. The same volume of 42 degrees C preheated YPAD was added for each flask. After 45 min incubation at 36 degrees C, cells were harvested and RNA was isolated. Four repeats of microarray results are in this series. Keywords: repeat sample
