TITLE
miRNA expression of Tubulocystic Renal Cell Carcinoma (TC-RCC) cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eleven TC-RCC cases were selected on the basis of the criteria defined by the 2012 Vancouver Classification of Renal Neoplasia and WHO 2016 classification criteria, and re-reviewed by a panel of expert renal pathologists. Two of these cases, TC-RCC#9 and #10, had a mixed tubulocystic and papillary histology and were macro-dissected into separate PRCC and TC-RCC components. The molecular basis of TC-RCC, and miRNA expression profile, is unknown. We therefore used Affymetrix miRNA v.2. arrays to elucidate the expression of these samples

DESIGN
Samples were extracted from macrodisected FFPE slides and purified using the Recoverall kit from Ambion

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
