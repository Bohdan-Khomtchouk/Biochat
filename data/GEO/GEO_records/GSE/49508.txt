TITLE
Analysis of ALK TKI sensitive and ALK TKI resistant isogenic pairs of H3122 (EML4-ALK E13;A20) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Starting with H3122 cells, which harbor the EML4-ALK E13;A20 fusion and are known to be sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we generated isogenic pairs of ALK TKI sensitive and ALK TKI resistant cell lines using established methods (see Chmeliecki, J et al Science Trans Med 2011). We modeled resistance against the currently FDA approved ALK TKI, crizotinib (also called PF-1066). We also modeled resistance against a novel more potent ALK inhibitor, X-376 (ref: Lovly, CM et al Cancer Research 2011). We compared gene expression profiles between the 'parental' (ALK TKI sensitive) H3122 cells and the drug resistant cells (H3122 CR for Crizotinib resistant cells and H3122 XR for X-376 resistant cells).

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from H3122 Parental, H3122 PF1066R, and H3122 X376R cells. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
