TITLE
Expression data from adult zebrafish exposed to low level TCDD

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Exposure to TCDD early in development produces reproductive abnormalities in adulthood and decreased reproductive capacity in males We used microarrays to investigate the global programme of gene expression in testicular tissue and identified distinct gene expression changes due to TCDD exposure in males.

DESIGN
Zebrafish were exposed to sublethal TCDD or vehicle (DMSO) during early development and analyzed for phenotypic and gene expression changes as adults. 5 TCDD and 5 Control males.

PLATFORM
