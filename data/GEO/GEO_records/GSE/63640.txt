TITLE
A DNA Microarray Analysis of Rat Intestine, Spleen and Liver Transcriptome after Oral Administration of Lavender Oil

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Lavender oil (LO) – a commonly used oil in aromatherapy with well defined volatile components linalool and linalyl acetate – use in non-traditional medicine is increasing globally. To understand and provide evidence for the potential positive effects of LO on the body, we have established an animal model for investigating in this current study, orally administered LO effects genome-wide in rat intestine, spleen and liver. The rats were administrated LO at 5 mg/kg (usual threaupeutic dose in humans) followed by screeing of differentially expressed genes in the tissues utlilizing a 4x44K whole genome rat chip (Agilent microarray platform) in conjunction with a dye-swap approach, one of the novelties of this study. Fourteen days after treatment (LO) and in comparison with a control group (sham), a total of 156 and 154 up ( > 1.5 fold)- and down ( < 0.75 fold)-regulated genes, 174 and 66 up- ( > 1.5 fold)- and down ( < 0.75 fold)-regulated genes, and 222 and 322 up- ( > 1.5 fold)- and down ( < 0.75 fold)-regulated genes showed differential expression at the mRNA level, in the intestine, spleen and liver, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation of highly up- and down-expressed genes revealed the regulation of Papd4, Lrp1b, Alb, Cyr61, Cyp2c, and Cxcl1 genes, by LO, as examples in these tissues. Using bioinformatics functionally categorization of differentially expressed genes was done by their Gene Ontology (GO) revealing their diverse functions and potential roles in LO-mediated effects in rat. Present results are a first such inventory of genes affected by the essential oil of Lavender (LO) in an animal model.

Rats were administrated LO at 5 mg/kg (the usual threaupeutic dose in humans) followed by the screeing of differentially expressed genes in the intestine, spleen, and liver utlilizing a 4x44K whole genome rat chip (Agilent) and the dye-swap approach.
