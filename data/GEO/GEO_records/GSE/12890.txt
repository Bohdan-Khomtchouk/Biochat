TITLE
Xylose metabolism in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In the present study transcriptome and proteome of recombinant, xylose-utilising S. cerevisiae grown in aerobic batch cultures on xylose were compared with glucose-grown cells both in glucose repressed and derepressed states. The aim was to study at genome-wide level how signalling and carbon catabolite repression differed in cells grown on either glucose or xylose. The more detailed knowledge about is xylose sensed as a fermentable carbon source, capable of catabolite repression like glucose, or is it rather recognised as a non-fermentable carbon source is important in achieving understanding for further engineering this yeast for more efficient anaerobic fermentation of xylose.
