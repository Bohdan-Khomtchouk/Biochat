TITLE
Xylose metabolism in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In the present study transcriptome and proteome of recombinant, xylose-utilising S. cerevisiae grown in aerobic batch cultures on xylose were compared with glucose-grown cells both in glucose repressed and derepressed states. The aim was to study at genome-wide level how signalling and carbon catabolite repression differed in cells grown on either glucose or xylose. The more detailed knowledge about is xylose sensed as a fermentable carbon source, capable of catabolite repression like glucose, or is it rather recognised as a non-fermentable carbon source is important in achieving understanding for further engineering this yeast for more efficient anaerobic fermentation of xylose.

DESIGN
Three aerobic batch fermentations were carried out both on 50 g l-1 glucose and on 50 g l-1 xylose to compare the yeast transcriptome and proteome of cells growing on xylose with that of glucose repressed and glucose derepressed cells. Samples of the xylose-grown cells were harvested at 72 h from the start of the xylose cultures with 32 g l-1 of residual xylose present. Samples of the glucose repressed cells were harvested at 5 h from the start of the glucose cultures with 37 g l-1 of residual glucose present. Samples of the glucose derepressed cells were harvested at 24 h from the start of the glucose cultures containing no glucose but 13 g l-1 of accumulated ethanol.
