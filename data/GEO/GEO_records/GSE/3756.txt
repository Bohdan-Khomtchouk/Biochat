TITLE
Chromosome-wide mapping of interactions of yeast nucleoporin Nup2 on chromosome VI.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This series is a complementary data set for the manuscript entitled " Nup-PI: The Nucleopore-Promoter Interactions of Genes in Yeast. " (Mol. Cell, 2006). Experimental Background: Genomic interaction sites of nuclear proteins were mapped by the in vivo ChEC technique described in Schmid et al. (2004) Mol. Cell 16, 147-157. Genome-wide probes that are suitable for hybridization of microarrays were prepared. In brief, MboI restriction fragments that were internally cleaved by the MN moiety of the fusion proteins were amplified and labelled. The procedure is explained in detail in the manuscript. " Nup-PI: The Nucleopore-Promoter Interactions of Genes in Yeast. " (Schmid et al., Mol. Cell 2006). Experiments: Genome-wide probes were prepared from control, uncleaved chromatin, as well as chromatin cleaved by H2b-MN and Nup2-MN. All samples were from raffinose grown cells induced for 1 hour by galactose in logarithmic growth phase. Keywords: Genome-wide ChEC analysis, Mapping of Nuclear Pore Proteins
