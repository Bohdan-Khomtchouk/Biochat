TITLE
RNA-seq of Taxus chinensis cells

ORGANISM
Taxus wallichiana var. chinensis

SUMMARY
We reported the application of high-throughput sequencing technology (RNA-seq) for the transcriptome of T. chinensis cells and the transcriptional alternatives of that responded to MeJA were comprehensively and quantitatively assessed with high-throughput sequencing technology (RNA-seq). By sequencing > 29 million reads (200 bp in length) of cDNA from each of MeJA-treated T. chinensis cells at 16 h (T16) and the control (T0), we identified 46,581 transcripts and uncovered 13,469 genes differentially expressed in response to MeJA. We provided functional clues for understanding the regulation mechanisms of MeJA-mediated defense responses and taxol biosynthesis.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different time treated with MeJA in Taxus chinensis cells.
