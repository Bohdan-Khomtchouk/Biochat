TITLE
Gene expression of metabolically adaptable triple-negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the characteristic of metabolically adaptable MA cells that enables them to survive severe metabolic challenge, i.e., prolonged lack of glutamine and other challenges [Singh et al., PLoS ONE 7: e36510, 2012], we used gene expression microarrays to compare these cells with the parental SUM149-Luc (luciferase-transfected) cells. We analyzed two independently selected cell populations, one from 0.5 million parental cells (designated MA1) and one from 1 million parental cells (designated MA2).

DESIGN
Comparing MA1 and MA2 variants to a common parental cell line SUM149-Luc. One sample each.
