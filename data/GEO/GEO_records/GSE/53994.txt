TITLE
Expression profiling of VCaP prostate cancer cells with ERG knockdown or WP1130 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray studies was performed to analyze gene expression profiling in VCaP cells after ERG was silenced by two different siRNAs or VCaP cells were treated by WP1130.

DESIGN
RNA samples, containing 3 replicates for each sample, were extracted from VCaP cells at 72 hours siERG post-transfection or 24 hours WP1130 treatment. After biotin labeling, samples were hybrided on the Illumina Human HT12v4.0 Expression Beadchip
