TITLE
Gut hepcidin: a key regulator of inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepcidin is demonstrated to be the key iron regulatory hormone, produced by the liver. Here we show an unexpected role of hepcidin as a master initiator of the local and systemic inflammatory response. We found that hepcidin was highly expressed in the colon of two major idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases : Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Thanks to the generation of intestinal specific hepcidin KO mice (Hepc{delta}int), we found in a DSS-induced colitis model that hepcidin mediated the induction of key inflammatory cytokines and was protective against intestinal injury. In a model of LPS-induced acute inflammation, intestinal hepcidin expression was increased through a TLR4 dependent pathway andwas required for intestinal neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. Strikingly, intestinal hepcidin was absolutely required for the systemic production of key inflammatory cytokines  (IL-6, CXCL1, TNF-alpha ...) as well as for the setting of the hypoferremia of inflammation. In a sepsis model, Hepc{delta}int mice were protected against LPS-induced mortality. Mechanistically, we showed that hepcidin was a direct neutrophil chemoattractant and a proinflammatory molecule in macrophages through a Myd88 dependent pathway. Altogether, we demonstrated that Hepcidin is a key new essential component of the immune system and may be a promising target in many inflammatory diseases.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression of BMDM treat with hepcidin for 1 hour.
