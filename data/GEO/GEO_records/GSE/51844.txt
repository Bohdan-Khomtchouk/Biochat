TITLE
Inferring the stress-activated signaling network in yeast through multi-omic data integration

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of yeast mutant strains responding to 0.7M NaCl treatment for 30  minutes. This study identified affected genes in each mutant and used it to computationally infer the complete NaCl-activated signaling network in yeast.

DESIGN
Two-color fluorescence arrays reporting on mRNA abundance in strains before and at 30 min after a shock with 0.7M NaCl, hybridized to yeast tile-genome Nimblegen arrays

PLATFORM
GPL17856 UWAPG Yeast 6K v1.0
