TITLE
Gene Expression Changes in Definitive Endoderm in response to GATA6-depletion (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GATA6 is required for proper definitive endoderm formation.  The mechanism of this process is poorly understood We used microarrays to identify genes whose expression is altered upon GATA6-depletion

DESIGN
Stable lentiviral or control cell lines were differentiated to various stages of definitive endoderm.  Rescue lines were differentiated to definitive endodermin the presence of doxycycline to induce shRNA-resistant GATA6 transgene expression.  Using this system we identified genes whose expression was altered upon GATA6 depletion during definitive endoderm differentiation.
