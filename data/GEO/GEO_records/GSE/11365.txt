TITLE
Gene expression profiling in peanut using oligonucleotide microarrays

ORGANISM
Arachis hypogaea

SUMMARY
Transcriptome expression analysis in peanut to date has been limited to a relatively small set of genes and only recently have moderately significant number of ESTs has been released into the public domain. Utilization of these ESTs for the oligonucleotide microarrays provides a means to investigate large-scale transcript responses to a variety of developmental and environmental signals, ultimately improving our understanding of plant biology. We have developed a high-density oligonucleotide microarray for peanut using approximately 47,767 publicly available ESTs and tested the utility of this array for expression profiling in a variety of peanut tissues. To identify putatively tissue-specific genes and investigate the utility of this array, we compared transcript levels in pod to peg, leaf, stem, and root tissues. Results from this experiment showed a number of putatively pod-specific/abundant genes, as well as transcripts whose expression was low or undetected in pod compared to either peg, leaf, or stem.
