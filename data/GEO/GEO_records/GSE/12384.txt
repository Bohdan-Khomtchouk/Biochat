TITLE
Effect of IL6 level on gene expression changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) induced by physical activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A number of chronic, age-related diseases are associated with elevated markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that sedentary individuals with disparate basal serum IL-6 respond differentially to a structured physical activity programme. Gene expression changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) induced by physical activity was investigated in  sedentary, middle-aged men (mean age 52.6 years and BMI 29.1), with relatively high or low basal serum IL-6 levels (mean of 2.13 and 0.59pg/ml respectively), who undertook a 24-week physical activity programme with blood sampling in the pre-exercise period and at the end of 24-weeks prescribed physical activity.
