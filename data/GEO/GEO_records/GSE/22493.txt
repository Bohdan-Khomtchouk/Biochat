TITLE
Comparisons of the global gene profile between CLDN4-overexpressing and CLDN4-silencing ovarian cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis was performed to compare the global gene expression profile between CLDN4-overexpressing (Control) and CLDN4-silencing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
CLDN4 gene was knocked down by CLDN4 siRNA lentivirus. Total RNA was extracted and microarray was perfomed to compare the gene profiling changes between CLDN4-overexpressing (Control) and CLDN4-silencing cells. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL10555 BWH Human Release 3.0 oligonucleotides
