TITLE
Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein Eml1 lead to ectopic progenitors and heterotopia formation during cortical development in mouse and human

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuronal migration disorders such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Doublecortin (DCX), LIS1 and alpha1-tubulin (TUBA1A), are mutated in these disorders, however corresponding mouse mutants do not show heterotopic neurons in the neocortex. On the other hand, the spontaneously arisen HeCo mouse mutant displays this phenotype. The study of this model reveals novel mechanisms of heterotopia formation. While, HeCo neurons migrate at the same speed as WT,  abnormally distributed dividing progenitors were found throughout the cortical wall from E13. Through genetic studies we identified Eml1 as the mutant gene in HeCo mice. No full length transcripts of Eml1 were identified due to a retrotransposon insertion in an intron. Re-expression of Eml1, coding for a microtubule-associated protein, rescues the HeCo progenitor phenotype. We further show that EML1 is mutated in giant ribbon-like heterotopia in human. Our data link abnormal spindle orientations, ectopic progenitors and severe heterotopia in mouse and human.
