TITLE
Human induced pluripotent stem cellâ€“derived cardiomyocytes recapitulate the predilection of breast cancer patients to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data on H9 hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (d30) treated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 uM of doxorubicin for 24 h Establish effects of increasing doses of doxorubicin on control H9 hESC-derived cardiomyocytes

DESIGN
Monolayers of cells in a 24-well plate were treated for 24 h
