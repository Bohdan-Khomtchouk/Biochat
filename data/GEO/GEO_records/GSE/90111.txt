TITLE
Functional genomics of HDAC class-I specific inhbitor 4SC-202 in pancreatic cell lines  [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined transcriptome-wide effects of 4SC-202 in L3.6, BXPC3 and PANC1 cells as well as its effect on TGFβ signaling

DESIGN
We performed  mRNA sequencing from L3.6, BXPC3 and PANC1 cells following following DMSO, 4SC-202 and/or TGFβ treatment. The mRNA-Seq includes following conditions: 4SC-202 vs DMSO (for L3.6, BXPC3 and PANC1 cells), TGFβ vs DMSO and 4SC-202+TGFβ vs TGFβ (for PANC1  cells). The libraries were performed in triplicates.
