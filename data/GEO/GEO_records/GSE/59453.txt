TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in the duodenum mucosa after a high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) meal ingestion.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fat intake is an important determinant in the development of obesity. The small intestine is the principal site of digestion and absorption of nutrients, and these short-term circulating nutrients and hormones as well as neural signals derived from the peripheral tissues in responses to a meal act at multiple central nervous system sites where food intake is controlled. In order to identify the HF-specific peripheral signals that can be therapeutic targets of obesity, we investigated transcriptomic changes in the duodenum mucosa after a HF or LF meal ingestion.

DESIGN
One group of mice (n= 20) was sacrificed after fasting, and the others (n = 20 per experimental condition) were fed ad libitum with LF or HF meal, and sacrificed 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after the beginning of the meal. The meal-induced transcriptomic changes in the duodenum mucosa were compared to the fasting condition.
