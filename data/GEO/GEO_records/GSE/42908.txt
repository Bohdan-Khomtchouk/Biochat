TITLE
Direct reprogramming of human astrocytes into neural stem cells and neurons (MeDIP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ectopic expression of the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, or NANOG into human astrocytes in specific cytokine/culture conditions activated the neural stem gene program and induced generation of cells expressing neural stem/precursor markers (ASTRO-NSC). To evaluate the epigenetic changes associated with this reprogramming, we analyzed the DNA methylation patterns of Astro-NSC relative to untransfected astrocytes.

DESIGN
We compared three human AstroNANOG-NSC clones to the astrocytes from which they were derived using NimbleGen 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays

PLATFORM
GPL16378 NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array [100718_HG18_CpG_Refseq_Prom_MeDIP]
