TITLE
The Transcriptome of HIV-1 Infected Intestinal CD4+ T cells Exposed to Enteric Bacteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gastrointestinal tract is a major site of early HIV-1 replication and death of CD4+ T cells. As HIV-1 replicates in the gut, the protective epithelial barrier gets disrupted, leading to the entry of bacteria into the underlying tissue and the bloodstream, leading to inflammation and clinical complications even in HIV-1-infected patients taking antiviral drugs. Counteracting these pathogenic processes may require in-depth understanding of the molecular pathways that HIV-1 and microbes utilize to infect, functionally alter and/or kill CD4+ T cells. However, to date, the nature of the genes altered by relevant HIV-1 strains and bacteria in intestinal CD4+ T cells remains unclear. Here, we obtained the first gene expression profiles of transmitted/founder (TF) HIV-1 (CH40-T2A-eGFP) infected gut CD4+ T cells infected with HIV-1 in the context of microbes found in the GI tract of HIV-1 infected patients. Our findings reveal common and distinct signaling pathways altered by HIV-1 depending on the presence of microbes that may shed light on infection, inflammation and CD4+ T cell depletion in HIV-1 infected individuals. In-depth understanding of these molecular programs may inform potential ways to counteract pathogenic outcomes initiated and/or sustained by HIV-1 infection in the GI tract.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes from transmitted/founder HIV-1 infected (GFP+) human LPMC with or without exposure to Prevotella stercorea and mock infected LPMC were analyzed using Affemetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST array.
