TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis mature siliques

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptomes of nearly ripe siliques (18-19 DAP) of the rdo2-1, rdo3 and hub1-2 (rdo4) mutants in comparison with wild-type Ler, using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array.

DESIGN
The experiment includes rdo2, rdo3, and rdo4 as well the Ler genotypes with three biological replicates for each. Therefore in total there are 12 arrays
