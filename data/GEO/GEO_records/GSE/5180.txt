TITLE
Gene expression in aortic aneurysms associated with tricuspid and bicuspid valves

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have increased risk of thoracic ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA) and dissection compared to those with a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether differences in gene expression exist in aortas from BAV and TAV patients with AscAA. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Aneurysmal tissue of ascending aorta was collected from 13 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and 12 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). Patients were selected on the basis of aortic diameter, age and other disease conditions. Patients with giant cell aortitis, cardiovascular abnormalities, inherited connective tissue disorders such as Marfan and  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were excluded from the study.  RNA was extracted using Invitrogen RNA extraction kit and shown to be of adequate quality before application to Affymetrix microarray U133A gene chips probing for over 16,000 genes per chip. Two different methods of data analysis were performed: a linear model and GeneSpring.
