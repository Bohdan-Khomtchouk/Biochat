TITLE
Gene Profiling of Endometrium Reveals Progesterone Resistance and Candidate Genetic Loci in Women with Endometriosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transition of regularly cycling endometrium from the proliferative or Estrogen-dominant phase of the menstrual cycle to the Progesterone-dominant Early and Mid Secretory phases requires wide-spread changes in gene expression that shift the endometrium from a proliferative capacity to a differentiated 'decidual' phenotype in preparation for implantation.  This process appears delayed in women with severe endometriosis, suggestive of a progesterone resistant endometrium in this disease. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Endometrial biopsies were obtained from women both with normal endometrial pathologies and no history of endometriosis and from women with laporoscopy proven moderate-severe stage endometriosis.  Samples were collected from the Proliferative(PE), Early Secretory (ESE) and Midsecretory (MSE) phases. Samples were then processed for Total RNA isolation and Affymetrix chip hybridization.
