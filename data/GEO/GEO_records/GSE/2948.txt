TITLE
UPRT Transgenic cells, Human Arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UPRT Transgenic and wildtype control cells of both HeLa and U373MG tissue culture lines were grown in the presence of 2mM 2,4-dithiouracil for either 6 hours (HeLa) or 8 hours (U373MG) and total RNA, not thiouracil-purified, from both transgenic and wildtype samples was compared on microarrays. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
