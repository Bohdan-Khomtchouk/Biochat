TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in DJ-1 deficient muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) underlie the pathogenesis of multiple disorders. Nevertheless, physiological levels of ROS are required for intracellular signalling and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. DJ-1, a Parkinsonâ€™s disease-associated protein, is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress. Our aim in this study was to determine the effect of DJ-1 disruption on gene expression in muscle cells. To this end, we transfected a murine myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells with siRNA targeting DJ-1.

DESIGN
C2C12 myoblasts purchased from ATCC were transfected with scramble or DJ-1 siRNA, and 48 hours later, cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes. 4 days later, myotubes were harvested and processed for RNA extraction and hybridization.
