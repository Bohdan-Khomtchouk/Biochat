TITLE
expression profiling of wild type and the hy5 mutant in arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine the functional relevance of the HY5 binding sites to the transcriptional regulation, we performed genome wide expression analysis using WT and hy5 grown in continuous white light for 4 days. Keywords: mutant/widetype comparative
