TITLE
ESlncRNA (AK148461) over-expression on gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We over-expressed ESlncRNA (AK148461) in fetal liver erythroid progenitor cells (Lin-cells), followed by microarray analysis to examine the global changes of gene expression level. We showed that ESlncRNA has an anti-apoptotic activity during mouse erythropoiesis.

DESIGN
Compare the gene expression level in vector transduced fetal liver erythroid progenitor cells (Lin-cells) with that in ESlncRNA transduced fetal liver erythroid progenitor cells (Lin-cells).
