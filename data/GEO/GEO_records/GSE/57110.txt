TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in calorie-restricted rats implicates epigenetic and post-translational mechanisms in neuroprotection and aging

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, 39 cerebral cortex RNA samples were sequenced. The study design was as follows:  Ad libitum fed rats at 6 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 12 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled) and 28 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled). Calorie restricted rats at  6 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 12 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled) and 28 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled). Rats fed alpha lipoic acid as a supplement to ad libitum at 12 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled) and 28 months (n=3, 6 individuals pooled). Diet switching groups, where diet was changes at 12 months; 28 month ad libitum switched to calorie restriction (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 28 month calorie restriction switched to ad libitum (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 28 month ad libitum plus lipoic acid switched to calorie restriction (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 28 month calorie restriction switched to ad libitum plus lipoic acid (n=3, 6 individuals pooled).

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of the ageing cerebral cortex at 6, 12 and 28 months and the effect of diet on age and longevity, using carlorie restriction and alpha lipoic acid supplementation
