TITLE
Epigenetic stress responses induce muscle stem cell aging by Hoxa9 developmental signals [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background and Aims: Analysis of aging-induced impairments in satellite cells (SCs) â€“ the stem cells of skeletal muscle that are required for its regeneration. Hox genes are known to control stem cell function and development of various tissues.

DESIGN
Hindlimb muscles from young adult (3-4 months) and old (22-28 months) C57BL/6J mice were injured by BaCl2 injection in order to induce satellite cell activation. Satellite cells were isolated 3 days after injury and gene expression was analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
