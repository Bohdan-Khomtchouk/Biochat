TITLE
Integrated analysis of transcript level regulation of metabolism during human adipocyte differentiation [T0901317]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we have focused on studying the link between metabolic changes driven by the differentiation into mature adipocytes of a human preadipocyte cell line (SGBS) and their regulation, through a combined experimental and computational approach. By collecting data on gene expression, PPARg, CEBPa, LXR and H3K4me3 genome-wide ChIP-seq profles and transcriptome-wide microRNA target identification for miR-27a, miR29a and miR-222, and using constraint-based modeling to estimate metabolic reaction activity, we obtained a comprehensive set of information highlighting how epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation impacts the metabolic network.

DESIGN
Illumina HT12 V3.0 microarrays: LXR ligand activation with 1 microM T0901317 for 4 h in SGBS day 10 differentiated adipocytes (6 samples, treatment vs control, in triplicate) This submission represents transcriptome component of study.
