TITLE
Expression data from Sh2b3 Knock-out NOTCH1-induced leukemias

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To formally address the tumor suppressor activity of Sh2b3 in vivo, we tested the interaction between oncogenic NOTCH1 and Sh2b3 loss in a retroviral- transduction bone marrow transplantation model of NOTCH-induced T-ALL Forced expression of activated NOTCH1 in this model typically results in full leukemia transformation 5-10 weeks later.

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression analysis of Sh2b3 wild type and Sh2b3–/– NOTCH1 induced leukemias
