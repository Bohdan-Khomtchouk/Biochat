TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in AhR WT (+/+) and AhR KO (-/-) primary mouse keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The AhR is a ligand activated transcription factor that may be important in normal skin physiology. We compared gene expression profiles between  AhR Wt and AhR KO primary mouse keratinocyte cultures. We identified 391 genes that were differentially expressed with a 1.5 fold cutoff and p < .05, and identified the AhR as an important regulator of genes involved in normal epidermal differentiation.

DESIGN
AhR Wt primary keratinocyte cultures (n=4) were compared with AhR KO primary keratinocyte cultures (n=3)
