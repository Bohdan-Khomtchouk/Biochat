TITLE
HCC Cell lines: MHCC97L vs. Huh7 and HCCLM3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes associated with HCC invasiveness and metastasis, a hybridization-based microarray assay was used to analyze three cell lines with increasing metastatic potentials, Huh7,MHCC97L, and HCCLM3

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, MHCC97L vs. Huh7 and HCCLM3 cells. Biological replicates:3 replicates (each cell line) .

PLATFORM
GPL18180 Agilent-045142 Human LncRNA v4 4X180K [Probe Name Version]
