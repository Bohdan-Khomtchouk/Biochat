TITLE
Nutrigenomics and nutritional analysis of juvenile Asian seabass (Lates Calcarifer) fed five different commercial feeds

ORGANISM
Lates calcarifer

SUMMARY
In this study, the relative effect of consuming five different commercial feeds (Feed B-F) and and frozen fish (control; Feed A) for two months on our selected juvenile Asian seabass (77.3g ± 22.4g) were investigated. The growth performance, the biochemical analysis of their flesh, the histology of their midgut and the transcriptome of their midgut and liver were compared to each other and controls. Our customised agilent microarray platform (GPL17855), were used to investigate the liver transcriptomic expression of the different Groups fed with different Feeds. No differential expression were detected between commerical Feeds (B, C, E and F). A total of 397 differentially expressed transcripts (Foldchange cutoff: -1.5≤ or ≥1.5, Pvalue with FDR ( < 0.05) were detected between Feed D and control Feed A.

DESIGN
Total: 24 samples (4 biological samples per Group; 6 Different Groups in total). Groups (A-F) were fed with Feeds (A-F) respectively for 61 days.

PLATFORM
GPL17855 Agilent-045004 Sea Bass v3 with 300Techreps_3
