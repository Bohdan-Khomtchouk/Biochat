TITLE
ChIP-seq of Atrophin in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Atro mutants have a large range of phenotypes, including neurodegeneration, segmentation, patterning and planar polarity defects. Although Atro mutants have diverse phenotypes, little is known about Atroâ€™s binding partners and downstream targets. We present the first genomic analysis of Atro using ChIP-seq against endogenous Atro. These data sets will serve as a valuable resource for future studies on Atro.

DESIGN
We performed three independent biological replicates of Atro ChIP-seq experiments in untreated S2 cells.  A corresponding non-specific IgG control ChIP was performed with each Atro ChIP-seq and was used as a control.

PLATFORM
GPL16479 Illumina MiSeq (Drosophila melanogaster)
