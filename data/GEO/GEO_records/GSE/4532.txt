TITLE
Cross-hybridization comparison between cRNA target and cDNA target

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used two RNA samples that differed only by a set of three hemoglobin transcripts to compare microarray cross-hybridization between two target preparation protocols.  We found widespread cross-hybridization using standard cRNA target but substantially less cross-hybridization using cDNA target. Keywords: protocol comparison
