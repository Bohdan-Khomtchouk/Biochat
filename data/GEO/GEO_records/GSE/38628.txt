TITLE
Analysis of gene expression during Calcium induced differentiation of human primary keratinocytes (NHEK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary keratinocytes were collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after addition of 1.8mM Calcium and RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
Primary normal human keratinocytes (NHEK) were collected and RNA was extracted 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 after addition of 1.8mM Calcium.
