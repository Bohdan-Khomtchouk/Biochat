TITLE
RNA-seq identified KLF16 as a negative regulator of adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed high throughput RNA sequencing at preadipocyte (D0) and differentiated adipocyte (D7) of primary brown preadipocyte and found that Kruppel-like factor 16 (KLF11) gene that was downregulated in D7 was a novel negative regulator of adipogenesis.

DESIGN
To explore global view of gene expression during adipogenesis, RNA-seq was performed in the primary cultured brown preadipocyte (D0) and brown adipocyte after 7 day differentiation (D7).  Compared with D0, 6,668 genes were identified as 2 fold differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at D7 including 2,836-upregulated genes and 3,832 down-regulated genes.
