TITLE
14-3-3ζ overexpression-induced gene signature in MCF-10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the function of 14-3-3ζ, we established MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells transduced with 14-3-3ζ (10A.ζ) and vector (10A.Vec) We performed gene expression profiling on 10A.ζ cells and 10A.Vec cells, and normalized to profiling of MCF-10A parental cells

DESIGN
Total mRNA were extracted from 10A.Parental cells, 10A.Vec cells, 10A.ζ cells which were cultured in 3D culture model for 16 days, and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis
