TITLE
Gene expression in tolerogenic TGFb-treated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
F4/80+ macrophages treated with TGFb2 are potently tolerogenic.  Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating the development of these tolerogenic properties is incomplete. We used microarray analysis to identify molecules that are involved in the tolerogenic mechanisms in murine TGFb-treated macrophages.

DESIGN
Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal exudate cells (F4/80+ macrophages) were treated with either PBS or TGFb2 overnight then total RNA extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
