TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of genes regulated by stk in Streptococcus suis serotype 2

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
To reveal the scope of the stk regulation and explore the differences in the regulatory roles of SC-19 and ∆stk, the global gene transcription profiles of the WT and ∆stk  strains were determined by RNA-seq analysis.
