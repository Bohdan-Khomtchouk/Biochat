TITLE
Transcriptional activity of Bacillus subtilis exposed to lethal heat stress

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Bacillus subtilis to lethal heat stress by systematic sampling of bacterial cell suspensions exposed to gradually increasing temperatures. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
Bacterial cell suspensions exposed to increasing temperatures ranging from 30-62ºC (Cy5 channel) versus 30 degrees C reference (Cy 3 channel), by transfer of the bacterial cell suspension from a 30ºC to a 65ºC water bath; sampling and quenching at 30, 40, 50, 57, 58, 59, 60 and 62ºC; total time to reach 62ºC is ~12 minutes . Biological replicates: 2, independently grown cultures. One replicate per array. Strains B subtilis 168 1A1; B subtilis A163 (food product isolate); B. subtilis MC85 (food product isolate).
