TITLE
Gene expression profiling in a congenic strain identifies candidate genes for nutrient intake QTL on mouse chromosome 17

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify genes contributing to fat, carbohydrate, and total calorie intake in mice by comparing gene expression in liver and hypothalamus of an interval-specific congenic strain, B6.CAST-17, with that of the control strain.  This congenic strain has previously confirmed genetic loci on Chr 17 linked to increased carbohydrate (Mnic1) and kilocalorie (Kcal2) intake. Keywords: Comparative gene expression analysis
