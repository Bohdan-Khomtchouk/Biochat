TITLE
Mice model for 15q11-13 duplication syndrome show late onset obesity and altered lipid metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression change in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of patDp/+ mice compared with wild type mice, the whole genome microarray profiling was performed. Total RNA from WAT of young adult stage mice (9-10 weeks old) was extracted and subject to microarray analysis. Expression change of sfrp5 gene was further validated by real-time PCR, suggesting this gene might contribute to the obesity in patDp/+ mice.

DESIGN
We measured the gene expression changes in WAT of young adult stage mice. Three patDp/+ mice and three wild type mice were used in the experiment.
