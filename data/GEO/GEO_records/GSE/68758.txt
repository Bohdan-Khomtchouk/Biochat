TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K27me3 modification sites in sk-hep-1,sk-hep-1-shEZH2 and LO2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for high-throughput profiling of H3K27me3 modifications in sk-hep-1(sk), sk-hep-1-shEZH2 (sks) and LO2 cells. Following standard ChIP procedure, 10 ng of each DNA sample was used for Illumina sequencing. Statistically significant ChIP-enriched regions (peaks) were identified by sk vs sks (p-value threshold of 10-2) or sk vs LO2 (p-value threshold of 10-3). Enriched peaks were annotated by the nearest gene using the newest UCSC RefSeq database. We identify genes modified by EZH2-mediated H3K27me3. This study provides insights into these down stream genes modified by EZH2 regulated H3K27me3 in HCC cell lines.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 in 3 HCC cell lines.
