TITLE
Expression analysis of Hypocrea jecorina CBS999.97(MAT1-2) wild-type and delta-env1 strains in four different light and darkness conditions

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in response to different light conditions of the H. jecorina CBS999.97(MAT1-2) parental strain (W) and the deletion strain delta-env1 (E). These two strains were grown on malt extract agar(Merck) at 25℃ in four different conditions: (1) 24L: constant light illumination (24L); (2) 12L12D: in a 12h light/dark cycle and then 6h light illumination; (3) 12D12L: in a 12h dark/light cycle and then 6h constant darknes;  (4) 24D:  constant darkness. The wild-type strain is potent for sexual development in 12D12L, 12L12D and 24D, whereas the delta-env1 mutant undergo sexual development only in 24D. By contrast, the wild-type strain is female sterile in 24L, and  the delta-env1 mutant is female sterile in 12D12L, 12L12D and 24D. Our results reveal that  conidation-specific genes, mating locus gene, h-type maitng pheromone genes, and genes invovled in processing and secretion of h-type mating pheromone are significantly upregulated in all four female sterile conditions (W-24L, E-12L12D, E-12D12L and E-24L).

DESIGN
We used two biological replicates of two H. jecorina CBS999.97 (MAT1-2) strains, wild-type (W) and delta-env(E) on the cellophane-covered malt extract agar (MEA) plate at 25℃ for 7.25 days.
