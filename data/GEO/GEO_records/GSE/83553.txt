TITLE
Gene expression from the New Zealand White rabbit calvarial defects treated with human particulated dentin

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
In this study, human particulated dentin (HPD) was developed. The characteristic of HPD was examinated by XRD, EDX and cytotoxicity test. HPD was used to implant in the calvarial defects of New Zealand White rabbits. bone tissue and blood samples were taken at 3, 5 and 7 days post-implantation for microarray experiment. The gene expression profiles and signaling pathways were monitored using GeneSpring software and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA), respectively. We used microarray and IPA to elucidate the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up- and down- regulated genes during HPD treated healing process.

DESIGN
In this study, 24 New Zealand White rabbits, weighing 3.0â€“3.5 kg, were anesthetized with intramuscular Zoletil 50 at a dose of 0.5 mL. Four circular defects (5 mm inner diameter) were made in the parietal bone using a trephine on a slow-speed electric handpiece. The two right defects were grafted with 0.2 g of prepared HPD and the other two were unfilled control. After 3, 5, and 7 days, The bone tissue and blood samples were taken for RNA extration and microarray experiment. The samples at 3 time points were defined as below: Control_3d, HPD_3d, Control_5d, HPD_5d, Control_7d, HPD_7d.
