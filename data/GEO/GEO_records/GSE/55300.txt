TITLE
Separated Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) by functional separation using modified Matrigel invasion assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We separated PSCs by functional separation using moidfied Matrigel invasion assay our previously reported (Fujiwara, PLoS One, 2012). In this culture system, we evaluated two primary cultures of human PSCs. PSCs in the upper chambers were incubated for 72 hours in culture with SUIT-2 pancreatic cancer cells in the lower chambers, or as controls without pancreatic cancer cells in the lower chambers, and were collected from the top and bottom sides of the upper chambers separately. The top side-derived PSCs were cells that did not migrate toward the cancer cells, and the bottom side-derived PSCs were cells that migrated toward the pancreatic cancer cells. We then performed a DNA microarray analysis using these cells.

DESIGN
The quality of the RNA samples was evaluated using Experionâ„¢ Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). We used a HumanHT-12v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for these analyses. The data were analyzed using Bead Studio software version 3.2.3 (Illumina).
