TITLE
Functional interaction between a PIP2 novel polyA polymerase and type 1 PIPKIalpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A loss of StarPap would be predicted to result in a decrease in cellular levels of mRNAs which it polyadenylates.  Moreover, if PIPKIalpha has a function relationship with StarPap, knockdown of PIPKIalpha should cause a decrease in a pool of target mRNAs which require both StarPap and PIPKIalpha for their maturation.  To test this, we independently knocked down StarPap and PIPKIalpha, and performed microarray analysis of total polyadenylated mRNAs from each group. Keywords: Gene expression after siRNA knockdown
