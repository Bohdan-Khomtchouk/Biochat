TITLE
Expression profile of human liver cancer cells with GP73 overexpression or knock down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GP73 contributes to the oncogenesis and development of HCC We used microarrays to detail the mechanism of GP73 with downstream targets that drive HCC cell growth

DESIGN
GP73 were knocked down in MHCC97H cell for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.We sought to obtain the mechanism/interactions of GP73 with downstream proteins/components that drive HCC cell growth
