TITLE
Differentiation of NIH-3T3 cells to adipocytes by PPARg or EBF1 over-expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH-3T3 cells transduced with either EBF1-, PPARg2- or empty vector were stimulated with hormones to initiate adipocyte differentiation. RNA extraction was done using TriZol at d0, d2, d4 and d10 after stimulation. Samples were handled according to standard affymetrix protocols. Keywords = Adipogenesis Keywords = adipocyte Keywords = early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) Keywords = commitment Keywords = differentiation Keywords = NIH-3T3 Keywords = pparg Keywords: time-course
