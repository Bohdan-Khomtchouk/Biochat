TITLE
Current injection and distal wound response in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These data represent two experiments, one on wounding leaves and one based on injecting current into leaves. We first analyzed transcript levels in leaf 13 when leaf 8 was wounded. Transcripts levels in leaf 8 were then analyzed after current injection. Sample handling and normalisations were identical between experiments.

DESIGN
Leaf 8 was wounded with forceps. 1 h later, leaf 13 was harvested. Unwounded leaf 13 was used for controls. For current injected (40 Î¼A, 10 s) versus non-current injected leaves, samples were harvested 1h after current injection. Non-current injected leaves used as control. In each case leaf 8 was used.
