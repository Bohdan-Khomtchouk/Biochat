TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana sixth generation of mutant fas2 MNase-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CAF-1 is a major nucleosome assembly complex, which functions particularly during replication and DNA-repair. Here, we studied how the nucleosome landscape changes in fas2 a mutant of the CAF-1 complex in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana

DESIGN
Comparison of nucleosome distribution between the sixth generation fas2 mutant and wt

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
