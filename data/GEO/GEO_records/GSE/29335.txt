TITLE
Time-course bud expression data from Populus deltoides

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We conducted micro-array analysis to quantify the global transcriptome variations in floral buds through the course of the year allowing for identification of changing developmental signals. We used RNA samples from floral buds, with bud scale removed,  in the upper crown of a sexually mature Populus deltoides tree 2 hours after sunrise.
