TITLE
Time-course bud expression data from Populus deltoides

ORGANISM
Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
We conducted micro-array analysis to quantify the global transcriptome variations in floral buds through the course of the year allowing for identification of changing developmental signals. We used RNA samples from floral buds, with bud scale removed,  in the upper crown of a sexually mature Populus deltoides tree 2 hours after sunrise.

DESIGN
Three independent samples of floral bud tissues with bud scales removes were collected from the upper crown of a single sexually mature male tree. RNA was extracted from tissues and hybridized on Affymetrix Genechip Poplar Genome Array.
