TITLE
Identification of ORS1 target genes using inducible overexpression system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify early target genes of the senescence-associated transcription factor: ORS1. For this purpose we used DEX-inducible system and studied the expression profile 5h after treatment using Affymetrix microarray. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Arabidopsis  46 day-old transgenic plants (Arabidopsis C24 background, inducible overexpression)  were sprayed with 30ÂµM  DEX for 5h. As control mock (0.05% ethanol) treated  ORS1-inducible over-expression plants were used. Whole rosettes were harvested 5h after induction and used for expression profiling using Affymetrix near-full genome ATH1 arrays. Experiment performed in two biological replications.
