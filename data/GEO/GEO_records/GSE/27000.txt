TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptome responses to Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs differing in Salmonella shedding phenotypes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Salmonella species infect many vertebrate species, and pigs colonized with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) are usually asymptomatic, making detection of these Salmonella-carrier pigs difficult. The variable fecal shedding of this gram-negative bacteria in such pigs is an important cause of foodborne illness and zoonotic disease. To investigate gene pathways and biomarkers associated with the variance in Salmonella shedding following experimental inoculation, we have initiated the first analysis of the whole blood transcriptional response induced by Salmonella. A population of pigs (n=40) was inoculated with ST and the peripheral blood and feces were collected between 2 and 20 days post-inoculation. Two groups of pigs with either low shedding (LS) or persistent shedding (PS) phenotypes were identified. The global transcriptional changes in response to ST inoculation were identified by Affymetrix Genechip?analysis of peripheral blood RNA at day 0 and day 2 post-inoculation.

DESIGN
Forty pigs (n=40) was inoculated with ST. Four low shedding (LS) pigs and six persistent shedding (PS) pigs were identified. Transcriptom of peripheral blood collected at 0 and 2 dpi were identified by Affymetrix Genechip analysis.
