TITLE
Comparative gene expression in the human conjunctiva and cornea

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of a marker that is expressed in the conjunctival epithelium but not in the corneal epithelium has been a growing need. A more specific marker of limbal and conjunctival epithelia would be necessary to detect non-corneal epithelial cells on the corneal surface. To search for conjunctival specific marker(s), we first performed preferential gene profiling in the conjunctiva in direct comparison to that in the cornea using microarray technique.

DESIGN
The study consisted of gene expression profiles comparing the cornea and conjunctiva.
