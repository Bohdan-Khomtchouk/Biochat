TITLE
Liver gene expression profile _ wild type_ CYP7A1 transgenic

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bile acids are not only physiological detergents facilitating nutrient absorption, but also signaling molecules regulating metabolic homeostasis. We reported recently that transgenic expression of CYP7A1 in mice stimulated bile acid synthesis and prevented Western diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. The aim of this experiment is to determine the impact of induction of hepatic bile acid synthesis on liver metabolism by determining hepatic gene expression profile in CYP7A1 transgenic mice. CYP7A1 transgenic mice and wild type control mice were fed either standard chow diet or high fat high cholesterol Western diet for 4 month. Hepatic gene expressions were measured by microarray analysis. Our results indicate that hepatic bile acid synthesis is closely linked to cholesterogenesis and lipogenesis, and maintaining bile acid homeostasis is improtant in hepatic metabolic homeostasis.

DESIGN
Male aged matched (~ 12-14 weeks) CYP7A1 transgenic mice and their wild type control littermates were fed a standard chow diet or a high fat (42%) high cholesterol (0.2%) diet (Harlan Teklad #88137) for 4 month Four groups (4 mice/group) are included in the experiments: Group 1: WT _ Chow Group 2: CYP7A1-tg + chow Group 3: WT + Western diet Group 4: CYP7A1-tg _ Western diet Total liver mRNA was isolated with a RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and used for microarray analysis.
