TITLE
Expression data from PML4 overexpressing and control K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PML functions as a platform for the interaction of transcription factors and coactivators. Role of PML in erythroid clone formation has been reported but the detail mechanism is unclear. We used microarrays to identify downstream-regulated genes of PML4.

DESIGN
We transfected K562 cells with retrovirus overexpressing PML4 and control vector pMSCV for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
