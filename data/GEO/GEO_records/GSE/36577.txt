TITLE
Chromosomal aberration of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Exposure to asbestos is a risk for malignant mesothelioma in humans. We carried out array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in a rat model by repeated intraperitoneal injections of three types of asbestos including chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite. We found a common chromosomal deletion mapped to the chromosome 5q32 locus, containing the genes encoding tumour suppressor genes CDKN2A/2B/ARF.  Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/2B/ARF was observed in the majority (92.6%) of the rat MM samples.

DESIGN
Carcinogenesis protocol was performed using specific pathogen-free male and female F1 hybrid rats between Fischer344 and Brown-Norway strains. A total of 27 tumor samples were profiled on Agilent 244A aCGH arrays according to manufacturer's instructions for the screening purpose.
