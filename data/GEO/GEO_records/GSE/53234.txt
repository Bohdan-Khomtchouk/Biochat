TITLE
Human lung adenocarcinoma NCI-H1975 cells: parental vs cell lines resistant to the EGFR-TK inhibitor CNX-2006

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome variation profiling of lung adenocarcinoma cells comparing untreated NCI-H1975 cells with CNX-2006-resistant untreated cells. Goal was to determine the potential mechanism of resistance to mutant EGFR-TKIs and rationally design novel strategies for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: NCI-H1975 parental cells vs CNX-2006-resistant cells. Pooled DNA from healthy volunteers was used as reference.

PLATFORM
GPL16694 Agilent-022522 SurePrint G3 CGH array 4X180K (Probe Name version)
