TITLE
Effect of MDK expressing Melanoma cells conditioned media in Human LEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in hLECs treated with gain of function or loss of function of MDK in human melanoma cells.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of hLEC treated for 3 days with EGM-2 MV conditioned media of melanoma cells. Cell line SK-Mel-147 KD for MDK (shMDK) and its corresponding control (shCtrl (LoF) and WM164 cell line overexpressing MDK (MDK)  or an empty vector (NEG) (GoF) were used to produce the conditioned media.

PLATFORM
