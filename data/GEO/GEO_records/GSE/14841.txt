TITLE
Expression data from healthy volunteers and IBS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Micro-inflammation and gut dysfunction are features of diarrhea-irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients, although the underlying interacting molecular mechanisms remain mostly unknown. Therefore, we aimed to identify critical networks and signaling pathways active in chronic diarrhea-associated inflammation. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression

DESIGN
Healthy volunteers and d-IBS patients were studied. Jejunal biopsies were subjected to chip analysis (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips).
