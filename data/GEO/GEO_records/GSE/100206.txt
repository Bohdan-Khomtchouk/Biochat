TITLE
RNA-seq reveals abundant circRNA, lncRNA and mRNA in blood exosomes of normal persons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin secreted by most cells, and contain a wealthy cargo of protein and RNA species that can modulate recipient cellsâ€™ behaviors and may be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of human diseases. They have been found in blood and are valuable sources for biomarkers due to selective cargo loading and resemblance to their parental cells. The goal of this study is to identify circRNA, lncRNA and mRNA profiles in human blood by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). 1-4 ml plasma or serum were used to extract exosomal RNAs by exoRNeasy Serum/Plasma Maxi kit (Qiagen). The exosomal RNAs were further treated with DNAse I and subjected to ribosome minus low-input RNAseq library preparation. The libraries were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq platform.

DESIGN
Human blood exosomal RNAs were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq.
