TITLE
RNA-directed DNA Methylation is associated with gene expression via chromosomal Interactions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a process, where small interfering RNA (siRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) work together to repress transposons. In addition to controlling repetitive sequences, it contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation by RdDM remain mostly unknown. We show that RdDM is involved in repression of long range chromosomal interactions. We propose a model where RdDM contributes to the regulation of gene expression by controlling looping between genes and their distant enhancers.
