TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Transcriptomes of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed high throughput transcriptome of breast cancer and normal tissues, identifying lincRNA associated molecular subtype with powerful capacity to distinct breast cancer population and predict prognosis. We also identified subtype-specific lincRNAs that may be a useful complement to intrinsic molecular subtype classification when divergence emerges among pathologists.Paired-end transcriptome sequencing were carried out on a cohort of 33 breast tissues from 11 groups including five breast cancer subtypes including luminal A (LA), luminal B (HER2 negative)(LB, HER2-), luminal B (HER2 positive) (LB, HER2+), HER2 and tripple negative breast cancer (TNB), adjacent noncancerous breast tissue (ANT, three samples for each subtype) and the complete normal breast tissues (three samples)

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomes in 15 breast cancer and 18 normal tissues.
