TITLE
Candidate Vaccine Assessment in a pH1N1 Rhesus Macaque Challenge Model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A mixed-aerosol pH1N1 (Cal04) challenge of rhesus macaques was establised to serve as a pre-clinical model for the evaluation of candidate vaccines.  After characterizing the clinical signs and immune responses associated with pH1N1 challenge in na√Øve rhesus macaques, a follow-up study assessing 2 candidate vaccines was performed.
