TITLE
Candidate Vaccine Assessment in a pH1N1 Rhesus Macaque Challenge Model

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
A mixed-aerosol pH1N1 (Cal04) challenge of rhesus macaques was establised to serve as a pre-clinical model for the evaluation of candidate vaccines.  After characterizing the clinical signs and immune responses associated with pH1N1 challenge in na√Øve rhesus macaques, a follow-up study assessing 2 candidate vaccines was performed.

DESIGN
This study has 2 phases: 1) Model Establisment consisting of 3 groups: Unvaccinated Live Challenge (n=3, Unvaccinated UV-inactivated Challenge (n=3), Previously Vaccinated Live Challenge (n=3) which were sampled at 2 baseline timepoints Day -7 and Day 0.  Following the H1N1 Challenge, samples were collected at day 1,2,5,8,14,20. 2) Candidate Vaccine Assessment consisting of four groups: Previously Vaccinted with anti-CD40-NP5+PolyICLC (n=4), Previously vaccinated with CD40-HA+PolyICLC (n=4), Previously vaccinated with commercial mismatched Fluzone (n=4), Previously vaccinated with Media+PolyICLC alone (n=4). Daseline samples were collected at Day -7 and 0 (baseline) and Day 1,3,6,14,20 post-challenge.
