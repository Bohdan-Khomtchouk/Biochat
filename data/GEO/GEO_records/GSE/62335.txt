TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs expression analysis of gallbladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although many protein-coding genes have been identified to be aberrantly expressed in gallbladder cancer, the mechanism that account for the development and progression of gallbladder cancer remains unclear. In recent years, long noncoding RNAs have been shown to play vital roles in mammalian cell biology. In this study, we found that a small number of  lncRNAs that are aberrantly expressed.

DESIGN
A ten chip study using total RNA recovered five separate gallbladder cancer tissues and five matched adjacent gallbladder normal tissues
