TITLE
Gene expression profiling of flower and leaf of Cold-tolerant rice variety Stejaree45

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To stabilize crop yield under low temperature stress conditions, it is important to improve stress tolerance in crops. Upon exposure to low temperature stress, many genes are induced and their products are thought to function as cellular protectants of stress-induced damages Therefore, responses of global gene expression profiles to cold stress was analyzed at the booting stage using the 60K Rice Whole Genome Microarray.

DESIGN
The cold-tolerant rice variety, Stejaree45 was transplanted in 1/5000 pot at 20 days after seeding. Fertilizers were applied at the rate of 11, 7.7 and 9.3 kg/10a in N, P2O5 The samples were selected at the booting stage of rice on the basis of the auricle distance (the distance between auricles of flag leaf and the previous leaf of the main culm). The plants with an auricle distance ranging from -5 ㎝ to 0 ㎝ were exposed up to the flag leaf auricle using cold water (13℃) for 3 days. Glumous flowers and flag leaves of the cold-resistant variety, Stejaree45, were used to examine gene expression profiles.
