TITLE
Expression data from rosiglitazone treated, rosiglitazone withdrawal and untreated control Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Insulin resistance and islet failure are the two etiological roots of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and understanding global islet gene expression may provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate islet function. In this study we systematically investigated the gene expression profile and proliferative response of islets to insulin sensitization, insulin resistance, and islet failure.

DESIGN
Five-week old male Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (n=24) were randomized into one of three groups: four-week rosiglitazone treated, rosiglitazone withdrawal, or untreated controls.  Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 gene arrays were performed on isolated islets to measure the gene expresion profile of islets at 9, 11, and 13 weeks of age.
