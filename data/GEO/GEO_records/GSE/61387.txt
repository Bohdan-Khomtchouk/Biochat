TITLE
Transcriptome profile of wild type Azoarcus sp. BH72 grown under microaerobic condition (0.3% oxygen) compared with that grown under aerobic condition (21% oxygen), both in presence of combined nitrogen source, respectively

ORGANISM
Azoarcus sp. BH72

SUMMARY
Low oxygen tensions are often encountered in flooded soils of rice fields by root-associated, strictly respiratory, beta proteobacterium, Azoarcus sp. BH72 which fixes nitrogen only under microaerobic condition. In this study, genome wide oligonucleotide microarrays were used compare the global transcription profile of Azoarcus sp. BH72 under microaerobic condition with cells grown under aerobic condition, both with ammonia as sole nitrogen source. The outcome of this study will provide a better insight about the establishment of this endophyte in the microaerobic environment, probably prevailing inside of the rice root niche .

DESIGN
RNA from cells grown under microaerobic condition with 0.3% oxygen (experiment) and aerobic condition with 21% oxygen (control), respectively  was used for two color whole genome microarray approach.

PLATFORM
GPL11300 Azoarcus sp. BH72 Array
