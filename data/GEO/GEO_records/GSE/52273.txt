TITLE
Effects of hepatocyte-restricted Fra-1 overexpression on hepatic gene expression in High-fat diet (HFD) fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatic mRNA expression was compared between control and Fra-1hep mice, which were fed High fat diet (45%kcal fat)

DESIGN
Liver RNA pooled from 5 HFD fed control mice (control pool) was Cy3-labeled and liver RNA from 4 individual Fra-1hep mice was Cy5-labeled. On each microarray, Cy3‐labeled control pool and one Cy5-labeled mutant sample were hybridized at 65°C for 17 hours.
