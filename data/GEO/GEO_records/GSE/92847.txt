TITLE
Gene expression of Vibrio parahaemolyticus growing in laboratory isolation conditions compared to those common in its natural ocean environment

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus

SUMMARY
Using high-throughput sequencing of RNA obtained from triplicate samples, we compared the differential gene expression of V. parahaemolyticus when growing at 37°C, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.04% bile salts with that at 12°C, 3% NaCl without bile salts, a condition similar to that prevailing in the ocean.

DESIGN
Examine differential expression in to two different condition (six samples)
