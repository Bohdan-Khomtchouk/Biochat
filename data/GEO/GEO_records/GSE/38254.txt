TITLE
Aberrant DNA methylation of miRNA genes in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in cancer. The aim of the study was to determine how is DNA methylation of miRNA genes changed in breast cancer cell lines an breast tumor specimens.

DESIGN
Breast cancer cell lines vs. HMEC.  Breast tumor tissue specimens vs. non-tumor tissue specimens. Biological replicates: 12 breast tumor specimens, 5 breast non-tumor specimens, 7 breast cancer cell lines, 3 HMEC genotypes, 3 HMF genotypes. Immunoprecipitation using anti-Methylcytosine (5MeC) antibody.

PLATFORM
