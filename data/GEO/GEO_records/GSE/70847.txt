TITLE
Genome-wide epigenetic cross-talk between DNA methylation and H3K27me3 in zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
DNA methylation and histone modifications are epigenetic marks implicated in the complex regulation of vertebrate embryogenesis. The cross-talk between DNA methylation and Polycomb-dependent H3K27me3 histone mark has been reported in a number of organisms and both marks are known to be required for proper developmental progression. Here we provide genome-wide DNA methylation (MethylCap-seq) and H3K27me3 (ChIP-seq) maps for three stages (dome, 24hpf and 48hpf) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryogenesis, as well as all analytical and methodological details associated with the generation of this dataset.

DESIGN
DNA methylation (MethylCap-seq) and H3K27me3 (ChIP-seq) profling of zebrafish embryogenesis
