TITLE
Epigenetic Analysis of Eµ-Myc B-cell lymphoma using both H3K27me3 CHiP-Seq and Bisulfite-Seq (reduced representation).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RRBS and H3K27me3 to understand epigenetic changes in resistant cell lines to DNA crosslinking agent, mafosfamide, (Parental, R100, R500, R1000, R2000, R4000) via dose escalation.

DESIGN
Resistant strains were generated from a parental Eµ-Myc B-cell lymphoma line via dose escalation of mafosfamide over a 34-day peroid.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
