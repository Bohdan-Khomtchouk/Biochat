TITLE
mRNA expression in rat proximal femoral growthplate after mid-shaft fracture

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Mid-shaft fracture stimulates bone lengthening by increasing linear growth at the growthplate.  This project studied changes in mRNA in the proximal growthplate after a mid-shaft fracture in a rat model. Keywords: time course, fracture, growthplate, rat

DESIGN
Study of rat proximal femoral growthplate after mid-shaft fracture in 4 week old Sprague-Dawley female rats.  RNA from two rats were pooled for each sample.  Proximal femoral growthplate was studied from the fractured femora and the intact contralateral femora.
