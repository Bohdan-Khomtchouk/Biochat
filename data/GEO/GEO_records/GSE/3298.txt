TITLE
mRNA expression in rat proximal femoral growthplate after mid-shaft fracture

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Mid-shaft fracture stimulates bone lengthening by increasing linear growth at the growthplate.  This project studied changes in mRNA in the proximal growthplate after a mid-shaft fracture in a rat model. Keywords: time course, fracture, growthplate, rat
