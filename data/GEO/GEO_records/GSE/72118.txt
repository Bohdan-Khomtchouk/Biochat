TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of CD44highCD24low(CSC) and CD44lowCD24high(Non-CSC) SCC25 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we have characterized the putative Cancer Stem Cell population of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by various cellular and molecular assay. Subsequently we performed gene expression profiling of  SCC25 cell line with CD44highCD24low(CSC) and CD44lowCD24high(Non-CSC) phenotypes using illumina BeadChip Array. Further, systematic computational analysis was performed to identify CSC-like gene signatures in the oral cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to pathway analysis in IPA.  The analysis lead to the identification of few relevant signaling pathway implicated in stemness.

DESIGN
Determination of gene signature in Cancer stem-like population of  oral cancer cell line SCC25 by microarray

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
