TITLE
Integrative gene expression profiling analysis of human quiescent hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unveiling the regulatory pathways maintaining hepatic stellate cells (HSC) in a quiescent (q) phenotype is essential to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat fibrogenic diseases. To uncover the miRNA-mRNAs regulatory interactions in qHSCs, HSCs were FACS-sorted from healthy livers and activated HSCs were generated in vitro. MiRNA Taqman array analysis showed HSCs expressed a low number of miRNA, from which 46 were down-regulated and 212 up-regulated upon activation. Computational integration of miRNA and gene expression profiles revealed that 66% of qHSCs miRNAs correlated with more than 6 altered targeted mRNAs (17,28Â±10,7 targets/miRNA), whereas aHSC-associated miRNAs had an average of 1,49 targeted genes. Interestingly, interaction networks generated by miRNA-targeted genes in qHSCs were associated with key HSCs activation processes. Next, selected miRNAs were validated in healthy and cirrhotic human livers and miR-192 was chosen for functional analysis. Down-regulation of miR-192 in HSC was found to be an early event during fibrosis progression in mouse models of liver injury. Moreover, mimic assays for miR-192 in HSCs revealed its role in HSC activation, proliferation and migration. Together, these results uncover the importance of miRNAs in the maintenance of qHSC phenotype and form the basis for understanding the regulatory networks in HSCs.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profile derived from four quiescent hepatic stellate (QHSC), four activated hepatic stellate (AHSC), three liver sinusoidal endothelial (LSEC) and two hepatocytes cells (HEP).
