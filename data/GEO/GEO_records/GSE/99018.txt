TITLE
Ileum Microarray Data from Transcriptomics Driven Lipidomics (TDL) identifies the microbiome-regulated targets of ileal lipid metabolism Study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microbiome regulation of lipid metabolism Germfree male C57BL/6J mice were purchased at 8 weeks of age from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France). Mice were treated with 10^8 CFU/mL E. coli M8 strain (isolated from the feces of an ob/ob mouse) in drinking water for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, mice were subjected to an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT) (with 6ml/kg of corn oil) after overnight fasting (14h). All mice were sacrificed 6 hours after the lipid tolerance test and ileum samples were collected for further analysis.

DESIGN
In order to identify key pathways involved in microbiome regulation of lipid metabolism we took advantage of gnotobiotic preclinical models and an E. coli strain isolated from an obesity mouse model (Ob/Ob).
