TITLE
Mechanisms of PU.1 binding site selection in-vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The majority of sequence-specific transcription factors bind genomic DNA only at a fraction of their potential binding sites and the ‘rules’ for binding or not-binding are only partially understood. Here, we studied the binding properties of the myeloid and B-cell specific transcription factor PU.1 in-vivo and in-vitro to unveil basic features of occupied vs. non-occupied consensus sites. In addition to published PU.1 ChIP-seq data we mapped CTCF binding sites in monocytes and macrophages to determine chromatin domain boundaries and performed MCIp-seq in monocytes to reveal DNA methylation patterns across the genome.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of CTCF in human monocytes and human monocyte-derived macrophages as well as MCIp-seq in human monocytes
