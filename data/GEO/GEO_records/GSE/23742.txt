TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Mus sp.

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to examine which genes are differentially expressed in mice that received a combination of fish oil and indomethacin.

DESIGN
We fed low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (LDLR-/-) mice with 6% of olive oil (control) or fish oil diets in the presence or absence of indomethacin for 12 weeks. We collected total RNA from liver samples and pooled 6 RNA samples in each group for Affymetrix microarrays.
