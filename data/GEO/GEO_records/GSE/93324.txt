TITLE
RNA-seq on developing mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to compehensively determine long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed in the mouse heart, we conducted RNA-seq on heart ventricles at three stages. We found that although lncRNAs are generally at a distance from protein-coding genes, cardiac transcription factor genes have lncRNAs in their proximity. Detailed examination revealed that many of these ln cRNAs were transcribed from the neighboring genes' promoter in a head-to-head divergent manner.

DESIGN
Paired-end RNA-seq on mouse heart ventricles. One sample for each stage.
