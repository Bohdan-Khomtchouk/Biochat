TITLE
Conditional knockout of p300 and Cbp in mouse rod photoreceptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ep300 and/or CrebBP were conditionally knocked out in differentiating mouse rod photoreceptors using opsin-driven Cre recombinase to elucidate the role of these transcription coactivators in photoreceptor gene expression regulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from retinas of 3 male and 3 female P14 mice of each genotype.  Each microarray sample contained pooled RNA from a male and female littermate of the same genotype, to control for any sex-related differences; three samples of each genotype were tested.  There were three control (C57Bl/6, RCre+, and cre neg dbl Fl/Fl) and 5 test genotypes (p300KO, CbpKO, p300 CH, Cbp CH, R-DCKO).
