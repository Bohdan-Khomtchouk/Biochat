TITLE
Transcriptome profiling from roots of jatropha in response to waterlogging

ORGANISM
Jatropha curcas

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis by high-throughtput RNA-sequencing from roots of waterlogged jatropha (Jatropha curcas). Six leaf stage seedlings (~30 d.o.) were subjected to 24 h of soil waterlogging.

DESIGN
4 samples, 2 conditions  (24 h nonstress and 24 h waterlogging stress) and 2 independent biological replicates of 2 mRNA pools

PLATFORM
