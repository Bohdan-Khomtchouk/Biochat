TITLE
Transcriptome data from human malanoma A375 cells stably expressing MAP4K5 shRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MAP4K5 is serine/threonine protein kinase similar to yeast SPS1/STE20 kinase. MAP4K5 activates JNK in mammalian cells, which suggests a role in stress response. MAP4K5 is involved in immune functions. We used microarray to investigate genome-wide transcriptional change from MAP4K5 knockdown in A375 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA's from the A375 cells where MAP4K5 was stably knocked down by shRNA were analyzed.  As a control, RNA's from A375 cells were also analyzed.
