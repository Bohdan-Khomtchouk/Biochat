TITLE
Plasma miRNA profile as a predictor for early virological response of  interferon treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To find novel circulating markers associated with prognosis of interferon therapy,We performed microarray analysis of plasma samples in 94 chronic hepatitis B patients

DESIGN
Ninety four HBV patients, who underwent PEG-IFN or conventional interferon treatment were enrolled. Their plasma samples before treatment were collected and subject to miRNA  array analysis. miRNA profiles from 13 formalin fixed formaldehyde embedded liver biopsy samples were also analyzed to evaluate the correlation between liver and plasma.
