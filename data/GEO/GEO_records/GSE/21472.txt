TITLE
Expression profile of TTHA1359-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to find function of TTHA1359 protein from T. thermophilus HB8, we observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the sdrP-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70Â°C for 300, 480, and 600 min.
