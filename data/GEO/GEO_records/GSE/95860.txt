TITLE
Expression data from fresh human embryonic lung epithelial tip and stalk cells and cultured organoids derived from tip and stalk.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We isolated the tip and stalk progenitors from four individual human embryonic lungs and used mRNAseq to profile their transcriptome. Tips and stalks from other individuals were subsequently cultured as organoids and their transcriptome profiled by mRNAseq in a separate sequencing run.

DESIGN
Lung epithelial tip and stalk cells were microdissected before being lysed for RNA extraction. Organoids were removed from Matrigel prior to lysis.
