TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse CD34(-)KSL hematopoietic stem cells and CD34(+)KSL multipotent progenitors were purified by cell sorting from bone marrow of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice, and their gene expression was analyzed.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of CD34(-)KSL hematopoietic stem cells and CD34(+)KSL multipotent progenitors were analyzed using a Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix).
