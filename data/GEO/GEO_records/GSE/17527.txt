TITLE
Genomic expression comparison between WT and H2B(K123R)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The study aims to elucidate the effect of mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B at K123.

DESIGN
The WT and H2B(K123R) yeast in early stationary phase were inoculated in fresh YPD rich media at OD 0.3.  The cells were then grown to OD2.0 and their total RNA was isolated for genomic expression profiling with S98 arrays (Affymetrix).  The experiments were performed in triplicate.
