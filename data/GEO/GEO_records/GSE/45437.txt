TITLE
Expression data from paediatric ependymoma short-term cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing is a common epigenetic mechanism of tumour suppressor inactivation in cancer, including malignant brain tumours. To identify targets of epigenetic silencing mediated by CpG island methylation in paediatric ependymoma, we used a pharmacological unmasking approach through treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine followed by global expression microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Three short-term ependymoma cell cultures were used for whole genome expression analysis following treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-dC (5 µmol/L) or mock-treated with DMSO (≤0.1% v/v) for 96-hrs.
