TITLE
Prostate cancer cell line with slienceing of PDEF or control (GFP) gene using siRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PDEF(Prostate Derived Ets factor) is a member of Ets transcription factor with specific expression in Prostate. We identified target genes for PDEF in prostate cancer cell line PC-3 using Affymetrix Genechip Microarray technology. Keywords: target gene identification for transcription factor

DESIGN
Stable cell lines were generated by infecting with Lentivirus contained silence RNA for PDEF and control GFP in PC-3 cells. 48 h after infection, total RNA was isolated from those samples.

PLATFORM
GPL4685 [U133AAofAv2] Affymetrix GeneChip HT-HG_U133A Early Access Array
