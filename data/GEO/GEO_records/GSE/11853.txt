TITLE
Porcine placenta, Erhualian pigs and Large White pigs, gestation day 75 and 90

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
From gestation day 75 to gestation day 90, an important stage for the placental and fetal development, the fetuses grow rapidly and need adequate nutrition. The Meishan pigs and the Large White pigs employ different ways in supplying the enough nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. The Meishan pigs increased the vascular density and the Large White pigs have the second increase in the surface of placenta. To understand the molecular basis related to late gestation placenta development in Chinese indigenous and Western breeds with different placental efficiency, samples were collected and used to hybridized. The results offered new data on understanding the molecular basis of placenta efficiency, and indicated that Erhualian pigs had the more  efficient than the Large White pigs.

DESIGN
Placenta efficiency (the body weight of a piglet divided by the mass of its placenta) of Erhualian pigs is markedly higher than Large White pigs. so placenta samples (female) from 6 Erhuanlian pregnant gilts at gestation day 75 (E75) and day 90 (E90) and 6 Large White pregnant gilts at gestation day 75 (L75) and day 90 (L90) were collected. RNAs from two female piglet placentas from each gilt were combined to 12 pools and hybridized to the porcine Affymetrix GeneChip.
