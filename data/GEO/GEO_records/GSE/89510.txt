TITLE
Analysis of CAL165 cells transcriptome using RNASeq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA extracted from the head and neck cell line CAL165 were purified using miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen). RNA libraries were then generated with the NEB next small library prep set for SOLID (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 5500 wildfire system following the manufacturer's instructions.

DESIGN
1 sample of CAL165
