SUMMARY
Natural variation in gene expression among healthy human individuals has been largely unexplored. In order to understand the genetic basis of variation in gene expression between normal human individuals, we need to obtain genome-wide expression data from various populations. Studies in monozygotic twins could enable us to estimate the size of the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the natural variation in gene expression. In this work, we report the gene expression analysis of 5 pairs of monozygotic twins and 3 unrelated individuals Normal healthy twin pairs were recruited for the study. Three more normal individuals including two females and one male were recruited. First, labeled products were hybridized with the Affymetrix GeneChip Test3 arrays. If the results were judged satisfactory, hybridization was subsequently carried out with the HG U95A arrays as per manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were hybridized at 45Â°C for 16 hours. The array was then washed using an automated Gene Chip Fluidics Station 400. After washing, the array was stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and scanned with a HP Gene Array Scanner. The data was analyzed using Gene Chip Software for expression analysis (MAS 5). All Gene Chip experiments were performed at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. Following comparisons were carried out: 1.	Between female identical twin pair (GSM14480 and GSM14481; GSM29053 and GSM 29054; GSM 29055 and GSM 29056) 2.	Between male identical twin pair (GSM14478 and GSM14479; GSM 29057 and GSM 29058) 3.	Between unrelated female individuals (include GSM14483, GSM20645 also but exclude comparisons within same twin pairs) 4.	Between unrelated male individuals (include GSM14477 but exclude comparisons between same twin pairs) Keywords: repeat sample
