TITLE
DNA methylation profiles across different brain regions in healthy mice (control samples)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and disease samples from different mice models. A custom Illumina Golden Gate DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 800 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 7 control samples were hybridised to the Illumina custom golden gate DNA methylation array.

PLATFORM
GPL16354 Custom Illumina GoldenGate DNA methylation Beadchip
