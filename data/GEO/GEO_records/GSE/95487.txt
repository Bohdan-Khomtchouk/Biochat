TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD45+CD3-CD11b+MHCII+ subsets in P5 (day 5 after birth) and 1.5M (1.5 months after birth) mouse epidermal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary Langerhans cells (LCs) network in the mouse skin epidermis is established within a week after birth by differentiation of skin-seeded embryonic LC precursors into mature LCs. Through binding to distinct receptors, two members of the TGFβ superfamily, BMP7 and TGFβ1, initiate cellular signaling essential for inducing LCs differentiation and for preserving LCs in a quiescent state, respectively. However, how these two processes are regulated remains elusive. Here we show that loss of Cbfβ2, one of two RNA splice variants of the Cbfb gene, results in long-term persistence of embryonic-derived immature LCs after their developmental arrest at the transition into the EpCAM+ stage. This phenotype is caused by selective loss of TGFβ receptor signaling, essential for LCs differentiation with intact signaling, which maintains the quiescent state. Interestingly, skin residential Cbfβ2-defcient LC precursors could differentiate further upon transgenic Cbfβ2 expression, but only around postnatal period and not when it was expressed in one month old mice. Loss of developmental potency in the precursor cells was accompanied by diminished BMP7-BMPR1A signaling. Collectively, our results reveal an essential and selective requirement for the Cbfβ2 variant in LC differentiation, and provide a novel insight into how establishment and homeostasis of the LCs network is regulated.

DESIGN
Examination of wild type and Cbfβ2 knock out at P5 (day 5 after birth) and 1.5M (1.5 months after birth).
