TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of melanoma samples to deduce microRNA expression profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report results on microRNA profiles revealing the distribution of " isomirs " of microRNA in a cancerous state. Deep sequencing was conducted at Stanford University and data analysis was conducted at the University of Connecticut Health Center.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiling to deduce differential microRNA expression levels along various stages of melanoma. Deep sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archived tissue samples, fresh frozen samples from melanomas, and cell lines.
