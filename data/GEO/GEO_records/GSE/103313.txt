Transcriptome profiling of individual rhesus macaque oocytes and preimplantation embryos

SUMMARY
Early mammalian embryonic transcriptomes are dynamic throughout the process of preimplantation development. Cataloging of primate transcriptomics during early development has been accomplished in humans, but global characterization of transcripts is lacking in the rhesus macaque: a key model for human reproductive processes. We report here the systematic classification of individual macaque transcriptomes using RNA-Seq technology from the germinal vesicle stage oocyte through the blastocyst stage embryo. Major differences in gene expression were found between sequential stages, with the 4- to 8-cell stages showing the highest level of differential gene expression. Analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites also revealed a striking increase in key regulatory factors in 8-cell embryos, indicating a strong likelihood of embryonic genome activation occurring at this stage. Furthermore, clustering analyses of gene co-expression throughout this period resulted in distinct groups of transcripts significantly associated to the different embryo stages assayed. The sequence data provided here along with characterizations of major regulatory transcript groups presents a comprehensive atlas of polyadenylated transcripts that serves as a useful resource for comparative studies of preimplantation development in humans and other species.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis in single oocytes/embryos at different stages of development including 2-3 replicates per stage.
