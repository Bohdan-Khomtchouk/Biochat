TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of E15.5 pancreas of both whole body Nkx2.2 mutant embryos and endocrine progenitor specific Nkx2.2 mutant embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim: Transcriptional analysis of E15.5 whole pancreas of Nkx2.2-LacZ/LacZ embryos versus control and Ngn3-Cre; Nkx2.2-flox/flox embryos versus control Methods: Embryonic pancreata were isolated at E15.5 from Nkx2.2 mutant mice and controls. Total RNA was extracted. Libraries were prepared from total RNA (RIN > 8) with the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument. More than 20 million reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC/mm9) using Tophat (version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. Significantly differentially expressed genes were calculated using DEseq. Results: There is significant overlap between the differentially expressed genes of whole body Nkx2.2 mutant embryos and endocrine progenitor specific Nkx2.2 mutant embryos; many of the downregulated genes (p-value < 0.05) are genes involved in beta cell function. Conclusion: Nkx2.2 functions within the endocrine progenitor lineage to activate beta cell genes

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of whole embryonic pancreata of E15.5 Nkx2.2 mutant and control embryos were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
