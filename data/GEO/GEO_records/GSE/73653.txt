TITLE
Polysome-seq of YBX heterozygous testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequence analysis of mRNP and polysome occupancy in single and compound Ybx2/3 heterozygotes revealed loss of translational repression almost exclusively in the compound Ybx2/3 heterozygotes.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of total RNA, the mRNP, and polysome fractions from wildtype, single YBX heterozygous, and compound YBX heterozygous adult testes

PLATFORM
