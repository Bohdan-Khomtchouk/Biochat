TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving subcutaneous Interferon-beta-1b therapy [U133 A and B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the transcriptional effects induced by subcutaneous IFN-beta-1b treatment (Betaferon, 250 Âµg every other day) in patients with relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). By using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we obtained genome-wide expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 25 MS patients within the first two years of IFN-beta administration.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were drawn from all patients immediately before first, second, month 1, 12, and 24 IFN-beta injection. Total RNA of Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 A and B arrays to quantify the mRNA levels.
