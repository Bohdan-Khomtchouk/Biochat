TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving subcutaneous Interferon-beta-1b therapy [U133 A and B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the transcriptional effects induced by subcutaneous IFN-beta-1b treatment (Betaferon, 250 Âµg every other day) in patients with relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). By using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we obtained genome-wide expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 25 MS patients within the first two years of IFN-beta administration.
