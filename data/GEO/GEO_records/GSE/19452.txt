TITLE
TSKMLO microarray validation experiment

ORGANISM
Meleagris gallopavo

SUMMARY
A 6K oligonucleotide microarray (TSKMLO) was designed as a community resource for researchers interested in domestic turkey muscle biology as it pertains to growth and development and their association with downstream meat quality. A series of quality control experiments performed to assess the functionality of the newly constructed array, which included a set of validation hybridizations performed in order to initially assess the functionality and repeatability of the newly designed TSKMLO array.  Strong correlations between these test comparisons confirmed that the array was able to hybridize fluorescently-labeled aRNA samples from turkey skeletal muscle at different developmental stages, that there was little dye bias, and that results were repeatable.
