TITLE
The effect of erstressin and nostressin on cytokine-induced A172 human glioblastoma cells in culture.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is induced by a range of environmental factors. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a synthetic small molecule, erstressin, which activates the UPR.  Erstressin induced rapid phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2a and the alternative splicing of XBP-1, hallmark initiating events of the UPR.  Further, erstressin activated the transcription of multiple genes involved in the UPR.   Coincident with these effects, erstressin also downregulated the transcription of the inflammation-associated enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cytokine-activated cells.  A close analog of erstressin that failed to induce the UPR did not attenuate expression of iNOS, suggesting that both biological effects of erstressin were mediated by a common mechanism.  Further, the structurally-distinct ER stressor thapsigargin also inhibited iNOS expression.  Together these chemical genetic studies reveal an unanticipated anti-inflammatory role for the UPR. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We utilized microarrays to understand the global effect of a novel compund, erstressin, on cytokine stimulated cells over time.
