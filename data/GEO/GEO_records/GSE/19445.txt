TITLE
LNCaP cells in response to DHT stimulation and inhibition/knockdown of TOPO2B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were carried out to ascertain whether TOP2β is required for DHT induced androgen receptor target gene expression. We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition or RNA interference-mediated depletion of TOP2β on gene expression in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells.
