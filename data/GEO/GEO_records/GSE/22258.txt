TITLE
72hr Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoite induction

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Two samples, 0hr and 72hr, were used to generate tachyzoite and bradyzoite transcriptional data from tissue-cultured Toxoplasma gondii strain Prugniaud, respectively.

DESIGN
Samples are single replicates, and a subset of a larger timeseries.  Non-control sample was exposed to alkaline conditions, media pH 8.2, for 72hr.

PLATFORM
