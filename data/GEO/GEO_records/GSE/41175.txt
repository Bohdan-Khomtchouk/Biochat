TITLE
Dissecting the Molecular Relationship Between Cardiac And Bone Marrow-Derived Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Baseline gene expression of mouse Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPC) We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression of mouse CPCs.

DESIGN
Compare the gloable gene expression of mouse CPCs and Cardiomyocytes. Although the chip is two color, we only used Cy5 as the data channel.
