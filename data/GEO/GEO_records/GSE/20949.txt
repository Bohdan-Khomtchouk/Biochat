TITLE
Gene expression in mice brain after ciguatoxin exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the global transcriptional response in mouse brain to a symptomatic dose (0.26 ng/g) of the highly toxic Pacific ciguatoxin P-CTX-1 at 1, 4 and 24 hrs using whole genome microarrays

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, ciguatoxin treated vs vehicle treated mice. 9 Biological replicates: 9 control replicates, pooled into 3 control time points.
