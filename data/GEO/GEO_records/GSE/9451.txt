TITLE
Identification of Signature Molecule-Marked Native Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background. The in vivo distribution status and molecular signature of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) remain unknown, although ex vivo expanded MSC have been used in numerous studies. Methods/Results. To address these issues, we identified human MSC-characteristic genes, including 9 transcription factor genes - using DNA microarray analysis: Most (75 %) of the MSC-characteristic genes were down-regulated by knockdown of the transcription factors. Furthermore, we used an antibody set for the MSC-characteristic molecules in immunohistochemistry, which revealed that, in embryonic/neonatal mice, elongated MSC were abundant near the endosteum and in the interior of bone marrow, perichondrium and periosteum, whereas in adult mice round/compact MSC were found only in the interior of bone marrow: No MSC-like cells were found in any other skeletal or non-skeletal tissues using this antibody set. Conclusion. The identification of native MSC in developing and adult skeletal tissues should be useful in basic and clinical studies on MSC. Keywords: cell type comparison
