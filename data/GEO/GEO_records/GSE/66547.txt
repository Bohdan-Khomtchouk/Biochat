TITLE
RNA-seq of Maternal Kdm1a mutant 2C embryos and eggs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
2C embryos were generated from Kdm1a FL/Fl Zp3Cre females mated to wild type males for RNA-seq analysis using the Nugen Ovation RNA-seq system V2. Ovulated eggs from Kdm1a FL/Fl Zp3Cre females were isolated for RNA-seq analysis using the Nugen Ovation RNA-seq system V2.

DESIGN
3 replicates of maternal Kdm1a mutant 2C embryos and eggs were collected for RNA-seq, compared to wt 2C embryos and wt oocyte samples from Macfarlan TS et al,  Nature 2012 (GEO acession GSE33923)
