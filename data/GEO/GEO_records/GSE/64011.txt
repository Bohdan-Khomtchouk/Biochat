TITLE
Comparison of miRNA profiles of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia with normal PBSC CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We isolated the CD34+ cells from bone marrow samples of CML patients and mobilized peripheral blood of healthy donors. The miRNA expression profiles were assayed by using the Agilent microarrays and compared.

DESIGN
The mononuclear cells of both CML Bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood from healthy donors will be isolated. Furthermore, the CD34+ cells populations ( > 95% CD34+ cells) will be purified by microBeads kit from Miltenyi Biotec. We will extract the total RNAs including miRNAs  by using the miRNeasy Mini Kit. These samples will be labeled and assayed for miRNA profiles using the G4470B human miRNA microarray 8x15K version 2. The differences of microRNA profiles will be compared.
