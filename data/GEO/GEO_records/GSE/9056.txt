TITLE
Host genome surveillance for retrotransposons by transposon-derived proteins

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analyses of Abp1 and Cbh1 across the S. pombe genome. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA recovered with antibody against FLAG-tagged protein from wild-type asynchronous growing fission yeast cells and whole cell extracts DNA were amplified by random priming and respectively labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. Labeled DNA samples were mixed and hybridized onto a 44k pombe Agilent oligo array. Data were processed using Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software

PLATFORM
GPL4682 pombe 44K_v2
