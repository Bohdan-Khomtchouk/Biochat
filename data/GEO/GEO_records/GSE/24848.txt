TITLE
Aspergillus niger WT: Control vs. xylan induction

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the A. niger WT (N402) strain treated with xylan (1%, w/v) for 6, 12 and 24 h. The main objective was to identify genes related to cellulases and hemicellulases after treatment with the polysaccharide xylan. The experiment was further validated by enzymatic assays.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: WT-Xylan for 6, 12 and 24 h at 30oC in batch culture. Firstly, the WT (N402) strain was grown in minimal medium with fructose as carbon source (control), and then transferred to 1% (w/v) xylan as carbon source. 2 biological replicates per time point.
