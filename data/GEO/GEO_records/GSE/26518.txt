TITLE
Temperature dependent gene expression levels at  28°C and 37°C for rhizophere Rhizosphere Originating Biocontrol Strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa M18

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas sp. M18

SUMMARY
To further understand the gene expression characteristics of originating biocontrol strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa M18, we have applied whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to to specify the temperature dependent expression of M18 genome at rhizosphere and human body temperature. We selected 28°C as temperature representative of the rhizosphere niches and 37°C for human body. The results from the temperature dependent transcriptome analysis are consistent to our previous published data that the phzM, ptsP and lasI genes expression is upregulated at 37°C. The comparison analysis of the M18 genome expressional profiles at 28°C and 37°C indicated a total of 605 gene expressed in a temperature dependent manner over about two fold at 28°C compared that at 37°C, covering 10.6% genes in M18 whole genome.
