TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison of fructose and lipid grown cultures of Ralstonia eutropha H16

ORGANISM
Cupriavidus necator

SUMMARY
Whole genome gene expression analysis was examined with Ralstonia eutropha strain H16 cultures grown in PHB production medium (recipe per Peoples and Sinskey, 1989) containing fructose or trioleate as the main carbon source.  The goal of this analysis was to determine the identity of the triacylglycerol and fatty acid breakdown genes in R. eutropha strain H16.
