TITLE
Liver gene expression profiling of complement component 3a receptor 1 knockout (C3ar1-/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Complement component 3a receptor 1 (C3ar1) was predicted as a causal gene for abdominal using a novel statistical method named LCMS (Schadt et al., 2005, Nature Genetics). In order to validate this prediction, we profiled the liver tissues of complement component 3a receptor 1 knockout (C3ar1-/-) mice and their littermate wild-type (wt) controls to examine the gene expression signature as well as pathways/networks resulting from the single gene perturbation.
