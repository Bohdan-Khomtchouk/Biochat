TITLE
ER alpha rapid signaling is required for estrogen induced proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) is required for the protective effects of 17-beta-estradiol (E2, the active, endogenous form of estrogen) after vascular injury or in atherosclerosis. E2-bound ERa can function as a transcription factor which binds directly to chromatin (the genomic pathway). Some ERa is also associated with the plasma membrane and, when bound by E2, activates cellular kinases, including PI3K, Akt and ERK (the rapid signaling pathway). Rapid signaling is mediated by interaction between ERa and the adaptor molecule striatin. Here we identify a triple point mutation (AA 231,233 & 234 KRR- > AAA) of full length ERa that blocks its association with striatin and eliminates its ability to perform rapid signaling (without affecting its ability to perform genomic signaling). We have created stably-transfected human vascular endothelial cell lines expressing either WT ERa (WT ECs) or KRR mutant ERa (KRR ECs), and use these cells to show that rapid signaling through ERa is required for the proper regulation of most E2-regulated genes (the data presented in this record), and also for the ability of E2 to stimulate EC migration and proliferation and to inhibit inflammatory monocyte adhesion to ECs.

DESIGN
Human Eahy 926 stable cell lines carrying a full length wild-type human estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) expression vector (WT ECs) or a full length KRR mutant ERa expression vector (KRR ECs, where the KRR mutant ERa is deficient in rapid signaling) were treated with or without 17-b-estradiol (E2) for 16 hrs. RNA from 3 bioligical replicates per condition was harvested and used to probe Illumina bead arrays.
