TITLE
Linking Transcriptomic Organization to the Regulatory Landscape of Cyanobacteria through Context-Based Network Analysis

ORGANISM
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002

SUMMARY
Construction of a global gene co-expression network to determine gene relatedness and expand regulatory pathways in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus 7002.

DESIGN
These 5 conditions represent part of a data set of RNA-seq conditions that were examined with the Context-Liklihood of Relatedness (CLR) program to generate a gene co-expression network.  Network structure was used group genes by transcriptomic context and thus function and link regulators with putative targets
