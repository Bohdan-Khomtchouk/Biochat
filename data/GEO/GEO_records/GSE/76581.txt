TITLE
siRNA knockdown of GATA3 or HIF-1α in OEC-M1 cells under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the GATA3 or HIF-1α regulated gene expression profile  in OEC-M1 cells under hypoxia

DESIGN
OEC-M1 cells were transfected with non-targeting or GATA3 or HIF-1α specific siRNAs for 72 hours and total RNA were extracted
