TITLE
EBV Modulates Host Cell microRNA-194 to Promote IL-10 Production and B Lymphoma Cell Survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of EBV infection on host cell miR and to characterize the miRNome in EBV+ B cell lymphomas from patients with PTLD. A qPCR array was used to measure the expression level of 377 previously identified miRs from RNA isolated from three sources: total B cells isolated from healthy individuals (n=4), lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) generated by transformation of normal B cell with the B95-8 lab strain of EBV (n=4) and EBV+ B cell lines isolated from patients with PTLD (n=6).

DESIGN
miRNA expression was assayed in total B cells samples (n = 4, in duplicate), in lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 4, in duplicate) and in spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from PTLD patients with EBV+ B cell lymphomas (n = 6 in duplicate). The expression of miRNA in the B cell samples was used as a control.
