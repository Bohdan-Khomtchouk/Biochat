TITLE
Expression data of wild-type C. elegans shifted from 23 degrees to 17 degrees

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
C. elegans exhibits thermotaxis, where most of the animals that had been cultivated at a particular temperature ranging from 15째C to 25째C for a few hours with a food source and then placed on a thermal gradient for an hour migrate to the cultivation temperature. In addition, animals that were previously conditioned to migrate to a certain temperature are capable of migrating to a new cultivation temperature a few hours after the cultivation temperature was shifted to the new temperature To gain the detailed molecular insight into thermotactic behavior, the genome-wide microarray analysis during behavioral conditioning was performed. We compared the transcriptional profile of animals conditioned to migrate to the new temperature 17째C with that of animals conditioned to migrate to the previous temperature 23째C

DESIGN
Synchronized adult wild-type animals cultivated at 23 degrees were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
