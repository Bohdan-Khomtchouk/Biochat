TITLE
Effect of long-term vitamin D supplementation on colonic gene expression in IL-10 Knockout mice at young adulthood

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Low vitamin D status has been implicated in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study used interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice, that develop an intestinal inflammation when housed in a non-sterile environment, to determine if supplementation with vitamin D throughout life impacts colonic gene expression. Results provide important information on the intestinal response to vitamin D in inflamed mice.

DESIGN
Female IL-10 knock out mice were randomized to 25 (Low, L) or 5000 (High, H) IU vitamin D/kg of diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, offspring received the same or opposite diet as their mother until age 3 months. This resulted in four vitamin D interventions: HH, HL, LH, or LL where the first letter represents the diet consumed by dams during pregnancy and lactation and the second letter represents the diet consumed by offspring from weaning through to 3 months of age. Global gene expression was analyzed in the proximal colon of 3 months old mice (n=6 per group, for a total of 24 samples; samples came from different litters and moms IDs are given in the samples table below). Samples were stored at -80C.
