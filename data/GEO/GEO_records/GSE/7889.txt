TITLE
High throughput mapping of origins of replicationand histone H3 actylation in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mapping origins of replication has been challenging in higher eukaryotes. We have developed a rapid, genome-wide method to map origins in asynchronous human cells by combining the nascent strand abundance assay with a highly-tiled microarray platform, and we validated the technique by two independent assays.  We applied this method to analyze the enrichment of nascent DNA in three 50 kb regions containing known origins of replication in the MYC, LMNB2, and HBB genes, a 200 kb region containing the rare fragile site, FRAXA, and a 1075 kb region on chromosome 22, and detected most of the known origins, as well as 28 new origins.  Surprisingly, the 28 new origins were small in size, and predominantly located within genes.  Our study also revealed a strong correlation between origin replication timing and chromatin acetylation.
