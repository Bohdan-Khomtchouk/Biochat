TITLE
The effect on lincRNA expression by p53 family members.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect on lincRNA expression by p53 family members, we overexpressed p53 family members in H1299 cells and evaluated the lincRNA expression by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
lincRNA expression was measured in H1299 cells infected with adenovirus expressing LacZ, p53, p63a, p63g, p73a and p73b.
