TITLE
Identification of genes involved in cell death induced by sodium fluoride in rat oral epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Although an appropriate range of fluoride is thought to be safe and effective, excessive fluoride intake results in toxic effects in either hard tissues of teeth and skeleton or soft tissues of kidney, lung and brain. It is also well known that fluoride at a millimolar range elicits the complex cellular responses such as enzyme activity, signal transduction and apoptosis in many kinds of cells. However, its toxic effects are still unclear. In this study, to identify genes involved in cell death induced by sodium fluoride (NaF) in rat oral epithelial ROE2 cells, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
NaF (2 mM) significantly induced apoptosis accompaning chromatin condensation and caspase-3 activation. Total RNA samples were prepared from the NaF-treated cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was monitored by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Rat Genome 230 2.0  array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
