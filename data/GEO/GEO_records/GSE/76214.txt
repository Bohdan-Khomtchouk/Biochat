TITLE
Effect of high-sugar feeding on wandering third instar larval fat body gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression in the Drosophila fat body on control and high-sugar diets in order to gain insight into the role of this organ during caloric overload. Differential expression analysis revealed changes in gene expression suggestive of a role for CoA metabolism in the ability to tolerate high-sugar feeding. This led us to perform biochemical and mutant studies supporting a model where CoA is limiting in the face of caloric overload.

DESIGN
Wild-type Drosophila were reared on control (0.15M sucrose) and high-sugar (0.7M sucrose) diets until the wandering stage. Fat bodies were isolated and RNA extracted to determine the effects of diet on gene expression using Illumina RNA-seq.
