TITLE
Innate and adaptive lymphocytes sequentially shape the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In support of our manuscript investigating the roles of ILCs and T cells the in maintenance of gut hoemostasis, we have performed RNAseq on terminal illeum of mice lacking either all adaptive immune cells (RAG1 -/-), deficient in T cells (TCRalpha -/-), or deficient in T cells but co-housed with wild-type mice and RAG1 -/- mice.

DESIGN
Tissues from three mice per group were analysed, and the following comparisions were made: RAG1-/- vs. WT C57BL/6 and TCRa-/- co-housed vs TCRa-/- seperately housed. Differential expression genes were identified at 1% FDR using DESeq2.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
