TITLE
Sexually dimorphic gene expression in the chick brain at stage 29

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Biological bases for sexual differences in the brain exist in a wide range of vertebrate species, including the chicken. We examined whether sexually dimorphic gene expression in the brain precedes gonadal differentiation. Using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Chicken Genome Array, we identified  many female- and male-enhanced genes that are differentially expressed in sex-specific brains from stage 29 chicken embryos.  We postulate that these genes have potential roles in the sexual differentiation of neural function and development in chickens.
