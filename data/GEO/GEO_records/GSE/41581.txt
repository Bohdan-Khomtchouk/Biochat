TITLE
Frequent truncating mutations of STAG2 in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the discovery of truncating mutations of the gene encoding the cohesin subunit STAG2, which regulates sister chromatid cohesion and segregation, in 36% of papillary non-invasive urothelial carcinomas and 16% of invasive urothelial carcinomas of the bladder. Our studies suggest that STAG2 has a role in controlling chromosome number but not the proliferation of bladder cancer cells. These findings identify STAG2 as one of the most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer. Affymetrix CytoScan HD Arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on genomic DNA extracted directly from 12 snap-frozen human urothelial carcinoma primary tumors with somatic mutations of the STAG2 gene.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis using Affymetrix CytoScan HD Arrays was performed for 12 human urothelial carcinomas of the bladder with truncating mutations of the STAG2 gene.
