TITLE
Epigenetic regulation of receptive human endometrium through microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as important epigenetic post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. We aimed to gain more understanding to the complex gene expression regulation of endometrial receptivity by analysing miRNA signature of fertile human endometrium.

DESIGN
We used Agilent miRNA arrays to define the miRNA expression pattern in receptive (LH+7, n = 3) vs. pre-receptive (LH < 7, n = 4) endometrium from healthy fertile women.
