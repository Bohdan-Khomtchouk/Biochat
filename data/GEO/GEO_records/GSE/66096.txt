TITLE
A dominant role for the methyl-CpG-binding protein Mbd2 in controlling Th2 induction by dendritic cells [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) direct CD4+ T cell differentiation into distinct T helper (Th) subsets that are vital for protection against diverse types of infection.  However, the mechanisms employed by DCs to initiate Th2 responses, which are important for immunity to helminth infection as well as being a major contributor to allergic disease, remain poorly understood.  We demonstrate a crucial role for methyl-CpG-binding domain-2 (Mbd2), a protein that links DNA methylation to repressive chromatin structure, in regulating DC gene expression and ability to promote Th2 immunity against either helminths or allergens.

DESIGN
RNAs were extracted from murine (C57BL/6) Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) samples.  Two groups of samples (three replicates each) were processed: (1) wild type, and (2) a homozygous knock-out of the Mbd2 locus.
