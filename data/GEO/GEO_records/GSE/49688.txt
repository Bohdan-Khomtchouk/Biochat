TITLE
Gene expression data from Dstncorn1 mutant, rescued and WT cornea after genetic ablation of Srf from the corneal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to characterize gene expression changes that occur when conditional knock-out of Srf rescues mutant phenotypes in the cornea of Dstncorn1 mice. This study uses a unique model combining genetic and genomic approaches to identify genes that are regulated by SRF.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were used for each of the three groups (mutant, rescued and WT). Each biological replicate consisted of 10 pooled corneas from five mice.
