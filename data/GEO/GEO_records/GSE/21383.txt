TITLE
Expression data from porcine ovary tissue of sows from two prolificacy levels

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Previous results from a genome scan in a F2 Iberian by Meishan intercross showed several chromosome regions associated with litter size traits. In order to identify candidate genes underlying these QTL we have performed an ovary gene expression analysis during pregnancy. F2 sows were ranked by their estimated breeding values for prolificacy, the six sows with higher EBV (HIGH prolificacy) and the six with lower EBV (LOW prolificacy) were selected. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix porcine expression microarrays. The statistical analysis with a mixed-model approach identified 221 differentially expressed probes, representing 189 genes. These genes were functionally annotated in order to identify the genetic pathways overrepresented. Among the most represented functional groups the first one was immune system response activation against external stimulus. The second group was made up of genes which regulate the maternal homeostasis by complement and coagulation cascades. The last group was involved on lipid and fatty acid enzymes of metabolic processes, which participate in steroidogenesis pathway. In order to identify powerful candidate genes for prolificacy, the second approach of this study was merging microarray data with position information of QTL affecting litter size, previously detected in the same experimental cross. According to this, we have identified 27 differentially expressed genes co-localized with QTL for litter size traits, which fulfill the biological, positional and functional criteria.

DESIGN
Twelve ovary samples: six high prolific sows and low prolific sows, slaughtered after 30 days of pregnancy. Each sample is the average between right and left ovary from each sow.
