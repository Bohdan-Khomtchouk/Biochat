TITLE
Global Bidirectional Transcription of the Epstein-Barr Virus Genome During Reactivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using strand specific RNA-seq to assess the EBV transcriptome during reactivation of Akata cells, we found extensive bidirectional transcription extending across nearly the entire genome.

DESIGN
Illumina strand-specific RNA-seq of BCR-activated Akata cells at 9 time points

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
