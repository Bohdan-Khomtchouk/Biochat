TITLE
Histone H2B K-

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Histone H2B was mutated to give H2B K6,11,16,17,21,22G.  Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H2B N-terminal acetylated lysine residues. Keywords: repeat
