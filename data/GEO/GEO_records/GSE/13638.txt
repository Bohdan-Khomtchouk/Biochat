TITLE
Ago2 or Dicer knockdown effects on mRNA levels in HeLa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA changes in HeLa cells following Ago2 or Dicer depletion. Dicer, a cytoplasmic RNase III, generates the mature form of small RNAs including microRNA. Ago2 is a component of an effector complex of microRNA. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)
