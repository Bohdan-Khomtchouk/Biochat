TITLE
Gene expression profile of  Dnmt1 flox/flox, Dnmt3a flox/flox, Dnmt3b flox/flox, cre negative (Wild type) and Dnmt1 flox/flox, Dnmt3a flox/flox, Dnmt3b flox/flox, Rx-cre (Triple mutant) murine retina transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to identify the gene expression profile of mouse retina which carries deletions in Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b genes. Method: Retinal mRNA profiles of Postnatal day 15 wild type mice and Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b mutant mice were generated by deep-sequencing

DESIGN
Retinal mRNA profiles of post natal day 15 wild type and mutant mice with Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
