TITLE
oct07-DNA methylation and small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs09-10_fwa - oct07. Impact of loss of DNA methylation and small interference RNAs (siRNAs) on gene expression. Mutants impaired for the DNA methylation maintenance pathway and for the RNA interference machinery were compared to mutants simultaneously impaired for both machineries to estimate their impact on genome activity.

DESIGN
8 dye-swaps. Gene knockout.

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
