TITLE
Brain-specific transcriptome analysis in MECP2 transgenic monkeys

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
We have performed gene expression profiling of the MECP2 transgenic monkey, taking advantage of recently completed genome sequencing for the cynomolgus monkey. We found interesting changes in the pattern of alternative splicing of many genes, including genes coding synaptic proteins (e.g., neurexin-3 and Shank-3) and metabolism-related proteins, as compared to the wild-type monkey. This study provides important information for understanding the impact of disease-related gene on brain development.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome in brain tissues of wild-type and MECP2 transgenic monkeys.
