TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of H1299 Cells from Tissue of 4D Model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed a 4D lung cancer model that forms perfusable tumor nodules. We determined if the model could be modified to mimic metastasis. We modified the 4D lung cancer model by seeding H1299 cells via the trachea only to the left lobes of the acellular lung matrix. The model was modified so that the tumor cells can reach the right lobes of the acellular lung matrix only through the pulmonary artery as circulating tumor cells (CTC). We determined the gene expressions of the primary tumor, CTCs, and metastatic lesions using the Human OneArray chip. All cell lines formed a primary tumor in the left lobe of the ex vivo 4D lung cancer model. The CTCs were identified in the media and increased over time. The CTC gene signature predicted poor survival in lung cancer patients. A unique set of genes were significantly expressed in CTC compared to the primary tumor and metastatic lesion.  The 4D lung cancer model can isolate tumor cells in three phases of tumor progression. This 4D lung cancer model may mimic the biology of lung cancer metastasis and may be used to determine its mechanism and potential therapy in the future.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profile (Human OneArray v6 chip) of primary tumor, CTCs, and metastatic tumors from the ex vivo (4D) model seeded with H1299 for different days.
