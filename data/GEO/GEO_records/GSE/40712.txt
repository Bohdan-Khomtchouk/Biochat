TITLE
Expression data from CD34+ hematopoietic cells transduced with control or anti-HCLS1 shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of HCLS1 mRNA in CD34+ hematopoietic cells resulted in a severe diminished in vitro myeloid differentiation which was in line with downregulation of a set of genes, e.g., of Wnt or PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. We performed microarrays to evaluate specific genes and signaling systems regulated by HCLS1 in hematopoietic cells.

DESIGN
CD34+ hematopoietic cells were isolated from the bone marrow of healthy individuals, transduced with lenitvirus-based RFP-expressed shRNA constructs targeting HCLS1 mRNA (two different shRNA constructs were used simultaneously) or scrambled control shRNA. After 4 days of the transductions, RFP+ cells were sorted, and total RNA of sorted cells was isolated and used for Affymetrix Exome arrays.
