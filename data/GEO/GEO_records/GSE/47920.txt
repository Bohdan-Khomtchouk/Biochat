TITLE
Expression data from T lymphocytes derived from T-iPS and peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T lymphocytes can be generated from T-cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (T-iPS). We used microarrays to better elucidate their phenotype and compare their gene expression profile to that of known lymhoid subsets from peripheral blood.

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from T-iPS-derived T cells at day 30-35 of differentiation and from sorted peripheral blood lymphoid subpopulations. Total RNA was amplified and labelled following the standard Affymetrix protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The labeled complementary RNA was then fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays HG-U133 plus 2.0.
