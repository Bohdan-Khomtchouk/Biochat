TITLE
aCGH data from SCEC and corresponding normal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary SCEC is a rare malignancy without established treatment strategy. Although previous studies suggested that there were similarities between SCEC and SCLC in clinical manifestation and pathological morphology, genetic studies on this highly malignant tumour remains sparse. This study was designed to investigate the copy number variations (CNVs) of SCEC.

DESIGN
SCEC vs.corresponding normal samples. Biological replicates: 3 SCEC replicates, 3 control replicates.
