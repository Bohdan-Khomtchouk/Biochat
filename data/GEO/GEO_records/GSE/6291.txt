TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (Affy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compare the transcriptome of two different clones of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) using Affymetrix arrays. Keywords: mRNA expression profiling, oligonucleotide microarrays, stem cells

DESIGN
Three mRNA samples (biological replicates) per cell type taken at different passage number were compared. Two independently isolated MAPC clones were used.
