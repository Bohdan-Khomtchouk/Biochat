TITLE
Rapid functional annotation of native enhancers in embryonic stem cells with a Neisseria meningitidis CRISPR-Cas9 system (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene regulatory elements such as enhancers have profound effects on cellular function, health, and disease. Our understanding of mammalian enhancer function is limited by the lack of a technology that would allow for a rapid and thorough test of their cell type-specific function. Here, we describe a novel Cas9-effector system that enables rapid testing and functional annotation of native enhancers in embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from R26 dCas9-effector mESC lines after viral delivery of sgRNAs directed against proximal promoter or enhancer regions

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
