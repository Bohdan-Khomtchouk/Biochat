TITLE
Gene expression profiles after infection of zebrafish with Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We describe here transcripts induced after infection of zebrafish with Spring Viremia Carp Virus (SVCV). Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related zebrafish genes were studied in internal organs (pooled spleen, head kidney). Also, transcripts from resistant fishes to viral infection one month after inoculation were studied.

DESIGN
Three different experiments were performed to get three biological replicates. Fishes were divided into two groups in each experiment. First group was infected by immersion with SVCV 10^7 pfu/ml, second group was used as a control of non-infected fishes. 6 fishes per group were sacrificed two days post infection, whereas the rest of the infected fishes from the three experiments were maintained for 30 days in the aquariums and then survivors (six for experiment) were sacrificed. This submission includes three biological replicate groups for the non-infected fish and the two days post-infected fish, and two biological replicate groups for the 30 days post-infected fish.
