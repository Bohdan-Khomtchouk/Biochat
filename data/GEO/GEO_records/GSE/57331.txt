TITLE
Chromosome copy number changes in Mps1DK-driven p53 null T-ALL samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mps1DK and p53 loss were combined in T-cells specificely leading to early onset and highly aggressive aneuploid T-ALL. Tumors were characterized for (recurrrent) copy number changes with a focus on whole chromosome abnormalities. DNA content was compared to the DNA content of sex-matched uninfiltrated control liver samples from litter mates

DESIGN
27 Mps1DK p53f/f of Mps1DK p53f/+ tumors and 5 p53 f/f control tumors

PLATFORM
GPL4092 Agilent-014695 Mouse Genome CGH Microarray 244A (G4415A) (Feature Number version)
