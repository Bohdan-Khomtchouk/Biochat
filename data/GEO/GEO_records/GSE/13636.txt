TITLE
Analyses of cyclin D1 function using a " genetic-proteomic " approach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptional function of cyclin D1 in mouse development using two approaches. First, we queried association of cyclin D1 with the genome of E14.5 mouse embryos using ChIP-on-chip approach.  We observed binding of cyclin D1 to several promoter regions.  Second, we compared gene expression profiles between wild-type and cyclin D1-null retinas. We observed several transcripts with altered levels in cyclin D1-null organs. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
