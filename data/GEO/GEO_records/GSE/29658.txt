TITLE
The transcriptional repressor Blimp1/Prdm1 regulates post-natal reprogramming of intestinal enterocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Prdm1 mutant E18.5 small intestine was performed using Illumina whole genome V2 arrays. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Blimp1 regulates the transcription of key genes involved in enterocyte differentiation and survival. Results identify substantial and premature activation of key components of the adult enterocyte biochemical signature.

DESIGN
Villin-Cre and Prdm1BEH/+ animals were intercrossed to generate heterozygous Villin-Cre, Prdm1BEH males that were then mated with homozygous Prdm1 CA/CA females carrying the R26R allele to generate Prdm1+/+ (Prdm1CA/+) or Prdm1-/- (Villin-Cre, Prdm1CA/BEH) offspring. Total RNA obtained from 11 Prdm1+/+ and 10 Prdm1-/- E18.5 small intestine samples was hybridized to Illumina WG6_V2 beadchips.
