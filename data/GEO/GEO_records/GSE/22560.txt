TITLE
Comparison of the expression data between vacant vector and SPRR2a expressing cell of cholagiocarcinoma cell lines SG231 and HuCCT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small proline rich protein (SPRR) 2a is one of the 14 SPRR family member genes which are coded in the region of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC).  SPRR2 genes are  coordinately expressed with other EDC genes and function primarily as cross-linking proteins which confer structural integrity to the cornified cell envelope.  More recently, SPRR2a was associated with functions independent of the EDC.  Non-coordinate up-regulation of SPRR2a is seen  during  stress/injury induced remodeling of barrier epithelia and during  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Forced SPRR2a expression in a cholangiocarcinoma cell line (SG231) down-regulates the epithelial cell adherens molecule E-cadherin and upregulates mesenchymal components, such as vimentin and fibronectin. Thus, we sought to identify which genes were commonly involved in SPRR2a induced EMT by cDNA microarray analysis using SG231 and HuCCT-1 SPRR2a stable transfectants.

DESIGN
SPRR2a expressing stable cell lines of SG231 and HuCCT1 and their control cell lines were selected  for  Affymetrix microarrays.
