TITLE
Integrative computational biology and molecular determinants of rectal cancer resistance to chemoradiotherapies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis identified a CRC related signature of differentially expressed genes discriminating patients Responder and Non Responder to radiochemotherapy Gene expression signatures of CRC samples Responder and Non Responder to radiochemotherapy were analyzed using supervised analyses

DESIGN
Patients with CRC have been studied using class comparison and class prediction analyses to identify markers characterizing Responders and Non Responders to radiochemotherapy
