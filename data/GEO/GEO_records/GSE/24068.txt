TITLE
Gene expression from SCID-hu mice treated with saline (control) or intermittent PTH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data present global gene expression profile of whole human bones, implanted in SCID mice (SCID-hu model), then engrafted with the myeloma cell line, Hg, and treated with saline or PTH for 4 weeks.

DESIGN
SCID-hu mice were prepared by subcutaneous implantation of human bone in SCID mice. The human myeloma cell line, Hg was injected directly into the implanted bone in SCID-hum mice. Upon establishment of myeloma growth as determined by measurement of circulating human immunoglobulins in SCID-hu mice sera, the mice were treated with saline or intermittent PTH (parathyroid hormone, 80 ug/kg/day) for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the human bones from SCID-hu mice were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extracted from these bones was subjected to global gene expression profile using Affymetrix U133-Plus microarray.
