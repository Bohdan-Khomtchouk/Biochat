TITLE
RNA-Seq based transcriptional map of bovine respiratory disease pathogen 'Histophilus somni 2336'

ORGANISM
Histophilus somni

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to experimentally annotate H. somni strain 2336 and construct a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map. Novel expressed elements were identified, and where appropriate, computational predictions of previously described gene boundaries were corrected.

DESIGN
Transcript profiling of a single sample by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL13659 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Histophilus somni)
