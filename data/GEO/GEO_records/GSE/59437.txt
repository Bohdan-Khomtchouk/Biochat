TITLE
Expression data from mouse tissue Angiotensin II treated for 0,1,3,7days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II (Ang II) mediated signaling plays a key role in the development of hypertension associated target organ damages. However, the gene expression changes regulated by Ang II in the early stage of acute cerebral, cardiac, renal, vascular injury remain unclear. we investigated Ang II–mediated gene expression alteration associated with the development of early cerebral, cardiac, renal, vascular injury by microarray assay in a mouse model.

DESIGN
All mice were euthanized by an overdose of pentobarbital on days 1, 3 and 7 of  Angiotensin II  treatment. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from brains, hearts, kidneys and vessels (n=1-3 per group) at each time point according to manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip mouse Genome 430 2.0 array according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). On the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, over 45,000 probe sets analyze the expression level of over 39,000 transcripts and variants from over 34,000 well characterized mouse genes.
