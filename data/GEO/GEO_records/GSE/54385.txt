TITLE
A comparison of gene expression between human dermal fibroblasts and neurons infected by varicella zoster virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular transcriptomes of VZV-infected fibroblasts and T-lymphocytes have been reported, but not that of human neurons. In order to determine the transcriptional response of human neurons to VZV infection, we generated 95%-pure populations of neurons from hESC, infected them with recombinant GFP-expressing cell-free VZV, and compared their transcriptome to that of human foreskin fibroblasts infected in parallel, using Agilent microarrays.  Applying a twofold-change as the cutoff (p-value < 0.05), we observed that transcription of 1654 fibroblast and 340 neuronal genes were upregulated, and 955 fibroblast and 38 neuronal genes were downregulated by VZV infection. 223 of these infection-regulated genes were unique to neurons. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed several clusters of genes regulated by VZV in neurons and fibroblasts differed. For example, neurons did not show upregulation of innate immune responses, NF-kappaB, response to stress and DNA repair clusters, in contrast to fibroblasts that upregulated these groups. This is the first study of the response of genetically normal human neurons to viral infection.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, VZV-GFP23- fibroblast cells vs. fibroblast cells, and VZV-GFP23- neuron cells vs. neuron cells. Data from two biological replicates and two technical replicates were used for each condition.
