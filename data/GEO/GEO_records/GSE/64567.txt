TITLE
Transcriptomic identification of genes for obesity and insulin resistance in human adipose tissue in a Mexican American population sample drawn from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA obtained from human fasted subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (FAT) was used to measure genome-wide gene expression. Expression values which were significantly present were standardized by quantile normalization and correlated with clinical data.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed for correlation with multiple obesity and insulin resistance related traits.
