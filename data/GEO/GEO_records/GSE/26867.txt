TITLE
Nociceptor differentiation from pluripotent cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we performed the first combinatorial small molecule screen for the rapid conversion of hPSCs into postmitotic neurons. We identified a combination of five small molecule pathway inhibitors sufficient to yield neurons at > 75% efficiency within 10 days of differentiation in the absence of any recombinant growth factors. The resulting human neurons express canonical markers of nociceptive sensory fate.

DESIGN
Two treatments (LSB and 3i) at days 2,3,5,7,9, and 15, in triplicate
