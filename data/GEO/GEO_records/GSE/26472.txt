ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional effects in liver, lung and blood samples from mice after intratracheal challenge with either Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19 (lobar-pneumonia) or serotype 2 (sepsis) were monitored after 6 and 24 hours and compared to sham (vehicle control). We gratefully acknowledge the BMBF grant within the “Promoting global research excellence in severe sepsis” (PROGRESS) study (01KI07111).
