TITLE
Gene expression analysis of leukemic samples in C57BL6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
[original title] Gene expression analysis of leukemic samples derived from AF4-MLL- or AF4-MLL/MLL-AF4-transduced and transplanted hematopoietic stem/precursor cells in C57BL6 mice. We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression in leukemic cells with three distinct immunophenotypes.

DESIGN
We compared leukemic cells isolated from the bone marrow of diseased mice and compared these profiles with normal bone marrow.
