TITLE
Genes regulated by HS3ST2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips to compare the transcriptome of HS3ST2-transfected and control vector-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with HS3ST2- or control-vector. Subsequently, total RNA was collected and processed for analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Three independent replicates were prepared for each comparison group.
