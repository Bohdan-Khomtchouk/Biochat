TITLE
Endometrial cell-type specific RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell-type specific RNA-seq is a powerful approach for unravelling molecular processes of endometrial receptivity, and to detect novel sensitive biomarkers of receptivity.

DESIGN
16 paired endometrial tissue samples from pre-receptive (defined as LH2) and receptive phase endometria (defined as LH8) from Estonia (defined as E) and Spain (defined as S) were collected. CD9-positive epithelial cells (defined as epithelium) and CD13-positive stromal cells (defined as stroma) were isolated with fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and full transcriptome analysis was performed by RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
