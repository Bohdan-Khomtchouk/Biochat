TITLE
Identifying targets of DSX with DamID-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have adapted the DamID protocol for use with high throughput sequencing.  We have used DamID to identify the positions within the Drosophila genome where the transcription factor DSX is bound. We sequenced DpnI-digested genomic DNA from fly tissues containing UAS-Dam (control) or UAS-Dam-DsxF or UAS-Dam-DsxM.

DESIGN
We have performed DamID-seq on adult male and female fatbody and on ovary.  We used two biological replicates for each tissue and sex.
