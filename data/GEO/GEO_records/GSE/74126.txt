TITLE
Rapid and affordable genome-wide bisulfite DNA sequencing by XmaI-RRBS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe XmaI-RRBS method for rapid and affordable genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, with library preparation taking only four days and sequencing possible within four hours. Small sizes of the XmaI-RRBS libraries allow their multiplexing and sequencing on the benchtop high-throughput machines. Described here is the first RRBS protocol validated for the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine.

DESIGN
DNA from MCF7 cell line and 6 normal breast samples (total 7 samples) were subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing analysis (XmaI-RRBS) by using Ion Torrent platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17301 Ion Torrent PGM (Homo sapiens)
