TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild-type and PTIP deficient chicken DT40 B cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
PTIP (Pax2 transactivation domain-interacting protein) is a nuclear protein containing six BRCT domains. It has been shown that PTIP affects gene expression by controlling the activity of the transcription factor Pax2 and histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complexes. In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, PTIP has been implicated in DNA damage response. To ask if  the depletion of PTIP affects the expression level of genes encoding DNA damage response factors , we compared the whole transcripts between wild-type and PTIP deficient chicken DT40 B cell lines.

DESIGN
The total RNAs were isolated from wild-type and PTIP deficient cells (PTIP-/-/-) using Sepasol®-RNA I (Nacalai tesque, Japan). The gene expression profiles were examined using Genechip® Chicken Genome Array (Affymetrix Cat #900590), by GeneticLab co. Ltd. Japan, following Genechip® protocol.
