TITLE
CHD8 controls progestin-dependent gene expression in T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHD8 is an ATPase of the SNF2 family involved in ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling. Our data indicate that in the presence of progestin (R5020), a progesterone receptor (PR) agonist, CHD8 is recruited to a number of PR enhancers. To correlate CHD8 binding sites with CHD8-regulated gene expression we performed a transcriptomic analysis of T47D-MTVL cells transfected with a control siRNA or a siRNA specifically targeting CHD8 and stimulated during 6h with progestin or vehicle. CHD8-dependent genes presented lower induction of up-regulated genes and lower repression of down-regulated genes, indicating that CHD8 is required for progesterone-dependent regulation of a subset of genes.

DESIGN
T47D-MTVL cells were transfected with control siRNA (siCt) or siRNA against CHD8 (siCHD8), subjected to serum deprivation during 48 h and then stimulated with 10 nM R5020 (R5020) or vehicle (EtOH) for 6 h. Three independent samples were taken from each condition: SiCt_EtOH, SiCt_R5020, SiCHD8_EtOH, SiCHD8_R5020.
