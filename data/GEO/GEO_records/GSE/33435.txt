TITLE
Tomato ripe fruits:Lycb-1 transgenic line vs Wild type

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The enzyme lycopene β-cyclase (LYCB) is responsible for the synthesis of β-carotene, a valuable component of the human diet. To understand the effect of the high β-Carotene content accumulation on plants carotenoid biosynthesis and global genes expression，a tomato engineered to constitutively express Lycb-1 accumulated a high level of β-carotene was used in this reasearch.Microarray analysis in the ripe stage revealed that the constitutive expression of Lycb-1 differentially regulated a number of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, flavones, flavonols, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, in the degradation of limonene and pinene, in starch and sucrose metabolism and in photosynthesis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Lycb-1 transgenic lines vs. Wild type. Biological replicates, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
