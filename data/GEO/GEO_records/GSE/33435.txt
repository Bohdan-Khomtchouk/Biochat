TITLE
Tomato ripe fruits:Lycb-1 transgenic line vs Wild type

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The enzyme lycopene β-cyclase (LYCB) is responsible for the synthesis of β-carotene, a valuable component of the human diet. To understand the effect of the high β-Carotene content accumulation on plants carotenoid biosynthesis and global genes expression，a tomato engineered to constitutively express Lycb-1 accumulated a high level of β-carotene was used in this reasearch.Microarray analysis in the ripe stage revealed that the constitutive expression of Lycb-1 differentially regulated a number of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, flavones, flavonols, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, in the degradation of limonene and pinene, in starch and sucrose metabolism and in photosynthesis.
