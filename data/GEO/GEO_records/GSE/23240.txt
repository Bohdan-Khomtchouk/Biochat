TITLE
CpG islands Methylation Profiling by DMH in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: Screening Set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have systematically profiled DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands (CGIs) in ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian tumours, excluding mucinous and clear cell cancers, prospectively collected through a cohort study, were analyzed by differential methylation hybridization (DMH) (Nouzova M et al, 2004) in duplicates. The loci targeted by the custom-designed microarray are the promoter CpG islands (Gardiner-Garden and Frommer, 1987) of the genes involved in the Wnt, p53, AKT/mTOR, BRCA1/2 and Redox pathways, DNA repair (HR, NHEJ and MMR), FA family and IgLON family.

DESIGN
111 ovarian tumor samples were assayed by DMH in duplicates. McrBC digested (Cy5) and undigested (Cy3) samples were competitively hybridized on the Agilent custom-designed microarrays 8x15k.
