TITLE
Testicular gene expression profiles in infertile patients with AZFc deletions of the Y chromosome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we carried out testicular gene expression profiling of patients with AZFc microdeletion, idiopathic infertility and normal spermatogenesis, in order to identify up- and downregulated genes in the different conditions, and to verify the presence of specific  molecular pathways leading to the spermatogenic damage in patients with AZFc deletions. All samples of patients with AZFc deletion clustered together, showing downregulation of several genes related to spermatogenesis.
