TITLE
CD4+ T cell response to IL12 in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional response to IL12 in activated CD4+ T cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were activated with CD3/28 beads for 48hrs and thereafter cultured with IL12 (100U/ml) for 2hrs or 8hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
