TITLE
Transcriptional rates in S. cerevisiae wild type haploid and polyploid cells as well as in whi5 and cln3 mutant cells using Genomic Run On (GRO)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analyzed the effect of the cell volume on transcription rate using the Genomic Run-on assay on polyploid and mutant cells.

DESIGN
This study focus on the transcriptional activity of RNA pol II in yeast genes on S. cerevisiae strains with different cell volume grown in YPD to exponential phase and then processed for Genomic Run-On. Home-made macroarrays containing entire ORFs were used. Three replicates of each time point were done. Each replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray. A single DNA genomic hybridization was done on the same microarrays for normalization. Data were normalized by MAD using the ArrayStat software.

PLATFORM
