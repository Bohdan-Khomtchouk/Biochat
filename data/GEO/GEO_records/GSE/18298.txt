TITLE
Gene expression profiling of aortic media after long-term treatment with an angiotensin II-receptor blocker, Losartan

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats (Wag/Rij, females) were chronically treated with Losartan (20mg/d), an angiotensin II-receptor blocker during 9 months. Gene expression profiling was performed on aortic media to understand the long-term effect of this molecule on the cardiovascular system.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment, Ctrl vs Losartan-treated animals. Biological replicates: 5 control replicates, 5 Losrtan-treated animals. All the RNA samples were pooled to provide a reference RNA for a two-color experiment.
