TITLE
Progressive human proteinuric nephropathies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained gene-expression profiles of microdissected renal-tubule cells from patients with proteinuric nephropathies. Based on the renal function during follow-up, the patients were divided in stable (n=14) and progressive (n=7) subjects (table 1). The cells of interest were laser-capture microdissected from frozen sections from archived kidney biopsy material. Initially all samples were processed as technical duplicates (2 x 21 arrays); due to a large number of signal-negative spots several arrays were excluded leaving 36 arrays for analysis. The samples P2, P6, P7, S10, S13 and S14 were analysed as individual arrays, all other samples were analysed after combination of duplicate arrays. Quality control: To test for reproducibility we calculated the intra-array variability of the duplicate arrays. Duplicate arrays were combined before statistical analysis where applicable. Patient and control characteristics can be found in the manuscript and on our website Frozen kidney biopsies were stained for alkaline phospatase, then the tubule cells were lasercapture microdissected using the PixCell II Laser Capture Microdissection System and CapSure; LCM Caps. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Disease State: samples from patients with proteinuric nephropathy (stable or progressive)
