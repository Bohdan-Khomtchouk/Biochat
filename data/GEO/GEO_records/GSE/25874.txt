TITLE
The Effect of GATA6 on miRNA in Lung Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gata6 regulates lung epithelial stem cell development and airway regeneration.  Here, the expression profile of microRNA was investigated when Gata6 was depleted during lung development.

DESIGN
Analysis used total RNA from Sftpc-rtTA:tetO-cre lungs at E14.5 as control samples (WT) for comparison to the experimental samples of total RNA from Gata6flox/flox: Sftpc-rtTA: tetO-Cre mutant lungs at E14.5.
