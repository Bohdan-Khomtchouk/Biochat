TITLE
Global hepatic gene expression data from germ free and specific pathogen free male mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver clock regulates transcription of hepatic genes in response to feeding. To explore the possibility that the microbiome influences this process, we measured the liver transcriptome in normal mice (Specific Pathogen Free or SPF mice) and compared it to the transcriptome in mice lacking microbiota (Germ Free or GF mice) at different time points over 24h. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver of GF and SPF 10-12 weeks-old male C57Bl/6 male mice.

DESIGN
There are 40 liver samples, each from an individual mouse. The samples are from germ free mice (GF) and specific pathogen free mice (SPF). Mice of both types were sacrificed at four time points: Zeitgeber Time 0, 6, 12, and 18. There are five replicates per condition.
