TITLE
Profiling gene expression levels to investigate the degree of substantial equivalence between GM and non-GM potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to calculate the degree of substantial equivalence between a GM potato line modified for late blight resistance and corresponding non-GM controls in the presence/absence of P. infestans inoculation. The GM phenotype was conferred through the introduction of the Rb gene which has been previously cloned from Solanum bulbocastanum (Song et al. 2003). The resulting GM phenotype was characterised by the expression of strong, partial resistance to P. infestans. By obtaining an expression profile from a GM and non-GM population before and after exposure to P. infestans, this effectively provides for the completion of two risk assessments: impact on the potato transcriptome of plus/minus genetic modification; before and after exposure to the pathogen.  For each biological replicate, individuals from three separate GM lines (A, B, C) and three separate non-GM lines (D, E, F) were randomly sorted and cultivated for analysis. Each GM line contained an independent, single transgene insertion, which was verified through Southern Blot analysis. One day prior to pathogen exposure, the 4-week-old potato plants were transferred into a growth chamber with a 16-h light period, 90% relative humidity at a temperature of 15C. Plants were randomly selected and 14 individuals/line were inoculated with a field isolate of P. infestans. An additional 14 plants/line were sprayed with water. Inoculations were made with a sporangial suspension of 20,000/mL and plants were sprayed until run-off. Twenty-four hours post-inoculation, leaf tissue was collected from 9 plants per treatment, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and pooled. Total leaf RNA was extracted using Trizol and the whole experiment was repeated three times (three biological replicates). Keywords: Direct comparison
