TITLE
The stress kinase MKK7 couples oncogenic stress to p53 stability and tumor suppression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of control and MKK7-deficient  primary mouse pneumocytes after oncogenic KRasG12 induction

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MKK7 proficient vs.  MKK7 deficient pneumocytes. 3 Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 knock out, independently grown and harvested. 3 technical replicates per array (each sample was hybridized to 3 in-house arrays (47MM, 51MM and 46MM - see HybridisationInfo.xls) for a total of 54 hybridizations).
