TITLE
Gene expression profiles of PBMC in CRPC patients receiving persornalized peptide vaccination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) is one of the attractive immunotherapy with high immune-boosting effects. However, as with most therapeutic agents, PPV does not elicit beneficial immune and/or clinical responses in all of the treated cancer patients. To identify prognostic biomarker for the selection of patients most likely to benefit from PPV, we conducted whole genome gene expression analysis of prevaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 112 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prevaccination PBMCs in 112 CRPC patients
