TITLE
Analysis of Liver Progenitor Cells Generated from Yap Expression [Set 1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hippo signaling is highly associated with activity in the stem cell compartment of many epithelial tissues.  In this study, we examined if Hippo signaling inhibition (by inducing Yap expression) could convert differentiated cells into a progenitor like phenotype.  Organoid cells derived from mouse livers under various conditions, wild-type, Yap ON (Plus Dox), and Yap ON then OFF (Minus Dox) was examined. Comparison between freshly isolated hepatocytes; Uninduced_YPF-#.cel  against Organoids grown in  wild-type conditions (WT), Yap On (in vivo) off (in vitro) -  YapOrganoidDoxMinus , and Yap On continuously - YapOrganoidDoxPlus.

DESIGN
Organoids grown in culture or YFP+ sorted liver cells after the indicated time of Yap expression were collected.  These were amplified using Nugene technology and hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene1.0 st arrays.
