TITLE
Pseudopodoces humilis Transcriptome data used for gene annotation

ORGANISM
Pseudopodoces humilis

SUMMARY
To optimize the genome annotation, two tissue RNA libraries (i.e. liver and muscle) were constructed using the Illumina mRNA-Seq Prep Kit This study is a part of the Pseudopodoces humilis WGS project (BioProject ID: PRJNA179234) and was used for gene annotation improvement.

DESIGN
We sequenced two tissues using illumina Hiseq 2000 platform.
