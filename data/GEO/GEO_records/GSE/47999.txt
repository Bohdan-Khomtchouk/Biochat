TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster Show a Threshold Effect in Response to Radiation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We investigate the biological effects of radiation using Drosophila Melanogaster as a model organism, focusing on gene expression and lifespan analysis to determine the effect of different radiation doses. Our results support a threshold effect in response to radiation: no effect on lifespan and no permanent effect on gene expression is seen at doses below 10,000 Roentgens.

DESIGN
Adult male Drosophila were irradiated 2 days after eclosion, with one of 6 radiation doses: 10; 1,000; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000 Roentgens. Samples were taken at 3 time points (2, 10 and 20 days post-irradiation).
