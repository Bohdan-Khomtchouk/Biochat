TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis root tips rRBr mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The RETINOBLASTOMAâ€“RELATED (RBR) is a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation in plants, and plays an important role in maintenance of the stem cell niche in the root. We used microarray analysis to characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana root tips from rRBr mutant (7 samples) against Col-0 wild type (6 samples) after 4, 6 and 10 das.

DESIGN
Using the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, we followed the transcriptional dynamics underlying the phenotypic changes due to RBR silencing we have analysed the rRbr line at early time points of development (4, 6 and 10 das) and compared to Col-0 wild-type. Biological replicates were performed for each sample and hybridized to the chips.
