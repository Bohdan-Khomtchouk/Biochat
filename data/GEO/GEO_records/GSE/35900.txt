TITLE
SOLiD sequencing of Noccaea (Thlaspi) caerulescens root transcriptomes from three contrasting ecotypes

ORGANISM
Noccaea caerulescens

SUMMARY
Root transcriptomes were sequenced using SOLiD 4 chemistry. The three accessions LC, GA and MP differed significantly in the expression of genes that contribute to metal ion transport and detoxification, stress tolerance and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. These data provide comprehensive genome-wide view to the root processes in several N. caerulescens accessions and highlight differences that potentially facilitate adaptation to various metalliferous soils.

DESIGN
Comparison of three N. caerulescens accessions with contrasting metal accumulation and tolerance traits
