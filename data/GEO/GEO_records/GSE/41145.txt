Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth with H2/bicarbonate or pyruvate

ORGANISM
Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain CB1190 during growth with H2/bicarbonate or pyruvate

DESIGN
Two treatments, based on carbon/energy source used for growth: pyruvate and H2/bicarbonate. Triplicate microarrays (biological replicates) were prepared for each treatment. Pyruvate was used as the reference treatment for subsequent analysis. Gene expression changes were compared pair-wise: H2/bicarbonate vs. pyruvate
