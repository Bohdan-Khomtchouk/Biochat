TITLE
Mouse popliteal lymph node transcriptome response to a wild type West Nile virus (WNV), New York 99 Strain, and mutant WNV-E218A viruses [microRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in mouse cortex infected with wild-type West Nile virus (WNV; WNV-NY99 382), and mutant WNV-E218A (WNV-NY99 382 E218A 2 nt).

DESIGN
Mice are inoculated with WNV in both hind footpads at a dose of 100 FFU. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in triplets in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 1 and 2 days post-infection.

PLATFORM
GPL19970 Agilent-046065 Mouse_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray [Probe Name version]
