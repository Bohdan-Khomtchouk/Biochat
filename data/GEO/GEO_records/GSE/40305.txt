TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis in fast-growing Arabidopsis thaliana with elevated level of ATP [roots]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Higher ATP supply in AtPAP2 overexpression line is the driving force for its fast-growth phenotypes, leading to massive changes in its transcriptome and metabolome. The OE lines are previously described in Sun et al., New Phytol. 2012 Apr;194(1):206-19.

DESIGN
20-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings at middle of day under long day growth conditions were collected for RNA extraction and microarray analysis
