SUMMARY
Drugs that target specific gene alterations have proven beneficial in the treatment of cancer. Because cancer cells have multiple resistance mechanisms, it is important to understand the downstream pathways of the target genes and monitor the pharmacodynamic markers associated with therapeutic efficacy. We performed a transcriptome analysis to characterize the response of various cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
We performed a transcriptome analysis to characterize the response of various cancer cell lines to a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor (CH5183284/Debio 1347), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. We treated compounds for 24 hours and purified total RNA.
