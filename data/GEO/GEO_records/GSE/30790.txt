TITLE
Effects of fzr1 knockdown on senescence-associated gene expression in human diploid fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile in Ras-induced senescent human diploid fibroblasts with or without depletion of fzr1/cdh1.  Results provide insight into the effect on fzr1/cdh1 on the regulation of senescence-associated gene expression in human diploid fibroblasts.

DESIGN
IMR-90-ER:Ras cells were cultured for 6 days with or without 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) and were subsequently subjected to transfection with siRNA oligos against fzr1/cdh1 or control for three times (at 2 day intervals).  Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent and were analyzed using the human 3D-Gene DNA chip (Toray) which that contains 25000 genes. The genome wide transcriptional response of proliferating cells (IMR si control2) and fzr1/cdh1 depleted senescent cells (IMR+OHT si cdh1) were compared to that of senescent cells (IMR+OHT si control).
