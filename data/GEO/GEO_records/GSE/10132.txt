TITLE
Overexpression of GLI2 induces genomic instability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization to investigate the response of control HT1080 cells and HT1080 cells infected with a lentivirus expressing eGFP, GLI2-eGFP or CCND1-RFP to challenge with methotrexate to address the question if GLI2 overexpression induces genomic instability. Keywords: aCGH
