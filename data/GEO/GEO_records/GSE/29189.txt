TITLE
Genome-scale DNA methylation profiling of TEL/AML positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of 48 samples to determine a DNA methylation signature specific to leukaemic bone marrow samples. Matching Leukaemia bone marrow and day 28 remission bone marrow or post induction follow up (follow up up to 2 years post induction) genomic DNA were extracted from archived microscope smear slides from 11 children diagnosed with TEL/AML positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). Unmatched bone marrow samples from an additional 8 children were also analysed. Primary tissue control samples from CD34+ and CD19+ bone marrow from adult and childhood samples as well as model cell lines (cancer and non cancerous) were compared to primary diseased samples. Disease specific DNA methylation changes were identified from these results and then verified using SEQUENOM EpiTYPER.

DESIGN
A total of 48 samples were analysed by Infinium DNA methylation analysis. As per manufacturer's protocols. Replicates were performed on one primary tumour sample and one cell line sample.
