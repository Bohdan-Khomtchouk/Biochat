TITLE
DNA methylation analysis for mouse embryonic stem cells deficient for Smad1 and Smad5 or for Bmp activated subpopulations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we determine the profile of DNA methylation by RRBseq of mESC in the absence of Smad1 and Smad5 and in subpopulation of mESC with different levels of BMP-SMAD activation. We observed a general loss of DNA methylation associated with low or absent BMP-SMAD signalling in mESCs.

DESIGN
DNA methylation analysis using RRBS was performed on 3 biological replicates of BRE negative and positive mESC subpopulations, which were collected in pairs at 3 different times. DNA methylation analysis using RRBS was performed on Smad1/5 floxed (FL) and knockout (KO) mESC. Two different parental cell lines were used. For each parental cell line we analyzed one Smad1/5 FL sample and two Smad1/5 KO samples, resulting in respectively two and four biological replicates for the FL and KO conditions.
