TITLE
Distal axotomy enhances retrograde presynaptic excitability onto injured pyramidal neurons via trans-synaptic signaling

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Injury of descending motor tracts remodels cortical circuitry and leads to enhanced neuronal excitability, thus influencing recovery following injury. The neuron-specific contributions remain unclear due to the complex cellular composition and connectivity of the CNS. We developed a microfluidics-based in vitro model system to examine intrinsic synaptic remodeling following axon damage. We found that distal axotomy of cultured rat pyramidal neurons caused dendritic spine loss at synapses onto the injured neurons followed by a persistent retrograde enhancement in presynaptic excitability over days. These in vitro results mirrored hyper-activity of directly injured corticospinal neurons in hindlimb motor cortex layer Vb following spinal cord contusion. In vitro axotomy-induced hyper-excitability coincided with elimination of inhibitory presynaptic terminals, including those formed onto dendritic spines. We identified netrin-1 as downregulated following axotomy and exogenous netrin-1 applied 2 days after injury normalized spine density, presynaptic excitability, and the fraction of inhibitory inputs onto injured neurons. These findings demonstrate a novel model system for studying the response of pyramidal circuitry to axotomy and provide new insights of neuron-specific mechanisms that contribute to synaptic remodeling.

DESIGN
