TITLE
Chromatin occupancy and target genes of TCF7L2 in hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
TCF7L2 regulates multiple metabolic pathways in hepatocytes through a transcriptional network involving HNF4Î±

DESIGN
For the identification of Tcf7l2 target genes using a RNA-seq timecourse, and for identifying the binding sites of Tcf7l2 and Hnf4a, Tcf7l2 was silenced in rat H4IIE hepatocytes using siRNA for Tcf7l2 with a scrambled siRNA as control. Treatment times for RNA-seq samples were 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 48, and 96 hours, and for ChIP-seq samples 15 h. RNA-seq timecourse was performed in duplicate or triplicate, and the ChIP-seq in duplicate for Tcf7l2 and in singlicate for Hnf4a. The H4IIE-specific transcriptome was defined from an independent set of pooled 24 h siRNA treated samples (N=3 for siRNA for Tcf7l2 and N=3 for scrambled siRNA).
