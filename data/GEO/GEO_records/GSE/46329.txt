TITLE
Gene expression profile of ETV1 knockdown in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Over half of prostate cancer harbor overexpression of ETS transcription factors including ERG and ETV1. LNCaP prostate cancer cells have an ETV1 translocation to the MIPOL1 locus on 14q13.3-13q21.1. To determine genes regulated by ETV1, we performed shRNA mediated knockdown of ETV1 using two lentiviral constructs as well as a scrambled shRNA in triplicate. Two pLKO.1 constructs against ETV1 (ETV1sh1: TRCN0000013923, targeting GTGGGAGTAATCTAAACATTT in 3'(B UTR; and ETV1sh2: TRCN0000013925, targeting CGACCCAGTGTATGAACACAA in exon 7) were purchased from Open Biosystems and pLKO.1 shScr (targeting CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG) was purchased from Addgene.  RNA was harvested 3 days after infection and gene expression profiling was performed. Among genes downregulated were many well characterized androgen regulated genes.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells logarthmically growing in full serum was infected with three different shRNA lentiviruses. Three days after infection
