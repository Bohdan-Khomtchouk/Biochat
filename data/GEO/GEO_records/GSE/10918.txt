TITLE
Microarrays analysis of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c target genes identify new regulatory pathways.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we have identified the target genes of SREBP1a and SREBP1c in primary cultures of human skeletal muscle cells using adenoviral vectors expressing the mature nuclear form of human SREBP1a or SREBP1c combined with oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: comparison of human myotubes infected either by SREBP1a or 1C
