TITLE
Expression data from Vulvar, Cervical, Endometrial Carcinoma tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A growing number of studies on gynecological cancers (GCs) have revealed potential gene markers associated either with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease on representing putative targets for therapy and treatment of cervical (CC), endometrial (EC) and vulvar cancer (VC). However, quite a little overlap is found between these data. In this study we combined data from the three GCs integrating gene expression profile analysis. The meta-analysis including our results and data emerge from other available studies on gynecological malignancies and other cancer types, revealed common properties among them including deregulation of cell cycle, immune response, antiviral response and apoptosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from physiological and cancer patients from cervix, endometrium and vulvar tissue and was hybridized on Affymetrix HG133_A_2.0 microarray chips corresponding to more than 12.000 uniquely represented genes. A total of 35 samples were used to identify potential biomarkers and signatures in each type of cancer.
