TITLE
Gene expression signature of the T-ALL cell line LOUCY treated with 1µM (+)-JQ1 for 48h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional consequences of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in the T-ALL cell line LOUCY by microarray analysis. Sustained exposure at a high concentration (48h, 1µM) revealed broad transcriptional effects with more than half of the expressed probesets showing significant up- or downregulation (adj. p-value < 0.05). Significantly downregulated genes included stem-cell associated genes and putative oncogenes such as BAALC, WT1, MN1, MEF2C, LMO1, LMO2, BCL2, IGFBP7, ZEB2, GFI1B, MYB and LYL1.

DESIGN
LOUCY cells were treated with 1µM (+)-JQ1 or DMSO for 48h. Three biological replicates of this treatment were performed.
