TITLE
Decay-initiating endoribonucleolytic cleavage by RNase Y is kept under tight control via sequence preference and sub-cellular localisation

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Bacteria depend on efficient RNA turnover to rapidly alter gene expression, essentially for responding to changing conditions. Nevertheless, remarkably few details are known about the rate-limiting steps in targeting and decay of RNA. The membrane-anchored endoribonuclease RNase Y is a virulence factor in Gram- positive pathogens. We have obtained a global picture of RNase Y sequence specificity using RNA-seq and the novel transcriptome-wide EMOTE method. Ninety- nine endoribonucleolytic sites produced in vivo were precisely mapped, notably inside six out of seven genes whose half-lives increase the most in an RNase Y deletion mutant, and additionally to three separate transcripts encoding degradation ribonucleases, including RNase Y itself, suggesting a regulatory network. We show that RNase Y is required to initiate the major degradation pathway of a defined sub-set of transcripts that are inaccessible to other ribonucleases, but is prevented from promiscuous activity by membrane confinement and sequence preference for guanosines.

DESIGN
Rnase Y activity in S. aureus is analysed on a genome wide scale under two perspectives: a RNA decay timecourse with mRNA-seq; and exact position of cleavage with an EMOTE assay (Exact Mapping Of Trancripts Ends)
