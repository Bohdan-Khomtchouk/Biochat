TITLE
The exon junction complex controls transposable element activity by ensuring faithful splicing of the piwi transcript

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The exon junction complex (EJC) is a highly conserved ribonucleoprotein complex which binds RNAs during splicing and remains associated with them following export to the cytoplasm. While the role of this complex in mRNA localization, translation and degradation has been well characterized, its mechanism of action in splicing a subset of Drosophila and human transcripts remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe a novel function for the EJC and its splicing subunit RnpS1 in preventing transposon accumulation in both Drosophila germline and surrounding somatic follicle cells. This function is mediated specifically through the control of piwi transcript splicing, where in the absence of RnpS1 the fourth intron of piwi is retained. Within this intron the polypyrimidine tract is disrupted by a transposon-adjacent A/T-rich sequence that confers dependence on RnpS1. Finally, we demonstrate that RnpS1-dependent removal of this intron requires splicing of the flanking introns, suggesting a model in which the EJC facilitates the splicing of weak introns following its initial deposition at adjacent exon junctions. These data demonstrate a novel role for the EJC in regulating piwi intron excision and provide a mechanism for its function during splicing.
