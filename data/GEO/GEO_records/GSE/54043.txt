TITLE
Global gene expression profile of gastric antrum tissue of patients with eosinophilic gastritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Significant recent progress has been made with understanding eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) yet most studies have focused on eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Herein, we aimed to provide fundamental information about the molecular characteristics of eosinophilic gastritis (EG).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from gastric biopsies from control patients (n=5) and patients with EG (n=5) followed by hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
