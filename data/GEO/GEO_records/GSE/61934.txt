TITLE
Gene expression profiling of bovine muscle samples upon experimental treatment with dexamethasone and dexamethasone/Clenbuterol combination

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In the present study, Bovine transcriptome was characterized in order to identify a set of candidate genes potentially useful for rapid detection of illegal use of some growth promoters (GPs) as dexamethasone (DEX) alone or in combination with the B2-agonist clenbuterol (CLEN). A bovine oligo microarray platform (GPL7053) was used to profile gene expression from twelve (12) bovine biceps brachii samples. Isolated and purified total RNAs were individually hybridized to the Agilent bovine V1 4x44k DNA microarray. The comparison of untreated and treated bovine transcriptomes revealed a set of differentially expressed genes. After functional analysis and qPCR validation, 16 genes were found to be differentially expressed among groups (15 downregulated genes & 1 upregulated gene between CTR and DEX and CTR and DEX CLEN groups, respectively).

DESIGN
A total of 24 animals was used in this study. Animals were randomly divided into three groups of 8 animals each. The first group was used as a control (CTRL), the second was treated with dexamethasone (DEX)  administered via feed 0.75 mg per capita for 42 days (group DEX), and the third one was treated with an increasing dose of Clenbuterol (CLEN) via feed 2 mg per capita during the first week, 4 mg per capita during the second week, and 6 mg per capita during the third and the fourth weeks (28 days in total), in combination with DXM 0.66 mg per capita for 21 days (group DEX+ CLEN).Twelve samples (4/group) out of the 24 were chosen for the microarray analysis based on the highest isolated RNA quality.
