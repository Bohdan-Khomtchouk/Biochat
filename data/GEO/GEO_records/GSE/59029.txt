TITLE
Quantitative analysis of wild type and MeCP2-/y mice hippocampus miRNAs using next generation sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether the miRNA expression profile is altered by MeCP2, we performed Solexa-based RNA sequencing(RNA-seq) to assess global changes in the expression pattern of miRNAs caused by the loss of MeCP2 in mecp2 null (knockout[KO]) mice (Chen et al., 2001).

DESIGN
Hippocampus miRNA profiles of 30-day old wild type (WT) and MeCP2-/y mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
