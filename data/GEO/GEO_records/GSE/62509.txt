TITLE
miRNA sequencing of Trim71 conditional ( " WT " ) and Trim71 KO mES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Trim71 mutation induces significant changes in the global expression profile of miRNAs in undifferentiated mES cells, rendering the cells prone to differentiation.

DESIGN
Analysis of changes in the expression of miRNAs in two different genotypes

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
