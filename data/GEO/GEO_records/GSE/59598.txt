TITLE
mRNA expression in human DAOY cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generate ZNF423 knockdown and control DAOY cells with lentivirus that co-expressed the fluorescent protein mCherry. We performed whole genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of three batched of cultured ZNF423 KD or control KD cells. The sequence reads were analyzed by Homer followed by edgeR. The analyzed RNA-seq results showed  differential expression profile including 12 known cilia genes, and 3 of these were validated with qRT-PCR on mouse granule cell precursors. This study proved data how ZNF423 linked to cilia complexes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq in three batched of control and ZNF423 KD cells(generated by lentivirus delivered shRNA targeting ZNF423 sequence).
