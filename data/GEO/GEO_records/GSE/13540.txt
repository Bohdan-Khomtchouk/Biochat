TITLE
Dual regulation of nitrogen metabolism by CodY and GlnR in Streptococcus mutans

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
CodY and GlnR are two major transcriptional regulators in nitrogen metabolism in Gram-positive bacteria. CodY regulates genes involved in the adaptive response to poor growth conditions, especially to nutrient limitation. GlnR controls nitrogen utilization according to the availability of nitrogen source. In this study we used microarray to investigate the regulatory roles that CodY and GlnR play in nitrogen metabolism in Streptococcus mutans.
