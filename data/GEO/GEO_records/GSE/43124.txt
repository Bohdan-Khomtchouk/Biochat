TITLE
Expression data from mobilized human CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bortezomib-based secondary induction therapy and mobilization could represent alternative strategies to reduce tumor burden. We used microarrays to investigate genome-wide expression changes between bortezomib and non-bortzomib mobilizaton strategies and identified distinct genes and pathways that were significantly differentially regulated.

DESIGN
CD34+ stem cells were enriched from leukapheresis products from multiple myeloma patients treated with a bortezomib- or non-bortezomib-based mobilization. RNA extraction, amplification and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed. Post-induction stem cell collection was initiated when patients' ANC reached > 1.0Ã—10^9/L.
