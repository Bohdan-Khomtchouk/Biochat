TITLE
Time-course differential lncRNA and mRNA expressions in radioresistant hypopharyngeal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through measuring expression levels of lncRNAs/mRNAs in RS-FaDu vs. FaDu cells at 0, 24 and 48 h after 4 Gy radiation, we identified a number of lncRNAs/mRNAs with dysregulation. And the microarray data were verified by qRT-PCR assays. By informatics analyses, we predicted pathways, which were potentially associated with radioresistance of hypopharyngeal carcinoma.

DESIGN
The radioresistant hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (RS-FaDu) was estabished from its parental human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (FaDu) by multi-fractioned radiation. Time-course differential lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in RS-FaDu vs. FaDu cells were detected by microarray approach, at 0, 2, 48 h after 4 Gy radiation.
