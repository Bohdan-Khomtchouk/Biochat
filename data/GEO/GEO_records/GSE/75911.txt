TITLE
Expression data from U937 cells infected by hsa-miR-608 inhibitor virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression level of miR-608 was found to be down regulated in several types of cancer. In our previous study, a single SNP in miR-608 (rs4919510)  was found to be strongly associated with a higher risk of developing sepsis and multiple organ dysfunctions in all 3 independent study cohorts. However, the clinicopathological impact and the exact roles of miR-608 and its underlying molecular mechanisms in inflammation remain to be identified. In order to identify the exact terget gene of miR-608 in monocytes, we constructed lentiviral vectors with has-miR-608 inhibitor sequences and transfected U937 cells.We used microarrays to identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process and look for possible target genes.

DESIGN
U937 cells transfected by has-miR-608 inhibitor lentiviral vectors or negative control virus were analyzed. There are three samples in each group.
