TITLE
Pituitary Tumors cDNA SAGE Libraries

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite a considerable literature concerning the molecular pathogenesis of pituitary tumors, the mechanisms of pituitary tumors development and progression remain unknown. Four SAGE cDNA libraries were constructed using a pool of mRNA obtained from five GH-, two ACTH-secreting, and four non secreting pituitary tumors (NS), and three normal pituitaries from patients who had accidental death, using I-SAGE kit (Invitrogen). The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential gene expression profile by SAGE genes in different subtypes of pituitary tumors to contribute for understanding of pituitary tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in subtypes of pituitary tumores.
