TITLE
LHX2 in neural differentiation from hESCs H9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to explore the role of LHX2 in neural fate determination, we performed knockdown and overexpression studies in H9.

DESIGN
--doxycycline induced LHX2 overexpression in H9-- GFP as a control 3 days doxycyline treatment was performed samples was collected 1 day (Day4) and 13 days (Day16) post doxycyline treatment --shLHX2 in H9-- shLuc as a control samples were collected 12 days of neural induction all samples were biological duplicate
