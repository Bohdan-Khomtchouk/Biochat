TITLE
QK-knockdown U87 transduced with miR-20a or a scrambled non-targeting microRNA (miR-NT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify potential miR-20a regulated mRNAs and linked pathways in the setting of QK knockdown by comparing the transcriptional profiles of shQK-transduced human U87 cells together with miR-20a or a scrambled miRNA control (miR-NT)

DESIGN
QK-knockdown U87 transduced with miR-20a and a scrambled non-targeting microRNA (miR-NT)
