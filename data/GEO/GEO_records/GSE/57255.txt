TITLE
Effect of EtOH on transcriptome signatures in human dental pulp stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed gene expression microarray analysis to profile transcriptomic signatures affected by EtOH in human dental pulp stem cells

DESIGN
Established human dental pulp stem cells were treated with different dose of EtOH (0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50mM) for a different time periods (24 and 48 hrs). Total RNA was extracted and subjected to gene expression microarray analysis using Affymetrix human genome 2.0 plus array
