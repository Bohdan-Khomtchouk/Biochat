TITLE
The cohesin offloading factor Wapal is required for proper polycomb-mediated gene silencing [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cohesin offloading protein Wapal also acts as a polycomb factor in flies.  We examined its role in transcriptional role in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

DESIGN
Two biological replicate for each condition, hybridized to single arrays, are included.  As a negative control we used the Empty Vector.  As experimental, we used two, independent shRNAs to Wapal
