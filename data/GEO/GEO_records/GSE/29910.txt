TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Phalaenopsis orchids

ORGANISM
Phalaenopsis aphrodite

SUMMARY
cDNA sequences were collected from Orchidstra database ( http://orchidstra.abrc.sinica.edu.tw/ ). 43662 genes were presented and 67038 probes were designed on this chip.

DESIGN
Expression profiling was analyzed using a customized oligonucleotide array probed with RNA extracted from various tissues from Phalaenopsis orchids including leaf, root, floral organs and flower stages after pollination.
