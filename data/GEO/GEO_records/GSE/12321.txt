SUMMARY
Examining the transcriptional change in whole mouse (VM) brain miRNA expression during prion (22A) induced neurodegeneration in order to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules which are emerging as key regulators of numerous cellular processes.  Compelling evidence links miRNAs to the control of neuronal development and differentiation, however, little is known about their role in neurodegeneration. De-regulation of a unique subset of miRNAs may suggest a conserved, disease-specific pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs is associated with prionâ€“induced neurodegeneration.
