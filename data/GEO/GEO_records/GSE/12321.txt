ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Examining the transcriptional change in whole mouse (VM) brain miRNA expression during prion (22A) induced neurodegeneration in order to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules which are emerging as key regulators of numerous cellular processes.  Compelling evidence links miRNAs to the control of neuronal development and differentiation, however, little is known about their role in neurodegeneration. De-regulation of a unique subset of miRNAs may suggest a conserved, disease-specific pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs is associated with prionâ€“induced neurodegeneration.

DESIGN
MiRNA extracted from the whole brains of 3 VM mice treated with mouse-adapted 22A scrapie strain were analyzed on GPL7118 (array was divided into top and bottom) for differential expression. Age-matched, PBS treated control mice were used for comparison (competitive hybridization). A technical replicate for each mouse was performed as well as a technical replicate for each of the dye-swaps.
