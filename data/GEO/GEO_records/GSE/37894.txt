ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
JQ1 is a small-molecule (BET family) bromodomain inhibitor that causes a contraceptive effect in mice by blocking spermatogenesis and reducing sperm motility.

DESIGN
Genome-wide Illumina gene expression analysis of male mice treated with 50 mg/kg JQ1(treated) or vehicle (control) daily for 6 weeks (6-12 weeks of age).
