TITLE
Expression profiling of T.rubrum treated with PH11B

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
T. rubrum was treated with PH11B,a potent  eucaryotic fatty acid synthase inhibtor. A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to PH11B were determined. Some class-specific and mechanism-independent changes in gene expression were found. Keywords: fatty acid synthase inhibition
