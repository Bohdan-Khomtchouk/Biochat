TITLE
Expression Data from 12 week old APCmin/+ and littermate matched Wildtype B6 mouse Terminal Ileum (TI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
APCmin/+ mice develop spontaneous gastrointestinal polyposis due to a dominantly inhereited germline loss-of-function mutation in the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Changes in intestinal immune activity have been documented to occur prior to the development of fulminate polyposis. Such changes are thought to contribute to disease development. We used microarrays to describe the changing intestinal transcriptional landscape in APCmin/+ mice. Whole transcriptome profiling from polypotic and nonpolypotic intestinal sections of  APC/min+ mice were examined in the early stages of disease, and compared to  normal intestinal sections from littermate matched wildtype B6 mice.

DESIGN
Nonpolypotic  (wildtype and APCmin/+) and Polypotic (APCmin/+) sections of terminal ileum were identified by visual inspection, and subsequently selected for RNA isolation and hydridzation to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Arrays. Interference from bacterial RNA was selected against using a probeset enriched in oligos extending into 3â€™-poly-A tails.
