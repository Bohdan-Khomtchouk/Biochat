TITLE
Parallel evolution of transcriptome structure during genome reorganization

ORGANISM
Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638

SUMMARY
Genome reorganization by large scale indels, gene displacements, and horizontal gene transfers allow an organism to re-organize genes into operons (“operonization”) and explore novel strategies for adapting to its changing environment. We have characterized the process of operonization by mapping and comparing transcriptome structures (TSs) of four phylogenetically diverse exptremophilic archaea: a hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis S2), an anaerobic thermophile (Pyrococcus furiosis DSM 3638), an acidophilic and aerobic thermophile (Sulfolobus solfataricus P2), and a photoheterotrophic halophile (Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1). We demonstrate how the evolution of new transcriptional elements (promoters and terminators) is utilized as a mechanism to incorporate translocated, inverted, and newly acquired genes into existing gene regulatory programs.
