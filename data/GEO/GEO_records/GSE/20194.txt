TITLE
MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) data set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human breast cancer (BR) data set (endpoints D and E) was contributed by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX, USA). Gene expression data from 230 stage I-III breast cancers were generated from fine needle aspiration specimens of newly diagnosed breast cancers before any therapy. The biopsy specimens were collected sequentially during a prospective pharmacogenomic marker discovery study between 2000 and 2008. These specimens represent 70-90% pure neoplastic cells with minimal stromal contamination. Patients received 6 months of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy including paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by surgical resection of the cancer. Response to preoperative chemotherapy was categorized as a pathological complete response (pCR = no residual invasive cancer in the breast or lymph nodes) or residual invasive cancer (RD), and used as endpoint D for prediction. Endpoint E is the clinical estrogen-receptor status as established by immunohistochemistry. RNA extraction and gene expression profiling were performed in multiple batches over time using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. Genomic analysis of a subset of this sequentially accrued patient population were reported previously. For each endpoint, the first 130 cases were used as a training set and the next 100 cases were used as an independent validation set.
