TITLE
MicroRNA expression in human colon: Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of miRNA expression in colon biopsies from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) control subjects.

DESIGN
Two Crohn's disease colon biopsies and two ulcerative colitis colon biopsies were compared to a single non-IBD control colon biopsy to ascertain differences in miRNA expression.
