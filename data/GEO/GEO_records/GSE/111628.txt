TITLE
Microarray data of osteoblast from sham, ovariectomized mice (OVX) with and without treadmill training

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Physical exercise has a positive effect on increasing or maintaining BMD in both pre-menopausal and postmenopausal women. The underlying mechanisms of physical exercise on the osteoblast (OB) in estrogen deficiency are not well understood. We used microarray to analyze the transcriptome of OB in ovariectomized mice, with or without physical exercise. intervention.

DESIGN
Six-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were applied to  sham or ovariectomy surgery.The sham surgical procedures were the same as those used in ovariectomy, with the exception of leaving the ovaries intact. The ovariectomized mice were randomly divided into an exercise group (OVX+T) and a non-exercise group (OVX). Mice assigned to the exercise group (OVX+T) were given treadmill training 5-days/week for 8 weeks, with each training session lasting 60 minutes. The treadmill was run at 10 m/min with an incline angle of 10 degrees.
