TITLE
Expression profiling of H4 cells expressing a Myc tagged aSyn construct

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to identify and confirm gene expression differences in control H4 cells and WT asyn expressing H4 cells, one of the cell-based models of Parkinson`s disease. DNA microarray gene expression was performed in two samples of control H4 cells and in two samples expressing WT asyn, along with bioinformatics analysis of retrieved data.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from two samples of H4 control cells and two samples of WT asyn expressing H4 cells (myc-tagged), labeled and hybridized to Human Genome U133 PLUS 2.0 arrays.
