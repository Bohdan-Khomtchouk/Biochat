TITLE
Investigation of ecdysone sensitive Histone methylation marks associated with gene regulation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Two cell lines were utilized to determine hormone sensitive chromatin marks. Specficially this study identifies the H3K4me pattern in response to hormone treatment. This chromatin mark is believed do demarkate genes which are 'poised' to be transcriptionally activated.  We have found differential H3K4me sites both common and unique in each cell type. Many of these correlate with previous studies of ecdysone sensitive genes.

DESIGN
22 arrays were utilized. For each cell type, a ChIP for Histone 3 Lysine 4 methlyation was conducted. Treatments with and without the hormone ecdysone were completed for three replicates of each cell line. In addition, input samples (with and without hormone) were completed for each cell line, in triplicate for Kc and duplicates for S2.
