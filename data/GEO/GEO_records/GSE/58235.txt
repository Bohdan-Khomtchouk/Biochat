TITLE
Expression Profiles of HepG2 cells treated with following compounds: Azathriopine, Furan, Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, Tetrachloroethylene, Diazinon and Dmannitol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by  Azathriopine (250µM, Sigma-Aldrich), Furan (2mM, Sigma-Aldrich), Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate  (500nM, Sigma-Aldrich), Tetrachloroethylene (2mM, Sigma-Aldrich), Diazinon (250µM, Sigma-Aldrich) and Dmannitol (250µM, Sigma-Aldrich) during 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72hrs As a solvent control for Azathriopine, Furan, Diazinon and Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, DMSO was used (0.5%); As a solvent control for tetrachloroethylene, ethanol was used (0.5%); As a solvent control for D-mannitol, HBSS was used (0.5%)

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72h hours of exposure to Azathriopine, Furan, Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, Tetrachloroethylene, Diazinon, D-mannitol, DMSO solvent control, ethanol solvent control and HBSS solvent control. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 135 arrays were analyzed in total.
