TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from pancreatic cancer cell lines and non-neoplastic pancreatic cell line HPDE To identify genes epigenetically silenced and regulated in pancreatic cancer

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines (panc215, A32-1, A38-5, panc2.5, panc2.8, and panc3.014), to the non-neoplastic pancreas cell line, HPDE. We also compared the baseline gene expression of the pancreatic cancer cell lines to expression patterns after treatment with 5-aza-dC alone, TSA alone, and to a combination of 5-aza-dC/TSA.
