TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison of chlorhexidine tolerant and sensitive Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of a chlorhexidine tolerant Salmonella Typhimurium were compared to its, chlorhexidine sensitive, isogenic progenitor isolate. RNA was extracted from mid-log phase cells from both isolates, without chlorhexidine exposure and following exposure to 1 Âµg/ ml of chlorhexidine for 30 minutes. Transcriptional profiles of the tolerant isolate were compared to the sensitive isolate, with and without chlorhexidine exposure.

DESIGN
Carried out using 3 biological replicates for each sample; each sample hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator/reference

PLATFORM
