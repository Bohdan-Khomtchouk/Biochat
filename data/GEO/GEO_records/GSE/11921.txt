TITLE
Microarray-based comparative genomic profiling of reference strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations were used to estimate whole genomic diversity of representative Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains. Our goal was to identify conserved genes, especially those predicted to encode outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins because of their potential for the development of more effective vaccines. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridisation

DESIGN
Microarray data for 15 known serotypes of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (at least 2 replicates per serotype).

PLATFORM
GPL6658 AppChip2 (NRC-IBS Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae L20)
