TITLE
Microarray-based comparative genomic profiling of reference strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 5b str. L20

SUMMARY
Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations were used to estimate whole genomic diversity of representative Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains. Our goal was to identify conserved genes, especially those predicted to encode outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins because of their potential for the development of more effective vaccines. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridisation
