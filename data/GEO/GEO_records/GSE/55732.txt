TITLE
Hematopoietic database: including HSCs, progenitors and effector cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Collection of adult mouse expression profiling covering main types of hematopoietic cells Aiming to identify HSC-specific genes, we have compiled 131 affymetrix MG430 2.0 arrays and re-processed data of third-party that were curated and quality-assured. This collection was built to include numerous progenitors’ subpopulations and balanced representation of major myeloid- and lymphoid cells. Result provided validated identification of genes that are highly specific to HSCs within the hematopoietic system. This dataset also enable direct identification of specific-genes for the other cell types represented.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of covering major hematoppietic and immune cells in the C57Bl/6 mouse. This dataset include 131 arrays that include 34 distinct populations (some with both naïve and activated states). We have included many progenitors subtypes and kept a balance between the myeloid and the lymphoid branches of the hematopoietic system (while there is an access of published arrays on lymphoid subtypes). The 131 Samples below are 131 third-party reanalyzed data from the following studies, available in the GEO database as; GSE4142, GSE6506, GSE6681, GSE6875, GSE7302, GSE7764, GSE8407, GSE9717, GSE9810, GSE9954, GSE10246, GSE10627, GSE11110, GSE11982, GSE12001, GSE12075, GSE12581, GSE20244, GSE34723 All were compiled together and we have normalized them to obtain a balanced-representation. *The complete dataset representing 131 third-party reanalyzed samples (re-processed using gcRMA), is linked below as a supplementary file.
