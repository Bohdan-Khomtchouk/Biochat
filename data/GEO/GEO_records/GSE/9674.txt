TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis plants misexpressing AtMYB30 after Xanthomonas inoculation at early timepoints

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant immune responses to pathogen attack involve various defense mechanisms and among them, the Hypersensitive Response (HR), a form of programmed cell death occurring at invasion sites.  AtMYB30, a transcription factor acts as a positive regulator of a cell death pathway conditioning the HR. We show by microarray analyses of Arabidopsis plants misexpressing AtMYB30 that the genes encoding the four enzymes forming the acyl-coA elongase complex, responsible for very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) biosynthesis, are putative targets. Keywords: Time course after inoculation with a Xanthomonas strain, Xcc147, in Arabidopsis wild-type plants and transgenic plants (AtMYB30 overexpressor (ox) and antisense (as) lines
