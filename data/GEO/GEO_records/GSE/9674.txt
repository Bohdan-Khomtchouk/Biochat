TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis plants misexpressing AtMYB30 after Xanthomonas inoculation at early timepoints

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant immune responses to pathogen attack involve various defense mechanisms and among them, the Hypersensitive Response (HR), a form of programmed cell death occurring at invasion sites.  AtMYB30, a transcription factor acts as a positive regulator of a cell death pathway conditioning the HR. We show by microarray analyses of Arabidopsis plants misexpressing AtMYB30 that the genes encoding the four enzymes forming the acyl-coA elongase complex, responsible for very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) biosynthesis, are putative targets. Keywords: Time course after inoculation with a Xanthomonas strain, Xcc147, in Arabidopsis wild-type plants and transgenic plants (AtMYB30 overexpressor (ox) and antisense (as) lines

DESIGN
18 samples are analyzed : Leaves of 4 week-old plants syringe-infiltrated with the Xcc147 strain (or not) were harvested.  In experiment 1, we selected 4 timepoints : T0 (not inoculated), 90-105 min, 2-4 h and 6 h post inoculation in the wild-type line, and in a transgenic line overexpressing AtMYB30. Experiment 2 is a biological replicate of experiment 1 (except for 6 hpi). In experiment 3, we focused on the early timepoint 90-105 min to compare the wild-type line and an AtMYB30 antisense line. Experiment 4 is a biological replicate of experiment 3. Plant material was pooled when necessary, and frozen before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. As a screen for candidate target genes, we looked for genes, i) up-regulated in the wild-type line after inoculation with Xcc147 as compared to time T0 (not inoculated) , ii) over-expressed in the AtMYB30 overexpressor line compared to the wild-type, and iii) down-regulated in the AtMYB30 antisense line compared to the wild-type.
