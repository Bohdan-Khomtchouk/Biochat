SUMMARY
Profiling of miRNA expression in mouse SHAM kidneys

DESIGN
9â€“12 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. Mice underwent anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and were subjected to Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO). After standard laparotomy, the left proximal ureter was exposed and ligated with 4-0 silk at two points. The sham operation consisted of a similar identification of the left ureter without ligation.  Treated (S numbers) and non-treated (C numbers) mice miRNA expressions were then compared.
