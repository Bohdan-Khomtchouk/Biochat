TITLE
Whole-transcript expression data from normal and DLBCL human peripheral blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling based classification of DLBCL patients versus healthy donors provides insights on transcriptional regulation processes. Within the most represented pathways in DLBCL, we identified an innate immune response signature, as well as an anti-inflammatory response. On the other hand, a significant under-representation of pathways involved in T-cell activation was also revealed.

DESIGN
Whole blood from 76 DLBCL patients and 87 healthy donors was collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (Becton Dickinson BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) ensuring blood stabilization and stored at -80°C before RNA extraction.  Total RNA, after globin mRNA depletion, was hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Exon 1.0 ST oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
