TITLE
miRNA high-throughput sequencing of human prostate cancer cell lines P69, M12, M2182

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of miRNA expression in cancer cell lines provides a path for analysis of dysregulated pathways and potential treatment of dysregulation. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived miRNA expression data in a non-tumorigenic prostate cell line (P69) to its metastatic derivative cell lines M12 and M2182.

DESIGN
small RNA sequencing of duplicate extractions of the benign human prostate cell line P69, its metastatic, tumorigenic derivative cell lines M2182 and M12, and a non-metastatic subline developed from M12 using microcell-mediated chromosomal transfer.

PLATFORM
