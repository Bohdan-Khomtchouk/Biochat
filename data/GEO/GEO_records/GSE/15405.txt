TITLE
Expression data from E. coli cells overexpressing GraL for long periods of time

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
While studying greA expression, we noted presence of an intrinsic terminator in the leader region of greA mRNA transcript. We found this terminator to be quite efficient both in vivo and in vitro. This region seems to be conserved among many enteric bacteria. Judging from fitness experiments, the resulting short RNAs (50-59nt long) exert biological effects. This lead us to propose that greA leader region encodes a novel small non-coding RNA that we collectively call GraL. We used microarrays to detail the effects of GraL after short and longterm overproduction of GraL.
