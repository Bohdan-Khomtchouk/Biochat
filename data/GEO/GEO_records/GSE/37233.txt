TITLE
DNA copy number analysis from mice with radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Certain mouse strains such as CBA, C3H and RFM, have high incidence of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data in this serie was generated by using spleen DNA from CBA mice which were irraidated with either gamma-rays or heavy ion (HZE) particles. Spleen DNA with radiation-induced AML was compared with DNA from normal CBA mice.

DESIGN
Comparison of spleen DNA from CBA mice with radiation-induced AML vs genomic DNA from normal CBA mice
