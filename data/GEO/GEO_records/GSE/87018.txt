TITLE
Loss of miR-16 mediated silencing of SQSTM1 is associated with Paget's associated osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report an upregulation of miR-16 in Paget's disease of bone which is to target the SQSTM1. When miR-16 is lost in Paget's disease, there is malignant transformation.

DESIGN
Paget's bone tissue was obtained from the NRP biorepository. We then performed small RNA sequencing using HD adapters.
