TITLE
Dynamics of gene expression during devepolement and expansion of vegetative stem internodes of bioenergy sorghum

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
Bioenergy sorghum accumulates 75% of shoot biomass in stem internodes. Grass stem internodes are formed during vegetative growth and elongate in response to developmental and environmental signals. To identify genes and molecular mechanisms that modulate the extent of internode growth, we conducted microscopic and transcriptomic analysis of four successive sub-apical vegetative internodes representing different stages of internode development of the bioenergy sorghum genotype R.07020.

DESIGN
A developmental time course of four sucessive internodes located in the zone of internode elongation each harvested in triplicate for RNA-seq analysis.
