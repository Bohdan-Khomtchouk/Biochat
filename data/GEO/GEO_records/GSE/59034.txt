TITLE
A Memory for Obesity in Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify transcriptional alterations in subcutaneous human white adipose tissue of post-obese subjects, global gene expression measurements were performed. Three groups, obese before and after bariatric surgery as well as never-obese controls, were compared to dissect candidate genes.

DESIGN
Based on high quality total RNA isolated from human subcutaneous white adipose tissue, gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Obese subjects before (n=16) and after bariatric surgery (n=16) as well as never-obese controls (n=16) were included in the study. Data were preprocessed with the Robust Multichip Average method.
