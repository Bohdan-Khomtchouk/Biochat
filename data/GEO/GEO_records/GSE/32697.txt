TITLE
Thrombospondin-1 type 1 repeats in a model of inflammatory bowel disease: genetic profile and therapeutic effects

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is an anti-angiogenic matricellular protein with regulatory functions in inflammation and cancer. The type 1 repeats (TSR) domains of TSP-1 have been shown to interact with a wide range of proteins that result in the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties of TSP-1. To evaluate potential therapeutic effects of TSRs in inflammatory bowel disease, we conducted clinical, histological and gene microarray analyses on a mouse model of induced colitis. We used Affymetrix GeneChips to determine the changes in the genetic profile underlying TSR-treatment coincident with induction of colitis using DSS. We identified differentially expressed genes among the treatment groups.

DESIGN
Using DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) to induce colitis, wild-type mice were simultaneously injected with either saline or one form of TSP-1 derived peptides, containing either the three domains of the TSR (3TSR), the two last domains (TSR2), or TSR2 with the RFK sequence (TSR2+RFK). Wt mice drinking water only was used as reference.
