TITLE
Linoleic Acid Stimulation of WT Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus USA300-0114

SUMMARY
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections result in more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths in the United States each year and remain an important medical challenge. A key factor of S. aureus pathogenesis is the production of virulence proteins that are secreted into the extracellular matrix damaging host tissues and forming abscesses that may serve as replicative niches for the bacteria. We recently discovered that host-derived cis-unsaturated fatty acids activate the transcription and translation of EsxA, a protein that plays a central role in abscess formation in clinically relevant MRSA strains. Additionally, we discovered that fatty acid stimulation of EsxA is dependent on fakA, a gene that encodes a protein responsible for the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into the S. aureus phospholipid membrane. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of host-fatty-acid-sensing in S. aureus, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on WT Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384, a community-acquired MRSA strain, in the presence and absence of 10μM linoleic acid.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis was performed on WT Staphylococcus aureus USA300 NRS384 in the presence and absence of 10μM linoleic acid. Each condition was performed in triplicate thereby yielding a total of 6 samples for RNA-Seq analysis.
