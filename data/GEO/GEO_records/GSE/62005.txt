TITLE
Regulation of dendritic cell genes by alpha fetoprotein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human dendritic cells (DC) are suppressed by tumor-derived alpha fetoprotein (AFP), but less so by cord blood-derived normal AFP.

DESIGN
We tested human DC from 5 healthy donors for transcriptional changes induced by tumor (tAFP) or cord blood (nAFP) AFP, vs. chicken ovalbumin (OVA) control.
