TITLE
Expression data from murine hematopoietic stem cells isolated from mice treated with control oil or estradiol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The division rate of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are promoted by estradiol. To identify the mechanism by which estradiol regulates HSCs, we performed gene expresssion profiling of HSCs isolated from mice of both sexes treated with either control vehicle (oil) or estradiol for one week.

DESIGN
4 groups were analyzed; 1) HSCs from male mice treated with oil, 2) HSCs from male mice treated with estradiol, 3) HSCs from female mice treated with oil, and 4) HSCs from female mice treated with estradiol. All groups include 3 biological replicates isolated from 3 mice.
