TITLE
Expression data from skin biopsy samples from patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiling sub-study was conducted in which skin biopsy samples were collected from 85 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who were participating in ACCEPT, an IRB-approved Phase 3, multicenter, randomized trial. This analysis identified 4,175 probe-sets as being significantly modulated in psoriasis lesions (LS) compared with matched biopsies of non-lesional (NL) skin.

DESIGN
Skin biopsy samples (n=170) were collected at baseline for RNA extraction and microarray analysis from 85 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis without receiving active psoriasis therapy.  The sample title is concatenated as < sample collection site ID > _ < subject ID > _ < skin type > .
