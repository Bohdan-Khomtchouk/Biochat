TITLE
Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection of AJ, B10.A, CSS3 and B6.chr3AJ (heart tissue day 4)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is a multifactorial process involving host genetics, viral genetics and the environment in which they interact. Here, we used a model of infection with Coxsackievirus B3 to characterize the contribution of host genetics to viral myocarditis. We determined heart CVB3 load in mice from a classical intercross between progenitors A/J (H2a) and  B10.A-H2a (B10.A) of different genetic backgrounds but with a common H2 haplotype. Here we compare whole genome expression patterns in infected and uninfected A/J and B10.A mice in order to determine which gene expression programs are common or distinct to each strain.
