TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (HSC-4, OSC19)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As microarray based gene expression profiling is well suited to study the complex diseases such as cancer, we revealed gene expression changes of two different cell lines.

DESIGN
Human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-4, OSC-19) gene expression was measured.
