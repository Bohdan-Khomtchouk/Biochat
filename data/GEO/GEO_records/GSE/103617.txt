TITLE
Ribosomal profiling of adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To generate gene expression profiles of inguinal white, epididymal white and interscapular brown adipocytes Methods: Translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP) using an adipocyte-specific cre in adult wildtype mice followed by RNA-Seq Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) using Tophat and assembled reads into transcripts using Cufflinks.

DESIGN
ribosomal affinity purified mRNA profiles of adult mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina NextSeq500.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
