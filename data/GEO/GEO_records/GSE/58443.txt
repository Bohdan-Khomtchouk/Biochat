TITLE
Characteristic bimodal profiles of RNA polymerase II at thousands of active mammalian promoters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we present PolII binding profiles from high-coverage ChIP-seq on promoters of actively transcribed genes in mouse and humans. We show that the enrichment of PolII near transcription start sites exhibits a stereotypical bimodal structure, with one peak near active transcription start sites and a second peak 110 base pairs downstream from the first.

DESIGN
High-resolution characterization of PolII at promoters in mouse liver
