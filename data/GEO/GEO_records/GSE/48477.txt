TITLE
Microarray of wild type, Shp2 knock-out, Pten knock-out and double knock-out erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
the gene expression profiling results provide important information for the genes regulated by crosstalk between Shp2 and Pten mediated signal pathways

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from CD71mid Ter119high erythroblasts isolated from the bone marrow of wide type, Shp2 knock-out, Pten knock-out and double knock-out mice

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
