TITLE
Gene expression data for MACS-isolated primary splenic T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are interested in unveiling potential gene expression alterations underlying the T cell-related phenotypes observed in DUSP4-/- mice. We used microarray to obtain a macroscopic views of gene profiles comparing freshly isolated splenic T cells from WT and DUSP4-/- mice

DESIGN
Magnetic-assisted cell sorting isolating T cells to 90-95% purity from freshly prepared splenocytes, followed by immediate RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
