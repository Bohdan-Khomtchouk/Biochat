TITLE
Drosophila adults 0.5% O2 6hr

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Identify genes with increased transcript abundance after low oxygen stress in Drosophila adults. Keywords: hypoxic response

DESIGN
There are 6 Oregon-R experiments comparing low oxygen exposed to normal oxygen.  Samples 1-4 have hypoxic RNA labeled with cy5, and samples 5 & 6 are dye-swaps with the hypoxic RNA labeled with cy3.  Samples 7 & 8 are Sb/Tm3 flies to control for background effects.
