TITLE
Gene expression evaluation of urinary bladder in mouse model of long-term ketamine injection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this cDNA array study is to search for advanced markers related to the pathogenesis of ketamine-induced cystitis. The result revealed a number of gene expressions involved in chronic wound healing response and collagen accumulation, which were closely related to fibrosis progression in the connective tissue of mice urinary bladder.

DESIGN
Both four male and female Balb/c mice were separately distributed into the control (normal saline, two mice) and ketamine (two mice) groups which received ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg/day) daily for a total period of 20 weeks. Subsequently, their urinary bladders were used to acquire expression profiles of 26,423 unique genes, leading to successful determination of the differentially expressed genes and pathways involved in ketamine-induced toxicity.
