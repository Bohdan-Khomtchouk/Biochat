TITLE
Contribution of the scavenger receptor MARCO to TLR-induced activation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain additional insight into the role of MARCO in dendritic cell activation and function, we profiled transcriptomes of mouse splenic dendritic cells obtained from MARCO deficient mice and their wild type counterparts under resting and activating conditions.

DESIGN
Pure dendritic cells from the spleens of WT and MARCO KO mice were cultured overnight in PBS or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix platform.

PLATFORM
