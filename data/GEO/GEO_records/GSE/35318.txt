TITLE
p38a-dependent gene expression in dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in wild-type and p38a-knockout dendritic cells (DCs) were compared. Lymph node dendritic cells were isolated from mice, and left unstimulated and stimulated with Pam3CSK4, a toll-like receptor 2 agonist. C57BL/6 wild-type mice, and dendritic cell-specific p38a-knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background were used for isolation of primary DCs.

DESIGN
Gene expression 0, 2, and 4 h after stimulation was analyzed with each time point in duplicate.
