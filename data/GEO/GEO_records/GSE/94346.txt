TITLE
EC-tagging experiments

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
whole larvae (all tissues) and tissue-specific transcriptome profiling by EC-tagging

DESIGN
Whole larvae (all tissues) tagged EU-RNA was purified from larvae fed 5Eud.  Neural + imaginal disc EU-RNA was purified from 12B08 > CD:UPRT larvae fed 5EC.  Mushroom body EU-RNA was purified from MB247 > CD:UPRT larvae fed 5EC.

PLATFORM
GPL7300 Agilent-018972 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
