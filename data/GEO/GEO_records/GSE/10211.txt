TITLE
Airway Epithelial Cell Response to Sendai virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to establish a profile for gene expression in wild-type airway epithelial cells after paramyxoviral infection. Analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from SeV-infected primary-culture mouse tracheal epithelial cells that were maintained under physiologic conditions (air-liquid interface). Keywords: Treatment Comparison

DESIGN
Primary-culture mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) were established on Transwell membranes using air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions. Sendai virus (SeV), strain 52, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and stored at -70°C. Cultures were inoculated with SeV or an equivalent amount of UV-inactivated SeV (SeV-UV) in the apical compartment for 1 h at 37 °C. Air-liquid-interface conditions were re-established by washing the membrane with PBS. Each culture well was subjected to one of two treatments (SeV, or UV-SeV) for 1 day. N = 4 SeV wells, N = 6 UV-SeV wells, with each well independently analyzed by microarray. No technical replicates were performed, but arrays were evaluated for quality control using the SimpleAffy package (Miller CJ, 2004) in Bioconductor 2.0.
