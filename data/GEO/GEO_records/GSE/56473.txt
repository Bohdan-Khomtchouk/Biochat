TITLE
rd10 transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a photoreceptor disease that affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States. There are currently very limited treatment options and the prognosis for most patients is progressive vision loss. Unfortunately, the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of RP initiation and progression is still poorly understood. However, the development of animal models of RP, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, has provided an opportunity to study the underlying cellular and molecular changes of this disease. Using RNA-Seq, we present the first retinal transcriptome analysis of the rd10 murine model of retinal degeneration.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq on whole-retina samples from rd10, wild-type and GFP-expressing mouse retina. Three biological replicates of each.
