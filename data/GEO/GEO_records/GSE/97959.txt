TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccus denitrificans during aerobic and anaerobic respiration (denitrification)

ORGANISM
Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 wild type incubated in continuous culture (continuous culture (CSTR)) in minimal media with aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The goal was to define the core respiratory genes.

DESIGN
Two growth conditions, three biological replicates of each condition. Each sample hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Paracoccus denitrificans genomic DNA as the comparator/reference, which also acted as a control for spot quality.

PLATFORM
GPL17412 Agilent-026900 Paracoccus denitrificans
