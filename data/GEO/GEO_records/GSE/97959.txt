TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccus denitrificans during aerobic and anaerobic respiration (denitrification)

ORGANISM
Paracoccus denitrificans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 wild type incubated in continuous culture (continuous culture (CSTR)) in minimal media with aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The goal was to define the core respiratory genes.
