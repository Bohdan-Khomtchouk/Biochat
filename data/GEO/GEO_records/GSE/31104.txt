TITLE
Chemosensitization of DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo by demethylating nucleoside analogues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series. Supplementary file [gene expression]: To better approach the delta analysis and find differences between sensitive cell lines and resistant cell lines to doxorubicin, we filtered the gene expression matrix for probes with a greater standard deviation among all samples greater than 0.5. We therefore kept 11842 probesets that we used for the analysis.
