TITLE
Expression Data from Toxoplasma gondii Infected Murine Macrophages and Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to determine how type II versus type III Toxoplasma infection affect host gene expression We infected mouse macrophage (RAW264.7 and J774) and dendritic (DC2.4) cell lines with type II (Me49) and type III (CEP)

DESIGN
cells were grown in T75 until 80% confluency, then infected with parasites for 18 hours at MOI of 7. Then the RNA was harvested from the cells by Trizol.
