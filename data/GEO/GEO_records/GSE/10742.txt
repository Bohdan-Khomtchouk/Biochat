TITLE
Nucleosome Mapping in S. pombe Centromeres

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
A key element for defining the centromere identity is the incorporation of a specific histone H3, CENP-A, known as Cnp1p in S. pombe.  Previous studies have suggested that functional S. pombe centromeres lack nucleosome arrays and may involve chromatin remodeling as a key step of kinetochore assembly.  We used tiling microarrays to show that nucleosomes are in fact positioned in regular intervals in the core of centromere 2, providing the first high resolution map of regional centromere chromatin. Nucleosome locations are not disrupted by mutations in kinetochore proteins cnp1, mis18, mis12, nuf2, mal2, overexpression of Cnp1p, or deletion of ams2.  Bioinformatic analysis of the centromere sequence indicates certain enriched motifs in linker regions between nucleosomes and reveals a sequence-bias in nucleosome positioning.  We conclude that centromeric nucleosome positions are stable and may be derived from the underlying DNA sequence.  In addition, sequence analysis of nucleosome-free regions identifies novel binding sites for the GATA-like protein Ams2p, which participates in CENP-A incorporation. Keywords: Nucleosome Mapping Study

DESIGN
Entire cnt regions and histone-related genes were tiled at 1-5 bp spacing using 60-mer probes.
