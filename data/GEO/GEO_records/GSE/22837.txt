TITLE
Identification of differentially methylated regions between placentas and maternal blood cells on chromosome 18

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of DNA methylation levels of chromosome 18 between placentas and blood cells of pregnant women

DESIGN
Extracted DNA from 5 cases of placental tissues and 5 cases of maternal blood cell was subjected to MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Tiling 2.0R Array sets. A control without immunoprecipitation (IP) was also processed in parallel with the immunoprecipitated DNA samples. The results were validated with bisulfite sequencing and mass spectrometry-based analysis
