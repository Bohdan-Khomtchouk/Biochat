TITLE
Genome-wide identification of transcription factor ATOH1 target genes in adult small intestine and colon (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify targets of ATOH1 binding in the adult intestinal epithelium.

DESIGN
Ileal or colonic crypts were isolated from 10~12 week old adult Atoh1GFP/GFP mice (which express a functional ATOH1::GFP protein and are phenotypically normal) followed by ATOH1, H3K27Ac and H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
