TITLE
Identification of early target genes of the DELLA protein GAI in etiolated seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The hormones gibberellins (GA) control many aspects of plant growth and development thruough the whole life cycle of the plant. For instance, GA participate in the establishment of the skotomorphogenic developmental program that is triggered when seeds germinate in darkness, i.e. under the soil. Under these conditions seedlings appear etiolated and developmental features usually triggered by light are kept repressed. The GA signaling elements GAI and RGA have a major, partially redundant role in this process. These proteins belong to the DELLA family of transcriptional regulators and are destabilized by GA, acting as negative regulators of the pathway. In order to understand the molecular basis of the regulation of the skotomorphogenesis by GA, we sought to identify early target genes of the activity of GAI in etiolated seedlings. For that purpose we analyzed rapid, global changes in gene expression in response to a transient accummulation of a dominant version of GAI, gai-1, which is resistant to GA-induced destabilization.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed using wild type Col-0 and the transgenic line HS:gai-1 that expresses the dominant version gai-1 under the control of the promoter of the HSP18.2 gene, which is highly and rapidly induced at 37ºC. Three biological repeats were performed, and wild type and transgenic samples were labelled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. For each point in the time course (0, 1, 2 and 4h after a 30 minute treatment at 37ºC), a sample from the transgenic line was compared to the corresponding wild type control.
