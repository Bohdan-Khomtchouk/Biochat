TITLE
VDR ChIP-seq in PMA-differentiated macrophages (human M2-type like macrophages)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq in macrophage-type PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells after stimulation with the the natural VDR ligand 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). We identified in total 223 VDR binding locations on chromatin after 1,25D treatment. De novo analysis of VDR site sequences identified DR3-type binding sites as major motif.

DESIGN
PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated for 0, 1 and 2 h  with 100 nM 1,25D

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
