TITLE
siRNA knockdown of GALNT2 in gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the whole genome profile of GALNT2 silenced AGS cells

DESIGN
AGS cells were transfected with non-targeting and GALNT2 specific siRNA with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for 48 hours and extracted for total RNAd
