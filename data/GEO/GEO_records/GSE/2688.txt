TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Dupuytren's Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dupuytren's disease (DD) is characterized by nodular fibroblastic proliferation of the palmar fascia leading to contracture of the hand. We performed a cDNA microarray analysis of DD palmar  cord tissue.  Normal-appearing palmar fascia adjacent to the diseased cord from the same patient and palmar fascia from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release were used as controls.  A type II microarray experiment was used on amplified sample RNA.  Samples were hybridized to arrays containing 42,000 gene elements. Array data was analyzed with the on-line software from the Stanford Microarray Database. A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied.
