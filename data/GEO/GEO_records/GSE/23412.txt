TITLE
Modulation of host gene expression by Hepatitis E virus ORF3 protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human liver cell line (Huh7) infected with HEV ORF3 expressing (Ad-orf3-egfp) and control recombinant adenovirus (Ad-egfp). Hepatitis E virus ORF3 protein (pORF3) is known to modulate the host cell. Results provide insight into the role of this protein for HEV infection and pathogenesis.

DESIGN
The gene expression experiment of Huh7 hepatoma cell line infected with ORF3 expressing recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-orf3-egfp) and with control recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-egfp) was performed in replicates of three.
