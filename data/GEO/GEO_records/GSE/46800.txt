TITLE
Expression data of mouse embryo brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wheather hematopoietic cells contribute to angiogenesis in developing brain, we utilized macrophage deficient mouse embryo. We used microarrays to detect down-regulated genes in KO embryo brain.

DESIGN
KO and WT mouse E10.5 embryo brains were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
