TITLE
Regulation of Gamma globin gene expression by AT2 and its associated proteins through the cAMP response element.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The upstream Gg-globin cAMP-response element (G-CRE) plays a role in regulating Gg-globin expression through binding of CREB1, cJun and ATF2. In this study we identified the ATF2 DNA-binding partners. ATF2 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of g-globin expression accompanied by decreased ATF2 binding to the G-CRE. By contrast, stably expressed ATF2 in K562 cells increased g-globin, which was reduced by ATF2 knockdown. Moreover, a similar role for ATF2 on g-globin expression was observed in primary erythroid progenitors. To understand the role of ATF2 in g-globin expression, chromatographically purified G-CRE/ATF2-interacting proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis; binding partners included CREB1, cJun, Brg1, and histone deacetylases among others. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated interaction of these proteins with ATF2 in CD34+ cells undergoing erythroid differentiation which was correlated with g-globin expression during development. These results suggest synergism between developmental stage-specific recruitments of the ATF2 protein complex and expression of g-globin during erythropoiesis. Microarray studies in K562 cells support additional roles for ATF2 in hematopoiesis and chromatin remodeling
