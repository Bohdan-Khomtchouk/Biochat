TITLE
MicroRNA expression array of 1833 cells: control vs. HMGA2 shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HMGA2 has been implicated in tumor progression. Identification of microRNAs regulated by HMGA2 helps us to understand how HMGA2 regulates tumor metastasis via its downstream target mircoRNAs and genes.
