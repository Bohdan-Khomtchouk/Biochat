TITLE
Gene expression profiling in murine mesenchymal stem cells treated with local anesthetics (ropivacaine)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited from the blood stream to tumors, healing wounds or sites of tissue injury by multiple growth factors and chemokines where they differentiate into e.g. fibroblasts or endothelial cells. Engrafted at the sites of tissue damage, they secrete growth factors and cytokines that facilitate healing. Inhibition of MSC proliferation by prolonged application of local anesthetics (commonly used after surgery) could delay wound closure and promote wound dehiscence.

DESIGN
Culture-expanded bone-marrow-derived murine MSCs wewre treated in vitro with 100 uM ropivacaine for 24 hours (4 samples). Untreated MSCs served as controls.The collected cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and later used for RNA isolation and subsequent microarray hybridization. Gene-level analysis was performed. Exon-level analysis will be also performed.
