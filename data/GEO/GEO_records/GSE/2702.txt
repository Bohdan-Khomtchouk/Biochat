TITLE
Big bluestem/RAMP experiment

ORGANISM
Andropogon gerardii

SUMMARY
On September 13, 2003, leaf tissue was collected from Andropogon gerardii growing in field plots under two precipitation variability treatments:ambient and altered (50% longer interval). cDNA was synthesized, labelled alternately with Cy3 and Cy5 and cross-hybridized to a maize microarray developed in the Schnable lab at Iowa State. Keywords: repeat sample

PLATFORM
GPL1996 Maize cDNA Generation II Version B
