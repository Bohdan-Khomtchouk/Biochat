TITLE
Expression data from environmentally enriched mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Environmental enrichment has been shown to induce wholescale alterations to the gene expression profile of experimental animals we used microarray analysis of whole blood samples taken from mice housed in enriched or standard cage environments to invesigate alterations in imune-modulatory gene expression between these animals

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from whole blood taken from animals subject to 2 weeks in an enriched or standard environment, purified and subject to CIP-SEQ microarray analysis
