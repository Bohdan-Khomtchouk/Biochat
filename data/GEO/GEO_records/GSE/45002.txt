TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of livers of wild type and IL-4/IL-13-/- mice after carbon tetrachloride-induced injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global analysis of differentially expressed genes of livers of wild type and IL-4/IL-13-/- two days after carbon tetrachloride treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated livers from vehicle and carbon tetrachloride administered wild type and IL-4/IL-13-/- mice.
