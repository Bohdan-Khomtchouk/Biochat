TITLE
Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to glucosylated mycotoxin

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The evaluation of mycotoxicity about glucosylated mycotoxin using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. Yeast BY4743 derivative PDR5 mutant was used for this study.

DESIGN
Samples were normalized with the three replicates per condition. Yeast strain was grown in YPD medium with 80 Î¼M of deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside. The same volume of DMSO was added into control samples.
