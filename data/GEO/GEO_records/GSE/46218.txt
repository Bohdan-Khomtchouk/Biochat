TITLE
Expression data from uncastrasion and castration tumor from LNCAP Orhotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecular singnal alterations between androgen dependent prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer, we performed interspecies comparative microarray analyses using RNAs prepared from uncastrasion and castration tumor from LNCAP Orhotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer. microarray data from uncastrasion and castration tumor revealed that the gene expression profile is most significantly altered in between androgen dependent prostate cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer. Comparative analyses of LNCAP Orhotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer showed that genes involved in androgen dependent and androgen independent tumor were significantly altered.

DESIGN
We prepared RNA samples from 4 samples uncastrasion and 4 samples castration tumors from LNCAP Orhotopic xenograft models of prostate cancer . High-quality RNA samples were subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST platform, and only those results that passed examinations for quality assurance and quality control of the Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays were retrieved. In total, we obtained gene expression profiles from the following samples: 4 samples uncastrasion and 4 samples castration tumors
