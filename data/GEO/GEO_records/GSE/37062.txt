TITLE
Murine Spermatogonial Stem Cells: Rapamycin- vs Vehicle-exposed in vivo (2-wk treatment)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male FVB strain mice aged 12-days-old through 26-days-old were administered daily intraperitoneal injections of rapamycin (4mg/kg body weight) or control vehicle (5% Tween-80, 5% PEG-400), beginning at postnatal day (P)12. Mice were euthanized at P26 and their testes were isolated for germ cell enrichment. Single cell suspensions of germ cells were prepared from isolated testes and subjected to magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). This procedure enriches the undifferentiated spermatogonia fraction, which represents the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) population. Total RNA from cells double-positive for the SSC surface markers thymus cell antigen 1, theta (THY1) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 1 (GFRA1) was isolated for gene expression microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used to enrich undifferentiated spermatogonia from a pool of primary testicular cells isolated from 5 littermate rapamycin (RM)-treated male mice and from 5 littermate control vehicle (VEH)-treated male mice. With MACS-enriched cells from pool generating RNA, no technical replicates performed.
