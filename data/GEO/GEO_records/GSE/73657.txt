TITLE
MiRNA analysis of rice seed germination

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we sequenced the sRNAs population from embryos of 0, 12, and 24 HAI rice seeds using next-generation deep sequencing technology. A series of miRNAs were identified, including both known and novel miRNAs. We also predicted the potential targets for the miRNAs. RT-PCR and 5â€™ RACE assay were performed to confirm some deep sequencing and target prediction results. This study provides the unique composition and expressional profiles of miRNAs and their potential regulations in the embryo at the early stages of rice seed germination.

DESIGN
Examination of  miRNA expressional profiles in rice embryo during early stages of seed germination

PLATFORM
GPL9147 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Oryza sativa)
