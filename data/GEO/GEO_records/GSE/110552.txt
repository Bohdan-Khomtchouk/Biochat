TITLE
Unique Circulating MicroRNA profiles in HIV Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to determine the association between extracellular miRs and HIV infection, and have demonstrated unique expression profile of 29 miRs in HIV+ subjects and 34 miRs in elite controllers as compared to HIV- subjects. Elite HIV+ subjects are those  who are HIV+, not on antiretroviral therapy, and with HIV viral load < 200 copies/mL.

DESIGN
Single-center cross-sectional study

PLATFORM
GPL24604 BioMark System with Dynamic Array 96.96 for miRNA RT-qPCR
