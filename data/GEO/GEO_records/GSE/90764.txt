TITLE
Small RNA sequencing at early and late differentiation stages of regeneration of the human airway mucociliary epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of these two datasets was to compare the abundance of canonical miRNA and isomiR sequence in  human airway epithelial cells at   early and late differentiation stages

DESIGN
Human airway epithelial cells  (HAECs) isolated from nasal turbinates of one donor were cultured on collagen-coated permeable filters in an air-liquid interface (Ali). Total RNAs were extracted from undifferentiated (Ali day 4, ALI4) and fully-differentiated stages (Ali day 31, Ali31) of human airway mucociliary epithelium.
