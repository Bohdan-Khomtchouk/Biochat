TITLE
Gene expression assessed by genome wide hybridization bead array in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) isolated from small intestinal biopsies of celiac disease  patients with active disease and clinical controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of role of small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the immunopathology of celiac disease

DESIGN
Five samples of purified IELs from duodenal mucosa of CD patients with active disease, 3  samples of purified IELs of clinical controls were individually subjected to genome-wide hybridization bead array analysis for gene expression.
