TITLE
Cryptococcal H99 cells grown in 8 conditions for capsule induction

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans

SUMMARY
To understand the relationship between gene expression and capsule formation, H99 cells were cultured overnight at 37ºC in the following eight conditions: low iron medium with or without both 500 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 10 mM bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS); phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with or without 10% v/v fetal bovine serum; Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (from Sigma) in ambient air or 5% CO2; and Littman's medium with either 0.01 µg/ml or 1 µg/ml thiamine.
