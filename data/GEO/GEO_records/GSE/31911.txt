TITLE
Cryptococcal H99 cells grown in 8 conditions for capsule induction

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
To understand the relationship between gene expression and capsule formation, H99 cells were cultured overnight at 37ºC in the following eight conditions: low iron medium with or without both 500 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 10 mM bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS); phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with or without 10% v/v fetal bovine serum; Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (from Sigma) in ambient air or 5% CO2; and Littman's medium with either 0.01 µg/ml or 1 µg/ml thiamine.

DESIGN
All samples were hybridized against a common reference pool of total RNA.  Three biological replicates were performed for each growth condition, with the exception of growth in DMEM.
