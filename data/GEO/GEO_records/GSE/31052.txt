TITLE
SAGA and ATAC histone acetyl transferase complexes regulate distinct sets of genes and ATAC defines a class of p300-independent enhancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metazoan SAGA and ATAC are distinct multi-subunits complexes that share the same catalytic HAT subunit (GCN5 or PCAF). Here we show that these human HAT complexes are targeted to different genomic loci representing functionally distinct regulatory elements both at broadly expressed and tissue specific genes. While SAGA can principally be found at promoters, ATAC is recruited to promoters and enhancers, yet only its enhancer binding is cell-type specific. Furthermore, we show that ATAC functions at a set of enhancers that are not bound by p300, revealing a new class of enhancers not yet identified. These findings demonstrate important functional differences between SAGA and ATAC coactivator complexes at the level of the genome and define a novel role for the ATAC complex in the regulation of a set of enhancers.

DESIGN
Examination of SPT20 in two different cell types.
