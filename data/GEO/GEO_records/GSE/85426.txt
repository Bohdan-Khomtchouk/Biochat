TITLE
Peripheral blood gene expression as a biomarker for early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression profile of Alzheimer's disease, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to   identify genes with the potential biomarker for early disease detection

DESIGN
Total RNA from peripheral blood cells was extracted, reverse-transcribed and labelled, then analysed for gene expression using GeneSpring GX12 (Agilent Technologies, USA). About 180 samples (AD=90, Non-demented control=90) was used for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL14550 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name Version)
