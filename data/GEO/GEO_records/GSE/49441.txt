TITLE
IFN-alpha- and IFN-gamma-regulated transcription in MEFs derived from wild type mice or littermates expressing STAT1F77A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type (WT) and knockin littermates expressing STAT1F77A (KI). For both genotypes, untreated control cells were compared to cells treated with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments; untreated versus IFN treated
