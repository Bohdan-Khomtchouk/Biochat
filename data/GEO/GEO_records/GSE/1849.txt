TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in Pulmonary Artery Endothelial Cells Exposed to Sickle Cell Plasma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical variability in sickle cell disease (SCD) suggests a role for extra-erythrocytic factors in the pathogenesis of vasoocclusion. We hypothesized that one potential factor, endothelial dysfunction, results from induction of phenotypic changes by circulating factors in SCD patients. The database reports gene expression in cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) exposed to plasma from: a) sickle acute chest syndrome (ACS) patients (samples ; b) SCD patients at steady-state and c) normal volunteers using microarrays (U133A-B GeneChip Affymetrix).
