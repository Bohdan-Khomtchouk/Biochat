TITLE
miRNA expression in CD4+CD25- conventional (Tconv) and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling in highly purified murine CD4+ Tconv and Treg cells. FoxP3-GFP-hCre1a(high) reporter mice were used to separate both populations based on surface markers and presence or absence of GFP.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Tconv vs. Treg. Biological replicates: 1 Tconv, 1 Treg, purified from the same pooled mice. One replicate on 1 array.

PLATFORM
GPL13960 UCSF Exiqon MirCury V9.2 array
