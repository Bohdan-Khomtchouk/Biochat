TITLE
Dynamic genome-wide transcriptional response of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells to IL-6 and Il-10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single cell timecourse experiments demonstrated that though IL-6 and IL-10 activate STAT3, they generate different temporal patterns of activation, with IL-6 generating a transient activation of STAT3, and IL-10 generating a sustained STAT3 response. We hypothesized that these different STAT3 activation dynamics would dictate the differing cellular responses to the two cytokines.

DESIGN
Human monocyte-derived denditic cells from four different donors were treated with IL-6 or IL-10 for either 0min, 45min, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, or 12hr. Total RNA was isolated from each sample and used for gene expression analysis.
