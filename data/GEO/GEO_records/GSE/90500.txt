TITLE
Circulating microRNAs as a signature predicting the occurrence of Acute Mountain Sickness before exposure to high altitude

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common disabling condition in individuals experiencing high altitudes, which may progress to life-threatening high altitude cerebral edema. Today, no established biomarkers are available for prediction of AMS and Non-AMS individuals before exposure to high altitude.MicroRNAs emerge as promising sensitive and specific biomarkers for a variety of diseases. Thus, we sought to identify circulating microRNAs suitable for prediction the susceptible of AMS before exposure to high altitude. A total of 31 microRNAs were differentially expressed between AMS and Non-AMS groups, 15 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated. Up-regulation of miR-369-3p, miR-449b-3p, miR-136-3p, and miR-4791 in patients with AMS compared with Non-AMS individuals were quantitatively confirmed using qPCR (all, P < 0.001).  A unique signature encompassing miR-369-3p, miR-449b-3p, and miR-136-3p discriminate AMS from Non-AMS (area under the curve 0.986, 95%CI 0.970-1.000, P < 0.001, LR+: 14.21, LR-: 0.08). This signature yielded a 92.68% sensitivity and a 93.48% specificity for AMS vs. Non-AMS.The study here, for the first time, describes a signature of three circulating microRNAs as a robust biomarker to differentiate AMS from Non-AMS individuals.

DESIGN
we enrolled 109 healthy man adults, 22 individuals randomly selected for microarray assay, the remained 87 volunteers for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test. A total of 31 microRNAs were differentially expressed between AMS and Non-AMS groups, 15 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated. After microRNA profiling, up-regulation of miR-369-3p, miR-449b-3p, miR-136-3p, and miR-4791 in patients with AMS compared with Non-AMS individuals were quantitatively confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (all, P < 0.001).
