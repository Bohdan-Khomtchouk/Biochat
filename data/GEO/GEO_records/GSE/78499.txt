TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of aging mouse meibomian glands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing of young and old mouse eyelids identified a number of signaling pathways, including FGF and Wnt that were altered in meibomian glands and conjunctiva of aging mice.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from frozen eyelid tissue excised from young and old mice was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
