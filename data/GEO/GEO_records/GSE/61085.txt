TITLE
Expression data from Soma dissected from single-cell rat Hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To assess neuronal expression divergence between mice and rats, we used the Affymetrix array platform to assay the transcriptomes of micro-dissected individual soma and pool of dendrites of hippocampal neurons in dispersed primary cell cultures from  rat and  mouse.

DESIGN
Using microdissected soma and dendrites from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons of two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) and one rat strain (Sprague-Dawley), we investigate via microarrays, subcellular localization of mRNAs in neurons
