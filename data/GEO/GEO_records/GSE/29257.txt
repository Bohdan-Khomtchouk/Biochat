TITLE
Differential gene expression in immortal DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cell line

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells comparing CEF derived immortal chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF-1). Goal was to determine differentially expressed genes of CEF which were changed responding DF-1.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, CEF vs. DF-1. Biological replicates: 1 control CEF sample, 1 DF-1 experimental sample.
