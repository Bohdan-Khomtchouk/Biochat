TITLE
Expression Analysis of 17 human T-ALL cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using array CGH and fiber-FISH, we found that several human T-ALL have tandem duplication of the MYB gene on one allele, we used microarray gene expression analysis to determine if increased MYB expression correlates with gene duplication Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
RNA from 17 T-ALL cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
