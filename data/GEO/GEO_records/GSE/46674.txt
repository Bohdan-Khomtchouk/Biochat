TITLE
Expression data from Salix matsudana

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Salt responsive genes were identified in chinese willow (Salix matsudana) after the plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl. for 48 hours We used microarrays to identify genes responsible for combating salt stress. Those up-regulated during the NaCl treatment may protect the plants from damages caused by salt stress.
