TITLE
Expression data from Salix matsudana

ORGANISM
Salix matsudana

SUMMARY
Salt responsive genes were identified in chinese willow (Salix matsudana) after the plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl. for 48 hours We used microarrays to identify genes responsible for combating salt stress. Those up-regulated during the NaCl treatment may protect the plants from damages caused by salt stress.

DESIGN
2 month-old S. matsudana plants which were treated with 100 mM NaCl and control plants were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain salt responsive genes that protect the plants from stress injury.Those differentially expressed genes identified by the microarray would help to understand the mechanism of S. matsudana reacting to salt stress.
