TITLE
Adipose, dermis and neural embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective is to study gene expression between potential adult stem cells isolated from dermis and adipose tissue compared to embryonic neural stem cells. Tissue was enzymatically digested and cells were seeded into a tissue culture flask. After 4 days, cells that had grown in suspension were passaged, harvested (by sedimentation, mechanically triturated and replated. Seven days later, cells were passaged again and RNA isolated after another 7 days. Keywords: other
