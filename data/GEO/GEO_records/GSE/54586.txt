TITLE
AICAR can modulate the expression of microRNA in J1 mESC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have demonstrated AICAR can maintain J1 mouse ES cells pluripotency in our previous research, yet its effects on ES cells miRNAs expression remain a mystery. In this study, we performed small RNA (sRNA) High-throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 to investigate the influence of AICAR on J1 mouse ES cells miRNAs expression and further found the mechanism of how miRNAs affect ES cells pluripotency maintenance. Samples that treated by DMSO is used as a control.

DESIGN
Compare microRNA expression of J1 mESC cultured with or without small molecule AICAR

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
