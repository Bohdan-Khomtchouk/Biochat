TITLE
The APSES Transcription factor Efg1 regulates a novel phenotype switch in Candida parapsilosis [ChIP-seq].

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
We use ChIP-seq to identify the targets of Efg1 in Candida parapsilosis. We show that Efg1 binds to 502 promoter regions, including 70 potential transcription factors or regulatory proteins. Several of the transcription factors belong to networks that regulate biofilm development and white-opaque switching in C. albicans. Efg1 also binds to its own promoter. The binding site for C. parapsilosis Efg1 resembles that of orthologs in other fungi. Many Efg1 targets are probably also regulated by the Ndt80 transcription factor.

DESIGN
Efg1 in C. parapsilosis was tagged in situ using a myc epitope. Examination of Efg1-myc DNA binding sites by ChIP-seq. Three immunoprecipitated samples were sequenced and three input samples (pre-immunoprecipitation) were sequenced as controls.
