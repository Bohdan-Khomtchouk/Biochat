TITLE
Rlf, a widely-spaced zinc finger protein, is involved in maintaining epigenetic marks at CpG island shores and enhancer elements across the genome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently identified a novel protein, Rearranged L-myc fusion (Rlf), that is required for DNA hypomethylation (and transcriptional activity) at certain regions of the mouse genome known to be sensitive to epigenetic gene silencing. Here we report the analysis of 12 whole genome bisulphite sequencing datasets across three different embryonic tissues/stages from mice with and without Rlf. We find that its absence has effects at thousands of differentially methylated regions.

DESIGN
Whole genome bilsulphite sequencing, RNAseq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq for wild type and mice homozygous null for Rlf (MommeD28/MommeD28)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
