TITLE
Expression profiling of tumor cells from MYCN-driven neuroblastoma upon BRD4 or AURKA inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amplification of MYCN is the most prominent genetic marker of high-stage neuroblastoma, a childhood tumor originating from the neural crest. We generated a cell line (mNB-A1) from tumors developed in transgenic mouse and treated these cells with DMSO (n=6), the BRD4-inhibitor JQ1 (n=3) or the AURKA-inhibitor MLN8237 (n=3) for 24 h.

DESIGN
The expression profiles of vehicle (DMSO)-treated mNB-A1 cells were compared to JQ1- or MLN8237-treated mNB-A1 cells.
