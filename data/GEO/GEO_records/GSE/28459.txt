TITLE
Mechansisms of resistance to decitabine in myelodysplastic syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investiage global methylation changes between patients at diagnosis and after relapse by CpG island methylation microarray analysis and determine the role of gene-specific methylation associated with relapse of cancer patients.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Biological replicates: 2 biological replicates and 2 samples from the same methylated CpG island amplification (MCA).

PLATFORM
GPL13380 Agilent-017278 whole human genome custom 4Ã—44k array [alternate hg17 annotation]
