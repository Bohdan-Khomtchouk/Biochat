TITLE
Characterization of human breast cancer xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A bank of human breast tumor xenografts was established by serial passage of primary breast tumor fragments in the cleared mammary fat pads of immuno-compromised NOD-SCID-IL2Rgammac–/– mice. The 15 expression profiles from five different tumors were classified using the ClaNC method [1]. The training data set consisted of 94 samples from Herschkowitz et al. [2]; class labels were based on tumor subtype (Basal-like, Luminal A, Luminal B, Claudin-low, HER2+/ER- and Normal breast-like).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from xenograft tumors from 5 different patients have been profiled in triplicate on the Illumina HT-12 BeadChip platform.
