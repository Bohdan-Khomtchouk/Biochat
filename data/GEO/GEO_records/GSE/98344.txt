TITLE
The unique C-terminal and N-terminal sequences of MT3 on gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7 cells were transfected with various metallothionein gene constructs with contain the insertion or the removal of the unique MT3 C- and N-terminal domains. The goal of this study was to determine how the global gene expression of the unique C- and N- terminal domains of MT3 was correlated to phenotypic properties of the cells.

DESIGN
Various gene constructs that were made by the alteration of the unqiue MT3 N- and C-terminal region have been stably transfected into the MCF-7 cells. Each gene construct was repeated in triplicate for array analysis.
