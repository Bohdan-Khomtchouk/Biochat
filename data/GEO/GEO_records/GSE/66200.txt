TITLE
High-throughput RNA-sequencing analysis in human glioma stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be associated with the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells that have different functional characteristics. To investigate gene expression including lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) in GSC, we have performed high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment using Illumina GAIIx.

DESIGN
Profiles of gene expression including lncRNA in GSC were generated by RNA-seq using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
