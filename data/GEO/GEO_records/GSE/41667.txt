TITLE
Effects of TSLP challenge on airway inflammation in naïve and OVA-sensitized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TSLP is believed to play a role in allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, through its activation of dendritic cells which later promote the induction of inflammatory Th2 cells. We sought to characterize the inflammatory response induced by TSLP challenge in naive and OVA-sensitized mice using gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Naïve and OVA-sensitized animals were given increasing doses of TSLP (Saline, Buffer alone, 150 ng TSLP, 500 ng TSLP and 1500 ng TSLP) and sacrificed 6 and 24 hours post-challenge. 8 animals were used for each sensitization-dose-time point combination.
