TITLE
Expression data from kidney and liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression differences between the liver and kidney of an adult male (homo sapien) were investigated using three technical replicates. The purpose of the experiment was to compare array data generated using Affymetrix with measures of expression obtained using RNAseq (a sequencing approach for measuring expression that utilizes Solexa technology). Keywords: kidney, liver

DESIGN
RNA samples from the liver and kidney were extracted within 6 hours post mortem. Aliquots of mRNA were extracted and hybridized to three Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (three technical replicates). The purpose of the study was to compare the Affymetrix array data with expression results obtained from RNAseq (Solexa)
