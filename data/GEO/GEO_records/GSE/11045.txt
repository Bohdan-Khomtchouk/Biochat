TITLE
Expression data from kidney and liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression differences between the liver and kidney of an adult male (homo sapien) were investigated using three technical replicates. The purpose of the experiment was to compare array data generated using Affymetrix with measures of expression obtained using RNAseq (a sequencing approach for measuring expression that utilizes Solexa technology). Keywords: kidney, liver
