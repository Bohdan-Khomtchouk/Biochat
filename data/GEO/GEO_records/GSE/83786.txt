TITLE
JUNB is a critical AP1 component for SMAD2/3 binding after TGFβ stimulation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed SMAD2/3 ChIP-seq analysis in MCF10A MII cells. To validate whether the changes in SMAD2/3 binding to the genome indeed resulted in changes in target gene expression, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome analysis after short and long periods of TGFβ stimulation (0, 1.5h and 16h) in MII cells. In addition, we revealed that JUNB is a critical AP1 component for SMAD2/3 binding after TGFβ stimulation. To assess the significance of JUNB for TGFβ-SMAD-target genes on a genome-wide scale, we also performed RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in JUNB-knock-downed MII cells.
