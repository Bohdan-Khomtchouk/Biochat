TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in liver after insulin receptor antagonist S961 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Insulin receptor antagonist S961 induces pancreatic beta cell replication. Microarray anaysis was performed in liver to find genes that may mediate beta cell replication.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with either vehicle (PBS) or S961 (10nMol/week) for a week, the total RNA from liver was isolated and then subjected to illumina microarray analysis.
