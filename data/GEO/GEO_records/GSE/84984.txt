TITLE
Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA) in matched colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed, by HTA 2.0, colorectal adenocarcinoma samples and matched normal colonic tissues in order to determine the whole transcriptome expression levels. Three widely used colorectal cancer cell lines were also analyzed. Results provided insights into the regulation, at transcript level, of genes involved in copper homeostasis.

DESIGN
9 tumoral bioptic samples, deriving from 6 patients, were collected directly after surgical resection. The mean age was 72 years (SD 13.73) for 5 female patients and the only male patient was 73 years-old. In 3 patients, two samples were taken at arbitrary positions in the tumor area, separated by at least 1 cm (double-sampling pairs, indicated as tumoral sample 1 or 2). In 6 cases biopsies of adjacent normal mucosa (at distance of 3-6 cm from the tumor) were also collected (matched tumor/mucosa pairs).
