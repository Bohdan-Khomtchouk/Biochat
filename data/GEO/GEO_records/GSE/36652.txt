TITLE
comparison_cul4_as_dark_light-Functional analysis of the SKP2 and CUL4 proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-04_skp2_cul4 - comparison_cul4_as_dark_light - Antisense and mutants of the SKP2 and CUL4 genes are compared to the Wt in order to identify the genes controlled by those SCF proteins. - The seeds have been sown every two days on MS 255 (Duschefa) without adding sugar. These plates stayed 2 days in the dark at 4°C. Then they got a 8 hours light induction (light induction of germination) and then back to the dark for 5 more days.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - gene knock out,normal vs antisense mutant comparison
