TITLE
Exposure of human A549 and THP-1 cells and mouse J774 cells to single walled carbon nanotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray investigations were part of a toxicological investigation of the effect of exposure to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to macrophages and non-phagocytotic cells The results of this study are accepted for publication in Toxicological Research with the title: The toxic effects of single-wall carbon nanotubes are linked to the phagocytic ability of cells

DESIGN
Cell lines were treated for 24 hours either with water (vehicle control) or SWCNTs for 24 hours and the toxic effects were investigated including gene expression changes by affymetrix microarrays.
