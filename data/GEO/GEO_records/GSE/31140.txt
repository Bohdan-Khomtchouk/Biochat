TITLE
E.coli response to Antimicrobial Arylamides

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We treated logarithmically growing cultures of E.coli with a sub-lethal dose of an antimicrobial arylamide compound (PMX 10070) and Polymyxin B sulfate to measure transcriptional responses in an effort to understand mechanism of action Treated samples were assayed at time = 20min and time = 60min after arylamide and polymyxin B exposure

DESIGN
E.coli were isolated and RNA extracted at different time points after exposure to arylamide, polymyxin B or control
