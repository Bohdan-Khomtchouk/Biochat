TITLE
Expression profiling of secondary wild type (WT) and Ezh2-null murine MLL-AF9 AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluated gene expression changes in secondary recipient murine leukemia caused by retroviral overexpression of MLL-AF9. We compared wild-type (WT) leukemia cells with mutant leukemia cells after cre-mediated inactivation of a homozygous conditional allele for Ezh2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2.

DESIGN
For WT cells, 4 biological replicates were hybridized. For Ezh2-null cells, 5 biological replicates were hybridized.
