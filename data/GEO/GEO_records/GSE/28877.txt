TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in metallopanstimulin-1 knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the differentially expressed genes in metallopanstimulin-1 (MPS-1) knockdown gastric cancer cells compared with negative control ones, we employed the microarray profiling analysis. MPS-1 was knockdown by retroviral interfering system in human gastric adenocarcinoma originated cell SGC7901 and the transfectants named P4, while the negative control named NC. Genes with greater than 1.5-fold change and P-value ＜0.05 were identified as differentially expressed genes between NC and P4 cells. Among those, apoptotic related gene (Gadd45β, cIAP2, Bcl2, CAD, Bid, etc) and adhesive related genes (integrin beta 4, ECM2, etc) were quantified by real-time PCR as well as western blotting.

DESIGN
The two groups of negative control (NC) and MPS-1 knockdown gastric cancer cells (P4) were harvested after puromycin screening. Three independent experiments were performed for each group.
