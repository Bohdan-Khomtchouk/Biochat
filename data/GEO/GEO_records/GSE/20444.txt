TITLE
S. cerevisiae TAF5 and taf5 temperature conditional mutants grown at permissive and non-permissive temperature

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TAF5 and taf5 temperature conditional mutants grown at permissive and non-permissive temperature. Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Saccharomyces cerevisae taf5-17, taf5-45, taf5-408 and taf5-10.4 mutants, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into the strains confer temperature conditional growth. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Layer et. al., 2010.

DESIGN
A twenty chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate wild-type cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and four separate cultures for each of four taf5 temperature conditional mutants (16 mutant cultures).  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,777 genes from Saccharomyces S288C with eight 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
