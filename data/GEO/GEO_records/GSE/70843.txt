TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of bri1-5 and its suppressors brs1-1D, bak1-1D, bri1-1D

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
bri1-5 is a weak mutant of Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1). Suppressors by activation tagging bri1-1D, brs1-1D and bak1-1D can recover bri1-5 phenotype. We use microarray to investigate which pathways or functional categories have been transcriptionally regulated by bri1-1D, brs1-1D and bak1-1D.

DESIGN
Whole seedlings from wild-type (WS2), bri1-5, bri1-5/brs1-1D, bri1-5/bak1-1D, bri1-5/bri1-1D. Three biological replicates for each genotype.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
