TITLE
Gene expression timecourse from Dengue virus infected human endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dengue viruses cause two severe diseases that alter vascular fluid barrier functions, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). While the mechanisms that lead to vascular permeability are unknown, the endothelium plays a central role in regulating fluid and cellular efflux from capillaries. Thus, dysregulation of endothelial cells functions by dengue virus infection may contribute to pathogenesis and severe disease. We used microarrays to investigate the effect of dengue virus infection on gene expression within primary human endothelial cells at various times post infection and identified numerous upregulated antiviral and immune response genes.

DESIGN
Early passage primary endothelial cells (HUVECs) were mock infected (no virus) or infected with dengue virus and total RNA collected at 3 timepoints: 12, 24, and 48 hours post infection. Multiple timepoints were analyzed to identify changes in gene expression levels over time. Gene expression from both mock infected and dengue virus infected endothelial cells was evaluated to determine fold induction at each timepoint.
