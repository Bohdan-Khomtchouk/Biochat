Gene expression analysis of pre-defined sets of neoplastic tissues

SUMMARY
To identify a group of genes, characteristic of a single neoplasia and determinant for the risk to relapse, we have performed gene expression analysis of ductal breast carcinoma samples using Affymetrix oligonucletide microarray (HU133A). Biopses from 60 patients, 30 good prognosis (desease free from six to ten years after surgical treatment) and 30 poor prognosis, have been analyzed. From each group we have created six homogeneous pools to show, during the analysis, only genes expressed in a greatly different way. A reduced number of cases has been used to avoid dilution of genes expressed only in few samples. Analysis have identified 77 candidate genes with a specific ontological distribution that contained some genes that were linked to breast cancer by previous studies. Microarray results validation has been performed by real-time PCR analysis on  127 single cases of breast cancer. Gene function study and literature data allow to define our candidate genes as potential markers of prognosis. Keywords: Breast cancer gene expression analysis
