TITLE
Global transcription profiles of Trichophyton rubrum in response to Flucytosine

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to 5-Flucytosine were determined. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
The expression profiles of Trichophyton rubrum treated with 5-Flucytosine were compared to those of Trichophyton rubrum without drug. Each treatment has three replicates.
