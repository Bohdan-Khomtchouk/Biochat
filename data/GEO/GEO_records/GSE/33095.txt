TITLE
Identification of Prognostic Genes for Recurrent Risk Prediction in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients in Taiwan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discrepancies in the prognosis of triple negative breast cancer exist between Caucasian and Asian populations.  Yet, the gene signature of triple negative breast cancer specifically for Asians has not become available.  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a prediction model for recurrence of triple negative breast cancer in Taiwanese patients.

DESIGN
Whole genome expression profiling of breast cancers from 185 patients in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008 was performed, and the results were compared to the previously published literature to detect differences between Asian and Western patients.  Pathway analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were applied to construct a prediction model for the recurrence of triple negative breast cancer. Most expression data of samples (181/185) were reanalyzed from previous studies already uploaded to GEO (see " reanalysis of " links below). Four additional gene expression profiling data of triple negative breast cancer sample were added to this study.
