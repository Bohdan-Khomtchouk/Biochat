Gene expression profiling of mouse mast cells exposed to different cancer cell supernatants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Na√Øve mast cells were cultured from murine bone marrow using incubation with IL-3 alone (samples 1-4) or IL-3 and KITL (samples 5-8).

DESIGN
IL-3 only or IL-3/KITL-matured bone marrow-derived mast cells were exposed to non-conditioned, or various mouse tumor cell line conditioned media.
