TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling and analysis on high-charge and energy particle irradiated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism whereby irradiated cells influence the outcome of DSB repair in their non-irradiated neighbors, we performed whole genome expression profiling.

DESIGN
Total of 9 samples are analyzed, including 0, 0.3 and 1.0 Gy dose groups, each with 3 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
