TITLE
Human islets exposed to cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the context of T1 Diabetes, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ are known to contribute to β-cell apoptosis; The measurement of mRNA expression following β-cell exposure to these cytokines gives a picture of the changes in gene expression characterizing the path to β-cell dysfunction and death.

DESIGN
Human islets were isolated and exposed (or not) to IL-1β and IFN-γ. The samples were collected at various time points for profiling with Affymetrix arrays. These measurements were performed three times.
