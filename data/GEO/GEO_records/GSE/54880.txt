TITLE
Microarray-based DNA methylation profiling of medulloblastoma and normal cerebellum samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Robust molecular subgrouping and copy-number profiling of medulloblastoma from small amounts of archival tumor material. Validation of patterns identified by whole-genome bisulphite sequencing in a larger cohort.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles of 276 primary medulloblastoma and 8 normal cerebellum control samples were generated from fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material using the Illumina 450k methylation array.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
