SUMMARY
Purpose: The JBR.10 trial demonstrated benefit from adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine (ACT) in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that expression profiling may identify stage-independent subgroups who might benefit from ACT. Patients and Methods: Gene expression profiling was conducted on mRNA from 133 frozen JBR.10 tumor samples (62 observation [OBS], 71 ACT). The minimum gene set that was selected for the greatest separation of good and poor prognosis patient subgroups in OBS patients was identified. The prognostic value of this gene signature was tested in four independent published microarray data sets and by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: A 15-gene signature separated OBS patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival (hazard ratio [HR], 15.02; 95% CI, 5.12 to 44.04; P .001; stage I HR, 13.31; P .001; stage II HR, 13.47; P .001). The prognostic effect was verified in the same 62 OBS patients where gene expression was assessed by qPCR. Furthermore, it was validated consistently in four separate microarray data sets (total 356 stage IB to II patients without adjuvant treatment) and additional JBR.10 OBS patients by qPCR (n 19). The signature was also predictive of improved survival after ACT in JBR.10 high-risk patients (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.63; P .0005), but not in low-risk patients (HR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.22 to 11.06; P = .0133; interaction P .001). Significant interaction between risk groups and ACT was verified by qPCR. Conclusion: This 15-gene expression signature is an independent prognostic marker in early-stage, completely resected NSCLC, and to our knowledge, is the first signature that has demonstrated the potential to select patients with stage IB to II NSCLC most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/vinorelbine.

DESIGN
A total of 133 non-small cell lung cancer samples was profiled for gene expression by using Affymetrix U133A platform. Raw cel data were preprocessed by RMA v0.5. The assocaition of individual gene with patients' prognosis was evoluated by Cox proportional hazards model and genes with p value of less than 0.005 were preselected and then a 15-gene signature was selected using MARSA algorithm. The prognostic value of the 15-gene signature was subsequently validated in silico in 4 independent data sets. Its predictiveness for adjuvant chemotherapy was validated in cases not being included in the training set by qPCR.
