TITLE
Identification of GSNO response network in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This project used transcriptomic analysis of the S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) response in E. coli, and associated regulatory mutants, to identified the molecular targets of and response to GSNO during aerobic growth in minimal media. Keywords: Comparative genomic response

DESIGN
Samples were treated with either 100 or 500 micromolar GSNO and the 5-minute response was analyzed.  The resulting transcriptome data was analyzed with network component analysis (NCA) to identify perturbed regulators and pathways.
