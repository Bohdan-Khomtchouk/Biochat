TITLE
Dysregulation of the colonic mucosally-adherent microbiota associates with HIV disease progression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV is known to severely affect the gastrointestinal immune system, in particular compartments of immunity that regulate gut microbial composition. Furthermore, recent studies in mice have shown that dysregulation of the gut microbiome can contribute to chronic inflammation, which is a hallmark of HIV and is thought to fuel disease progression. We sought to understand whether the gut microbial community differs in HIV-infected subjects, and whether such putative differences are associated with disease progression. We found that dysbiosis in the gut mucosally-adherent bacterial community associates with markers of chronic inflammation and disease progression in HIV-infected subjects, and this dysbiosis remains in many subjects undergiong antiretroviral therapy.

DESIGN
We used G3 PhyloChip microarrays (commercially available from Second Genome, Inc.) to profile gut bacteria in rectosigmoid biopsies from 32 subjects: 6 HIV-infected viremic untreated (VU), 18 HIV-infected subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 1 HIV-infected long-term non-progressor that is untreated (LTNP), and 9 HIV-uninfected subjects (HIV-).
