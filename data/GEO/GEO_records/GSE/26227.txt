TITLE
Differential expression of keratin genes in regenerating digit of C57Bl/6 versus MRL/MpJ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of genes encoding multiple keratin- and keratin-associated proteins varies between C57BL/6 and MRL/MpJ (superhealer) mice following digit amputation.  We characterized changes in gene expression by microarray analysis of regenerating digits in these mice at various timepoints following surgical amputation.  These changes were validated by quantitative rtPCR analyses.

DESIGN
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from regenerating mouse digits following surgical amputation as well unamputated digits (total 24 samples). These data are used to obtain genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups of digits.
