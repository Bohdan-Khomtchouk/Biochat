TITLE
High-throughput transcriptome sequencing of an AML-M2 patient in two stages: primary tumor and remission.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to detect the transcriptomic differences during chemotherapy treatment of de novo AML, we adopted massively parallel pyrosequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) using blood tissues of an patient with AML (FAB subtype M2) in tumor stage and remission stage. We obtained a total of 34.6 and 30.8 million paired reads from the two samples. The RNA-seq data derived from the sample illustrated the differentially expression genes between the two stages.

DESIGN
Blood samples of an AML-M2 patient in two stages examined: primary tumor and chemotherapy induced remission.
