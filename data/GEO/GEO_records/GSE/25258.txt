TITLE
Cells isolated from diaphragm of mdx mouse: satellite cells vs. PDGFRa+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse skeletal muscle-derived cells comparing satellite cells with PDGFRa+ cells. Satellite cells and PDGFRa+ cells were directly isolated from diaphragm of dystrophic mdx mouse by FACS.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, satellite cells vs. PDGFRa+ cells. Freshly isolated. One replicate per array.
