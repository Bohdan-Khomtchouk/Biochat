TITLE
Characterization of pro- and anti-inflammatory activation states in embryonic stem cell derived microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cell derived microglia (ESdM) were treated with different inflammatory stimulants to analyze their ability to adopt different activation states. These were characterized using ELISA, flow cytometry, quantitative real time PCR, and RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
Analysis of cytokine secretion, cell surface marker, gene expression, and RNA-seq expression data of differentially activated ESdM
