TITLE
Logical modelling of lymphoid and myeloid cell specification and trans-differentiation [ChIPseq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify nez putative transcriptionnal regulations controlling the specification of B cell and Macrophage, we performed ChIPSeq in a pre-B cell line containing an inducible form of the transcription factor C/EBPa (C10). We performed ChIP-seq against Foxo1 in uninduced b cell, and for Ebf1 in uninduced or after several times of C/EBPa induction.

DESIGN
Genome binding/occupancy of transcription factor Pu1 and histones (H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27me3) by ChIPseq in uninduced Bcell (Control), after induction Cebpa for 6h (Pulse) and after 6 days of wash (Chase).
