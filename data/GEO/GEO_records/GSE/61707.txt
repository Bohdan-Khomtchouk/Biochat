TITLE
Smo and Ets-2 signaling in fibroblasts effects gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments aim determine the effects of Smo and Ets-2 signaling on fibroblast gene expression.

DESIGN
To achieve this, we used a genetic model in which Smo or Ets-2 was conditionally deleted in stromal fibroblasts in a Kras-driven mouse model ofpancreatic cancer. We isolated fibroblasts from pancreata mice with either wild type, Smo null, or Ets-2 null fibroblasts.
