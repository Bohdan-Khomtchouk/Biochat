TITLE
The genes associated with the response to S-1,cisplatin and docetaxel combination chemotherapy (DCS therapy) for metastatic gastric cancer:

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the effort in defining the molecular mechanisms for the drug resistance, predictors of response to chemotherapy have yet to be developed in gastric cancer. With microarray of whole human genes, we determined 29 genes associated with the response to cisplatin and docetaxel combination chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer.

DESIGN
We obtained Fresh-frozen samples of tumor tissue and background gastric mucosa tissue from 19 patients with gastric cancer by endoscopic biopsy before DCS therapy. Total RNA was extracted from individual microdissected populations of cancer cells and background mucosa cells using RNAeasy mini kits and amplified with a random primer, WT-Ovation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2; NuGEN, Cincinnati, Ohio) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. The amplified fragmented RNA was hybridized on a Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray Chip (Agilent Technologies) containing 44,000 cDNA clones.
