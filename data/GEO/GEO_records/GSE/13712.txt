TITLE
Differential gene expression of young and senescent HUVECs under static and laminar shear stress conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Laminar shear stress due to constant blood flow is known to play a critical role in maintaining vascular health. In contrast, endothelial cell senescence appears to be closely associated with the incidence of vascular disorder. In an attempt to identify functional biomarkers for age-related vascular health/disease, the present study investigated differential gene expression of young and senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under static and laminar shear stress. We used a cDNA microarray method to compare gene expression profiles of young and senescent HUVECs under static and laminar shear stress conditions. Keywords: stress response, age state analysis

DESIGN
Senescent cells were prepared by continuous subculture in vitro, and a cone-and-plate device was used to impose laminar shear stress onto cells. Young and senescent cells were exposed to laminar shear stress or maintained under static conditions. Total mRNA was extracted and gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray.
