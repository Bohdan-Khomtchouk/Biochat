TITLE
Discovery of consensus gene signature and intermodular connectivity defining self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression signatures in undifferentiated hESCs against differentiated embryoid bodies to identify key signatures defining self-renewal of hESCs.

DESIGN
Using H1 and H9 hESC lines, we performed gene expression microarray analysis (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) and analyzed the interaction patterns of 54,614 genes using WGCNA in R programming
