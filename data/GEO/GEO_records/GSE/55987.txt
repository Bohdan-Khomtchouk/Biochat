TITLE
The expression pattern of microRNAs in granulosa cells of subordinate and dominant follicles during the early luteal phase of bovine estrous cycle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study was conducted to investigate the miRNA enrichment and degradation in the granulosa cells of dominant and subordinate follicle during the early luteal phase of the bovine estrous cycle using high throughput miRNA sequencing technology.

DESIGN
We used follicle samples retrieved from ovaries obtained from Simmental heifers slaughtered at day 3 and 7 of the estrous cycle. The follicles were categorized as subordinate (SF) and dominant (DF) based on their size. The granulosa cells were collected from each follicle and subjected to total RNA isolation .The RNA samples used for miRNAs deep sequencing. A total of 12 granulosa samples (three biological replicates of granulosa cells from SF or DF at day 3 or day 7 of the estrous cycle) were used for miRNA deep sequencing.
