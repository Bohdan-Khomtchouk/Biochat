TITLE
Identification of translationally deregulated proteins during inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regulation of translation is crucial for cells to rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Although the transcriptional changes under inflammatory conditions are intensely studied, not much is known about translational changes. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying translationally deregulated targets in inflammatory settings.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated for 4h with the supernatants of U937 monocytes or TPA-activated U937 monocyte-derived macrophages and subjected to polysomal fractionation using sucrose gradients. Total RNA was collected simultaneously.
