TITLE
RNAseq of microglia from Rab7 Mutants & Control and Wild-Type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We purified by magnet assisted cell sorting microglial cells from brains of adult Rab7 null mutant, aged mice and respective controls, isolated total RNA and performed RNAseq to determine the transciptome profiles.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomes of Rab7 null mutants and control (2 replicates each) and aged mice and young controls (3 replicates each)

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
