TITLE
Expression data from human corneal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) form a monolayer by adhering tightly through their intercellular adhesion molecules. Located at the posterior corneal surface, they maintain corneal translucency by dehydrating the corneal stroma, mainly through the Na+- and K+-dependent ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase). Because HCEC proliferative activity is low in vivo,we tried to activate proliferation of HCEC by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.We have here demonstrated microarray data of transduced human corneal endothelial cell lines.

DESIGN
Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 array was used to transcriptionally profile to compare cultured human corneal endothelial cells and transduced human corneal endothelial cells.
