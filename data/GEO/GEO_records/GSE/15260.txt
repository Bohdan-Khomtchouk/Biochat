TITLE
Effects of far-infrared rays on 3 human prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We introduce anticancer effect of the far-infrared rays. The growth of three human prostate cancer cells (DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP) was suppressed in vitro only by far-infrared rays. The far-infrared rays induced the gene activation involved in apoptosis that exert positive effects on cancer control. Shima, H. et al.

DESIGN
Twelve samples were analyzed. Each sample was cultured quadricate. One replicate per array. The DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). DU145 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were maintained in F-12K medium and RPMI medium with the same supplements, respectively. All three cancer cells were cultured for 21 and 28 days with or without exposure to far-infrared rays.  The cells without exposure to far-infrared rays were used as the reference samples (Far-infrared rays-treated  vs. non-treated cells). Natural or synthetic rubber/resin (RB) was obtained as far-infrared rays emitter from Yamamoto Corporation (Osaka, Japan). RB consisted of rubber, lime stone and titanium metal powder in a honeycomb structure comprised of micron-sized cells, and had the ability to radiate far-infrared rays (4–25 um). Experimental samples were sandwiched with RBs for 21 and 28 days. Channels 1 were exposed to RB.
