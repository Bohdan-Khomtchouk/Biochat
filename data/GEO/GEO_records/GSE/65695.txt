TITLE
Genome-wide binding profiles of nuclear FGFR1, RXRα and Nur77 in pluripotent mouse Embryonic Stem Cells and during Retinoic Acid-induced differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide binding patterns of nuclear FGFR1, RXRα and Nur77 in pluripotenet mESC and as mESC differentiate towared a neuronal lineage in response to high levels of Retinoic Acid treatment in vitro. We also report the genome-wide incorporation of histone varant H3.3 into chromatin specifically during Retinoic Acid-induced differentiation. This study presents nuclear FGFR1 as a global factor that controls genomic function by binding within the promoters of thousands of genes, both alone and in cooperation with RXR, Nur77 and histone H3.3, by targeting consensus DNA sequences of diverse transcription factor families. As such, it identifies a previously unknown, multifaceted form of control of major ontogenic pathways and gene networks targeted by the nuclear form of FGFR1.

DESIGN
Examination of nuclear FGFR1, RXRα, and Nur77 binding sites in 2 celluar states. Examination of H3.3 incorporation in 1 cellular state.
