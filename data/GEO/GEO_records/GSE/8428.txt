TITLE
The expression profiles of control embryos and pbx2-MO;pbx4-MO embryos at 10 somites and at 18 somites.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Pbx homeodomain proteins have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during muscle development.  Whether Pbx proteins are required broadly for the regulation of muscle gene expression or are required for the expression of a specific subset of muscle gene expression is not known.  We employed microarrays to determine the requirements for Pbx proteins during zebrafish development. Keywords: developmental time course analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from control and pbx2-MO;pbx4-MO embryos were collected at two developmental stages: 10 somites and 18 somites. Their expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix zebrafish genome arrays, and the differentially hybridized genes were determined to be significant according to a FDR < 0.05.
