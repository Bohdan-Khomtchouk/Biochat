TITLE
Expression in Kir6.1-deficient heart following LPS challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KATP opposes depolarization of cells in the heart, smooth muscle, and other tissues by permitting the efflux of potassium ions and this efflux is evidently required to prevent unopposed vasoconstriction and insufficiency of coronary artery blood flow triggered by one or more cytokines induced in response to LPS.   The cytokine(s) involved must elicit a dysfunctional response in the Kir6.1-deficient environment, and to gain further insight into the effects of the mutation, we examined the transcriptional status of whole heart, isolated from normal C57BL/6J mice or KcnJ8Md/Md mice, before and after injection of 1 Î¼g of LPS Keywords: Time course, stress response, disease state analysis, genetic modification
