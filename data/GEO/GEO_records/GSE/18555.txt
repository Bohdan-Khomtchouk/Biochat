TITLE
INO80-regulated genes in S-phase after MMS treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This is transcription analysis of genes regulated by the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex in S-phase of the cell cycle after MMS treatment.

DESIGN
Wildtype and ino80 mutant cells were first synchronized at G1 using alpha-factor, the cells were released in to S-phase in the presence of 0.02% MMS. After 45 minutes, total RNA was isolated and analyzed to identify genes that are regulated by INO80 under such conditions.
