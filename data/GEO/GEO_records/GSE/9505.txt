TITLE
Expression data from hybrid male Xenopus sex reversal experiment

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis x Xenopus muelleri

SUMMARY
Gene expression was examined in genetic females that were sex-reversed to be phenotypically male compared to normal hybrid males We used microarrays to test expression in the gonad of sex-reversed males (ZW) compared to normal males (ZZ) Keywords: treatment

DESIGN
RNA from testis of sexually mature individuals was extracted and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.
