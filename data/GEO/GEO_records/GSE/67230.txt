TITLE
Small RNAs during E. histolytica stress response

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
We analyzed ~27nt small RNAs from Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites in basal conditions and after heat shock or oxidative stress

DESIGN
E. histolytica trophozoites were treated with 1mM H2O2 for 1hr, or heat shocked at 42Â°C for 1hr and RNA was isolated and small RNA populations were compared to small RNA populations from untreated trophozoites

PLATFORM
