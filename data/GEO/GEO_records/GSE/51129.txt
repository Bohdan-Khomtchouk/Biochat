TITLE
microRNA expression profile of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed microRNAs in tumor tissues, human hyopophryngeal squamos cell carcinoma tissues were subjected to miRCURY LNA microRNA Array.

DESIGN
A total of 11 pairs of primary hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples and adjacent normal mucosa were obtained from patients who underwent tumor resection at Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan). The Ethics Committee of Chiba University approved our study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for use of their tissue samples and clinical data. The tissue samples were immersed in RNAlater and stored at -20Â°C until use.

PLATFORM
GPL17728 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 7th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (miRBase 19.0)
