TITLE
IM013 - Mouse infection with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the host response (C57BL/6 mouse model) to A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^3 and 10^4PFU.

DESIGN
Groups of 22-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^3 or 10^4 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 3-4 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomic analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
