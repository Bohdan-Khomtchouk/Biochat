TITLE
Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men is a population-based study aimed at identifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease. At the time of biopsy all subjects were ~ 70yr of age

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from muscle tissue taken from 129 subjects, when they were aged ~70yr and characterised as disease-free (note the above average longevity in Swedes born circa 1920 compared with US and UK populations). From these samples, 108 yielded RNA of sufficient quality to profile on Affymetrix gene-chips. Only survival data are used in the paper. There are no data from cardiovascular disease subjects; we only profiled the healthy subjects and followed for 20yrs.
