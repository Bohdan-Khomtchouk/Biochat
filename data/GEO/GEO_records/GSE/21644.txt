TITLE
FN1 expression is a marker of radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to analyze differential expression in head and neck cancer cells with various intrinsic radiosensitivity. The gene expression profiles of the cell lines were determined using the Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).

DESIGN
The UTSCC cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2mM glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin-G, 50ug/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (all from Gibco, Paisley, UK). Total RNA was prepared from 3 x 10^6 cells using the RNeasy Mini Protocol (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The study included a total of 10 samples with 2 seperate experiments from 5 cell lines respectivley.
