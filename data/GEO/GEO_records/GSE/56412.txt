TITLE
Development of micro RNA expression signatures for differential translation of protein isoforms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed miRNAs (“hits”) under differential expression of p53 isoforms RNA samples were sent for micro array. Some of the micro RNAs are shortlisted below depending on significant upregulation or downregulation. In this micro array we saw some miRNAs getting differentially regulated. 39 upreguated and 15 downregualted in case of p53 and 68 up and 9 downregulated in case of p47 with respect to the vector control.
