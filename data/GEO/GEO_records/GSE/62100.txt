TITLE
DOT1L Inhibits SIRT1 and SUV39H1-Mediated H3K9 Modification to Maintain Gene Expression [ChIP-seq 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation of histone 3 on lysine 79 (H3K79) is broadly associated with active gene expression in eukaryotes, and the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L is indispensable for specific leukemia subtypes like those with MLL-translocations. We found that suppression of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 rescued MLL-AF9 leukemia cells from their dependence on DOT1L. We show that upon DOT1L inhibition, SIRT1 is required for the acquisition of a repressive chromatin state consistent with facultative heterochromatin around MLL-AF9 target genes in leukemia and other genes possess an H3K79me2(hi), H3K9ac(hi), H3K9me2(low) histone modification profile in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Examination of histone modifications via ChIP-seq in three human cancer cell lines.
