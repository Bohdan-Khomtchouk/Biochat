TITLE
Identification of differentially regulated genes upon shRNA-mediated knock-down of HLX in the URE leukemia cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the role of Hlx in hematopoietic differentiation and tumorigenesis, URE cells were infected with short-hairpin-containing pSIH1-H1-copGFP lentiviral vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) containing either nucleotide sequences targeting luciferase (shControl) or HLX (shHLX). After 24hrs incubation in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing FBS, mIL-3, mIL-6 and mSCF with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 8ug/ml polybrene, cells were cultured in fresh medium for several days. Subsequently, GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS and RNA was prepared.

DESIGN
URE cells were infected with short-hairpin-containing pSIH1-H1-copGFP lentiviral vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) containing either nucleotide sequences targeting luciferase (shControl) or HLX (shHLX). After 24hrs incubation in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing FBS, mIL-3, mIL-6 and mSCF with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 8ug/ml polybrene, cells were cultured in fresh medium for several days. Subsequently, GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three replicates of each, shControl and shHLX-transduced cells were used. The goal was to study the role of Hlx in hematopoietic differentiation and tumorigenesis.
