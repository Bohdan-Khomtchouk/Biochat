TITLE
Effect of heat shock on Rickettsia prowazekii Madrid E from four independent biological replicates

ORGANISM
Rickettsia prowazekii str. Madrid E

SUMMARY
Here we present the first microarray analysis of global gene expression changes in the obligate intracytoplasmic pathogen Rickettsia prowazekii using temperature upshift as a model stress condition.  We describe a methodology for isolating highly-purified rickettsial RNA where a combination of differential centrifugation and use of Ambionâ€™s MICROBEnrich reagent removed the majority (~90 %) of host cell RNA.  A pool of rickettsiae-infected L-cells grown at 34 oC was split and half of the sample was challenged at 42 oC for 30 minutes, total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA followed by hybridization to an oligonucleotide DNA array.  We report data (duplicate hybridizations) from four, independent biological replicates.  Twenty-three rickettsial transcripts were significantly increased by temperature upshift greater than two-fold and no transcripts demonstrated reproducible decreases.  Notably, the GroESL, DnaK, and DnaJ members of the family of chaperones as well as the two R. prowazekii proteins annotated as putative heat shock proteins were induced.  In addition, proteins annotated as proteases were also induced indicating that R. prowazekii mounts a response to heat-shock induced protein unfolding.  These data are the first global analysis of the R. prowazekii transcriptome and provide insight into the mechanisms employed by rickettsiae to adapt to temperature upshifts.

DESIGN
Four, independent biological replicates (Control at 34 C versus Heat Shock at 42 C, 30 minutes) All arrays were performed in duplicate (dye swaps)
