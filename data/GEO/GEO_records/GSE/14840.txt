TITLE
Phosphate depletion: A novel trigger for Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
These data represent the global gene expression profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 24 hrs and 72 hrs of inorganic phosphate starvation. Differentially regulated genes appear to include those encoding proteins involved in adaptation to phosphate starvation, namely those involved in phosphate regulation and phosphate assimilation, as well as those involved in the stringent response.
