TITLE
Expression data from mutant FoxP3-transduced CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FoxP3 is a central regulator of immunological tolerance, controlling the development and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells. To dissect the complex processes orchestrated by FoxP3, we investigated impacts of three autoimmune disease-associated missense FoxP3 mutations in mice. As a initial approach, we retrovirally transduced naïve conventional T (Tconv) cells with WT or mutant (A384T and R397W) FoxP3 and analyzed the gene expression profiles of the transduced T cells.

DESIGN
Naïve CD4(+) CD25(-) CD45RB(high) T cells were sorted from BALB/cA mice and retrovirally transduced with either MIGR1, mouse WT FoxP3/MIGR1, A384T FoxP3/MIGR1, or R397W FoxP3/MIGR1 retrovirus. GFP(high) CD4(+) transduced T cells were sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All cell populations analyzed were genereted in duplicates or triplicates.
