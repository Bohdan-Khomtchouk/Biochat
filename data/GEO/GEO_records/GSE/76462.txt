TITLE
Circulating microRNA screening of high-risk individuals enrolled in COSMOS lung cancer screening trial.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Low-dose computed tomography screening (LDCT) was recently shown to anticipate the time of diagnosis, thus reducing lung cancer mortality. We identifed a serum microRNA signature (the miR-Test) that could identify the optimal target population for LDCT screening. Here, we performed a large-scale validation study of the miR-Test in high-risk individuals enrolled in the Continuous Observation of Smoking Subjects (COSMOS) lung cancer screening program.

DESIGN
RT-qPCR of circulating microRNA purified from serum samples. Trizol-LS and miRNEASY Mini kit (Qiagen) were used for miRNA purification. Custom TaqManÂ® Low Density Array microRNA Custom Panel (Life Technologies) was used to screen serum circulating microRNA.
