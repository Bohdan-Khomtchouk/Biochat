TITLE
Expression data from control and Mycobacterium leprae-infected mouse Schwann cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium leprae infect mouse Schwann cells in vitro, reprogram the Schwann cells, and induce mesenchymal stem cell-like cells. In this reprogramming, a vast number of stem cell-related genes, especially those with transcription factor activities are differentially regulated We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the Mycobacterial infection and identified distinct classes of differentially-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Control and Mycobacterium leprae-infected Schwann cells were selected at successive stages of the infection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. As for infected Schwann cells, three time points including day 14 and day 28 after infection, and the final stage of the reprogramming; pSLC cultured in stem cell media.
