TITLE
Comparative genome hybridization for Lactobacillus casei

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus casei

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus casei is remarkably adaptive to diverse habitats. To understand the evolution and adaptation of Lb. casei strains isolated from different environments, the gene content of 22 Lb. casei strains isolated from various habitats (cheeses, n=8; plant materials, n=8; and human sources, n=6) were examined by comparative genome hybridization with an Lb. casei ATCC 334-based microarray.

DESIGN
Comparative genome hybridization was performed against an Affymetrix custom microarray designed to include 2,661 (97%) chromosomal and 17 (85%) plasmid CDSs predicted to occur in Lb. casei ATCC 334, as well as all predicted CDSs in the draft Lb. helveticus CNRZ 32 genome.  CDSs that were not included in the microarray design were all transposase-encoding genes.
