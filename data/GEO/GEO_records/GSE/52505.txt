TITLE
High throughput screening of lipopolysaccharide treatment in nasal fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate effect of lipopolysaccharide in nasal fibroblast, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform. Nasal fibroblasts were exposed to LPS (10 μg/mL) for 12 h. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For control and test RNAs, synthesis of target cRNA probes and hybridization were performed using the Low RNA Input Linear Amplification kit (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridized images were scanned using a DNA microarray scanner and quantified using Feature Extraction Software (Agilent). All data normalization and selection of fold-change of the genes were performed using GeneSpringGX 7.3 (Agilent).

DESIGN
Nasal fibroblasts were exposed to LPS (10 μg/mL) for 12 h. After exposure for 12hr with LPS, the untreated nasal fibroblasts and LPS-treated nasal fibroblasts were harvested and measured. Double independent experiments were performed at each time (0 or 12 hours) using different nasal fibroblasts for each experiment. So these data are duplicated.
