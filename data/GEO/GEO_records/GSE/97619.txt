TITLE
Differentiation of Inflammation-responsive Astrocytes from Glial Progenitors Generated from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to generate inflammation-sensitive astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We examine the transcriptomic inflammatory signature of generated astrocytes following Il1Beta exposure. Primary human cerebellar astrocytes, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) and hiPSC-derived astrocytes were treated with Il1beta and compared to vehicle treated controls. Results: hiPSC-derived can be differentiated to astrocytes that are inflammation sensitive.
