TITLE
Expresssion data from reovirus treated breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reovirus mediated cell death of breast cancer is orchestrated via apoptotic cell death pathways We used inhouse microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following reovirus treatment

DESIGN
Breast cancer cell lines were treated with reovirus for 12 and 24 hours and RNA was extracted.  Microarray was performed in inhouse (University of Calgary miroarray facility) chips.

PLATFORM
GPL20321 Human 14K 70mer Oligo Array
