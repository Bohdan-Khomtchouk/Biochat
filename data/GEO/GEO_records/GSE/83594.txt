TITLE
Expression data analysis of murine pulmonary cryptococcosis induced by Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous investigation indicated that high-virulence C. gattii (C. gattii R265) tend to reside in the alveoli, whereas low-virulence C. gattii (C. gattii 5815) tend to be washed out from the alveoli and move into the central side of the respiratory system of the mice. Furthermore, C. gattii R265 and 5815 infected mice showed much lesser macrophage response than C. neoformans H99 infected mice. To elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon from the viewpoint of genetic analysis, we performed this microarray assay.

DESIGN
C. gattii R265, C. gattii 5815, and C. neoformans H99 were prepared for the study. The mice were anesthetized and the spore suspension was intratracheally injected into each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 15 days after the infection and then examined. Lungs of the mice infected with C. gattii R265 (n=4), C. gattii 5815 (n=4), and C. neoformans H99 (n=3) and of a normal control (n=1) were obtained. RNA targets preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using GeneChip(R) 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). One hundred nanograms of total RNA were converted into double-stranded cDNA template for transcription. In vitro transcription synthesized amplified RNA (aRNA) and incorporated a biotin-conjugated nucleotide. After purification and fragmentation of aRNA, 12.5 ug of them was hybridized to GeneChip(R) Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix).The Probe Array was scanned using a GeneChip(R) Scanner 3000 7G.
