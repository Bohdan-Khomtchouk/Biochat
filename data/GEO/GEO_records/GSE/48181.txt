TITLE
Impact of sucrose on the tolerance of phenanthrene-phytoremediation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-04_phytoremediation; impact of sucrose on the tolerance of phenanthrene Effect of phenanthrene and sucrose - We test 3 conditions plants non-treated (C or t0), plants treated with phenanthrene (P) and plants tread with phenanthrene and sucrose (S). The plants were grown on MS/2 media for 17 days and then transferred on the corresponding condition. We took a sample of 30 plants at different times (0, 30 min, 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h).

DESIGN
22 dye-switch - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
