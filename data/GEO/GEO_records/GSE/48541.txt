TITLE
Prostaglandin dose response on hematopoietic stem cells (25 & 37 deg C)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valuable source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for use in allogeneic transplantation. Key advantages of UCB are rapid availability and less stringent requirements for HLA matching. However, UCB contains an inherently limited HSC count, which is associated with delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates and early mortality. 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) was previously identified to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis and we hypothesized that a brief ex vivo modulation could improve patient outcomes by increasing the " effective dose " of HSCs. Molecular profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips were used to evaluate if increasing the concentration of prostaglandin at 25 and 37 deg C could increase biological responses.

DESIGN
Isolated human CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood were incubated ex vivo in Stem Span (SS) media evaluating five concentrations of 16,16-dmPGE2 (0.1uM, 1uM, 10uM, 50uM, and 100uM) or Vehicle (DMSO) for 2 hours at 25 or 37 deg C. Total RNA was isolated post incubation and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays for pathway activation.
