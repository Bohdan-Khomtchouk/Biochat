TITLE
Virus Induced Airway Hyperreactivity and Goblet Cell Metaplasia Phenotypic Extremes (CB6F2/J)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice representing phenotypic extremes of airway hyperreactivity and goblet cell metaplasia post-Sendai virus infection were identified from a 500 mouse F2 cohort (CB6F2/J).  Whole lung RNA from 3 mice at each extreme was analyzed via microarray for gene expression.  Subsequent pairwise comparisons between arrays allowed the identification of genes differentially expressed with respect to the disease phenotypes (airway hyperreactivity and goblet cell metaplasia). Keywords: disease state analysis
