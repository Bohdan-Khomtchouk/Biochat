TITLE
Real-time Monitoring of Cisplatin Toxicity on Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells by cisplatin leads to a very specific metabolic response and an onset of cell death about 10-11 h after beginning of treatment. For more detailed understanding of the molecular processes underlying the specific metabolic response, mRNA was isolated from MCF7 cells when the specific changes, (i) induction of glycolysis and (ii) onset of cell death, were detected during online measurement in the cell biosensor system.

DESIGN
MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with cisplatin in the BIONAS 2500 cell biosensor chip system, and samples were collected from the biosensor chip module at time points when glycolysis was induced (change of ph; 8-9h) and at the beginning of cell death (change of impedance; 10-11h).
