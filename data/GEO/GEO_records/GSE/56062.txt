TITLE
Expression data from internodes of maize seedlings

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Plant growth regulators (PGRs) were commonly used in practical farming to restrict plant height and control lodging. Ethephon has been reported to shorten the internodes elongation and increase the harvestable grain yield of maize. In the present study, we characterized that internodes phenotypic responses to ethephon treatment induced should due to ethylene released inhibited the longitudinal growth of cells and promoted its the lateral growth. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene differentially expression underlying maize and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
After ethephon sprayed treatment 0 day (0 h), 1 day (24 h), 2 day (48 h), the seventh internode of maize seedlings from the treatment group and control were collected. The internodes meristem were frozen immediately using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80â„ƒ for further RNA extraction. Every RNA sample was derived from 3 independent seedlings. In sum, three time points were selected and three biological replicates were performed at each time point, totally 15 maize genome arrays were used.
