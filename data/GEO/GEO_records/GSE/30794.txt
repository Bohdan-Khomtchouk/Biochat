SUMMARY
Meningitis is a complex disease which can be caused by infection with either viral or bacterial pathogens. Viral meningitis is usually a sterile self-limiting disease with a good clinical prognosis, while bacterial meningitis is a potentially more serious disease with a higher mortality rate. Early diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is of paramount importance, as intervention with antimicrobial therapy increases the likelihood of a favourable clinical outcome.  Routine diagnosis in many laboratories is still dependent to some degree on traditional methods e.g. culture, though molecular methods have been developed which can give a shorter time to diagnosis.  However, there is not as yet a single test format that can detect all bacterial pathogens capable of causing meningitis.  In addition, many tests e.g. real-time PCR have a finite limit for multiplexing and do not provide additional information such as strain or serogroup which is useful during outbreaks and for retrospective epidemiological surveillance. To this end we have developed a microarray probe set for detection of meningitis-associated bacterial pathogens including those in the N. meningitidis serogroups. Here we demonstrate utility of this array in specific detection of represented bacterial species and strains and in detection of pathogen signals in cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. This method shows promise for development as a diagnostic tool; however, we discuss the technical issues encountered and suggest mechanisms to improve resolution of pathogen-specific signals in complex clinical samples.
