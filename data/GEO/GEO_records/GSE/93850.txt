TITLE
Low Serum Level of miR-485-3p Predicts Poor Survival in Patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to perform systematic profiling of human microRNAs in serum from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  patients to find potential biomarkers. By comparing the serum microRNA profiles of the GBM patients and healthy volunteers, potential biomarkers for GBM were investigated.  Using a custom microarray platforms containing 1843 species of miRNAs, we previously identified 19 serum miRNAs with differential expression in GBM patients.

DESIGN
30 microarrays containing 1843 human microRNAs were used to screen for potential biomarkers with significant differential expression levels between 22 GBM patients and 8 healthy volunteers.
