TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of lung squamouse cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discovery of novel diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers of lung squamous cell carcinoma based on a whole transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Transcriptomic profiles of 12 available samples, out of 87 recruited patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were generated using Ion Proton system.

DESIGN
Tumoral mRNA profiles of 12 patients with lung SCC were generated by deep sequencing, using Ion Proton system.
