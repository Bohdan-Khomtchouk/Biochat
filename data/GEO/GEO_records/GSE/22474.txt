TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of Dnmt3a-mediated epigenetic regulation in murine postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cells (NSCs) [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation at proximal promoters facilitates lineage restriction by silencing cell-type specific genes. However, euchromatic DNA methylation frequently occurs in regions outside promoters. The functions of such non-proximal promoter DNA methylation are unclear. Here we show that the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is expressed in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) and is required for neurogenesis. Genome-wide analysis of postnatal NSCs indicates that Dnmt3a occupies and methylates intergenic regions and gene bodies flanking proximal promoters of a large cohort of transcriptionally permissive genes, many of which encode regulators of neurogenesis. Surprisingly, Dnmt3a-dependent non-proximal promoter methylation promotes expression of these neurogenic genes by functionally antagonizing Polycomb repression. Thus, non-promoter DNA methylation by Dnmt3a may be utilized for maintaining active chromatin states of genes critical for development.

DESIGN
Chromatin extracted from wild-type (WT) or Dnmt3a-null (KO) SVZ NSCs was immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies and analyzed by Agilent 244K extended promoter (-5.5kb to +2.5kb flanking transcription start sites) microarrays. Whole cell extract (WCE) was used as input controls for most experiments (IP/WCE). For other experiments, immunoprecipitated DNA from WT and KO NSCs was directly compared on the same microarrays (IP/IP).
