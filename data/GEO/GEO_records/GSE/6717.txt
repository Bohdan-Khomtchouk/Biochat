TITLE
Mycoplasma gallisepticum Rlow attached to MRC-5 cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mycoplasma gallisepticum str. R

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes important to the interaction of Mycoplasma gallisepticum with host cells in an in vitro system.  An interaction time of one hour was chosen since it is less than a generation time and thus all changes can be attributed to transcriptional changes.  A total of 60 transcripts were determined to be significantly up- or down-regulated under these conditions, including several hypothetical genes.  Also several metabolism-related genes and ATP synthase genes were significantly down-regulated. Keywords: transcriptional response to host cells

DESIGN
Five separate biological experiments and extractions were performed yielding five total replicate hybridizations.  The microarray slide contains 760 oligonucleotide spots in duplicate including several Arabidopsis controls and blank spots.  Individual spots were analyzed using BAGEL and a significantly different data set determined by including spots that were significantly (p < .05) up- or down-regulated by greater than 1.5-fold reproducibly (both duplicate spots). " Broth-grown and attached M. gallisepticum BAGEL analysis " output file provided as a Series data table.
