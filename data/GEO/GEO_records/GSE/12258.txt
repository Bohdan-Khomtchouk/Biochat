TITLE
The pilus retraction protein PilT has a global influence on the transcriptome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
The ATPase protein PilT mediates retraction of type IV pili.  We performed microarrays comparing the transcription profile of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae wild-type strain MS11 and its isogenic pilT mutant. 63 open reading frames were found to be differentially regulated in the pilT mutant. Most interestingly, a loss of function mutation in pilT leads to an upregulation of pilE, which encodes the pilus subunit protein.
