TITLE
Transcriptomes profile of Solanum tuberosum (St) and Solanum commersonii (Sc) under cold stress and AtCBF3 overexpression.

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
St (common potato) is a freezing sensitive species unable to cold acclimate. The close wild relative Sc is freezing tolerant and able to cold acclimate. Here we compare the cold transcriptome of these two species with different levels of freezing tolerance. We also identify the putative CBF regulons by comparing the transcriptomes of wild type plants with that of 35S::AtCBF3 transgenic lines in both species.
