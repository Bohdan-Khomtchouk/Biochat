TITLE
Transcriptomes profile of Solanum tuberosum (St) and Solanum commersonii (Sc) under cold stress and AtCBF3 overexpression.

ORGANISM
Solanum commersonii ; Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
St (common potato) is a freezing sensitive species unable to cold acclimate. The close wild relative Sc is freezing tolerant and able to cold acclimate. Here we compare the cold transcriptome of these two species with different levels of freezing tolerance. We also identify the putative CBF regulons by comparing the transcriptomes of wild type plants with that of 35S::AtCBF3 transgenic lines in both species.

DESIGN
Plants were grown in 16:8 photoperiod. Eight hours after dawn, plants were either transfered to cold or kept in the warn. Wild type S. tuberosum and S. commersonii were grown at 2oC for 2h, 24h and 7 days. Wild type plants grown under warm temperatures for 2h was used as control for 2h cold samples; wild type warm grown plants for 24h were used as controls for 24h and 7 days cold samples. Under warm conditions, S. commersonii 35S::AtCBF3 lines were compared to S. commersonii wild type plants (same thing was done for S. tuberosum).
