TITLE
Expression data from MEFs wt cells starved as compared to MEFs wt cells grown in Normal Medium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of starvation on the MEFs wt trascriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the starved cells Transcriptome analysis of the starved MEFs wt cells

DESIGN
For the analysis on the starved MEFs wt cells, total RNA was extracted; RNA extracted from MEFs wt cells grown in Normal Medium was used as control
