TITLE
MicorRNA expression in klotho-deficient and wild-type mouse brain subregions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression profiles of miRNAs in klotho-deficient and wild-type mouse brain subregions were examined. The data indicated that little or no marked difference in the miRNA expression was detected between them.

DESIGN
Twelve samples prevared from 4- or 5-week-old klotho-deficient and wild-type mouse brain tissues (cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus) were examined.
