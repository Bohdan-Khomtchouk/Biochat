TITLE
Lysine catabolic pathways in P. aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Among multiple interconnected pathways for L-Lysine (L-Lys) catabolism in pseudomonads, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 employed the decarboxylase and the transaminase pathways. However, up till now several genes involved in the operation and regulation of these pathways were still missing. Transcriptome analyses coupled with promoter activity measurements and mutant growth phenotype analysis lead us to identify several new members of the L-Lys and D-Lys catabolic pathways and their regulatory elements, including argR to trigger lysine decarboxylation into cadaverine, PauR for the Î³-glutamylation pathway of polyamine catabolism into 5-aminovalerate, gcdR-gcdHG for glutarate utilization, dpkA, amaR-amaAB and PA2035 for D-Lys catabolism, lysR-lysXE for L-Lys efflux, and lysP for L-Lys uptake.
