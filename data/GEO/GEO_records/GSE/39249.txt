TITLE
Primary Mammary Epithelial Cells: Control vs 1023-Treated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary mammary epithelial cells treated for 72 hours with compound 1023 compared to DMSO.  Goal was to determine genes differntially regulated by treatment with the novel compound, 1023.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, DMSO vs. 1023. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 1023 replicates.
