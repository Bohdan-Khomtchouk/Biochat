TITLE
DNA methylation profile of PBMC following decitabine therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epigenetic regulation, for example, DNA methylation, controls the development and differentiation of both tumor cells and immunocytes. Treatment with DNA demethylating agent (such as decitabine) has shown a dramatic clinical benefit in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. However, the influence of epigenetic therapy on host immune system remains unclear.

DESIGN
To investigate the effects of low-dose decitabine therapy on T cells, we collected whole blood samples from two solid tumor patients pre and post low-dose decitabine therapy, and detected the DNA methylation profiles of PBMCs.
