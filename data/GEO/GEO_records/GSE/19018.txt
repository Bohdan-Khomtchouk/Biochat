TITLE
Changes in gene expression of Imr90 cells with age and senescence under 3% and 20% oxygen growth conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Senescent is an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest initiated by damaged cell constituents and subsequent pro-oncogenic signaling.  Replicative senescence in vitro can be considered a model for human aging.  When fibroblasts are cultured under atmospheric oxygen conditions of 20%, typical of normal tissue culture procedure, fibroblasts generally reach their replicative capacity at 50-60 population doublings (PDs).  When fibroblasts are cultured under normal physiological oxygen conditions of 3%, PDs increase about 30% relative to atmospheric levels.  Hence while oxygen is a requirement for normal aerobic respiration, it can contribute to the total amount of oxidative stress to which cells are exposed to, leading to a long-term adverse effect in vitro.  Inasmuch, cultures maintained under hyperoxic and hypoxic conditions provide a convenient model system for assessing the relationship between oxygen/oxidative stress and senescence. We used microarrays to profile the changes in global gene expression during aging and senescence of Imr90 cells under growth oxygen conditions of 3% and 20%.

DESIGN
Imr90 cells at various population doubling timepoints (young, old, and senescent) grown seperately under 3 and 20% oxygen growth conditions were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Timepoints from cells grown under 3% and 20% oxygen conditions were age matched via population doublings to ensure accurate cross sample comparison.
