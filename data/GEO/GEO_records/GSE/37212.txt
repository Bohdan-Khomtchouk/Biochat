TITLE
Identification of miR-21 targets in Jurkat cells by AGO2 immunoprecipitation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify miR-21 targets by a biochemical high-throughput method, we immunopurified RISC Complex and associated mRNAs in both control and miR-21 overexpressing Jurkat cells.

DESIGN
Following transduction of miR-21 encoding construct (or a cognate control vector) in Jurkat cells, we used microarray technology to profile Total RNA, AGO2 Immunopurified RNA and control IgG purified RNA.
