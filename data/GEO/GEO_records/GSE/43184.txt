TITLE
Human CD1c+ dendritic cells drive the differentiation of CD103+ CD8+ mucosal T cells via TGF-β

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In comparison to murine dendritic cells (DCs), less is known about the function of human DCs in tissues. Here, we analyzed, using lung tissues from humans and humanized mice, the role of human CD1c+ and CD141+ DCs in determining the type of CD8+ T cell immunity to live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine. We found that both lung DC subsets acquired influenza antigens in vivo and expanded specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in vitro. However, lung-tissue-resident CD1c+ DCs but not CD141+ DCs were able to drive CD103 expression on CD8+ T cells and promote CD8+ T cell accumulation in lung epithelia in vitro and in vivo. CD1c+ DCs induction of CD103 expression was dependent on membrane-bound TGF-β1. Thus, CD1c+ and CD141+ DCs generate CD8+ T cells with different properties, and CD1c+ DCs specialize in the regulation of mucosal CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from purified human CD1c+ (BDCA1+) and CD141+ (BDCA3+) mDCs sorted from different tissues, including human blood, spleen and lungs of humanized mice, and human lungs. Eighteen samples in total were analyzed from different donors and tissues.
