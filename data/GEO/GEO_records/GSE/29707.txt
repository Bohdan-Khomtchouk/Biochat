TITLE
Analysis of deregulated microRNAs in malignant mesothelioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression of human microRNAs in the cellular fraction of human peripheral blood of patients with diagnosed malignant mesotheliomas and asbestos-exposed controls. Altered expression of several miRNAs were observed for patients with diagnosed malignant mesotheliomas in comparison with asebstos-expsoed controls.

DESIGN
The study group consists of 23 patients with diagnosed malignant mesothelioma (mean age 66 years, range 34 – 84 years). Patients were not treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy before sample collection. The histological subtypes were: one sarcomatoid, seven biphasic, and twelve epithelioid cases. In three cases the histological subtype was unknown. The control group consists of 17 asbestos-exposed age-matched volunteers without any diagnosed cancer (mean age 68 years, range 47 – 80 years). Oligonucleotide microarrays were purchased from the Norwegican Microarray Consortium (www.microarray.no). The mirVana miRNA Probe Set v2.0 (Ambion) based on the miRBase Sequence Database v8.0. was used.
