TITLE
Expression profile of contrasting maize genotypes grown on acid and control soil (root tips)

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Aluminum toxicity is one of the major limiting factors for many crops worldwide. The primary symptom of Al toxicity syndrome is the inhibition of root growth, leading to poor water and nutrient absorption. The causes of this inhibition are still elusive, with several biochemical pathways being affected and with a significant variation between species. Most of the work done so far to investigate the genes responsible for Al tolerance used hydroponic culture. Here we evaluated plant responses using soil as substrate, which is a condition closer to the field reality. We used Affymetrix chips to reveal the transcriptional changes of two maize genotypes contrasting for Al tolerance.

DESIGN
Root tips from Cat100-6 (Al-tolerant) and S1587-17 (Al-sensitive) maize genotypes were harvested after growing on acid or control soil for 1 or 3 days. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Maize Genome Array. Three biological replicates were used for each sample.
