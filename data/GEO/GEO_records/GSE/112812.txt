TITLE
Genetic and epigenetic changes in clonal descendants of irradiated human fibroblasts [strain 1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study delayed genetic and epigenetic radiation effects, which may trigger radiation-induced carcinogenesis, we have established single-cell clones from irradiated and non-irradiated primary human fibroblasts. Stable clones were endowed with the same karyotype in all analyzed metaphases after 20 population doublings (PDs), whereas unstable clones displayed mosaics of normal and abnormal karyotypes. To account for differences in radiation sensitivity, all experiments were performed with two different embryonic fibroblast strains. After a single dose of 2 Gray more than half of the irradiated clones exhibited radiation-induced genomic instability (RIGI). Methylation arrays identified several hundred differentially methylated genes and nine  enriched pathways associated with in vitro ageing. Methylation changes in 259 genes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway were associated with delayed radiation effects (after 20 PDs). Collectively, our results suggest that both genetic and epigenetic changes occur in the progeny of exposed cells that were not damaged directly by irradiation, likely contributing to radiation-induced carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip starting culture/mass culture was analyzed as duplicate, 12 non-irradiated/control clones, 34 irradiated clones (25 unstable, 9 stable)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
