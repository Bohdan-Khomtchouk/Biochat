TITLE
Expression data from Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcription profiles in BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 were analysed using DNA microarray technology. BL21, BL21/pOri1 or BL21/pOri2 strains were cultured at chemostat status and harvested after the cultivation arrived steady status. Keywords: Effects of plasmid DNA on Escherichia coli metabolism

DESIGN
BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 were cultured at the exponential growth status or at the same growth rate status, respectively. E. coli BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 RNAs were reverse-transcripted into cDNAs, The RNAs from the BL21, BL21/pOri1, BL21/pOri2 were labelled with biotin. The labelled cDNAs were mixed and then hybridized on the microarray slides. Experiments were repeated four times. Most of them have no significant difference comparing plasmid-carrying E. coli and plasmid-free E. coli
