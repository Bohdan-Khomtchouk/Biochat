TITLE
Expression data from Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Transcription profiles in BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 were analysed using DNA microarray technology. BL21, BL21/pOri1 or BL21/pOri2 strains were cultured at chemostat status and harvested after the cultivation arrived steady status. Keywords: Effects of plasmid DNA on Escherichia coli metabolism
