TITLE
lncRNAs expression signatures of colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNAs have been recently implicated as having oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles.To further investigate the function of lncRNA in colon cancer, we have employed lncRNA microarray to identify lncRNA with the potential to involve the metastasis of colon cancer.   Human peripheral blood from healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and a 74-gene consensus signature was identified that distinguished between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy) and control samples.  The same set of genes separated samples by exposure level at both six and 24 hours after treatment, with overlap evident only at the highest two doses (5 and 8 Gy).  Expression of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern.

DESIGN
The experimental samples  are divided into three groups(normal„ÄÅprimary tumor and metastatic tumor) to compare lncRNA expression profiling of those
