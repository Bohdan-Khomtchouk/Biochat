Effects of exercise training and antioxidant supplementation on endothelial cell gene expression

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms of exercise-induced cardiovascular protection are poorly understood. There is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are necessary for some of these adaptations and antioxidants may be used to investigate this effect. This study aimed to determine the effects of exercise and/or antioxidant supplementation on myocardial and vascular endothelium gene expression. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: i) endurance exercise (90min of treadmill running 4d/week, 14 weeks); ii) antioxidant-treated; iii) antioxidant and endurance exercise and iv) control. The supplemented animals received Vitamin E (1000 IU/kg diet) and alpha-lipoic acid (1.6 g/kg diet) mixed with rat chow. cDNA microarray analysis was performed using purified endothelial RNA from myocardial and coronary artery endothelial cells and showed that the expression levels of 35, 40 and 40 genes were altered for groups i, ii, and iii respectively compared to control. Differentially expressed genes were analysed using the KEGG pathway database, hierarchical cluster and DAVID analysis. These analyses revealed that a gene involved in cardiovascular disease progression, Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) was down-regulated by exercise, upregulated by antioxidant supplementation and the combination of exercise and antioxidant blunted both effects. These findings were confirmed by real-time PCR. In summary, exercise and antioxidant supplementation affect endothelial cell gene expression and ROS appear necessary for some of these adaptations.
