TITLE
Combined inhibition of TGFÎ² and PDGF signaling attenuates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate effects on mRNA expression in mouse lung tissue through treatment with Ly, Su, Imatinib, irradiation and combinations of them.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was measured 24 days after irradiation. 2 biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment condition (control, Ly, Imatinib, Su, Ly+Imatinib, Ly+Su, Irradiation, Irradiation+Ly, Irradiation+Imatinib, Irradiation+Su, Irradiation+Ly+Imatinib, Irradiation+Ly+Su)
