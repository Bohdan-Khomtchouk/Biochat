TITLE
Expression data from cerebral cortices of bacTRAP transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays of eight different cell types in cortex to conduct specificity index analysis for detailed cell type specific molecular profile.

DESIGN
Cerebral cortices of adult bacTRAP transgenic mice were dissected out and subjected to polysomal immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody in accordance with the established protocol (Heiman et al. Cell 2008). Enriched RNAs for each cell type were extracted from corresponding bacTRAP mice and subjected to two cycle RNA amplification and biotin labeling following quality control. Biotin labeled RNAs were hybridized on Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray chips and the expression intensity of all 40,000 probesets were analyzed further.
