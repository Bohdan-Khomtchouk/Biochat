TITLE
Transcriptomic response of zebrafish embryos to Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We are presenting here the application of toxicogenomics to perform the evaluation of toxic effects of two polyamidoamine dendrimers (Generation3 and Generation4) on the developing zebrafish embryo. They are nanomaterials of special concern under the toxicological point of view because of their relatively high solubility in water and bioavailability. Zebrafish embryo toxicity assays (zFET) showed that G3 was more toxic to zebrafish than G4, and that both compounds were several orders of magnitude more toxic than other carbonaceous nanomaterials, like carbon fullerenes or nanotubes. The results suggest a variety of MoA for different dendrimers, probably related to the nature and number of the chemical groups attached to their surface. They also confirm the relatively high bioavailability of these compounds, a key factor for the assessment of the risk associated to their use and release into the environment. About 5% genes were affected by the treatment. Gene ontology (GO) analyses show that these genes are involved in the oxidation-reduction process and also in the nervous system development. Representatives of each GO functional groups were selected and quantified by real-time PCR to validate the microarray data and to differentiate the action of generations of dendrimers studied.

DESIGN
Two different treatments were performed in this study. Zebrafish fertlized eggs were exposed to PAMAM dendrimer G3 and G4 during 48h. 3 biological replicates per studied dendrimer are included such as each control sample.
