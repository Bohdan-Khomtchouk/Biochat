TITLE
Murine small intestinal crypt cells: IGF-1 stimulated vs. control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of mouse small intestinal crypt cells comparing control untreated with cells treated with insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 stimulated cell proliferation, as observed in Brdu incoporation assay.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment. Control vs IGF-1 treatment. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treated. Independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array
