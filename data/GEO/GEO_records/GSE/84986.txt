TITLE
53BP1 integrates DNA repair and p53-dependent cell fate decisions via distinct mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor protein 53BP1, a pivotal regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair,  was  first  identified  as  a  p53-interacting  protein  over  two  decades  ago,  however  its direct  contributions  to  p53-dependent  cellular  activities  remain  undefined.  Here,  we  reveal 53BP1 stimulates  genome-wide  p53-dependent  gene  transactivation  and repression  events  in response  to  ionizing  radiation  (IR)  and  synthetic  p53  activation. 53BP1-dependent  p53 modulation requires  both auto-oligomerization and tandem-BRCT domain  mediated bivalent interactions  with  p53  and  the  ubiquitin-specific  protease  USP28.  Loss  of  these  activities results in inefficient p53-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint and exit responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate  53BP1-USP28  cooperation  to  be  essential  for  normal  p53-promoter  element interactions and gene transactivation-associated events, yet dispensable for 53BP1-dependent DSB repair regulation. Collectively, our data provides  a mechanistic  explanation for 53BP1-p53 cooperation in controlling anti-tumorigenic cell fate decisions, and reveal these activities to  be  distinct  and  separable  from  53BP1’s  regulation  of  DNA  double-strand  break  repair pathway choice.

DESIGN
We evaluated the transcriptional profiles of two 53BP1Δ cell lines and included a positive (WT) and a negative (p53Δ) controls. These cell lines were treated with Nutlin-3, ionising radiation or mock treated. Three independent replicates were included for each independent condition generating a total of 36 samples.
