TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of IL-17A-treated Synovial Fibroblasts from the Human Temporomandibular Joint

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Synovial fibroblasts contribute to the inflammatory temporomandibular joint under pathogenic stimuli. Synovial fibroblasts and T cells participate in the perpetuation of joint inflammation in a mutual activation feedback, via secretion of cytokines and chemokines that stimulate each other. IL-17 is an inflammatory cytokine produced primarily by Th17 cells that plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated the roles of IL-17A in temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) by using genome-wide analysis of synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with TMD. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of synovial fibroblasts that were treated with or without IL-17A.

DESIGN
IL-17 induced gene expression in synovial fibroblasts from human temporomandibular joint was measured at 4 hours after treated with IL-17A (10 ng/ml) and untreated control samples. This experiment used one donor sample.
