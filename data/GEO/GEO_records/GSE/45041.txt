TITLE
Transcriptome-wide microRNA expression of white blood cells before and after intense cardiorespiratory exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regular physical exercise reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality through several biological mechanisms. We were interested in white blood cell microRNA expression in response to exercise. Ten healthy adult males (19-39 years old) undertook 30 minutes of continuous treadmill running at 80% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Blood samples were taken before and immediately after exercise.  Whole-genome microRNAs were then analysed in the extracted RNA.

DESIGN
Microarrays (one per sample, with no pooling) were performed on ten healthy adults (19-39 years old) who undertook 30 minutes of continuous treadmill running at 80% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Blood samples were taken before and immediately after exercise.Whole blood was collected from arm vein, and white blood cells were separated and  preserved in liquid nitrogen and later transferred to a â€“80C freezer.  After extraction of RNA, cRNA was prepared and arrays performed using the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray Kit Release 16.0 performed at the Ramaciotti Gene Function Analysis facility, University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
