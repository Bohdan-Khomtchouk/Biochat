TITLE
Gastric Cancer Subtyping (Australian Patient Cohort)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of 70 primary gastric tumors from the Australian patient cohort. Like many cancers, gastric adenocarcinomas (gastric cancers) show considerable heterogeneity between patients. Thus, there is intense interest in using gene expression profiles to discover subtypes of gastric cancers with particular biological properties or therapeutic vulnerabilities. Identification of such subtypes could generate insights into the mechanisms of cancer progression or lay the foundation for personalized treatments. Here we report a robust gene-xpression-based clustering of a large collection of gastric adenocarcinomas from Singaporean patients [GSE34942 and GSE15459]. We developed and validated a classifier for the three subtypes in Australian patient cohort.

DESIGN
Profiling of 70 primary gastric tumors on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. All tumors were collected with approvals from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Australia; the Research Ethics Review Committee; and signed patient informed consent.
