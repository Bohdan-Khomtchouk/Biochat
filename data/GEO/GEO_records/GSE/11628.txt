TITLE
Wnt & LIF signalling in mESC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular processes underlying the properties of ESC are yet unknown even when it's well established that LIF/STAT3 is neccesary for the maintenance of pluripotency. Other pathways as Wnt are may be implicated in the regulation of the biological mechanisms in mESC. Work model: D3-ES cultivated with or without LIF and treated with chronic (7 days) low doses (50nM) of GSK3 Î² inhibitor (lithium). We used microarrays to detail the global profile of gene expression to identified different groups of up and down-regulated genes in the work model.

DESIGN
mESC cultivated as it has been defined in the work model were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We analyzed 3 independent experiments per replicate, and we did three replicates per sample.
