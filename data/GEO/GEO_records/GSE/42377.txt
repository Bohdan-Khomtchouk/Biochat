TITLE
Benefit of a second opinion, intrapulmonary metastases or multiple primary tumors?

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules in lung cancer usually means distant metastases (M1a). We present an extraordinary example that challenges to look beyond this classification, and illustrates the potential benefits of a multidisciplinary re-evaluation in such a case.

DESIGN
FFPE DNA from a patient with three primary tumors. Test samples were compared to normal tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL8687 Agilent SurePrint G3 CGH array (4X180K) CCA_VUMC design AMADID#022522
