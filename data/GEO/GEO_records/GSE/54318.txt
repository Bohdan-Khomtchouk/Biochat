TITLE
Hypoxia-inducible factor 3 is an oxygen-dependent transcription activator and regulates a distinct transcriptional response to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify Hif-1 and -3 regulated genes in zebrafish embryos. RNA samples were prepared from embryos injected with GFP, Hif-1α, and Hif-3α mRNA. The RNA samples were subjected to DNA microarray analysis using the Agilent 4×44 K (V3) Zebrafish Microarray Chip.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were collected from three independent microinjection experiments. Each RNA sample was extracted from a pool of 60 embryos and labeled with Cy3-CTP. Slides were scanned by the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, read by Feature Extraction software 10.7 and normalized by Gene Spring Software 11.0.
