TITLE
Poly I:C Induced Gene Expression Changes in Non-Human Primates V

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
The respiratory epithelium is the bodyâ€™s first line of defense to pathogens, pollutants, and other potentially injurious agents that can be inhaled.  Sampling the upper respiratory tract is becoming a widely used technique in the clinic to examine the molecular changes in the diseased airway;  however, it is unclear as to whether the responses in the upper respiratory tract (i.e. the nasal turbinates) reflect the changes that occur in the lower  respiratory tract (i.e. trachea and lungs). Here, we assessed the responses to poly I:C, a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule that is meant to  mimic the acute effects of a viral infection, in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cynomolgus macaques. To do this, we compared the in  vivo response after a nasal poly I:C challenge in a nasal scrape samples (performed using a nasal curette) to responses that occurred after ex vivo  poly I:C stimulation in nasal scrapes, tracheal epithelial brushings, and lung tissue explants in non-human primates.

DESIGN
Lung tissue were collected from NHPs during a necropsy, plated in 24 well plates in Clonetics SABM media.  Samples were stimulated with poly I:C (100 mg) or a mock control and collected at time points indicated. There were 2-3 technical replicates for the tracheal brushings and the lung explants
