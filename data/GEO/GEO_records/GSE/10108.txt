TITLE
Gene expression analysis of TNF-alpha stimulated CaCo-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The series was designed to obtain gene expression patterns of TNF-alpha stimulated CaCo-2 cells. Keywords: TNF-alpha stimulation

DESIGN
This series represents a group of 18 samples in 2 groups: 10 samples derived from not stimulated CaCo-2 cells, 8 samples from CaCo-2 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha in final concentration of 5 ng/ml for 60 min.
