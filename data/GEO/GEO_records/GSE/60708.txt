TITLE
Gene expression in pluripotent and Oct4+Tet1 induced cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Detection of gene expression profiles during OT(Oct4+Tet1)-mediated iPSC induction and demonstration the pluripotency of OT-iPSC. We used microarray to explore the global expression change during the reprogramming process.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, microarray analysis is used to detect the overall gene expression profile of starting fibroblast cells, intermediated reprogramming cells, fully reprogrammed iPS cells and wildtype ES cells.

PLATFORM
