TITLE
Discovery of novel and conserved microRNAs in Spirodela polyrhiza by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Spirodela polyrhiza

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous non-coding RNAs, which play key roles in a variety of developmental and physiological processes by regulating gene expressions at post-transcriptional or translational levels. The objective of our work was to explore conserved and novel miRNAs in Spirodela at the whole-genome level, and further characterize their potential roles in gene regulation.
