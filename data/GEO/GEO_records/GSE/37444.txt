TITLE
Distribution of histone modificiation H3K27me3 in Drosophila Kc cells, comparison with dCTCF knockdown

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we map the localization of H3K27me3 in Drosophila Kc cells, as well as in Drosophila Kc cells wherein dCTCF is knock down.

DESIGN
examination of genomic occupancy for H3K27me3, control samples used for Drosophila Kc were previously described (Wood, Van Bortle et al., 2011 GSE30740)

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
