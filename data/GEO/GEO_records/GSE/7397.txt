TITLE
Adult cardiomyocytes treated with fractalkine (CX3CL1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Background and Aims: It is known that inflammatory processes are activated in heart failure, but the regulation of cytokines and their role in the pathogenesis of the disease are not well understood. We have identified fractalkine as a possible novel mediator in HF development. To address this issue, we have performed microarray analysis of cardiomyocytes treated with different isoforms of fractalkine. Methods: Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat hearts and treated with different forms of fractalkine for 24 hours. Control cells were treated with BSA. Molecular alterations in myocardial tissue were measured by using cDNA microarrays. Molecular pathways affected were identified by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results: Several molecular pathways were affected upon fractalkine stimulation of adult cardiomyocytes. Keywords: Fractalkines effect on cardiomyocytes
