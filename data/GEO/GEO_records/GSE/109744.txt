TITLE
Mitral valve interstitial Tissue: Myxomatous P2 prolapse of the mitral valve  vs. Control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: Test the hypothesis that 5HT receptors (5HTRs) signaling contributes to MVP pathophysiology. Methods and results: MV RNA was used for microarray analysis of MVP patients versus control, highlighting genes that indicate the involvement of 5HTR pathways and extracellular matrix remodeling in MVP. These canine MVP leaflets (N=5/group) showed 5HTR2B upregulation. Conclusion: In humans, MVP is associated with an upregulation in 5HTR2B expression and increased 5HT receptor signaling in the leaflets. 5HTR signaling is involved not only in previously reported 5HTrelated valvulopathies, but it is also involved in the pathological remodeling of MVP.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 4 MVP patients vs. 4 controls. 3 replicates per sample.
