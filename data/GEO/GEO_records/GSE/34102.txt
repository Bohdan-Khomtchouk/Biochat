TITLE
Expression analysis of gene silenced barley to identify the function of a novel LRR-RLK (leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase)

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) was used to silence a putative LRR-RLK, Affy ID Rbaal9i05_at, in barley. Expression patterns in leaves were compared between untreated control leaves, virus treated leaves, VIGS-Rbaal knockdown leaves and VIGS-Rbaal/PDS (phytoene desaturase) co-silenced leaves.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  David L Parrott.

DESIGN
treatment: Untreated Control(3-replications);  treatment: Empty Virus (no inserted plant sequences)(3-replications);  treatment: Rbaal VIGS(3-replications);  treatment: Co-silencing (Rbaal + PDS)(3-replications)
