TITLE
Integrated RNA and DNA sequencing reveals early drivers of metastatic breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer metastasis remains a deadly disease with poorly understood clonal evolution and the timing with which drivers are acquired. Here, we present the RNA sequencing data as the RSEM upper quantile normalized data.

DESIGN
