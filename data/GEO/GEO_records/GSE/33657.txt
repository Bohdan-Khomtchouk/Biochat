TITLE
Expression analysis of Ralstonia solanacearum strain GMI1000 at 20°C and 28°C in rich medium (CPG) and in planta

ORGANISM
Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, strain GMI1000 at 20°C and 28°C in culture and in planta. The  tropical strain GMI1000 cannot wilt tomato plants at 20°C although it can cause full-blown disease at 28°C.

DESIGN
A 16 array study using total RNA recovered from the following: 8 separate cultures of Ralstonia solanacearum strain GMI1000 grown in rich medium-CPG (4 grown at 20°C and 4 grown at 28°C) 8 separate in planta samples of Ralstonia solanacearum strain GMI1000 harvested from diseased tomato plants cv. BonnyBest (4 recovered from plants grown at 20°C and 4 from plants grown at 28°C)  Each array (4-plex format) measures the expression level of 5061 genes from Ralstonia solanacearum strain GMI1000 with 2 to 6, 40-70 mer probes per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy. The arrays also contain probes for intergenic regions with no technical replicates.
