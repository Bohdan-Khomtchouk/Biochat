TITLE
CLIP-seq analysis of integrase-RNA interactions

ORGANISM
Human immunodeficiency virus 1

SUMMARY
Integrase CLIP-seq experiments were conducted on wild-type and eccentric HIV-1 virions generated in the presence of allosteric integrase inhibitors and IN K264/266A and R269/K273A mutations

DESIGN
Integrase CLIP-seq experiments were conducted by immunoprecipitation of integrase-RNA complexes from fully formed mature and eccentric virus particles. Libraries of RNA molecules bound by integrase were generated and sequenced by Illumina Hi-Seq2000 and 2500 platforms.
