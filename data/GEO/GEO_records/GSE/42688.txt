TITLE
Gene expression analysis of male and female embryonic day 14 genital tubercle (GUDMAP Series ID: 45).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing urogenital system. The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus Microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of the embryonic day 14 genital tubercle of the male and the female.

DESIGN
The genital tubercle region from E14 (TS22) FVB/N males and females were microdissected and total RNA isolated for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix MOE430 microarray chip.
