TITLE
Cells and exosomes after cell-free culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to report that breast cancer associated exosomes contain microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the RISC Loading Complex  (RLC) and display cell-independent capacity to process precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into mature miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs, along with Dicer, AGO2, and TRBP, are present in exosomes of cancer cells. CD43 mediates the accumulation of Dicer specifically in cancer exosomes. Cancer exosomes mediate an efficient and rapid silencing of mRNAs to reprogram the target cell transcriptome. Exosomes derived from cells and sera of patients with breast cancer instigate non-tumorigenic epithelial cells to form tumors in a Dicer-dependent manner. These findings offer opportunities for the development of exosomes based biomarkers and therapies.

DESIGN
Exosomes from cancer cells and non-tumorigenic cells were isolated using established ultracentrifugation methods. The global miRNA content of cancer exosomes [MCF7 exos, MDA-MB-231 exos and 4T1 exos] and normosomes [NmuMG exos and MCF10A exos]  was investigated before and after exosomes were cultured in cell-free media to study the microRNA biogenesis in exosomes. Samples 1 and 2 are samples with different times of culture [72hr and 24hrs, respectively].
