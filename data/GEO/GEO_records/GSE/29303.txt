TITLE
Genome-wide transcript profiling associated with metabolic regulation of Poplar N storage and cycling

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Previous research has shown that glutamine and sucrose treatment of excised poplar stems induces bark storage protein (BSP) gene expression. The objective of this research is to identify changes in gene expression associated with metabolic regulation of nitrogen storage and cycling and use this information to identify potential regulatory genes. Significant, differentially expressed genes were identified in excised poplar stems incubated in solutions of glutamine, sucrose, glycine, glutamine+glucose, and glutamine+sucrose compared to incubation in a water control.
