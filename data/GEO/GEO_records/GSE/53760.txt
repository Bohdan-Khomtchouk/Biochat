TITLE
Identification of Sox3 targets in mouse neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox3 has been shown to be expressed within neural progenitors of the developing mouse central nervous system. However, identification of Sox3 targets within neural progenitors has remained elusive. Using microarrays we compared populations of in vitro derived mouse neural progenitor cells, with or without Sox3, to identify putative Sox3 neural progenitor targets.

DESIGN
Mouse R1 ES cells, with or without Sox3, were differentiated into neural progenitor cells using the standard N2B27 protocols. At the fourth day of N2B27 differentiation, over two independent series, RNA was extracted from both Sox3 positive and Sox3 null populations and hybridization on a GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix microarrays.
