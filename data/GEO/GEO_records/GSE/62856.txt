TITLE
Functional characterization of C. elegans Y-box binding proteins reveals tissue-specific functions and a critical role in the formation of polysomes (RIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We present a basic characterization of the function of Y-box binding proteins (YBPs) in C. elegans. YBPs in other organisms are known RNA-binding proteins. Our global analysis of associated mRNAs supports a role of YBPs as general mRNA binders in C.elegans.

DESIGN
FLAG IPs were performed on transgenic animals expressing FLAG-tagged versions of either CEY-1, CEY-2, or CEY-4. MYC IPs served as controls. All IPs were performed in duplicates. 12 samples in total.

PLATFORM
GPL18245 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
