TITLE
Gene expression profiles of high and low immune responder Holstein cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The study explores the genetic basis of high or low antibody (Ab) and cell (DTH)-mediated immune responses in Canadian Holstein cows using microarray hybridization to an in-house immune-endocrine cDNA microarray Keywords: immune response comparison

DESIGN
The study uses a common reference design for the microarray hybridizations. There are three biological replicates per group and there are four groups: high-Ab, low-Ab, high-DTH and low DTH. The design included four technical replicates with dye swap for each biological replicate.
