TITLE
miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) profiling of monocyte-derived osteoclasts and macrophages.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the miRNA changes that occur during osteoclast differentiation we used the miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) to profile monocyte-derived osteoclasts and monocyte-derived macrophages. Of the 2046 probes present on the assay, we detected expression of ~400 (20%) miRNAs across all samples.

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of 4 normal, healthy volunteers and differentiated into osteoclasts or macrophages in vitro. Total RNA was isolated from these cells at 0, 24, 72, 144, and 288 hours of culture. RNA was profiled using the Qiagen miRCURY LNATM microRNA Hi-Power Labelling Kit and miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen).

PLATFORM
GPL19128 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array; 7th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (miRBase 18.0)
