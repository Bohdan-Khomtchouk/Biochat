TITLE
SKPs derive from hair follicle precursors and exhibit properties of adult dermal stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global expression analysis of neural crest-like skin-derived precursors (SKPs) and Sox2-positive follicle dermal cells that SKPs originate from. In spite of the remarkable regenerative capacity of mammalian skin, an adult dermal stem cell has not yet been identified. Here, we provide evidence that SKPs, multipotent neural crest-like skin-derived precursors, represent an adult dermal stem cell. When transplanted into adult skin, SKPs can reconstitute the adult dermis, contribute to dermal wound-healing, home to a hair follicle niche, and instruct epidermal cells to make hair follicles. Hair follicle-derived SKPs self-renew, maintain their multipotency, and serially reconstitute hair follicles. The endogenous origin of SKPs are Sox2-positive follicle dermal cells that share a similar global gene expression profile with SKPs. These endogenous cells home back to their follicle niche, induce hair follicle morphogenesis, and differentiate into neural and dermal progeny. Hair follicle-associated dermal cells will move out of their niche to contribute to dermal maintenance and wound-healing. These studies therefore identify a dermal stem cell, and provide a biological rationale for the presence of a multipotent precursor within adult dermis, findings with important therapeutic implications.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 4 independent neonatal backskin primary passage SKP preparations and from 5 independent neonatal Sox2:EGFP-positive, CD34-negative backskin cell isolates prepared in this way. These RNA samples were analyzed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. No technical replicates were performed.
