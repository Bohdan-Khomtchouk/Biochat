TITLE
Cortex PS2 APP transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene Expression profiles from whole cortical tissue from the PS2APP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease will reflect the cellular alterations, including the pathological drivers and the compensatory mechanisms of neurodegeneration when compared to wild-type control animals. The " SAMID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech. The ID of this project in Genentech's ExpressionPlot database is PRJ0006684 Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
5 Male transgenic and 5 Male wild-type mice were perfused and sacrificed at 3 months (earliest behavioral changes), 7 months (inflammation and plaque pathology), or 13 months (spreading synapse loss) of age. Hemicortices were subdissected and flash frozen prior to RNA extraction using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue extraction kit with on-column Dnase digestion.
