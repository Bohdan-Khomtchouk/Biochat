TITLE
P15 Rat Sciatic Nerve ChIP-Chip with NuRD complex components

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The NuRD complex is required for efficient and timely myelination in the peripheral nervous system.  ChIP-chip assays were performed on rat sciatic nerve at P15, a peak timepoint of myelination, for binding of Chd4 to genes involved in regulating myelin formation. This experiment includes two custom ChIP-chip design incorporating many genes that are dynamically regulated during myelination. The antibodies used in this platform were Chd3/4 (Santa Cruz sc-11378) Chd4 (gift from Paul Wade), Mta2 (Santa Cruz sc-9447), and Nab2 (Santa Cruz sc-22815).

DESIGN
Chd4 ChIP samples from experimental and input samples were hybridized.
