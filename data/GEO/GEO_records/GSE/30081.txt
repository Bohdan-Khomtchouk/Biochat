TITLE
Blueberry Diets during Early Development Only Is Sufficient to Prevent Senescence of Osteoblasts and Bone Loss in Adulthood

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Appropriate nutrition during early development is essential for optimal bone mass accretion; however, linkage between early nutrition, childhood bone mass and prevention of bone loss later in life has not been extensively studied. In this report, we have demonstrated several fundamental issues in the field. 1) A significant prevention of ovariectomy (OVX) -induced bone loss from adult rats can occur with only 14 days consumption of a blueberry-containing diet immediately prior to puberty. 2) The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects involve increased myosin production and preserved a shuttle for transcription factors such as Runx2 from cytoplasm to nucleolus which stimulates osteoblast differentiation and reduces mesenchymal stromal cell senescence. 3) The effects of blueberry diet on preserving fidelity of osteoblast differentiation also overcome reduced osteoblast differentiation and activity due to OVX-induced degradation of collagen matrix.

DESIGN
Bone quality was compared among casein control diet sham operated, casein diet ovariectomized, long term BB diet ovariectomized, and short term BB diet ovariectomized female rats
