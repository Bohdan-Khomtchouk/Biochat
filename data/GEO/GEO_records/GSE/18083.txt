TITLE
To Study the effects of antioxidant on allergic airways inflammations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ragweed challenge in Ragweed (RWE) sensitized animals generates Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the airway epithelium and induces allergic airway inflammation. We want to study the genes induced by ROS generated by RWE. This goal can be achieved by comparing PBS challenge vs. RWE challenge. Keywords: Infection

DESIGN
There are two group of animals. Group 1 has Wild type mice(n=3) treated with PBS and Group 2 has Wild Type mice(n=4) treated with Ragweed
