TITLE
Bleomycin induces molecular changes directly relevant to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis:  A model for “active” disease.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic profiling of bleomycin- and saline-treated mice across 7 timepoints (1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days post treatment) was carried out in C57BL6/J mice to determine the phases of response to bleomycin treatment which correspond to onset of active pulmonary fibrosis.

DESIGN
Temporal genomic characterization of lung homogenate from male C57BL6/J mice treated intratracheally with bleomycin or saline was carried out at 7 timepoints post treatment (1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days). Bleomycin (2U/kg) in 50 μl was intratracheally sprayed once into mice lightly anaesthetized with isoflurane (5% in 100% O2). Control animals received 50 μl of saline. Total RNA was isolated from the mouse lung tissue of bleomycin- and saline-treated mice across the 7 time points (n=8 per group) and homogenized in QIAzol reagent. Purified total RNA was amplified and labeled using NuGen Ovation kits (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA), and RNA from samples was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 arrays. One sample (saline treated, d14) was flagged as an outlier in principal component analysis and removed from subsequent analysis.
