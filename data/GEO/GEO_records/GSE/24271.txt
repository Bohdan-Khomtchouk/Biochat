TITLE
Gene expression profiling of A549 cells that undergo cell death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was analyzed using A549 cells that were treated with glucose deprivation (GD) or GD + phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA).

DESIGN
Gene expression levels were determined by comparing the gene expression of the experimental samples (GD or GD+PMA) with that of the control sample.
