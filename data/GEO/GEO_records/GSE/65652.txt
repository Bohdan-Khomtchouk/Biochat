TITLE
Cancer-adipoocyte interaction by co-culture of MCF7 and human primary adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examination of an interaction between adipocytes and MCF7 to identify the genes associated with invasion of carcinoma cells into adjescent adipocytes.

DESIGN
To identify up-regulated genes by adipocyte-cancer interaction in breast cancer cells, mono-cultured MCF7 was used as control to compare with 3T3-L1 adipocytes co-cultivated MCF-7 for 72 hours in DMEM

PLATFORM
