TITLE
Dissecting the Precise Role of Histone H3 K9 Methylation in Crosstalk with DNA Maintenance Methylation in Mammalian Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study supports a role for H3K9 methylation in promoting DNA methylation, it  demonstrates  for the first time that DNA maintenance  methylation  in  mammalian  cells  is  to  large  extent independent on H3K9 methylation.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation levels in UHRF1 knock in and wide type mice.
