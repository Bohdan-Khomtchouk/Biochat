TITLE
Deciphering the Developmental Dynamics of the Mouse Liver Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data to interrogate the developmental dynamics of the C57BL/6 mouse liver transcriptome. We analyze gene expression patterns in the developing mouse liver over 12 distinct time points from late embryonic stage (2 days before birth) to maturity (60 days after birth). Biological functions deemed significant at different developmental stages are identified and their leverage is mapped over time. Upstream regulators modulating these gene expression patterns are determined and their regulatory networks are described along with putative transcriptional modules associated with gene regulation. Several genes that were alternatively spliced over time were identified. Previously uncharacterized isoforms were found for several genes.

DESIGN
We analyze gene expression patterns in the developing mouse liver over 12 distinct time points from late embryonic stage (2 days before birth) to maturity (60 days after birth). Three replicates per time point.
