TITLE
Mechanism of protective immunity against Vibrio anguillarum infection in zebrafish bath-vaccinated with MVAV6203

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
MVAV6203, an live attenuated vaccine showed a strong protection against V. anguillarum for Paralichthys olivaceus, Epinephelus coioides and zebrafish. However the mechanism of its protection, especially the mucosal-related response induced by immersion vaccination, is not fully understood. This study was conducted to reveal the changes of genes involved in both innative and adaptive immunity. For gene expression analysis, spleen of zebrafish from 3 vaccinated groups and 3 control groups  were hybridized on a 4×44K aglient whole zebrafsih genome oligo microarray. Functional analysis of the microarray data was performed using KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Microarray gene expression analysis showed that the Th17-like immune response may  play vital role in orchestrating the mucosal barrier against pathogen.

DESIGN
Zebrafish were randomly divided into three vaccinated groups and three control groups. V.anguillarum MVAV6203 was cultured in high-salt Luria (LB) medium at 30 for 16h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and rinsed twice in 2% saline. The desired number of cells was adjusted to 1.0E+08 CFU/mL with 2% saline. Six groups of 70 zebrafish were immersed in the aerated cell-resuspended saline or 2% saline for 10min at 24℃. At 28 days post-vaccination pool of spleen tissue of 10 zebrafish from each group was harvested for microarray hybridization.
