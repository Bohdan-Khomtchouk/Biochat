TITLE
Expression data from microRNA-520f transfected PANC-1 pancreas carcinoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA-520f regulates EMT, as it activates CDH1 (mRNA) and E-cadherin (protein) expression, and it suppresses tumor cell invasion. We have characterized miR-520f target genes through whole genome transcriptional profiling of miRNA transfected pancreas cancer cells (PANC-1). In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from A. non-transfected (Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent only), B. negative control miRNA  (mirVana #4464058), and C. miR-520f (mirVana #4464066) transfected PANC-1 cells (ATCC #CRL-1469). These data are used to obtain genes that are differentially expressed in response to miR-520f activity.

DESIGN
In total 9 samples (each condition in triplicate) were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 and using ANOVA. A. non-transfected vs. C. miR520, and B. neg control vs. C. miR520. Genes that were significantly up or downregulated in the miR520-treated cells in comparison to both control groups were considered miR-520f target genes.
