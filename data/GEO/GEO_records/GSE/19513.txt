TITLE
Expression data from P2 mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zinc finger protein ZBTB20 plays a critical role in mouse hippocampal development by orchestrating gene expression profile of hippocampal neurons. We used microarrays to investigate the target gene of ZBTB20 in mouse hippocampal development.

DESIGN
Mouse hippocampi were harvested at postnatal day 2 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify the target genes of transcription factor ZBTB20 in hippocampal development. To that end, we isolated the hippocampi from ZBTB20 knockout and their littermate control mice.
