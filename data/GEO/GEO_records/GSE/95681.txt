TITLE
Network of nutrient sensing pathways and a conserved kinase cascade integrates osmolarity and carbon sensing inÂ Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Identifying nutrients available in the environment and utilizing them in the most efficient manner is a challenge common to all organisms. The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates, from simple sugars to the complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls. The zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor CLR-1 is necessary for utilization of cellulose, a major, recalcitrant component of the plant cell wall; however, expression of clr-1 in the absence of an inducer is not sufficient to induce cellulase gene expression. We performed a screen for unidentified actors in the cellulose-response pathway and identified a gene encoding a hypothetical protein (clr-3) that is required for repression of CLR-1 activity in the absence of an inducer. Using clr-3 mutants, we implicated the hyperosmotic-response pathway in the tunable regulation of glycosyl hydrolase production in response to changes in osmolarity. The role of the hyperosmotic-response pathway in nutrient sensing may indicate that cells use osmolarity as a proxy for the presence of free sugar in their environment. These signaling pathways form a nutrient-sensing network that allows N. crassa cells to tightly regulate gene expression in response to environmental conditions.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type and mutant N. crassa cells exposed to carbon starvation and cellulose. There are 14 different strains and conditions each done in biological triplicate, which includes wild type controls for a total of 42 samples.
