TITLE
Circulating Adipose-derived Exosomal miRNAs and metabolites associated with insulin signaling are altered by gastric bypass surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 array profiling of adipocyte-derived exosomes from pre and post bariatric subjects. We used miRNA arrays to profile FABP4+ (adipocyte-derived) exosomes isolated from serum from pre and post bariatric subjects.

DESIGN
We isolated FABP4+ (adipocyte-derived) exosomes from Human bariatric patient pre and post serum and profiled them to determine insulin signaling correlations.
