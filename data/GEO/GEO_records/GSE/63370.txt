TITLE
Gene Signature of High White Blood Cell Count in B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression profiling of ETV6-RUNX1-positive BP-ALL patient samples to identify differentially expressed genes based on the presenting white blood cell count ( < 50,000/cumm vs > 50,000/cumm).

DESIGN
Ten samples from patients with low white blood cell counts ( < 50,000/cumm) were compared with five samples from patient with high white blood cell counts ( > 50,000/cumm).
