TITLE
Expression analysis of Antirrhinum majus inflorescence meristems grown under control and crowding conditions

ORGANISM
Antirrhinum majus

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes as a result of crowding growth conditions.

DESIGN
A five-chip study using total RNA recovered from samples of inflorescence meristems of Antirrhinum majus cv.165E, grown as single plant per pot (control) and 10 plants per pot (crowded conditions). Each chip measures the expression level of 11,959 ESTs with up to six 60-mer probes per target.
