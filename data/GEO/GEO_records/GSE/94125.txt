TITLE
Analysis of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 response to co-cultivation with Meiothermus ruber strain A

ORGANISM
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of the cyanobacteria T. elongatus to co-cultiavation with a heterotrophic partner M. ruber was examined under three varying light levels and three varying oxygen levels.

DESIGN
Three light levels were examined: low (197 µmol photons m-2 sec-1), mid (1190 µmol photons m-2 sec-1), and high (1995 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) all with oxygen at at a partial pressure of 0 .  Three oxygen levels were also examined: low (partial pressure of oxygen=0), mid (partial pressure of oxygen=0.3) and high (partial pressure of oxygen=0.6) all at a light level of 197 µmol photons m-2 sec-1.  T. elongatus was examined both axenically and with a hetertrophic partner of each of these six conditions.  The high light condition overlaps with the low oxygen condition for both axenic and co-culture experiments
