TITLE
Seasonal gene expression in a migratory songbird

ORGANISM
Catharus ustulatus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from brain samples of 20 captive Swainson's thrushes. 10 were from California, belonging to the coastal subspecies, and 10 were from Alaska, belonging to the inland subspecies.

DESIGN
Gene expression level analysis of Swainson's thrushes maintained in captivity for > 1 year. The study treatments were: non-migratory inland (N = 4), non-migratory coastal (N = 6), migratory inland (N = 6), migratory coastal (N = 4). This Series includes 19 Samples.  This Series does not include migratory inland Sample t22 (it was not included in any analyses because its overall expression was an outlier to the remaining dataset).
