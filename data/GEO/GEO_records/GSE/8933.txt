TITLE
Germline and Somatic Disruption of DLG2 in Neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data suggest that DLG2 functions as a human neuroblastoma suppressor gene Keywords: aCGH

DESIGN
To discover genetic events that might be involved in the initiation of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, we performed a genome-wide scan for DNA copy number abnormalities in the germline and tumor DNAs from ten patients with neuroblastoma and complex congenital abnormalities using a customized high-resolution BAC array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) platform.

PLATFORM
GPL4894 Penn/CHOP Homo sapiens 4.5K (BAC array for studying Neuroblastoma)
