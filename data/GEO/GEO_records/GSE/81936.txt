TITLE
Methylation Profiling of IGHV Unmutated vs mutated CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, the methylation profiling (MeDIP) was carried out in 14 treatment-naive, early stage (Rai stage 0-2)  CLL patients and pooled 19+ normal controls. To find an association of methylation with IGHV mutation status, CLL patients were further segregated into IGHV unmutated (n=9) and  IGHV mutated (n=5) subgroups. The methylation signature obtained for CLL versus nornal controls and; unmutated versus mutated CLL was integrated with gene expression profile of these patients and the results were correlated with clinical outcome.

DESIGN
Methylation profiling was carried out in 14 treatment na√Øve early stage CLL samples and pooled samples (n=3) from 10 healthy subjects. The CLL patients were further seggregated into unmutated (n=9) and mutated (n=5) on the basis of IGHV mutation status and methylation profile of these two groups were also compared.
