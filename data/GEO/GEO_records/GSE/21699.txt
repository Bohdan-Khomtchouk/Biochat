TITLE
Architectural complexity of the polyadenylated intestinal transcriptome revealed by hybrid RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the complexity of the polyadenylated transcriptome of the mouse intestinal tract assessed by a hybrid RNA-sequencing. We show that 90.72% of the polyA-derived unique reads map to known genes, but  9.28% of reads matched to nonannotated genomic regions.

DESIGN
Screening and verification of non-annotated transcriptional units by different RNA-Seq protocols.
