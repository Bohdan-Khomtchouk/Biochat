TITLE
Gene expression of ovary and neural complex in adult Ciona intestinalis

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
To compare with new Ciona intestinalis microarray NimbleGen 135k, we peformed gene expression analysis of GPL14686. Total RNAs from common samples with a part of NimbleGen's analysis are used for this analysis.

DESIGN
Ovary and Neural Complex from adult Ciona intestinalis, duplicate, 2 time points during spawning

PLATFORM
GPL14686 Ciona intestinalis Oligoarray ver.2 4X44k
