TITLE
Effects of eye opening on gene expression in the superficial layers of the rat superior colliculus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq on six samples of P20 Sprague Dawley rat superior colliculus, three control rats that underwent eye opening at P14 until P20 and three deprived rats which had their eyes glued closed from P14 until P20. Each sample was created from two pooled colliculi.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of the superior colliculus with and without long term light deprivation.

PLATFORM
GPL10287 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Rattus norvegicus)
