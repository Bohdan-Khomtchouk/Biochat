TITLE
Expression profiling during early flower development [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We studied early events of flower formation with a temporal resolution by employing a floral induction  system to drive synchronised flower development from inflorescence meristem-like tissue (Wellmer et al. (2006)). We  generated a developmental time series including vegetative leaf tissue, young developing flowers at  zero (t0) and two days after induction of flower development (t2), and fully expanded inflorescences. We analysed histone mark dynamics at those time points and the transcriptomics data presented here served to compare histone mark dynamics to transcriptome dynamics.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis in four different developmental stage/tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana using RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
