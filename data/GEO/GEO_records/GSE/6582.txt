TITLE
Candida glabrata transcription profile when grown under Niacin starvation or in human urine

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
The transcription profile of Candida glabrata grown under two different Niacin limitation conditions were determined. Condition 1 is comparing log phase C. glabrata cells (O.D. 0.5-0.6) grown in synthetic medium containing 0.016 uM versus 3.25 uM nicotinic acid (NA), a common form of Niacin. The NA concentration of 3.25 uM is the standard concentration in synthetic complete (SC) medium. Condition 2 is comparing log phase C. glabrata cells (O.D. 0.4-0.6) grown in 3 individual human urine samples (supplemented with 2% glucose) versus in SC medium. Keywords: transcriptional profiling by microarray

DESIGN
GSM151863, GSM151869 are dye-swap experiment #1 and GSM151880, GSM151881 are dye-swap experiment #2 for Niacin limitation condition 1. GSM151934, GSM152116 are dye-swap experiment #1, GSM152118, GSM152119 are dye-swap experiment #2 and GSM152130, GSM152131 are dye-swap experiment #3 for Niacin limitation condition 2.
