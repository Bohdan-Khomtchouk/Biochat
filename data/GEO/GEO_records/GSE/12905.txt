TITLE
Foxl2 functions in sex determination and histogenesis throughout mouse ovary development, analyzed by Affymetrix arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of Foxl2-null ovaries to wildtype ovaries, ovaries lacking Wnt4 or Kit, or testes, throughout mouse development. The goal of this study was to identify early Foxl2 target genes as well as other ovarian, anti-testis genes that may act independently of Foxl2. Keywords: disease state analysis; genetic modification; developmental study
