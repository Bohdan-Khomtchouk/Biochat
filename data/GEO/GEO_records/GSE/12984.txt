TITLE
Response to the inhibitors of mevalonate pathway in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this experiment we performed the transcriptional profiling of the wild type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon treatment with lovastatin or zaragozic acid. These drugs are known to exert a repressing effect on the sterol branch of the isoprenoid pathway, but their action differs at the level of FPP biosynthesis. While lovastatin decreases FPP availability because it is an inhibitor of HMGR, zaragozic acid increases this level because it inhibits squalene synthase. In this work, we were interested especially in genes, whose expression would be oppositely regulated in the presence of lovastatin or zaragozic acid, since these genes could be affected by variation in FPP level and thus related somehow to the isoprenoid pathway.
