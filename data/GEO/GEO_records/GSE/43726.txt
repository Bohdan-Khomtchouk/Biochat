TITLE
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in breast cancer cell lines after ectopic manipulation of miR-26a expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing technology has been carried out in order to evaluate mRNA expression changes after manipulation of miR-26a in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
To evaluate the entire set of genes modulated by miR-26a in breast cancer, we performed RNA-seq after ectopic manipulation of this miRNA. We over-expressed miR-26a in MCF-7 epithelial cancer cell lines and also reduced its activity by stably transfecting MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal-like cancer cell lines with a specific sponge vector. GO terms and pathway enriched analysis of the transcripts that significantly change upon miR-26 ectopic manipulation implicates miR-26ab in cell cycle, apoptosis, cell spreading and cell adhesion in breast cancer
