TITLE
Tet-Gabpα cKO ES cells: -Tet vs. +Tet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated tetracycline-inducible myc-GABPα-expressing Gabpα conditional knockout embryonic stem cells (Tet-Gabbpα cKO ES cells), and then compared the transcriptional profiles between control (-Tet) and Gabpα-null (+Tet) cells by an oligo DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Tet-Gabpα cKO ES cells were cultured with or without Tet for 1 day. Total RNAs were isolated and subjected to microarray analysis.
