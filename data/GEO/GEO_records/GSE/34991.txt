TITLE
Transcriptional profile of EHEC 86-24 fusK (HK) and fusR (RR) mutants

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
The goals of this experiment was to obtain a transcriptional profile of EHEC 86-24 upon deletion of fusK or fusR genes.

DESIGN
The samples were grown in DMEM until late logaritmic phase then RNA was extracted using the TriZol method.
