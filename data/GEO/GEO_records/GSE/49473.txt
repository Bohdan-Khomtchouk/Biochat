TITLE
A Genomics-Based Analysis of Relative Potencies of Dioxin-Like Compounds in Primary Rat Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A toxicogenomics approach was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare gene expression changes in rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF). Hepatocytes from five individual rats were exposed for 24 hours to 11 concentrations of each chemical ranging from 0.00001 nM to 100 nM and a vehicle control.

DESIGN
115 microarrays representing primary hepatocytes from 5 rats, each exposed to 11 doses of each chemical (PeCDF and TCDF) and vehicle controls. Arrays were completed with a one-color design.
