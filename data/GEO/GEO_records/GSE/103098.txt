TITLE
Müller glial microRNAs are required for the maintenance of glial homeostasis and retinal architecture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the miRNAs in adult Dicer1-CKO Müller glia of the neural retina, we isolated the Müller glia from Rlbp-CreER: Stopf/f-tdTomato/Dicerf/f mice by means of fluorescent activated cell sorting and analyzed their miRNAs using NanoStrings Technologies®. miRNA expression of Dicer1-CKO Müller glia was compared to wild type Müller glia (a re-analyzed sample from GSE94759). We found that all highly expressed miRNAs declined in the Dicer-CKO leading to a disruption in retinal architecture over time.

DESIGN
Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to purify adult Müller glia (pooled from 26 retinas, > postnatal day 21), using an Müller glia specific cre-lox labeling strategy by crossing Rlbp1-CreER:tdTomato mice with Dicer1f/f mice. The RNA was extracted from purified Müller glia (tdTomato+) and miRNA expression was analysed using NanoString and nCounter Technologies ®.
