TITLE
Neurod6 expression defines new retinal amacrine cell subtypes and regulates their fate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to define gene expression patterns of two mouse retinal neuron subsets that express the Thy1-mitoCFP-P (MP) transgene. The two populations expressing the MP transgene are: 1) non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic amacrine cells; and 2) a subset of OFF-type bipolar cells.

DESIGN
We used the VC1.1 monoclonal antibody, which labels amacrine cells (ACs) but not bipolar cells, to separately purify the AC and bipolar populations that express the MP transgene. Two biological replicates, originating from different litters, were collected for each sample. RNA was extracted from sorted cells and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
