TITLE
Progesterone activates multiple innate immune pathways in Chlamydia trachomatis-infected endocervical cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
In this project we examined the in-vitro effect of female sex hormones (estradiol and progesterone at average physiological concentrations) during a infection mediated by Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D, on the gene expression of human endometrial cell line ECC-1

DESIGN
