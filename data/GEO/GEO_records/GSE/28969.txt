TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human breast cancer cell lines after demethylation treatment.

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The contribution of aberrant DNA methylation and the downstream effects in tumorogenesis through silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and microRNAs has been investigated. Since these epigenetic alterations can be reversed, we investigated the effects of the epigenetic therapy in breast cancer cell lines. We used microarrays to investigate the global microRNA expression profile after demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine (DAC) in breast cancer cell lines and identified distinct classes of early and late systematic stable or transient effects of the treatment.
