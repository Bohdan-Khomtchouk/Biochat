TITLE
Basonuclin-1 modulates epithelial plasticity and TGF-Î²1-induced loss of epithelial cell integrity [BNC1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-b1-stimulation induces an epithelial dedifferentiation-process, throughout which epithelial cell sheets disintegrate and gradually switch into fibroblastic-appearing cells (EMT-like transition). Several transcription factors, some of them being TGF-b1-responsive, are functionally involved in such a switch and affect epithelial differentiation and plasticity. We used microarray-based gene expression profiling of mammary epithelial cells that actively undergo TGF-b1-induced epithelial dedifferentiation. Further, we determined gene expression changes in Basonuclin-1 knock-down cells in conjunction with TGF-b1-stimulation in order to determine a possible effect of Bnc1 on TGF-b1-responsive genes.

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with non-silencing (control) siRNA or siRNA against Basonuclin-1 (Bnc1) for 24hrs. Subsequently, cells were treated with 5ng/ml TGF-b1 or left untreated for additional 24hrs. The experiments were performed as independent biological triplicate.
