TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis plants under varying zinc supply.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Deficiency of the micronutrient zinc is a widespread condition in agricultural soils, generating a negative impact on crop quality and yield. Nevertheless, there is insufficient knowledge on the regulatory and molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to inadequate zinc nutrition. Hydroponically-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants (WT Col-0 and the T-DNA insertion double mutant bzip19 bzip23)  were subjected to zinc deficiency, sufficiency and excess. The particular role of the bZIP19 and bZIP23 transcription factors was investigated via the bzip19 bzip23 double mutant.

DESIGN
Fourty two Affymetrix ATH1 microarray hybridizations were carried out, to resolve the transcriptome under three variables: genotype (WT vs. Mutant), tissue (Shoot vs. Root) and zinc supply (Defficiency vs. Sufficiency vs. Excess).
