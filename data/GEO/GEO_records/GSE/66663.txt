TITLE
Dermal papilla signature gene expression in immortalized human dermal papilla cells from balding and non-balding scalp

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of DP signature gene expression in hTERT-immortalized balding (BAB) and non-balding (BAN) dermal papilla cells derived from frontal and occipital scalp of male patients with androgenetic alopecia Hamilton grade IV.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from BAB and BAN, 3 replicates for each cell line
