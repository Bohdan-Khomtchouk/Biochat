TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of female VMHpvlm and VMHpvll

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate whether female VMHpvlm and VMHpvll have distinct transcriptional profiles, we conducted RNAseq onto these subnuclei that were microdissected by laser capture microdissection. Our results demonstrate that each subnucleus had distinct set of enriched genes.

DESIGN
VMHpvlm and VMHpvll of VgluT2-cre/Ai6 female mice were microdissected using Laser capture microdissection.  Subsequent RNAseq generated transcriptional profiles of the subnucleus.

PLATFORM
