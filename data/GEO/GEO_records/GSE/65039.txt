TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of alveolar macrophages in asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate the alteration of gene expression pattern of alveolar macrophages by allergen challenge in human asthmatics. Method: By using subsegmental bronchial provocation with allergen (SBP-AG) protocol, we obtained BAL fluids, before and 48 hours after allergen challenge in the subjects enrolled in the protocol. Alveolar macrophages were purified from the BAL fluids and total RNA was isolated. Next-generation sequencing data were generated by using the Illumina system. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 75 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome and identified 29,691 transcripts in the macrophage mRNAs. Among them, the change in the expression profiles of 37 transcripts were statistically significant. Conclusions: It has been well accepted that Th2 cytokine enriched environment transforms the phenotype of macrophages into alternatively activated form. However, the details of a genome-wide gene expression profiles of macrophages were not well investigated. Using RNA-seq technology, we provided comprehensive data of macrophage gene expression profiles in allergic lung inflammation. Our data could offer a framework to study biologic functions of alternatively activated macrophage in chronic inflammatory diseases.
