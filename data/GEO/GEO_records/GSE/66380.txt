TITLE
ATF4 governs functional expansion of hematopoietic stem cells partially via Angptl3 in the fetal liver microenvironment (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we demonstrated that deletion of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) resulted in severely impaired HSC expansion in the fetal liver at E12.5 and E15.5. In contrast, generation of the first HSC population in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region at E11.5 was not significantly affected. Furthermore, the HSC-supporting ability of both endothelial and stromal cells in fetal liver was significantly compromised in the absence of ATF4. Gene profiling using RNA-seq revealed down-regulated expression of a panel of cytokines in ATF4-/- stromal cells, including angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA).

DESIGN
To investigate the molecular pathways of ATF4 in the stromal cells and LSK cells in the fetal liver.
