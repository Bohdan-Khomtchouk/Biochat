TITLE
ORC binding profile in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Map ORC binding sites to identify replication origins in C. albicans by using polyclonal ORC antibodies (gift from Stephen Bell Lab).  Due to the unsynchronized nature of Candida cells, log-phase cultures were taken to perfoem ChIP-chip experiments to find the genome-wide ORC binding sites.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip experiments from log-phase C. albicans culture. 7 different unsynchronized log-phase cultures as replicates.
