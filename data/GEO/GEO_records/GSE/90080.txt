TITLE
RNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings overexpressing the transcription factor TCP14

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the transcription factor TCP14 (AT3G47620) under the UBQ10 promoter.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown under short day conditions (9h of light at 21°C - 15h of dark at 18°C) for two weeks. Samples were harvested in the beginning of the light period and used for RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. Lines Col-0 (4 replicates), UBQ10::YFP-TCP14-3 (4 replicates), UBQ10::YFP-TCP14-4 (1 replicate), and coi1-16 (2 replicates) were used in the experiment. Each replicate corresponds to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
