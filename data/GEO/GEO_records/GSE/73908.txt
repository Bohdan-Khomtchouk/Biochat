TITLE
Transcriptomic difference between the wild type red-fruited tomato and its yellow-fruited mutant

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Background: Fruit color is an important quality trait for nutrition value in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and has attracted huge attention for a long time. In order to dissect the yellow-fruit color of a novel tomato mutant n3122, we compared the dynamic transcriptome of the fruit pericarps from the mutant n3122 and its wild type red-fruited tomato cultivar M82. Results: The transcriptomes of fruits from M82 35 DPA (Days Post Anthesis), M82 47 DPA, M82 54 DPA, n3122 35 DPA, n3122 47 DPA, n3122 54 DPA and n3122 60 DPA were sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing platform. A total of 5568 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly identified in the four pairwise comparisons of M82_35 DPA vs n3122_35 DPA, M82_47 DPA vs n3122_47 DPA, M82_54 DPA vs n3122_54 DPA and M82_47 DPA vs n3122_60 DPA. Further Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that carotenoids biosynthesis, ethylene biosynthesis and signaling transduction, and transcription factors associated fruit ripening were different between M82 and n3122 which might be the underlying mechanisms for the yellow-fruit color of tomato. Conclusions: This research provided a global data set of dynamic transcriptomic changes during fruit development and ripening for the wild type red-fruited tomato cultivar M82 and its yellow-fruited mutant n3122, and offered a base for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying tomato red/yellow fruit color mutation.
