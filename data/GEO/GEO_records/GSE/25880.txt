TITLE
Characterization of the human host response to Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to study the molecular response of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells to E. cuniculi parasite infection, kinetics microarray experiments targeting human genes expression have been performed during the parasite whole infection cycle. Infected HFF cells (IHFF; t=4h, 16h, 48h, 72h and 120h ) were systematically compared with control uninfected HFF cells (UHFF; t=0h).

DESIGN
Time-dependent experiment comparing two conditions, IHFF vs. UHFF cells (data points: t=4h/0h, t=16h/0h, t=48h/0h, t=72h/0h, t=120h/0h).
