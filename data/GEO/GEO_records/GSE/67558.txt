TITLE
Protein phosphatase PP1-NIPP1 activates mesenchymal genes in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The deletion of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) regulator     NIPP1 is embryonic lethal during gastrulation, hinting at a key role of     PP1-NIPP1 in lineage specification. Consistent with this notion we show     here that a mild, stable overexpression of NIPP1 in HeLa cells caused a     massive induction of genes of the mesenchymal lineage, in particular     smooth/cardiac-muscle and matrix markers. This reprogramming was     associated with the formation of actin-based stress fibers and     retracting filopodia, and a reduced proliferation potential. The     NIPP1-induced mesenchymal transition required functional substrate and     PP1-binding domains, suggesting that it involves the selective     dephosphorylation of substrates of PP1-NIPP1.

DESIGN
In total 16 samples were processed. Four different cell lines were analysed: HTO_parental, HTO_NIPP1wt, HTO_NIPP1m (= alias NIPP1-Pm) and HTO_NIPP1-Pa. For each cell line 4 replicates were obtained. The HTO_parental cell line is the control cell line. For the HTO_NIPP1wt and the HTO_NIPP1-Pa the 4 replicates were obtained from two replicates of two different transgenic cell lines expressing FlagNIPP1wt (cell line wt n°1 and 2) and FlagNIPP1-Pa (cell line n°1 and 2), respectively. Each cell line was derived from the same parental control cell line.
