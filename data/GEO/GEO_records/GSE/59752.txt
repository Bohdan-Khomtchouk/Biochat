TITLE
Transcription factor binding in liver tissue isolated from WT and GRdim mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo data for GR in liver tissue isolated from WT and GRdim mice. Comparison of the mouse models reveals that GR interacts with the genome as both a monomer and dimer.

DESIGN
Examination of GR, RNAPII and CEBPb binding in WT and GRdim mice on a genome-wide scale

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
