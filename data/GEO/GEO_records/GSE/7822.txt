A comparison of DNA copy number profiling platforms using a panel of melanoma cell lines

SUMMARY
The accurate mapping of recurring DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs), a hallmark feature of the cancer genome, has facilitated the discovery of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.  Microarray-based assays designed to detect these chromosomal copy number alterations on a genome-wide and high-resolution scale have emerged as a cornerstone technology in the genomic era.   The diversity of commercially-available platforms prompted a systematic comparison of five copy number profiling assays for their ability to detect 2-fold copy number gain and loss (4n or 1n, respectively) as well as focal high-amplitude CNAs.   Here, using a collection of established human melanoma cell lines, we defined the reproducibility, absolute signals, signal:noise, false-positive and false-negative rates for each of the five assays against ground-truth defined by Spectral Karyotyping (SKY), in addition to comparing the concordance of CNAs detection by two high-resolution Agilent and Affymetrix microarray platforms.  Our analyses concluded that the Agilent’s 60mer oligo-microarray with probe design optimized for genomic hybridization offers the highest sensitivity and specificity [area under Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve > 0.99] while Affymetrix’s SNP microarray appears to offer better detection of CNAs in gene-poor region.  Availability of these comparison results should guide study design decisions and facilitate further computational development. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
