TITLE
Gene expression data comparing rbf1 mutant and PSC overexpressing Drosophila eye imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PSC overexpression can cause phenotypes specifically in an rbf1 mutant background, likely due to a sensitization to PSC-induced phenotypes.  The goal of this study is to understand the interaction between rbf1 hypomorphic mutation and the overexpression of Polycomb group gene Posterior sex combs.  We used Drosophila larval eye imaginal discs that were mutant for rbf1 or overexpressing PSC and compared these to control larval eye discs to assess changes in gene expression. We identified a common set of genes that are deregulated when rbf1 is mutated or when PSC is overexpressed.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from eye imaginal discs dissected from third instar Drosophila larvae.  Samples were amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array.  To better understand the effects of rbf1 mutation and PSC overexpression, we compared the gene expression of rbf1 mutant eye discs and eye discs overexpressing PSC to control eye discs.
