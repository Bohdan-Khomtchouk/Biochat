TITLE
Identification of RNAs bound to MS2 aptamer using MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
DsrA regulatory RNA represses both hns and rbsD mRNAs through distinct mechanisms in Escherichia coli

DESIGN
Identification of RNAs co-purified with MS2 aptamer in a rne131 strain. pNM12 empty vector was used as control

PLATFORM
