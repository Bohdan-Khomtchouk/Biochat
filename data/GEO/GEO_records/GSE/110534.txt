TITLE
Allele-specific DNA methylation of disease susceptibility genes in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We determined cis-regulated allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) around IBD susceptibility genes in CD4+ effector/memory T cells (Tem) in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) in patients with IBD

DESIGN
We performed MSNP analysis to detect allele specific methylation.
