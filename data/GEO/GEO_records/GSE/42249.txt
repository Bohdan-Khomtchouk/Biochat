TITLE
Genome-wide localization of NF-E2 p45 in mouse primary megakaryocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq assay was performed with anti-p45 antibody using in vitro cultured primary megakaryocytes to identify direct p45 target genes in megakaryocytes.  This analysis revealed genes that regulate platelet function, which were not known previously to be p45-regulated.

DESIGN
ChIP was performed using a day-3 primary culture of megakaryocytes from E13.5 fetal livers of wild-type mice with an anti-p45 antibody.

PLATFORM
