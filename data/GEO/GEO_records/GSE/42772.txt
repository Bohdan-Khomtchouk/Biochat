TITLE
Transcription pattern in Normal (NL) and Down's Syndrome (DS) Astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a broad-spectrum microarray analysis using mRNA from 3 NL and 5 DS astrocyte cultures. The microarray output was validated for several genes To explore the relation between gene expression and potential oxidative stress in DS samples, we also evaluated the transcription profile in NL astrocytes subjected to mild oxidative stress (50ÂµM H2O2 for 24 hr).

DESIGN
Samples of total mRNA from NL cultures non treated (NT), normal cultures treated with H2O2 (T), DS cultures NT and DS cultures T were included in the arrays.
