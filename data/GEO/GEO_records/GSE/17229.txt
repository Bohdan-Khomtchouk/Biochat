TITLE
Mouse Cells Time of Replication (ToR)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Measurment of the ToR by comapring the DNA content of the S phase and the DNA content of the G1 phase, the method is based on the method used in the paper - Replication timing of the human genome by Woodfine et al. that was published in Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004. Briefly, after staining with Propidium Iodide,  cells in G1 and S phase of the cell cycle are sorted by FACS sorter (ARIA or Vantage), DNA is then extracted from the fractions and differentially labeled with dUTP-Cy3 or dUTP-Cy5 using direct labeling (Agilent labeling kit). The labeled DNA is cohybridized to the array. Early replicating sequences correspond to the spots with high S/G1 ratio and late replicating sequences correspond to the spots with low S/G1 ratio.

DESIGN
four mouse tissues were measured (MEF, L1210, ES-stem cell, and NPC-neuronal progenitor cells derived from the same ES line), 2 replicates for each sample
