TITLE
HOXA5 transcriptional targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOXA5 inducible cell line Hs578T was established and cultured as described previously (MCB 2004. 24:924-935). 2Ã—106 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm cell culture dish at 24h before induction. Two batches of RNA from HOXA5-inducible cells (0 h, 6 h and 9 h) were purified for repeating the microarray hybridization experiments once using Affymatrix Chips.Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Keywords: time-course
