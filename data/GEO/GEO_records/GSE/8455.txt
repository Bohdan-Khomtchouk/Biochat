TITLE
AtNF-YB1 and CBF4 Overexpression Study in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The baseline transcriptional profiles of Arabidopsis seedling shoots overexpressing CBF4 or AtNF-YB1 were compared with wild-type controls. Keywords: overexpression_study

DESIGN
Two independent homozygous 35S::AtNF-YB1 lines (#3 and #6), two independent 35S::CBF4 lines (#10 and #19, 23), and wild type Col-0 Arabidopsis were grown axenically on vertically-oriented tissue culture plates under 24 h light on standard MS media. Seedling shoot tissue (separated from root tissue) was harvested at 10 am after 14 days of growth and processed according to standard protocols for Affymetrix GeneChips. Two biological replicates for each transgenic line or three replicates for the single wild-type lines, each containing 20-24 seedlings, were hybridized to microarrays.
