TITLE
Expression data from GGF2-treated post-MI swine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a paracrine factor critical for cardiac development.  We have been examining whether the recombinant NRG-1Î² isoform known as glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) has therapeutic potential for heart failure. In both small and large animals after experimental myocardial infarction (MI) we have found that GGF2 treatment improves myocardial function and limits progressive myocardial remodeling.  To understand potential mechanisms for this effect, we compared gene expression in swine by microarray analysis. We used microarrays to compared th the global gene expression underlying the efficacy of GGF2 treatment for heart injury.

DESIGN
Left ventricular tissue remote from the site of infarct was collected from each of 8 animals (3 untreated controls, 3 low dose GGF2-treated and 2 high dose GGF2-treated) and processed for gene expression microarray analysis using Affymetrix porcine genome GeneChips.
