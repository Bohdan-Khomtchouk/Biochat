TITLE
Investigating putative RPS4-chromatin associations during Arabidopsis plant disease resistance, using a temperature-inducible system which resembles pathogen-infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Innate immune responses of plant cells confer the first line of defence against pathogens. Signals generated by activated receptors are integrated inside the cell and converge on transcriptional programmes in the nucleus. The Arabidopsis Toll-related intracellular receptor RPS4 operates inside nuclei to trigger resistance and defence gene reprogramming through the stress response regulator, EDS1. In order to test a role for RPS4 at the chromatin level during Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI), we undertook a ChIP-seq approach.

DESIGN
We used transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing RPS4 in EDS1 WT or eds1-2 mutant backgrounds. In the EDS1 WT background, an immune response can be turned on rapidly and synchronously in leaf cells after a switch from high to moderate temperature. In order to substract defense-unrelated artifacts due to the temperature stimulus, we used Col-0 WT plants in parallel as negative control. This Series represents the ChIP-Seq data only. The related gene expression microarray data are available in GSE40143, and RNA-Seq data in GSE40216.
