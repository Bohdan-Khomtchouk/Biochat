TITLE
MicroRNA profile of exosome from serum samples of  Kawasaki disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our miRNA diagnostic approach to Kawasaki disease(KD), we have employed microRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs as the potential biomarkers to rapidly diagnose Kawasaki disease. Pooled exosome of serum in equal amount from 5 healthy children, 5 KD patients and 5 KD patients after Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy were used for microRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
MicroRNA profile of exosome from Kawasaki disease(KD) was analyzed by microRNA microarray analysis in 5 healthy children, 5 KD patients and 5 KD patients after IVIG therapy.

PLATFORM
