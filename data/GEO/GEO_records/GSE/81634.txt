TITLE
Allyl-isothiocyanate treatment induces a complex transcriptional reprogramming including heat stress, oxidative stress and plant defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are degradation products of the plant secondary metabolites glucosinolates (GSLs) and are known to affect human health as well as plant herbivores and pathogens. To investigate the processes engaged in plants upon exposure to isothiocyanate we performed a genome scale transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana at different time points in response to an exogenous treatment with allyl-isothiocyanate.

DESIGN
In-vitro grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants (10 days after sowing) were exposed to allyl-isothiocyanate vapour for 30 minutes, 1 hour and 9 hours. Non-exposed control plants were harvested at each time point. The plantlets used for each biological replica were harvested separately from two individual petri dishes and immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2. Each time point consists of two biological replicas from ITC-treated and control plants.
