TITLE
ENCODE H1_ES cell phenotyping study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These samples are part of the ENCODE consortiumâ€™s proposed time-limited Pilot Study for confirmation of the utility of RNA abundance measurements as a standard reference phenotyping tool. Keywords: cell type comparison For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Each batch of H1-ES cells cultured by Cellular Dynamics International for use by the ENCODE labs was processed on Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST arrays to obtain phenotyping data.

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
