TITLE
FOXD3 is a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FoxD3) is a transcriptional factor which belongs to forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor family. The functions of FOXD3 in embryogenesis and in the development of neural crest cells have been clearly defined. Its tumor suppressor function hasbeen found in many types of cancer in recent years. However, the study about its roles in lung cancerdevelopment is still lacking. Our study found that deficiency of FoxD3 in lung cancer enhanced cell growth and cell invasion. RNA-sequence analysis demonstrated that loss of FoxD3 mainly affected cell cycle progression related gene expression. Knockdown of FoxD3 led to G2-M cell accumulation with up-regulation of DNA replication licensing factor MCM5 and MCM4 as well as cell cycle regulator polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) and CDC6. Over-expression of those genesin lung cancer was associated with poor clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients. We also identified high mobility group box-1(HMGB1), Hras and Ephrin B1 gene expression increase after FoxD3 silencing which may participate in enhanced lung cancer cell invasion. Our study identifiedtumor suppressor function of FoxD3 in lung cancer andwe did the first comprehensive analysis of the genes regulated by FoxD3 for cell proliferation and invasion in lung cancer. The identified genes regulated by FoxD3 through our analysis will provide valuable information to uncover the mechanism of FoxD3 tumor suppressor function.

DESIGN
Three control and three FOXD3 knockdown A549 cell lines were subjected to RNA sequencing.
