SUMMARY
Investigation of differential gene expression array between primary and cultured human bone marrow MSCs as adherent cells (P0 and P3) or spheres (P0 and P3)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted lin-CD45-CD31-CD71-CD235a-CD271+ cells primary cells (n=3), from cultured adherent cells (P0; n=4, P3; n=4) and from sphere cultured cells (P0; n=4, P3; n=4)
