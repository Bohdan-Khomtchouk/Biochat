TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after inhibition of methylation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Expression microarray of livers from 4 dpf control zebrafish larvae, larvae treated with azacytidine, and ahcy mutant larvae Comparison of expression from livers obtained from ahcy+/+ treated with vehicle, ahcy+/+ treated with azacytidine, and ahcy-/- treated with vehicle.

DESIGN
We treated larvae starting at 2 dpf with 1 mM azacytidine or vehicle control. Livers were removed at 4 dpf, RNA isolated, and double amplified.
