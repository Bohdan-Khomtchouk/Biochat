TITLE
CHIP-seq KAT2B in mouse isolated islet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPRer) pathway plays an important role for pancreatic β cells to adapt their cellular responses to environmental cues and metabolic stress. Although altered UPRer gene expression appears in rodent and human type 2 diabetic (T2D) islets, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We show here that germ-line and β-cell specific disruption of the lysine acetyltransferase 2B (Kat2b) gene in mice leads to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance. Genome wide analysis of Kat2b-regulated genes and functional assays revealed a critical role for KAT2B in maintaining UPRer gene expression and subsequent β-cell function. Importantly, Kat2b expression was decreased in db/db and in human T2D islets and correlated with UPRer genes in normal human islets. In conclusion, KAT2B is a crucial transcriptional regulator for adaptive β-cell function during metabolic stress by controlling UPRer and represents a promising target for T2D prevention and treatment
