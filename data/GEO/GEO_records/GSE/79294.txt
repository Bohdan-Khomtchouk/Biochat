TITLE
Identification of transcripts whose abundance changes in response to acute switches in DSX isoform in the ovary and testis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNAseq of dissected adult ovary and testis after DSX isoform is switched using temperature inducible alleles or constructs.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were sequenced for each genotype at each condition.

PLATFORM
