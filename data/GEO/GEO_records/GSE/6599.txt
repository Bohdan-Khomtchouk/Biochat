TITLE
gene expression in monkey aorta with aging and gender

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Although increased vascular stiffness is more prominent in aging males than females, and males are more prone to vascular disease with aging, no study has investigated the genes potentially responsible for gender differences in vascular aging.  We tested the hypothesis that the transcriptional adaptation to aging differs in males and females using a monkey model, which is not only physiologically and phylogenetically closer to humans than the more commonly studied rodent models, but also is not afflicted with the most common forms of vascular disease that accompany the aging process in humans, e.g., atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Gene expressions of monkey aorta from four groups (YF, OF, YM, OM) were detected to find out the molecular mechanism of aorta stiffness. Keywords: aging and genders

DESIGN
Four groups were used in this experiment. 6 samples per group.The transcriptional profile of the aorta was compared by high-density microarrays between young and old males or females.  About 600 genes were expressed differentially when comparing old versus young animals. Analysis of the different groups was further performed by gene ontology.We also analyzed  whether the transcriptional regulation described above might correspond to specific transcription factors
