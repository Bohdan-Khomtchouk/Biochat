TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Sorghum bicolor responding to combined heat and drought stress

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
Sorghum is an important crop often subjected to simultaneous high temperatures and drought in the field. We examined the gene expression response to heat and drought stress both individually, and in combination, with the aim of identifying important stress tolerance mechanisms.

DESIGN
Plants were subjected to 4 different conditions (control, heat shock, drought stress and combined heat and drought stress). 3 replicates were carried out for each treatment type giving a total of 12 samples

PLATFORM
GPL17335 Agilent-39880 Unilever-Durham University Sorghum 28K array (Probe Name version)
