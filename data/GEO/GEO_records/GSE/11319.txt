TITLE
Met mutations in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tyrosine kinase-activating mutations in Met have been observed in hereditary papillary renal carcinomas as well as in other cancers. These mutations have been examined in several in vitro systems, where they cause constitutive Met activation, focus formation, and cell motility, and are tumorigenic in xenografts. To determine the influence of these mutations on tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated mice with targeted mutations in the murine met locus. Five mouse lines with mutant Met were created: wt, D1226N, Y1228C, M1248T, and M1248T/L1193V. These mouse lines develop a wide range of sarcomas, lymphomas, and carcinomas. To determine if mutationally activated forms of Met have altered signaling specificity we utilized gene expression analysis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from the mutant Met lines and here we present data for wild type and M1248T (M833). Our results indicate that Met activating mutations have unique gene expression signatures. Keywords: mutant analysis
