TITLE
Role and function of Pten in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of Pten in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from Pten fl/fl mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with CRE-ERT2 or ERT2 (PMIP) and after 2 days of treatment with 4OH-Tamoxifen (0.5 micromolar) subjected to gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Two days after treatment with 4OH-Tamoxifen (0.5 micromolar) total RNA of Puromycin resistant cells was extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
