TITLE
Gene expression profiles of ASK1-deficient adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the potential function of ASK1 in adipose tissues, microarray analysis was performed using iBAT and eWAT. Tissue samples were collected from 10-week-old male mice, and RNA samples derived from three individuals were pooled to analyze. These data provide novel insights into the physiological functions of ASK1.

DESIGN
To elucidate the potential function of ASK1 in adipose tissues, microarray analysis was performed using iBAT and eWAT.
