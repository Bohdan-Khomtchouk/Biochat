TITLE
Huh-7-Mock and Huh-7-HBV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profiling of HBV-transfected Huh-7 cells and control cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of major malignant disease worldwide, and patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have a high risk of developing HCC. Via microarray gene expression analysis, we detected the gene alteration in HBV transfected hepatoma cells.

DESIGN
To investigate the role of HBV on gene alteration of hepatoma cells, the pUC18-HBV1.2 plasmid and control plasmid were transfected into Huh-7 cells (named as Huh-7-HBV and Huh-7-Mock). After 48 hours, the total RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling of both HBV transfected cells and control cells were carried out on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST array.
