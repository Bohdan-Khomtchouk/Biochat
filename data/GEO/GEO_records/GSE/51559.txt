TITLE
Expression data from control and Mbd4 KO CH12 cells that were activated with CIT for 24 hours.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AID-dependent U/G mismatches in S DNA are converted by BER and MMR DNA pathways into double-stranded breaks that are required for optimal CSR in activated B cells. Deficits in MMR proteins, MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2 result in lower CSR frequencies that are coupled with impaired DSB formation. MBD4 interacts with MLH1 and has been postulated to coordinate mismatch repair of U/G. Deletions of Mbd4 targeting the 5' end of the gene in mice do not affect CSR . However, Mbd4 transcription is complex, with the propensity to create alternative transcripts, including residual transcription leading to to truncated protein expression that complicates ananlysis in these mice. We describe a novel function of MBD4 housed in the C-terminus that is critical for DSB formation, which shares several characteristics with MMR . We conclude that the 3' end of the Mbd4 gene positively contributes to CSR and likely intersects the MMR pathway.

DESIGN
2 independent samples for each control and Mbd4 KO group
