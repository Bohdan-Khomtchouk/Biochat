TITLE
Expression data in WT and Satb1-/- ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satb1 and Satb2 are regulators of higher order chromatin in T cells and osteoblasts repectively. We were interested if Satb1 and Satb2 play a role in the regulation of gene expression in ES cells. In this experiment, we compared the transcriptome of wild type and Satb1-/- ES cells. Interestingly Satb1-/- ES cells display an impaired differentiation potential.
