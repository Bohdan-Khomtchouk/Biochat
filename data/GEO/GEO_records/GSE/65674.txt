TITLE
Gene expression data in DLEU1 downregulated BL cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiling between DLEU1 downregulated Raji BL cell and wild type Raji BL cell

DESIGN
Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) mediated DLEU1 downregulated Raji burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell clone and wild type (control) Raji cell clone were analyzed in duplicate. Four samples were hybridized to HGU133_plus_2 Genechip(Affymetrix) and scanned with the Scanner 3000 7G.
