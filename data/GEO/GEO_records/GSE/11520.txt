TITLE
Identification of flap structure specific endonuclease 1 as a factor involved in LTM formation of aversive learning

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We proposed that DNA recombination/repair processes play a role in memory formation.   Here, we used microarray analysis of rat amygdala genes to identify possible DNA recombination/repair factors involved in memory consolidation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA).  Among the genes that showed statistically significant differential expression, we identified fen-1, encoding a flap-structure specific DNA endonuclease.  Amygdalar fen-1 mRNA induction was associated to the illness component of CTA, since it could be observed by the pairing of a flavor and gastrointestinal illness, by the illness itself, but not by the presentation of the flavor alone.  No CTA related induction of fen-1 expression was observed in the insular cortex.  Importantly, functional validation studies demonstrated that amygdalar suppression of  fen-1 expression impaired memory consolidation of CTA.  Overall, our studies helped identify a new DNA recombination/repair candidate factor involved in memory formation of aversive experiences.

DESIGN
Two comparisons were established between the cRNA samples: CTA versus Flavor-only and CTA versus Toxin-only. For each comparison, the microarray experiment was repeated four times using new biological samples, each consisting of a sample pool from 3 animals. Two of the four biological replicates were performed as dye-swaps in order to correct for dye bias effects.
