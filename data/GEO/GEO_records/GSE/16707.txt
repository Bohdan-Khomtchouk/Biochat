TITLE
Long-term effect on the transcriptome of loss of Frizzled4 signaling in cerebellar endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of the cerebellar endothelial cells from P16 Fz4-/- animals were compared to their wild type littermate controls. The goal is to characterize the long-term effect on the transcriptome of loss of Fz4 signaling in cerebellar endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Endothelial cells were immuno-purification from P16 cerebellum using anti-PECAM antibody coated dynabeads. The cell immuno-purification procedure follows that described by Matsubara et al. (2000) and Su et al. (2003). 3 replicates of both wild type and Fz4-/- cerebellar endothelial cells were analyzed.
