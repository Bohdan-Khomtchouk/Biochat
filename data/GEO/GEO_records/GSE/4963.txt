TITLE
Heart Failure, DITPA and Captopril

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Three weeks after infarction, age matched rats with large infarction by ECG criteria were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: 1) Treatment with Captopril for 21 days and a daily subcutaneous dose of DITPA for the last 10 days of treatment, 2) Treatment for 10 days with DITPA alone, 3) Control heart failure and 4) Sham-operated. Keywords: Drug Effects on Heart Failure

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from left ventricle using TRIzol and later Poly A+ RNA was isolated with Oligotex beads. About 0.5ug Poly A+ RNA was reverse transcribed and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 and 647. Labeled probed were hybridized with Operon's rat Unigene oligo library printed on glass slides. After 2 lows and 1 high stringency washes, Prolong Antifade was added to the slides to prevent any bleaching effect. The experiments were repeated 2-4 times by dye-swaping. Slides were scanned in Array Worx scanner with dual wave length. The data ratio was normalized using a location and intensity dependent Lowess formula.
