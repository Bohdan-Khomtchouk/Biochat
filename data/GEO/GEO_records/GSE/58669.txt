TITLE
A Dach2-Hdac9-Myog-Gdf5 signaling system regulates regeneration of neuromuscular synapses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle denervation due to injury, disease or aging results in impaired motor function.  Restoring neuromuscular communication requires axonal regrowth and regeneration of neuromuscular synapses.  Muscle activity inhibits neuromuscular synapse regeneration. The mechanism by which muscle activity regulates regeneration of synapses is poorly understood.  Dach2 and Hdac9 are activity-regulated transcriptional co-repressors that are highly expressed in innervated muscle and suppressed following muscle denervation.  Here, we report that Dach2 and Hdac9 inhibit regeneration of neuromuscular synapses. Importantly, we identified Myog and Gdf5 as muscle-specific Dach2/Hdac9-regulated genes that stimulate neuromuscular regeneration in denervated muscle.  Interestingly, Gdf5 also stimulates presynaptic differentiation and inhibits branching of regenerating neurons.  Finally, we found that Dach2 and Hdac9 suppress miR206 expression, a microRNA involved in enhancing neuromuscular regeneration.

DESIGN
RNAseq on innervated and 3 day denervated adult soleus muscle from wildtype mice is compared with that from 3 day denervated soleus muscle from Dach2/Hdac9 deleted mice to identify Dach2/Hdac9-regulated genes.
