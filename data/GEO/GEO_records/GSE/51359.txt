TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL-LT) and in vitro activated peripheral blood B-cells. We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis on frozen tumor biopsies from 19 cases of PCFCL and PCLBCL-LT to establish microRNA profiles. Cluster analysis of the complete microRNome could not distinguish between the two subtypes, but 16 single microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed.

DESIGN
Lymphoma miRNA profiles of were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
