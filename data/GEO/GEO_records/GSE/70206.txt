TITLE
Genetic characterization of the MCF-10A cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MCF-10A cells in our laboratory were karyotyped using array CGH. The results were compared against previously published karyotypes for the cell line.

DESIGN
Biological replicates of unperturbed, parental MCF-10A cells in our lab were analyzed using a dye swap method. Pooled male genomic DNA was used for the reference.
