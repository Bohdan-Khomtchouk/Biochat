TITLE
Basal gene expression in proliferating ASCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterize basal gene expression for proliferating adipose tissue MSCs, cultured at normal cell culture conditions.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from ASCs from 3 different donors cultured at normal conditions (DMEM/F12,10% FBS) for 3 weeks.
