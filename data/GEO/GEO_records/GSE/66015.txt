TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in human macrophages in response to different stimuli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in macrophages infected with influenza A virus or non-infected and treated with the saliphenylhalamide, obatoclax, expressing wild type NS1 protein or its mutant R38A, K41A. The hypothesis tested was that R38 and K41 residues within viral NS1 protein are essential for transctiptional control of cellluar gene expression. Cells were infected with influenza  A/WSN/33 viruses expressing wild type NS1 protein (WT), its R38A, K41A mutant (RK/AA) or non-infected (Mock)

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from macrophages 8 hours post stimuation.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
