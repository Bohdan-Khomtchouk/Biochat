TITLE
Liver expression data from four mouse strains treated with vehicle or PF-04287881 for seven days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PF-04287881 induced varying degrees of liver necrosis and phospholipidosis in a 34-inbred strain Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP) study. Four strains with differing susceptibilities to these phenotypes (MA/MyJ, NZW/LacJ, SM/J, WSB/EiJ) were selected for analysis of gene expression changes in the liver. The objective of this study was to identify gene expression changes that drive PF-04287881-induced liver injury.

DESIGN
Thirty-one total samples were analyzed: N=4 per treatment and strain, except PF-04287881-treated WSB/EiJ (N=3) where one animal died before the completion of the study due to gavage error. Two strains exhibited findings of PF-04287881-induced Kupffer cell vacuolation and were coded as phospholipidosis responders (MA/MyJ and NZW/LacJ). One strain exhibited findings of single cell necrosis and was coded as a necrosis responder (NZW/LacJ).
