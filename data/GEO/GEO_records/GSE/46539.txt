TITLE
Genetic modifiers of progression-free survival in never-smoking lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with first-line TKIs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Via a GWA study, several SNPs have been identified as markers capable of predicting prognosis of lung cancer patients receiving TKIs therapy as first-line treatment. In order to get insights into how these genetic variants are linked to traits of interest, we conducted a genome-wide eQTL study by integrated analyses of  SNP genotyping array data and gene expression array data of 115 subjects of lung adenocarcinoma. Our study successfully identified several SNPs as eQTLs, whose genotype were significantly associated with expression levels of several already known genes related  to lung cancer.

DESIGN
From the  Lung Cancer Tissue Core, 115 non-smoking subjects of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) were selected to obtain the gene expression profiles of both lung tumor and their adjacent normal lung tissues, using Illumina WG-DASL HumanRef8 v3 or HumanHT12 v4 BeadChip. Only shared probes of those two platforms were analyzed.
