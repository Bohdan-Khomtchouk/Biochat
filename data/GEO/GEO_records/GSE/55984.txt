TITLE
Gene expression profiling in leaf and panicles of non-transgenic and HMB4 over-expression line.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The profiling was conducted with the Rice 3'-Tiling 135k Microarray designed from 31,439 genes deposited at IRGSP, RAP2 database ( http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp ). In this research, an array of 31,439 rice genes was used to elucidate gene expression in leaf and panicles of non-transgenic and HMB4 over-expression line. The analyses show that transgenic rice induces early flowering due to an enhancement of stress response.

DESIGN
A total of 20 chips were used for microarray. Total RNAs were extracted from rice leaf and panicle. Experiments were duplicated.

PLATFORM
GPL18435 Rice 135k tiling V2 array
