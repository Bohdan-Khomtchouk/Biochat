TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of ADPKD placentas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this microarray study was to determine genes whose transcriptional profile was altered in the absence of polycystin-1 expression.  Placentas from knockout and wild-type littermates were compared at the latest viable timepoints (14.5d and 15.5dpc) and genes with a fold change > 1.5 were identified. Keywords: other

PLATFORM
GPL2028 NIA 15K mouse cDNA array
