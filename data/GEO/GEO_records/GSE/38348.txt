TITLE
Effects of Developmental Lead Exposure on the Hippocampal Transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the effects of lead-exposure up hippocampal gene expression in males and females exposed to 0ppm, 250ppm and 750ppm lead during two different developmental periods, perinatal (in utero through to weaning at PND21) and postnatal (PND0-PND45).  All tissue was taken at PND 55.  We used affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0ST arrays to obtain global gene expression data from each animal, with a group size of 4 for all conditions (Total number of Arrays = 40)

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in hippocampus at  no lead exposure (0ppm), 250ppm and 750 ppm lead exposure level at peinatal and postnaltal developmental period.
