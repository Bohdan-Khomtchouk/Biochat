TITLE
In vitro and In vivo Evidence of Long Non-coding OR3A4 in Gastric Cancer Progression and Tumorigenicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNA and mRNA expression profiling for 7 human gastric cancr samples (3 tumor tissues and 3 tumor lymph node and 1 normal tissue) We have completed the metastasis-related Long Noncoding RNA expression profiling data microarray analysis of the 7 human gastric cancer related samples

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of  three gastric cancer tissues and three metastatic lymph nodes tissues compared with the normal tissues and lymph nodes tissues, followed up more than five years, was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 1942 lncRNA and 1976 mRNA, leading to the successful construction of supervised

PLATFORM
