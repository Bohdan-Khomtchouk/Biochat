TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in gastric cancers plasmas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate miRNA expression profiles between gastric cancers plasma and healthy controls plasma,screening the microRNAs that can serve as plasma biomarkers for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer by miRNA array.

DESIGN
miRCURY™ LNA expression array was used to investigate the differences of miRNA expression profiles in 5 gastric cancers plasma and 3 healthy controls,the miRNA array contains 3100 capture probes, covering all human, mouse and rat microRNAs annotated in miRBase 18.0.

PLATFORM
GPL17107 Exiqon miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array - hsa, mmu & rno
