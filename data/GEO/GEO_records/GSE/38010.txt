TITLE
Janus-Like Opposing Roles of CD47 in Autoimmune Brain Inflammation in Human and Mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene transcripts and proteins expressed during disease pathogenesis identify targets for therapy. We performed microarray analysis of histologically characterized multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions in comparison with control brain samples to identify differentially expressed molecules. We identified CD47 as a target of interest and studied its biology in MS and EAE.

DESIGN
We isolated total RNA from acute plaque (AP), chronic active plaque (CAP) and chronic plaque (CP) from MS brains and white matter from healthy controls and performed microarray studies.
