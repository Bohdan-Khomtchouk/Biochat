TITLE
mRNA Expression data from bladder cancer and normal bladder tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. In order to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of BCa, the details of molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and development needs to be clarified. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the mRNA and miRNA interactions in BCa. 3 human bladder cancer tissues and 3 normal bladder tissues were analyzed using microarray. The alteration of mRNA and miRNA expression between the 2 groups were detected.

DESIGN
A total of 3 BCa tissues and 3 normal bladder tissues were obtained for total RNA extraction and hybridization from patients who underwent surgical treatment according to clinical protocols. All cases were reviewed by two pathologists for confirming the diagnosis of BCa. We sought to obtain the aberrant mRNA and miRNA between BCa tissues and the normal bladder tissues.
