TITLE
PMCA2 Regulates HER2 Expression, Cell-Surface  Localization and Signaling, and Promotes HER2-  Mediated Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the normal breast, PMCA2 transports calcium into milk. It is also  upregulated in breast cancer cells and high tumor levels predict increased  mortality in patients. In this study, we examined interactions between PMCA2  and HER2. We find that PMCA2 and a scaffolding protein, NHERF1, interact  together with HER2 in specific membrane domains protruding from the surface of  breast cancer cells. Knocking down PMCA2 or NHERF1 increases intracellular  calcium and leads to the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of HER2  after receptor activation. This is associated with reductions in HER2 expression  and signaling. Manipulating PMCA2 levels regulates proliferation and apoptosis  of breast cancer cells in vitro and knocking out PMCA2 dramatically inhibits the  formation of hyperplasia and tumors in MMTV-Neu mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on control SKBR3 cells vs. PMCA2, NHERFR1 and HER2 knock down cells. Each group has 6 duplicates.
