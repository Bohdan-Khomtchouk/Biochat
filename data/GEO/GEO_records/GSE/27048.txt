TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in rice endosperm

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone H3 trimethylation in rice endosperm. By obtaining about four hundred million bases of sequence from rice chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of rice endosperm. We find that the presence of H3K27me3 in either upstream or downstream of a gene is predominately associated with repression of the gene, while its absence is mainly associated with high gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in rice endosperm.
