TITLE
Expression data from WT, HEB-KO and E2A-KO LY6D- CLP cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The E-protein transcription factors E2A and HEB play important roles at several stages of hematopoiesis. However, the exact mechanism for theire action and the main targets in the LY6D negative common lymphoid progentior (CLP) compartment remains unknown. By adressing this question, we will gain important infromation regarding the early events leading to B-cell specification.

DESIGN
FACS sorted LY6D negative common lymphoid progenitors from WT, HEB-KO and E2A-KO mice were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. At least two independent sorts were performed per genotype. During each sort, cells were pooled from several bone marrows.
