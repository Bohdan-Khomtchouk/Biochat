TITLE
The Role of microRNAs in Neural Stem Cell-supported Endothelial Morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA microarrays and RNA expression arrays were used to identify  functional signaling between neural stem cell progenitor cells (NSPC) and brain endothelial cells (EC) that are critical during embryonic development and tissue repair following brain injury.

DESIGN
Mouse neural stem /progenitor cells (NSPC) and brain endothelial cells (EC) were co-cultured to identify changes in gene and miRNA profiles induced in ECs under the influence of NSPCs
