TITLE
mRNA expression profiling in myocardial tissue by caloric restriction initiated in different aged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) demonstrated that some altered pathways, such as p53, cell cycle, and TGFb signaling pathways were closely associated with cardiac aging. Notably, FOXO signaling pathway revealed significant differences between CR initiated in different aged mice

DESIGN
In this study, 6 samples from young, middle-aged, and old mice with or without caloric restriction (CR) were used to acquire the mRNA expression profiling thus to elucidate the possible molecular pathways underlying the observed different effects of CR on cardiac aging.
