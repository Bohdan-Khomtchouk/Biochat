TITLE
Expression of genes involved in the T cell pathway in circulating immune cells of cattle orally challenged with BASE

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine Amyloidotic Spongiform Encephalopathy (BASE) is a variant of classical BSE that affects cows and can be transmitted to primates and mice.The present work examined the effects of BASE on gene expression in circulating immune cells. Ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed between cattle orally challenged with brain homogenate from cattle confirmed as BASE and control cattle identified three main pathway which were affected. Within the immune function pathway, the most affected genes were related to the T Cell Receptor-mediated T Cell activation pathways. The differential expression of these genes in BASE challenged animals at 10,12 and 24 months following challenge vs controls, was investigated. The results of this study show that the effects of prion diseases are not limited to the CNS, but involve the immune system and particularly T cell signalling during the early stage following challenge before the appearance of signs if infection or clinical symptoms.

DESIGN
In the present work we analysed 5 sample from cows orally challenged with BASE and  5 negative samples for the microarray analysis. Probes,  negative and quality controls of the microarray  were synthesized in duplicate. Samples from four orally challenged cattle and four different negative control Holstein cows were used for the confirmation and time-course studies with real time PCR. Each qRT-PCR reaction was performed in triplicate
