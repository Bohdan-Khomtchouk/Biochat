TITLE
Induction of Interleukin-9-producing Mucosal Mast cells Promotes Susceptibility to IgE-mediated Experimental Food Allergy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Experimental IgE-mediated food allergy depends on intestinal anaphylaxis driven by interleukin (IL)-9. However, the primary cellular source of IL-9 and the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to food-induced intestinal anaphylaxis remain unclear. Herein, we have reported the identification of multifunctional IL-9-producing mucosal mast cells (MMC9s) that can secrete prodigious amounts of IL-9 and IL-13 in response to IL-33, and mast cell protease-1 (MCPt-1) in response to antigen and IgE complex crosslinking, respectively. Repeated intragastric antigen challenge induced MMC9 development that required T cells, IL-4, and STAT6 transcription factor, but not IL-9 signals. Mice ablated of MMC9 induction failed to develop intestinal mastocytosis, which resulted in decreased food allergy symptoms that could be restored by adoptively transferred MMC9s. Finally, atopic patients that developed food allergy displayed increased intestinal expression of Il9 and MC-specific transcripts. Thus, the induction of MMC9s is a pivotal step to acquire the susceptibility to IgE-mediated food allergy.

DESIGN
dUTP mRNA-Seq profiles of indicated hematopoietic cell lineages were generated on Illumina HiSeq2500.   Hematopoietic cells were  isolated from Balb/C mice that developed food allergy and bone marrow-derived mast cells were generated from na√Øve Balb/C mice
