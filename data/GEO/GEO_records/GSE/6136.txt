TITLE
Expression data from murine BRD2-mediated lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The dual bromodomain protein Brd2 is closely related to the basal transcription factor TAFII250, which is essential for cyclin A transactivation and mammalian cell cycle progression. In transgenic mice, constitutive lymphoid expression of Brd2 causes a malignancy most similar to human diffuse large B cell lymphoma. We compare the genome-wide transcriptional expression profiles of these lymphomas with those of proliferating and resting normal B cells. Transgenic tumors reproducibly show differential expression of a large number of genes important for cell cycle control and lymphocyte biology; expression patterns are either tumor-specific or proliferation-specific. Several of their human orthologs have been implicated in human lymphomagenesis. Others correlate with human disease survival time. BRD2 is underexpressed in some subtypes of human lymphoma and these subtypes display a number of similarities to the BRD2-mediated murine tumors. We illustrate with a high degree of detail that cancer is more than rampant cellular proliferation, but involves the additional transcriptional mobilization of many genes, some of them poorly characterized, which show a tumor-specific pattern of gene expression. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
26 samples are included in this series.  Sporadic murine E-mu-BRD2 mediated lymphomas are divided into three classes by disease severity and compared to either resting or mitogen-activated B Cells.  The resting and activated B Cells are either wildtype or E-mu-BRD2 transgenic.  All samples are on the FVB wildtype background.
