TITLE
Study of the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse ventricular tissue comparing WT control mice with mice invalidated (KO) for AMPK-alpha 2 gene. Goal was to identify new biological targets of AMPK in heart, through a global gene expression approach.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, KO vs. Control WT mice. Biological replicates: 6 WT (AMPK alpha2 +/+) control mice, 6 KO (AMPK alpha2 -/-) mice.

PLATFORM
GPL2872 Agilent-012694 Whole Mouse Genome G4122A (Feature Number version)
