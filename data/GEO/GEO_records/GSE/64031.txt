TITLE
Transcriptome characterization of CHOPS syndrome, a novel genetic disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations of AFF4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AFF4 is a component of super elongation complex (SEC), which plays an important role in mobilizing paused RNA polymerase II at gene promoter regions.  Using exome sequenging, we have identified a novel genetic disorder caused by missense mutations in AFF4.  We propose CHOPS syndrome as a name for this new diagnosis.  To evaluate the effect of identified missense mutations of AFF4, utilizing patient derived skin fibroblast cell lines, the gene expression analysis was perfomred.

DESIGN
To characterize the transcriptome pattern observed in CHOPS syndrome, the skin fibroblast samples from two CHOPS syndrome probands and three healthy control subjects were used. Samples used for expression array include two CHOPs syndrome samples (CDL160: 6 year-old Caucasian female with 254S mut and CDL444: 12 year-old Caucasian male with 254A mut) and three age gender matched controls (GM01652: 11 year-old Caucasian female, GM02036 11 year-old Caucasian female and GM08398: 8 year-old Caucasian male).
