TITLE
Expression data from purified human platelets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a markedly increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors fail to account for this increased risk. We used microarray to probe the platelet transcriptome in individuals with SLE and healthy controls, and the gene and protein expression of a subset of differentially expressed genes was further investigated and correlated to platelet activation status. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (p < 0.0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients as compared to healthy volunteers. Notably, patients with a history of vascular disease had increased expression of type I IFN-regulated proteins as well as more activated platelets as compared with patients without vascular disease. We suggest that interferogenic immune complexes stimulate production of IFNÎ± which up-regulates the megakaryocytic type I IFN-regulated genes and proteins. This could affect platelet activation and contribute to development of vascular disease in SLE. In addition, platelets with type I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE.

DESIGN
Platelets were purified from SLE patients (n=10) and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (n=10). cDNA was generated for each individual. For the microarray analysis, cDNA from the 10 SLE patients were pooled, as well as the cDNA from the 10 healthy volunteers to represent a mean mRNA expression level from 10 individuals.
