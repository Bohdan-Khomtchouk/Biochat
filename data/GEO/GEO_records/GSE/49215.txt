TITLE
Genomic characterization of three acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and one established cell line REH at the single cell level

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA copy number alterations and mutations were characterised by bulk SNP anlaysis and exome sequencing (not sown here) in three acute lymphoblastic leukaemia samples and one establish cell line REH. Further single cell experiments of these cases investigated the mutation and copy number targets previously defined exploring the sub-clonal populations and phylogenic trees within each leukaemia. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP6 arrays or Cytogenetics whole genome 2.7M arrays was performed for three leukaemic samples and one established cell line REH. Remission samples were only available for two of the leukaemia samples (Case A and Case B) and therefore 20 HapMap Caucasien samples were used as controls for the SNP6 array expeeriments.
