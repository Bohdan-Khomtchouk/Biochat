TITLE
Expression data from treatment of human melanocytes with phenolic compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vitiligo, an acquired disorder characterized by depigmented skin patches, results from loss of epidermal melanocytes. Etiology of vitiligo is not clearly understood but environmental, biochemical, genetic, and immune factors play a role in its pathogenesis. There is evidence that melanocyte death is perpetuated by an autoimmune response that causes lesions to spread. 4-tertiary butyl phenol (4TBP) and monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone (MBEH) are phenolic compounds that are known as environmental causes of vitiligo. We used microarray to detail the global gene expression that occurs following exposure of melanocytes to 4-TBP or MBEH to identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes that may contribute to melanocyte loss in vitiligo. We show that human melanocytes exposed to 4-TBP and MBEH show increased production of some  inflammatory cytokines. Interleukin-6 (IL6) and IL8, in particular, are expressed at the periphery of vitiligo lesions and may contribute to recruitment of immune components to the areas, perpetuating melanocyte loss.

DESIGN
Cultured human epidermal melanocytes were treated with 4TBP or MBEH for 3, 6, or 24 hours and gene expression were compared with untreated cells.
