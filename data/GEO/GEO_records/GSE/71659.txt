TITLE
Regional centromeres in Candida lusitaniae lack pericentromeric heterochromatin (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Clavispora lusitaniae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identifiy centromere locations of Candida lusitaniae through ChIP-Seq analysis. We applied ChIP-Seq on two centromere proteins: Cse4 and Mif2. After peak calling, we identified one peak in each of the 8 supercontigs of Candida lusitaniae which may represent the potential centromere location.

DESIGN
Identification of  centromere location of Candida lusitaniae using two centromere proteins: Cse4 and Mif2
