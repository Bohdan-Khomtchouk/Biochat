TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of T. reesei upon growth on different carbon sources in light and darkness

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the transcriptome upon growth on different carbon sources in light or darkness.

DESIGN
Strains of this study were grown on Mandels Andreotti Minimal Medium with 1 % w/v microcrystalline cellulose, glucose, glycerol or lactose as carbon source in constant light or constant darkness or pregrown for 24 hours on glycerol and then replaced to 1.5 mM Sophorose for cellulase induction and harvested after 5 hours; 2 biological replicates were included
