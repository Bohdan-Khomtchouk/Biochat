TITLE
CpG Methylation by Illumina Methyl27 Bead Arrays from ENCODE/HAIB

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE project. The track displays the methylation status of specific CpG dinucleotides in the given cell types as identified by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray platform ( ). In general, methylation of CpG sites within a promoter causes silencing of the gene associated with that promoter. Detailed information for the CpG targets is in an XLS formatted spreadsheet on the Myers' lab protocols website ( ). For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
