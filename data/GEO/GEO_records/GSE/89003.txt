TITLE
Drosophila Cbp80 is needed for the expression of piRNA components and piRNAs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
piRNAs expression analysis in dissected Drosophila ovaries, focused on the 42ab and flamenco locus

DESIGN
Germline tissue expressing reduced levels of Cbp80 (shRNA treatment knocked down Cbp80 specifically in the germline) was used to isolate small RNAs. Small RNA reads were compared to small RNA reads after knock down treatment of a control gene / mRNA (mCherry-Jupiter)

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
