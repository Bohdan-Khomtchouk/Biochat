TITLE
Expression data from Huh-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) dysfunction have been associated with cancer development. We investigated the function of an orphan C/D box class snoRNA, SNORD126, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells We used microarrays to identify targets with roles in SNORD126â€™s activity in Huh-7 cells

DESIGN
SNORD126- or EGFP-overexpressed Huh-7 cells were collected and followed by RNA extraction, then hybridized with Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the differentially expressed genes between the two groups.

PLATFORM
