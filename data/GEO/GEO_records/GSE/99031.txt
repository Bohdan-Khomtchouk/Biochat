TITLE
Global analysis of liver RNA from male and female Wildtype mice vs Ikbkb-deleted in hepatocyte mice fed high cholesterol and saturated fat diet (HCFD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatocyte IKKβ deficiency worsens HCFD-induced NASH in male but not female mice. To help understand this gender difference, we performed microarray analysis for liver RNA samples to determine genes which are differentially regulated by IKKβ deficiency in male but not female mice as compared to Wildtype mice.

DESIGN
Male and female Wildtype mice vs Ikbkb-deleted in hepatocyte mice were fed either standard rodent chow or HCFD from 2.5 months of age for 20 weeks.
