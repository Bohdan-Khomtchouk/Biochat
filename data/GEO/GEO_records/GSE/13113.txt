TITLE
Arabidopsis unfertilized pistil development and senescence

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of post-anthesis unfertilized pistil development and senescence in Arabidopsis, in a serie including samples from seven different stages according to pistil age in days post-anthesis (dpa). The time course started at anthesis and ended at 12-14 dpa, several days later of the loss of fruit set capacity. Keywords: Developmental time course

DESIGN
Unfertilized pistils were obtained growing under low humidity cer6-2 conditional male sterile mutant of Arabidopsis in Ler background. The seven stages considered were: 0-1 dpa, 2-3 dpa, 4-5 dpa, 6-7 dpa, 8-9 dpa 10-11 dpa and 12-14 dpa. Two biological replicas with two technical replicas each were performed for each stage. The biological replicas were grown independently, and all the samples of each one were harvested simultaneously. Amplified RNA from each sample was hibridized together with a global reference over the DNA microarray. The reference was generated from an equimolar mix of amplified RNAs from each of the seven samples of the corresponding biological replica. Amplified RNA from each sample was labelled separately with Cy5 and with Cy3, and each labelling was compared in the DNA microarray with Cy3-labelled and with Cy5-labelled RNA from the reference mix, respectively.
