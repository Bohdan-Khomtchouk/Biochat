SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of post-anthesis unfertilized pistil development and senescence in Arabidopsis, in a serie including samples from seven different stages according to pistil age in days post-anthesis (dpa). The time course started at anthesis and ended at 12-14 dpa, several days later of the loss of fruit set capacity. Keywords: Developmental time course
