TITLE
Uterine glands synchronize embryo-endometrial interactions and coordinate on-time embryo implantation and stromal cell decidualization for pregnancy success

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By employing FOXA2-deficient mouse models coupled with LIF repletion, we reveal definitive roles of uterine glands in pregnancy establishment.These studies provide original evidence that uterine glands synchronize embryo-endometrial interactions, coordinate on-time embryo implantation, and impact stromal cell decidualization, thereby ensuring embryo viability, placental growth, and pregnancy success.

DESIGN
Uterine transcriptomes of control and Foxa2-deficient mice were generated on gestational day (GD) 4 and GD 6 following LIF-repletion. All time points were done in quadruplicates.

PLATFORM
