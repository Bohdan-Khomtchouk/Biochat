TITLE
Identification of Highly Conserved Putative Developmental Enhancers Bound by SOX3 in Neural Progenitors Using ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SOX3 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPC) within the developing mouse cetral nervous system. A ChIP-Seq experiement was performed for SOX3 in NPCs derived from embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Identification of SOX3 binidng sites from 3 independent ChIP-seq samples in NPCs

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
