TITLE
Gene expression in chow or HFD-fed OGG1-/- livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in livers of male wild-type (WT) and OGG1-deficient (Ogg1-/-) mice fed either a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) were examined. Mice were fed the diet for 10 weeks prior to tissue collection and were 22 weeks of age at the time of tissue collection.

DESIGN
24 Total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using GeneSifter: WT Chow vs Ogg1-/- Chow; WT HFD vs. Ogg1-/- HFD using t-test followed by Benjamini and Hochberg correction.  An adjusted p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
