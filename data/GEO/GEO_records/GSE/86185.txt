TITLE
miRNA expression data in unstimulated and TGF-β1-stimulated lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung fibroblasts play an important role in extracellular matrix homeostasis and this process is mainly regulated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Hence, lung fibroblasts are postulated to play a crucial role in aberrant lung tissue repair and remodeling, which is a main factor in lung diseases like COPD. In this study, the effect of TGF-β1 on the miRNA expression in parenchymal lung fibroblasts is investigated.

DESIGN
Primary parenchymal lung fibroblasts of 9 control subjects were cultured. After serum starving for 24 hrs, the fibroblasts were stimulated with and without TGF-β1 (100 U/ml TGF-β1, equivalent to 3.1 ng/ml) for 24 hours. The RNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The RNA samples were then hybridized with the Human GeneChip miRNA 1.0 array (Affymetrix).
