TITLE
Immune response gene-1 prevents neutrophil mediated immunopathology during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, in vivo data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) is a host mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate under inflammatory conditions. Recent in vitro studies have suggested that itaconate can modulate inflammation and also have bactericidal effects by inhibiting isocitrate lyse (ICL), a bacterial glyoxylate shunt enzyme. To evaluate the function of Irg1 in vivo, we challenged wild-type (WT) and Irg1-/- mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and evaluated effects on morbidity, mortality, and immune response. Irg1-/- but not WT mice succumbed rapidly to Mtb, and the mortality was associated with increased infection, inflammation, and lung injury. This phenotype was due in part to a pathogenic neutrophil response, as it was reversed in depletion studies. Transcriptional profiling experiments and studies with WT and ICL-deficient Mtb suggest that Irg1 regulates mitochondrial metabolic pathways to temper inflammation rather than acting as a direct anti-bacterial mediator. Our data establishes that Irg1 modulates the immunometabolism axis to curtail Mtb-induced lung disease.

DESIGN
C57BL/6N (WT) mice were purchased from Charles River. B6.SJL (CD45.1) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Irg1−/− mice (embryonic stem cells obtained from KOMP (C57BL/6N background), MGI: 103206) were generated at Washington University. Adult mice (6-13 weeks of age) of both sexes were used, and sex was randomized between experiments. Neutrophils were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting from the bone marrow of naïve mice (negative selection) or the lungs of Mtb-infected mice at 16 dpi (selection for Ly6G+ cells) (Miltenyi).
