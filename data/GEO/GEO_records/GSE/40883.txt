TITLE
Gene expression before or 3 hours after t-RA treatment in HeLa cells expressing an shRNA control or shRNA against PARG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to compare gene expression after t-RA treatment in cells with or without the presence of the PolyADP ribose Glycohydrolase protein (PARG)

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of gene expression before or 3 hours after t-RA treatment in Hela cells expressing an shRNA control or shRNA against PARG
