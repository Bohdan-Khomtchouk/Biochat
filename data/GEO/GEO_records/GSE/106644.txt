TITLE
Expression data from CTCL patient skin lesion [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) can have clinical and histological features resembling benign inflammatory dermatosis (BID) and can be difficult to diagnose especially at the early stage of CTCL. We used microarrays to detail the global alteration of miRNA transcriptome and generate a diagnosis and prognosis signature.

DESIGN
Patient skin biopsy samples were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled 3 samples per group into one Affeymetrix sample.
