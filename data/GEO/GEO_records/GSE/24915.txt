TITLE
Identifying genes of Escherichia coli involved in interactions with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in planktonic cultures and biofilms using transcriptomic analysis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Biofilm formation by Escherichia coli was significantly inhibited when co-cultured with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in static systems. Genes of E. coli involved in species interactions with S. maltophilia were identified in order to allow the study of the mechanisms of inhibited E. coli biofilm formation in co-culture. A total of 89 and 108 genes were identified as differentially expressed in mixed species cultures when growing as biofilm and as planktonic cultures, respectively, compared to the counterpart of pure cultured E. coli. Differential expression of certain identified genes was confirmed using E. coli reporter strains combined with single-cell based flow cytometry analysis. Co-culture with S. maltophilia affected genes involved in metabolism, signal transduction, cell wall composition, and biofilm formation of E. coli. Several selected genes were further confirmed as affecting E. coli biofilm formation in mixed species cultures with S. maltophilia. The data suggest that these genes were involved in species interactions between E. coli and S. maltophilia. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
