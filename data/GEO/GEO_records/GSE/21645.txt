TITLE
New insights on resistance mechanisms to antimicrobial compounds in a plant pathogen biofilm

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c biofilm, submitted to treatments with sub inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of copper and tetracycline.

DESIGN
A study of Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c was done using total RNA recovered from biofilm bacterial cells submitted to 3 or 7mM of CuSO4 or 100 or 800 Âµg/ml of tetracycline.  Each chip measures the expression level of 2832 genes from Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c with thirteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with five-fold technical redundancy.
