TITLE
EGF-Mediated Transcriptional Coregulation of EpICD-LEF1 Alters Nanomechanical Properties of Endometrial Cancer Cells for Promoting Cell Migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a membrane protein known to modulate cell-cell adhesion, is also a signaling molecule internalized into the nucleus for transcriptional regulation. Here we demonstrate that activated EGF/EGFR is a signaling factor to drive the proteolysis of EpCAM. Cleavage of the extracellular fragment EpEX results in topographic fading of cell-surface EpCAM detected by antibody-conjugated cantilevers of atomic force microscope (AFM). As a result, internalization of the cytoplasmic domain EpICD forms a transcription factor complex with LEF1 that regulates gene transcription for enhanced cell-mobility functions. Comprehensive probing of cell surface using AFM tip (without antibody) reveals increased elasticity and non-stickiness of these cells, promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition. While EpCAM cleavage may contribute to the loss of cell-surface adhesiveness, its internalized EpICD additionally regulates targets for promoting cell migration. Thus, this EGF/EGFR-modulated action on structural EpCAM and regulatory EpICD can enhance invasion potential of transformed cells.
