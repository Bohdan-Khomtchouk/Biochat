TITLE
Gene expression analysis of delg_mut versus Df_plus control

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Nuclear transcription factors drive mitochondrial mass by regulating the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Among these factors, nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2/GABP) has been proposed to be critical for mitochondrial mass in mammalian cells, yet there is little genetic evidence to support this function in vivo. Here, we show that mutants of the Drosophila melanogaster NRF-2alpha/GABPalpha homologue Delg (CG6338) have reduced expression of multiple genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, leading to reduced mitochondrial mass.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed in total: three biological replicates of the control (Df_plus) and three biological replicates of the mutant (Df_delg).
