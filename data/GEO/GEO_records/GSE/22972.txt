TITLE
Neurospora crassa early sexual development with oligod(T) priming

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Multi-targeting priming (MTP) for genome-wide gene expression assays provides selective targeting of multiple sequences and counter-selection against undesirable sequences. We demonstrated superior performance of two MTPs compared to oligo-dT microarray profling and RNA tag sequencing the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to nitrogen deficiency and profiling Neurospora crassa early sexual development. Priming with MTPs in addition to oligo-dT resulted in higher sensitivity, a greater number of well-measured genes, more genes significantly differentially expressed, and a greater power to detect meager differences.

DESIGN
Neurospora crassa mat A FGSC#2489 2 developmental stages and oligo(dT) primers.
