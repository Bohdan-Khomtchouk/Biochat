TITLE
Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF) secreted from iPSC derived-RPE facilitates apoptotic causes cell death, not the differentiation, of iPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) secreted-factor, pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) secreted/derived from primary or iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)RPE, dramatically inhibitsed the cell growth of iPSCs. PEDF was detected abundantly in culture supernatant media of primary and iPSC-derived RPE.  We examined the gene expression in primary RPE and iPS-derived RPE.

DESIGN
Two samples: RPE derived from 253G1 iPSC, Primary RPE.
