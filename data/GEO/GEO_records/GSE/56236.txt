TITLE
Glomerular transcriptomic analysis of the influence of Genetic background effect during anti-GBM glomerulonephritis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the impact of the genetic background during experimental passive non-accelerated anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM-GN) (an equivalent to nephrotoxic nephritis) in two different mouse genetic backgrounds (C57BL6/J vs 129S2svPAS/crl). Glomerular extracts have been made at an early time point (e.g day 4 of the induction of the glomerulonephritis). RNA have been extracted following standard procedures.

DESIGN
3 mice per group have been compared. 3 Control mice from each background. And 3 anti-GBM-GN challenged mice from each Genetic background, corresponding to 12 samples in total.
