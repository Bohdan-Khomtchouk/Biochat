TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for ANP in HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HUVEC treated with ANP. ANP is a cardiac hormone, binding to the guanylate cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor with a major role in cardiovascular homeostatic mechanisms. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of ANP in vascular endothelial cell.

DESIGN
ANP induced gene expression in HUVEC was measured at 0, 1 and 6 hours.  Four independent experiments were performed at each time (0, 1 or 6 hours) for each experiment.
