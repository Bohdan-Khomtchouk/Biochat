TITLE
Genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of benign and malignant prostate cell lines without and with androgen (R1881) stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq data were obtained from hTERT immortalized human prostate transit amplifying EP156T cells (+/- 10 nM R1881 for 48 hrs), progeny tumorigenic EPT3-M1 cells recovered from mouse metastatic tumor  (+/- 10 nM R1881 for 48 hrs) and the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP  (+/- 10 nM R1881 for 48 hrs), VCaP (+/- 1 nM R1881 for 24 hrs) and 22Rv1 (+/- 1 nM R1881 for 24 hrs) (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection). All cells were either stimulated or not stimulated with the synthetic androgen R1881 (1 or 10 nM for 24 or 48 hrs) prior to lysis (Qiagen miRNeasy minikit lysis buffer) and total RNA purification and DNase treatment.

DESIGN
Quantification of RNA expression in benign and malignant prostate cells in vitro without and with androgen stimulation
