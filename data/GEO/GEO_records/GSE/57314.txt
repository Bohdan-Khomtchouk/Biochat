TITLE
Nfatc1 enhances stem cell contribution to squamous skin tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We find that epithelial-specific deletion of Nfatc1 decreases skin tumor susceptibility in mice subjected to DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis. To probe the molecular mechanisms by which Nfatc1 may regulate tumorigenesis, we identify gene expression changes associated with constitutive NFATc1 activation in primary mouse keratinocytes. Constitutively active NFATc1 activity in primary mouse keratinocytes to investigate how Nfatc1 regulates tumor initiation in the skin.

DESIGN
Primary mouse keratinocytes were infected with retroviruses encoding a recombinant human NFATc1 containing mutations in the autoinhibitory domain that render it constitutively active (CAC1). Keratinocytes infected with retroviruses generated from an empty MSCV reotroviral vector were used as a control. Three biological replicates were performed.
