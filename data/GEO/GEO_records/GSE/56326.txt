TITLE
RNAseq analysis of NGATHA loss and gain of function alleles

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The four NGATHA genes (NGA) form a small subfamily within the large family of B3-domain  transcription factors  of  Arabidopsis thaliana.  NGA  genes  act redundantly to direct  the development of  the apical tissues of the  gynoecium, the style and the stigma.  Previous studies indicate that  NGA  genes  could exert this function at least partially by directing the synthesis of auxin at the distal end of the developing gynoecium  through the upregulation  of  two  different  YUCCA  genes, which encode flavin monooxygenases involved in auxin biosynthesis. We  have compared three developing pistil transcriptome data sets from wildtype, nga  quadruple mutants and a 35S::NGA3 line. The differentially expressed genes showed a significant enrichment for auxin-related genes, supporting the idea of NGA  genes  as major  regulators of auxin accumulation and distribution within  the developing gynoecium.
