TITLE
Transcriptome of normal, paracancerouse and cancerous bladder tissues based on RNA-Seq method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to support our research of bladder cancer in human genome, we conducted massively parallel pyrosequencing of mRNAs (RNA-Seq) using normal, paracancerouse and cancerous human bladder tissues. We obtained a total of 30.0 million read pairs from normal, 33.1 million read pairs from paracancerous and 36.5 million read pairs from cancerous. The RNA-Seq data derived from the sample illustrated the differencially expression genes among normal, paracancerous and cancerous bladder tissues of human.

DESIGN
3 samples examined: normal tissue, paracancerous tissue, cancerous tissue.
