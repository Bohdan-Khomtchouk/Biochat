TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of H4Ac in Legionella pneumophila-infected human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we infected human blood-derived macrophages with L. pneumophila and used immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to screen gene promoters for the activating histone 4 acetylation mark. We found about 500 genes with induced acetylation upon infection, including several pro-inflamatory and inflamatory factors and non-coding RNAs. In particular, we assess the functional consequences of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2), a factor not yet characterized in the pathology of L.pneumophila, on bacterial replication.

DESIGN
Examination of one histone modification H4Ac in blood-derived macrophages with and without Legionella infection. Total input DNA was used as control in both conditions.

PLATFORM
