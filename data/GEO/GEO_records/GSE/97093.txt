TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of kidneys from ADTKD-UMOD mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD)-uromodulin (UMOD) pathophysiology, we carried out transcriptional profiling of kidneys from 1- and 2-month-old TgUmodC147W mice, a transgenic model that recapitulates the main features of the disease, and TgUmodwt mice, a matched transgenic control of Umod overexpression. These time points correspond to presymptomatic stages that precede renal dysfunction in TgUmodC147W mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from kidneys of mice at different ages carrying either wild type or mutant Umod transgene.
