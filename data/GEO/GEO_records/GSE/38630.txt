TITLE
The GacA transcriptome of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 growing on pea seed surfaces

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas protegens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of a gacA mutant of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 in comparison to the wild-type Pf-5 strain grown on pea seed surfaces for 24h.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, the gacA mutant compared to wild-type Pf-5 grown on pea seed surfaces for 24 h.  There are three biological replicates and two flip-dye replicates for a total of six slides analyzed.  Each slide contains four replicate spots per gene.

PLATFORM
