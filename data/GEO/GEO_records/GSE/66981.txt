TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in mouse pancreas tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetically engineered mice developed spontaneous pancreas cancer (Pdx-Cre;LSL-KRASG12D;P53Mut). Mice were also engineered to develop similar spontaneous pancreas cancer without Twist or Snail (conditional gene knockout). The pancreas tumors were harvested and analysed for gene expression profiles comparisons.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the pancreas tumors of 2 mice with wild-type Twist and Snail, from 2 mice without Twist expression in the pancreas, and from 2 mice without Snail expression in the pancreas.
