TITLE
Genetic networks regulated by short chain fatty acids in vivo (rat adrenal medulla) and in vitro (in rat PC12 cells)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling showed significant overlap of the genetic networks regulated by butyrate in vivo (rat adrenal medulla) and in vitro (PC12 cells) including TH and other neurotransmitter-related genes (DBH, AADC, GTPCH, ppEnk, NPY).

DESIGN
Studies in PC12 cells were performed to delineate which genetic networks are regulated by SCFA depending on the dose. Experiments in vivo were performed to test wheter similar phenomenon operates in the sympathoadrenal system. ISBPC: 1mMSB PC12 GSBPC: 6mMSB PC12 CPCR: CPC12 SBAM: rat SBAdrenal Medulla CAM: rat Control Adrenal Medulla
