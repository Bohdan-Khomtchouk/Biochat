TITLE
HNSCC cell lines for CoGAPS matrix factorization algorithm identifies AP-2alpha as a feedback mechanism from therapeutic inhibition of the EGFR network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the expression AP2-alpha target genes,  global gene expression of 7 HNSCC cell lines with and without cetuximab treatment (100 nM, 24 hrs) and the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line was performed.

DESIGN
42 total RNA collected from a panel of 7 HNSCC cell lines (control and cetuximab treated) and the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line.  Cell surival rates after 7 days with cetuximab treatment are assessed using matrigel colony formation assays.
