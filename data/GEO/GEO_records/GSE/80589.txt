TITLE
Total RNA-seq of HeLa cells upon conventional or improved RNA extraction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We devised a novel improved RNA extraction method, and performed total RNA-seq to determine the effect of improved RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Examination of total RNAs that were derived from the same cell/TRI Reagent solution, split into two and extracted by either a conventional or improved RNA extraction method. Hokkaido System Science, Co.
