TITLE
Identification of Novel Changes in Human Skeletal Muscle Proteome following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of metabolic improvements following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery are not entirely clear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the role of obesity and RYGB on the human skeletal muscle proteome.

DESIGN
Basal muscle biopsies were obtained from seven obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) female subjects (45.1Â±3.6 years) pre- and 3 months post-RYGB, and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity.
