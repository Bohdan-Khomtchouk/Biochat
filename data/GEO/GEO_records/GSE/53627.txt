TITLE
Disruption of H3K27me3 through loss of EZH1 and EZH2 accelerates progression of hepatosteatosis to fatal liver fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although epigenetic mechanisms, such as specific histone modifications, control common and cell-specific genetic programs, a role for histone modifying enzymes in liver metabolism and disease has not been investigated. This report demonstrates that the combined loss of the histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 in mouse hepatocytes led to the disruption of H3K27me3 homeostasis by age three months, simple fatty liver by age six months and fatal fibrosis by age 15 months. Global and gene-specific reduction of H3K27me3 marks paralleled a concomitant increase of H3K4me3 marks at genes associated with chronic liver disease. Advanced disease was accompanied by widespread infiltration of immune cells, an increase of activated hepatic stellate cells and collagen deposition. Expression of genes from the cytochrome P450 family that control drug metabolism was already deregulated by age two months and mice were fatally hypersensitive to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). These genetic experiments, for the first time, illustrate that the simple loss of EZH1/EZH2, which results in the disruption of epigenetic modifications, is sufficient for the progression of fatal liver disease.

DESIGN
