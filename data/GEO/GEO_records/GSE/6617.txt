TITLE
Changes in gene expression due to CgtA-depletion in Vibrio cholerae.

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
A cgtA-depletion strain in V. cholerae was constructed and used to identify changes in gene expression that occur due to loss of the gene product.  This information was then used to characterize the role of the gene, which was found to be involved in stress response. Keywords: Depletion strain, stress response

DESIGN
V. cholerae cells from a cgtA-depletion strain were used.  This strain requires arabinose for growth.  Cells were grown to mid-log, washed, and split into two cultures, one with arabinose, one without.  These cells were grown for one doubling time, then RNA was harvested using a Trizol method. Both depleted and non-depleted cell RNA was converted to cDNA, with one set incorporating Cy5, the other Cy3, with fluorophores reversed in the multiple analyses.  RNA from both conditions was applied to a whole genome PCR microarray from V. cholerae N16961, containing two sets of every ORF.  Data was analyzed by Genepix and Rosetta Resolver.
