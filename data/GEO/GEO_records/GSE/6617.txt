TITLE
Changes in gene expression due to CgtA-depletion in Vibrio cholerae.

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
A cgtA-depletion strain in V. cholerae was constructed and used to identify changes in gene expression that occur due to loss of the gene product.  This information was then used to characterize the role of the gene, which was found to be involved in stress response. Keywords: Depletion strain, stress response
