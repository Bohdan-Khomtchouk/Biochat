TITLE
Interplay of host microbiota, genetic perturbations, and inflammation promotes local development of intestinal neoplasms in mice [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The preferential localization of some neoplasms, such as serrated polyps, in specific areas of the intestine suggests that non-genetic factors may be important for their development. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of transgenic mice that expressed HB-EGF throughout the intestine, but develop serrated polyps only in the cecum. Here we show that a host-specific microbiome was associated with serrated polyps, and that alterations of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment or by embryo-transfer rederivation markedly inhibited the formation of serrated polyps in the cecum. Mechanistically, development of serrated polyps was associated with a local decrease in epithelial barrier-function, bacterial invasion, production of antimicrobials, and increased expression of several inflammatory factors such as IL-17, Cxcl2, Tnf-Î±, and IL-1. Increased number of neutrophils were found within the serrated polyps, and their depletion significantly reduced polyp growth. Together these results indicate that non-genetic factors contribute to the development of serrated polyps and suggest that the development of these intestinal neoplasms in the cecum is driven by the interplay between genetic changes in the host, an inflammatory response, and a host-specific microbiota.

DESIGN
We obtained serrated polyp (SP) and surrounding normal (NM) tissue from the ceca of three affected mice (paired design) and assessed expression differences by RNA-Seq.
