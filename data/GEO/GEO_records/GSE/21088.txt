TITLE
Intrasite and Intersite expression analysis of Mytilus californianus

ORGANISM
Mytilus californianus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the effects of natural environmental variation across the vertical distribution of Mytilus californianus within a single mussel bed Keywords: Environmental Response

DESIGN
30 Biological replicates from plots sampled at 3 different verticle tide heights above the MLLW at Strawberry Hill Oregon. 15 mussels were sampled after a mid-day emmersion event and 15 mussels were sampled after a 1 hour recovery at ambient seawater temperatures. 1 replicate per array, compared using a common reference sample. 50 Biological replicates for 5 plots sampled at 2 different verticle tide heights above the MLLW at Boiler Bay Oregon. 25 mussels were sampled after a mid-day emmersion event and 25 mussels were sampled after a 1 hour recovery at ambient seawater temperatures. Pooled RNA from 5 biological replicates from each plot per array, compared using a common reference sample.
