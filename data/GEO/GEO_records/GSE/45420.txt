TITLE
DNAseq data from human ovarian carcinoma cell lines subjected to shRNA TRC1.0 library

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hallmark of human cancer is heterogeneity, mirroring the complexity of genetic and epigenetic alterations acquired during oncogenesis.  We extracted DNA of 14 cultured human ovarian carcinoma cell lines subjected to pooled shRNA screen using TRC 1.0 library, and performed DNAseq.

DESIGN
14 ovarian carcinoma cell lines DNAseq data.
