TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 A549 overexpressing cells and in tumor xenografts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TIMP-2 is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, i.e. inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. As a result, TIMP-2 inhibits tumor growth and progression to metastasis. Understanding, therefore, the mechanisms of TIMP-2-mediated tumor growth inhibition would provide further support on the use of TIMP-2 as a novel biological agent for cancer therapy. We used microarray analysis to determine the TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 transcriptional profiles of A549 cancer cells in order to understand how TIMP-2 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis.

DESIGN
We overexpressed TIMP-2 and its mutant (does not inhibit MMP) in A549 human lung cancer cells and determined TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 transcriptional profiles, groups of genes and associated biological functions. We then injected the cells in NOD-SCID mice and RNA from tumors were isolated for further analysis to identify genes that are associated with tumor growth inhibition.
