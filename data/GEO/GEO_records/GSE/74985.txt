TITLE
Hipposeq: an RNA-seq based atlas of gene expression in excitatory hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a quantitative, whole genome atlas of gene expression for every excitatory neuronal class in the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical neurons of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell class- and region-specific transcriptional atlas for these canonical populations.

DESIGN
Hippocampal RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500, with three biological replicates per population
