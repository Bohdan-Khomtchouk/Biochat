TITLE
Transcriptomic alterations induced by AT-EAE in mouse spinal cord

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared RNA samples extracted from spinal cords of control (C) and AT-EAE (E) mice using the " Multiple Yellow " strategy. 4 distinct C-extracts were hybridized with two slides and 4 distinct E-extracts with other two slides, and the green/red normalized signals were compared separately and the E/C ratios averaged. Keywords = white matter Keywords = inflammation Keywords = cDNA microarray Keywords = experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
