TITLE
Functional blockade of α5β1 integrin induces scattering and genomic landscape remodeling of hepatic progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells treated with a specific antibody against α5β1 integrin exhibited cell spreading and scattering, over-expression of liver stem/progenitor cell markers and activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs signaling cascades, in a similar manner to the process triggered by HGF/SF1 stimulation. Gene expression profiling revealed marked transcriptional changes of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration, as well as genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors. These responses were accompanied by conspicuous spatial reorganization of centromeres, while integrin genes conserved their spatial positioning in the interphase nucleus.

DESIGN
Untreated cells versus HGF/SF1 treated or α5β1 integrin-mediated cell migration
