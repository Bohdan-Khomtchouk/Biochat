TITLE
Gene expression in HT-29-MTX intestinal epithelial cells treated with Ancylostoma ceylanicum hookworm larvae

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT-29-MTX cells were treated with Ancylostoma ceylanicum hookworm larvae or left untreated.  The differences in gene expression between treated and untreated samples was observed.

DESIGN
HT-29-MTX cells were grown for 7 days post-confluency (total 21 days) and were either treated with iL3 A. ceylanicum larvae for 24 hours or left untreated.  RNA from treated and untreated samples was collected and differences in gene expression were observed using RNA-Seq.
