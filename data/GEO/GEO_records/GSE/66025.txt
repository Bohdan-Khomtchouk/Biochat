TITLE
Genome-wide anaylsis of histone acetylation during mouse ESC differentiation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using acetylated histone H3 ChIP-seq, we reveal that the histone H3 acetylation level is gradually increased on the neural gene loci while decreased on the neural-inhibitory gene loci during mouse ESC neural differentiation. By overlapping with the targets of HDAC1 ChIP-seq, we identify Nodal as a target gene repressed by histone deacetylation. Thus, our study reveals an intrinsic mechanism that epigenetic histone deacetylation ensures neural fate commitment by restricting Nodal signaling.

DESIGN
Examination of HDAC1 in differentiated day 2 cells and acetylated histone H3 in day 2, day 4 and day 6 cells.
