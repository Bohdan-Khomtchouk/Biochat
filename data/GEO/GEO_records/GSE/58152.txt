TITLE
Transcriptome of CD4+ T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome of ex vivo-isolated murine naive CD4+ T cells, Th1 cells and Th17 cells by microarray.

DESIGN
CD4+ T effector cells were prepared ex vivo, stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin, subjected to a comercially available cytokine secretion kit (IL-17A and IFNg), stained by adding fluorescence-labeled antibodies against CD3, CD4 and CD45RB and sorted by flow cytometry. We sorted naive CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RB_high), Th1 cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RB_low_IFNg+IL17A-) and Th17 cells (CD3+CD4+CD45RB_low_IFNg-IL17A+).
