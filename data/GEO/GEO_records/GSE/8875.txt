TITLE
potyvirus-Transcriptional analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana infected by a potyvirus.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra03-02_potyvirus - potyvirus - Identification of genes involved in plant/virus interactions. - In this experiment, Arabidopsis plants infected by a virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a potyvirus, were compared with healthy plants to identify genes for which the expression is modified by the viral infection. Analysis of both inoculated leaves and upper young leaves were performed 7 days after the inoculation with the virus (or with only buffer for the healthy plants). Keywords: normal vs disease comparison

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
