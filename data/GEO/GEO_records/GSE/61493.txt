TITLE
Analysis of gastric microbiota by pyrosequencing in Korea

ORGANISM
human gut metagenome

SUMMARY
Sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, which has improved the characterization of microbial community, has made it possible to detect a low level Helicobacter pylori (HP) sequences even in HP-negative subjects which were determined by a combination of conventional methods. This study was conducted to obtain a cutoff value for HP colonization in gastric mucosa biopsies and gastric juices by the pyrosequencing method.

DESIGN
Microbial DNA from gastric mucosal samples [gastric antrum (n=63, mucosal biopsy), follow-up sample on gastric antrum (n=16, mucosal biopsy), and gastric body (n=18, mucosal biopsy)] and gastric juices (n=4, not mucosal biopsy) was amplified by nested PCR using universal bacterial primers, and the 16S rRNA genes were pyrosequenced.
