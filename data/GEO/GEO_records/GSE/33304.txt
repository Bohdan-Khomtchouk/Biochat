TITLE
Epigenetic regulation of miRNA in CLL [ChIP_hsa_miRNA_v2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation is used for identification of microRNA transcriptional start sites. Various cell types allow a broad range detection of putative promoters rather independent of tissue specific expression patterns. These data are used for identification of   aberrant epigenetic regulation at the respective regions.

DESIGN
5 samples total: 1 primary CLL sample, 1 CLL related cell line -/+ 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment (Granta-519), myeloid cell line Kasumi-1 (-/+ 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment); H3K4me3 enriched vs. Input
