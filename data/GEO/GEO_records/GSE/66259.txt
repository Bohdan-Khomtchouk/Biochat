TITLE
Gene expression in mouse DRG neurons at 2 or 5 days post-sciatic lesion in WT and Nfil3-KO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with a deletion of transcription factor Nfil3 show delayed functional regeneration after sciatic lesion compared to WT mice. To analyze differential gene expression, sciatic nerves were lesioned and nerve endings were coaptated. After two or 5 days, DRGs L4 and L5 were dissected out and gene expression was measured by microarray. Control tissue was taken from the non-injured side. We found that expression of classic regeneration associated genes was similar in WT and Nfil3 KO mice. We did identify a group of differentially expressed genes known for its role in olfactory signal transduction, but were not known as regeneration associated genes until now, which may explain the negative effects on functional recovery.

DESIGN
Gene expression in DRGs L4 and L5 from WT and NFIL3 KO mice was analyzed at 2 and 5 days after receiving a sciatic nerve lesion. Control tissue was taken from the non-injured side. Four biological replicates were used per condition. Microarray chips were two color chips, but each channel was analyzed in single color fashion. Conditions were pseudo-randomized over chips in a balanced dye-swap setup.
