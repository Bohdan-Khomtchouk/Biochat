TITLE
Placental gene expression in intestinal nematode-infected and protein-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protein deficiency and intestinal parasite infection during pregnancy impair fetal growth through passage of signals from the maternal environment which signal impairment of fetal growth. The placenta is an important regulator of the transfer of these signals through differential expression of key placental genes. We used microarrays to examine placental gene expression responses to maternal protein deficiency (6% vs. 24% protein) and Heligmosomoides bakeri infection.

DESIGN
2x2 factorial.
