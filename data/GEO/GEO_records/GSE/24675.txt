TITLE
mer1D_SK1 meiotic time course on expression/splicing microarrays

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Synchronized mer1D_SK1 meiotic time course. mer1D diploid was generated in the SK1 strain background (ATCC: MYA-2089) by PCR-mediated cassette-based gene replacement where the MER1 ORF was replaced with HIS3 from S. kluyveri then the transformants were sporulated and the homozygous deletion was verified by PCR.

DESIGN
Two independent time courses; Dye swap of each time point; Reference pool WT RNA comprised of 50% time zero RNA plus 10% each of time 2 hours, 5, hours, 7 hours, 9 hours and 11 hours

PLATFORM
GPL11043 Yeast Splicing/Expression Chip v6.2-6.3
