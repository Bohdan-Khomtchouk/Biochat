TITLE
Gene expression changes in multiple sclerosis relapse suggest activation of T and non-T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
paired comparison of RNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the same group of 14 multiple sclerosis patients while stable and while in relapse. A defining feature of multiple sclerosis is the occurrence of clinical relapses separated by periods of clinical stability.  Better understanding of the events underlying clinical relapse might suggest new approaches to treatment.  We used microarrays to measure mRNA expression in the peripheral blood of 14 MS patients during clinical relapse and while stable.  Seventy-one transcripts changed expression at the p < 0.001 significance level.  The most notable finding was decreased expression of transcripts with regulatory function, expressed primarily in non-T cells.  Transcripts with increased expression were primarily expressed in T cells.  Pathways analysis suggested involvement of the cytokine network, coagulation and complement cascades, IL-10 signaling, and NF-?B signaling.
