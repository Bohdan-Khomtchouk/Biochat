TITLE
Microarray Based Comparison of two Amplification Methods For Nanogram Amounts of Total RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two T7 based methods One round of Amplification (Affymetrix) and Two round of Amplification were compared to two Ribo-SPIA based systems, RiboSPIA and pico Ribo SPIA systems. Data for One Round of amplification , Two round of amplification and RiboSPIA are listed here. All Hybridisation were performed using Affymetrix Mouse 430-2 gene chips.  Data were all scaled to 500 and scaling factor average was 3.6 +/- 0.9, background intensities 46 +/- 5 , noise 2.9 +/- 0.6, rawQ 1.5 +/- 0.2 Keywords: other
