TITLE
Cell type influences metastasis tropism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that the cell of origin plays an important role in this metastatic tropism. Following injection into the arterial circulation of mice, each of the identically transformed cell types gave rise to different metastatic patterns. Using gene expression analysis, we identified the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as being instrumental in determining the distinct metastatic patterns between skeletal muscle precursor cells and skeletal myoblasts.

DESIGN
3 independent cell lines of primary human skeletal myoblasts, primary skeletal muscle cell precursors, and each of these cell lines transformed with hTERT, the early region of SV40 encoding T-Ag and t-Ag, and RasG12V analysis of primary human skeletal myoblasts, primary skeletal muscle cell precursors, and each of these cell lines transformed with hTERT, the early region of SV40 encoding T-Ag and t-Ag, and RasG12V
