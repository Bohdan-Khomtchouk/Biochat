TITLE
C. elegans gene expression in response to acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (Part 1) and recovery (Part 2) by Neomycin/Streptomycin treatment

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
(Part 1) Gene expression profiles of C. elegans in response to P. aeruginosa. Synchronized larval stage 1 (L1) worms were raised on E. coli OP50 for 72 hours. These synchronized young adult (YA) animals were subsequently exposed to P. aeruginosa PA14 for 4 hours. 25dC. (Part 2) Gene expression profiles of C. elegans in response to Neomycin/Streptomycin-mediated recovery after a 4 hour exposure to P. aeruginosa. Synchronized larval stage 1 (L1) worms were raised on E. coli OP50 for 72 hours. These synchronized young adult (YA) animals were subsequently exposed to P. aeruginosa PA14 for 4 hours and then treated with Neomycin and shifted to E. coli OP50 plus Streptomycin plates for 6, 12, or 24 hours to resolve the infection. As a control for Neomycin/Streptomycin exposure, synchronized larval stage 1 (L1) worms were raised on E. coli OP50 for 72 hours and either shifted to fresh E. coli OP50 plates for 6 hours or treated with Neomycin and shifted to E. coli OP50 plus Streptomycin plates for 6 hours. 25dC.

DESIGN
Samples include 72 hours on OP50 (72hOP), 72 hours on OP50 plus 4 hours on PA14 (76hPA), 72 hours on OP50 plus 4 hours on PA14 plus 6 hours of Neomycin/Streptomycin-mediated recovery (82hR), 72 hours on OP50 plus 4 hours on PA14 plus 12 hours of Neomycin/Streptomycin-mediated recovery (88hR), 72 hours on OP50 plus 4 hours on PA14 plus 24 hours of Neomycin/Streptomycin-mediated recovery (100hR), 82 hours on OP50 (82hOP), and 72 hours on OP50 plus 6 hours of Neomycin/Streptomycin (82hOPC). Triplicate biological samples were included for each timepoint except for 82hOP (which utilized duplicates). 20 total samples. Agilent C. elegans expression microarrays (GPL11346).
