TITLE
Effects of long-term treatment with tamoxifen on endometrial gene expression in women.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to examine changes in gene expression of the endometrium exposed to long-term tamoxifen treatment in comparison to age matched controls. To achieve this, endometrial tissues were obtained from women receiving tamoxifen treatment who were undergoing a hysterectomy. Using cDNA microarrays, gene expression changes in the postmenopausal endometrium of these women was compared with that in endometrium of age matched women not receiving tamoxifen. Keywords: Gene expression changes in the postmenopausal endometrium of women following tamoxifen treatment
