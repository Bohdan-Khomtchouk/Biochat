TITLE
RNA-sequencing of TGF-ß1-driven gene expression in human kidney cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta1 is the major cytokine driver of fibrotic scarring observed in diabetic nephropathy and other fibrosis-related diseases. RNA-sequencing offers the potential for more sensitive assessment of the TGF-ß1-driven transcriptome.

DESIGN
There were two treatment groups: vehicle, 48 hr TGFb1. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate. Upon quality control assessment, one TGFß1 treated sample was excluded from further analyses, leaving 3 unstimulated and 2 TGFß1 samples.
