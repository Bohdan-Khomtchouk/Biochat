TITLE
Testicular gene expression in SCARKO mice during prepuberty

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To unravel the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of androgens on spermatogenesis, testicular gene expression was compared in mice with a Sertoli cell-selective androgen receptor knockout (SCARKO) and littermate controls on postnatal d 10. At this age testicular cell composition is still comparable in SCARKOs and controls. Microarray analysis identified 692 genes with significant differences in expression. A more than 2-fold up- or downregulation by androgen action in Sertoli cells was observed for 28 and 6 genes respectively. The biological relevance of the “strongly” upregulated genes was supported by the finding that several of them were previously described to be androgen-regulated or essential for spermatogenesis. Serine protease inhibitors were overrepresented in the same subgroup suggesting a role for androgens in cell junction dynamics and tissue restructuring events during spermatogenesis. A time course experiment (d8-d20), followed by cluster analysis allowed the identification of typical expression patterns of differentially expressed testicular genes during initiation of spermatogenesis. Three genes with a pattern closely resembling that of Pem, a prototypal androgen-regulated gene in Sertoli cells, were selected for confirmation by RT-PCR and further analysis. The data confirm that the SCARKO model allows identification of novel androgen-regulated genes in the testis. This series represents the time course data from d 8, d 10, d 12, d 16 and d 20. The expression data from the additional SCARKO vs control comparison on d 10 is represented by series GSE2260 ( " Testicular gene expression in SCARKO mice at day 10 " ). Keywords: time-course
