TITLE
High-throughput sequencing analysis identify miRNAs in 7dpf F1-zebrafish under β-diketone antibiotics exposure to F0-zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Small RNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to characterize the miRNAs in F1-zebrafish after 90-day β-diketone antibiotic (DKA) exposure to F0-zebrafish at 6.25 and 12.5 mg/L. The small RNA libraries from 7-dpf F1-zebrafish were constructed. In total, 10,117,347, 9,818,830 and 12,049,949 raw reads were acquired, respectively, under the different DKA-exposure treatments (0, 6.25 mg/L and 12.5mg/L) from the three miRNAs libraries by Illumina sequencing. Low-quality reads were removed, which included 5' contaminants, those missing the 3' primer or insert tag, sequences with a poly A tail, and those shorter than 17 nt and longer than 25 nt. As a result, 8,141,146 (representing 312,735 unique sequences; control), 8,687,210 (representing 251,508 unique sequences; 6.25 mg/L), and 10,569,566 (representing 441,938 unique sequences; 12.5 mg/L) valid reads in the 17 to 25 nt size range were isolated for further analysis. The sRNAs from the three libraries were similar, and the unique sRNA reads were mainly distributed in the 20-24 nt range, among which 22 and 23 nt accounted for 41.8% and 20.0% of total unique sRNA reads, respectively. The 22-nt sRNAs were the most abundant, with the length distribution of counts of sequ-seqs and unique miRNAs displaying a normal distribution.
