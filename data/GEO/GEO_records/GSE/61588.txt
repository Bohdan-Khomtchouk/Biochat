TITLE
MicroRNA expression in normal and tumoral esophageal squamous cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify microRNAs aberrantly expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells.

DESIGN
Three esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-derived cell lines and one normal human esophageal squamous cell line were analyzed.

PLATFORM
