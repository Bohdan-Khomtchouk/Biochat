TITLE
Discovery of progenitor signatures by time series synexpression analysis during Drosophila cell immortalization [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To characterize the sequence of events associated with RasV12 immortalization of Drosophila embryonic cells, we generated transcriptional time series during cell line establishment, from primary cultures until passage (P) 19.

DESIGN
We generated three transcriptional time series from three cell lines (R1, R4 and R5) by sampling the cultures at successive stages, early (P2-4), intermediate (P4-11), and late (P16-19), characterized by different passage times. Time points for the R1 time-series were: P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P10, P11, P16, P17 and P19; for the R4 time-series: P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P9, P11, P12, P16, P17 and P19; and for the R5 time-series: P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P16, P17 and P19
