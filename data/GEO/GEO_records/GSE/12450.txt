TITLE
p53-repressed miRNAs are Involved with E2F in a Feed Forward Loop Promoting Proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles of WI38 primary human fibroblasts with an active or inactive p53. Cells were compared under normal untreated conditions (young and proliferating cells), after DNA damage with Doxorubicin, and upon entry into replicative senescence. Keywords: miRNA, WI-38, p53, GSE56, Senescence, Doxorubicin, Cancer, DNA-damage, fibroblasts.
