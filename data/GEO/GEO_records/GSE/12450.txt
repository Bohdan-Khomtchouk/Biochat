TITLE
p53-repressed miRNAs are Involved with E2F in a Feed Forward Loop Promoting Proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles of WI38 primary human fibroblasts with an active or inactive p53. Cells were compared under normal untreated conditions (young and proliferating cells), after DNA damage with Doxorubicin, and upon entry into replicative senescence. Keywords: miRNA, WI-38, p53, GSE56, Senescence, Doxorubicin, Cancer, DNA-damage, fibroblasts.

DESIGN
6 samples of WI38 cells were analyzed on 12 Exiqon miRcurry LNA arrays in biological duplicates (2 different cell culture plates for each experimental condition). The six conditions included: 1. [Con_Young] - Primary Young WI38 cells (passage 20) with a control retroviral vector (pLXSN-NEO). Untreated. 2. [GSE_Young] -Primary Young WI38 cells (passage 20) with a retroviral vector encoding for the p53-inactivating peptide GSE56 (pLXSN-NEO-GSE56).Untreated. 3. [Con_Dox] -Primary Young WI38 cells (passage 20) with a control retroviral vector (pLXSN-NEO). Treated with Doxorubicin (0.2 micrograms/ml) for 24 hours). 4. [GSE_Dox] Primary Young WI38 cells (passage 20) with a retroviral vector encoding for the p53-inactivating peptide GSE56 (pLXSN-NEO-GSE56). Treated with Doxorubicin (0.2 micrograms/ml) for 24 hours). 5. [Con_Old] - Sesescent WI38 cells (passage 30) with a control retroviral vector (pLXSN-NEO). Untreated. 6. [GSE_Old] - Senescent WI38 cells (passage 26) with a retroviral vector encoding for the p53-inactivating peptide GSE56 (pLXSN-NEO-GSE56).Untreated. RNA was extracted with TRI-Reagent and sent for labeling and hybridization in Exiqon laboratories (In Denamark). Samples were labeled with Cy5. Reference sample (Cy3) was an RNA mix of all samples. Log2 for Ratio(Cy5/Cy3) was used for further analysis.
