TITLE
Genes and mechanisms regulated by androgens as possible contributors to the male excess observed in autism [LNCaP]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We optimized ChIP-sequencing protocole and anti-androgen receptor (AR) antibodies on human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) after either DMSO (solvent) or DHT 100nM 4 hours treatment.

DESIGN
Examination of AR IP sequences with 2 anti-AR antibodies (commercial N-20 from SantaCruz or homemade 3279.4) after DMSO or DHT 100nM treatment by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500
