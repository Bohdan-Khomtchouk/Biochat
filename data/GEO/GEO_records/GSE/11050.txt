TITLE
cross-hybridization of woodchuck HCCs using human, rat and mouse arrays

ORGANISM
Marmota monax

SUMMARY
Woodchucks that were infected with WHC virus developed HCCs. HCCs and surrounding tissues were removed and RNA was extracted from microarray study. Human, rat and mouse arrays were used due to the lack of a woodchuck array. Same procedures and parameters were used to conduct this experiment. Keywords: comparative study

DESIGN
3 woodchucks with HCCs were used. HCCs and their surrouding normal tissues were harvested. These 3 pairs of tissues were cross-species hybridized into a human, rat and mouse chip under same conditions. Data analysis were performed to compare the results.
