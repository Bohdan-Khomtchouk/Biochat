TITLE
Mouse bone marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) exposed to activated T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the changes induced in MSC transcriptome by activated T cells, MSC were co-cultured in transwell with anti CD3/CD28 activated T cells for 48 hrs before RNA extraction IFNγ-induced plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells is regulated by STATs through inhibition of mTOR and TGFβ pathways.

DESIGN
The expression of MSC co-cultured with activated T cells ( two replicates) were compared to that of naive MSC (3 replicates)
