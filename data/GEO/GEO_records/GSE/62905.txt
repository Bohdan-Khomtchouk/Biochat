TITLE
Quantitative analysis of CD133+ liver cancer stem cells vs CD133- non cancer stem cell by RNA-Seq profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goal of this study is to compare the differentially expressed transcriptomes between CD133+ liver cancer stem cells versus CD133- non cancer stem cells by RNA-Seq profiling

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of sorted CD133+ and CD133- subsets isolated from HCC cell lines Huh7 and PLC8024 were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx
