TITLE
Methylation analysis of cancer and control samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiling of cancer and control samples. The Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 1,505 CpG sites CpGs distributed across 807 genes in blood DNA specimens.

DESIGN
DNA samples were extracted from blood specimens, bisulfite treated  and subsequently used for GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I Array (Illumina) according to manufacturerâ€™s protocol together with normalization methylated, hemimethylated and unmethylated DNA controls (Qiagen).
