TITLE
Genes differentially expressed in wild-type Medicago truncatula plants during nodulation

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We used an Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray consisting of 9,935 tentative consensus (TC)sequences, which are based on cDNA libraries (Mitra et al., 2004 [PMID:15220482]).  We examined gene expression of wild-type M. truncatula plants after inoculation with wild-type S. meliloti at 1 d, 4 d, 7d, 14 d, and 21 d. We chose these time points because they span the range of development of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, from initiation of the interaction through nitrogen fixation. The gene expression data for the 1-day time point (Mitra et al., 2004 [PMID 15220482]) and the other time points was previously published (Starker el al., 2006 [PMID 16407449]).

DESIGN
Three or five independent biological replicates were performed at each time point (1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment) and each treatment (buffer and wild-type bacteria).
