TITLE
Analysis of microRNA expression profiles induced by Yiqifumai Powder Injection in rats with chronic heart failure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism of Yiqifumai Powder Injectionthe on treating chronic heart diseases. We have employed a microRNAs microarray to identify the pivotal miRNAs altered by Yiqifumai compared to chronic heart injury and control group samples. 7 miRNAs accord with a 4-fold change (or more) or 1/4 (or less) and reverse rate between 1 and 2 were picked out as the reversible miRNAs for their expression after Yiqifumai treatment reversed significantly compared to model group. Among them, miR-21-3p and miR-542-3p were reported to associate with cardiac hypertrophy and tumer poliferation,respectively and they were validated by RT-PCR, which showed the consistent results as the microarray ones.

DESIGN
Yiqifumai Powder Injection regulated 7 differentially expressed miRNAs in treating chronic heart failure rats.
