TITLE
Expression data from different time points of developing natural killer cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of natural killer (NK) cells relies on the regulation of transcription factors and its function are controled by intergrating signals from the related receptors.To fully understand the scheme of NK cell development and find out useful new transcription factors and receptors, we conducted the microchips. We used microarrays to identify up-regulated transcription factors during different differentiation stages and related receptors in the last stage.

DESIGN
We collected the cells at different time points, from the first week to the fifth week, during the differentiation process from cord blood CD34 positive cells to NK cells in vitro.
