TITLE
Expression data for normal flow sorted hematopietic cell subpopulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of normal hematopoietic cell subpopulations RNA extracted from flow sorted normal hematopietic cells were hybridized onto Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Eight different flow sorted hematopoietic cell subpopulations were profiled. Two individual samples were obtained for each population.
