TITLE
Bisulphite-sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA (BisChiP-seq) directly informs methylation status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisulphite sequencing enables DNA methylation analysis of every cytosine residue. We have optimized conditions for combining chromatin immunoprecipation (ChIP) with high throughput bisulphite sequencing to study the relationship between histone modifications and DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Paired-end bisulphite sequencing of H3K27me3-ChIP DNA for LNCaP and PrEC cell lines
