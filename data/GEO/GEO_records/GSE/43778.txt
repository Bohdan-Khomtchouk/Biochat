TITLE
Gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinomas of various grades of malignancy

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study was to assess the gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinoma (in unsupervised manner) classified by pathologists as the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd grade of malignancy and compare their molecular and pathological classifications. Our analysis showed that some pathologically distinct tumours may have similar gene expression and vice-versa. Probably that is why the patients with the same pathological type of cancer often have various outcomes and respond in a heterogenous manner to anticancer agents. The molecular classification, contrary to the pathological methods, reflects the biological processes and pathways within the tumour cell, not only the morphological features. It is also helpful in the better understanding of cancer biology (genes responsible for tumourigenesis, molecular interactions within the tumour or genes involved in specific pathways which could be a target for future therapy).

DESIGN
18 canine mammary tumours (6 of the 1st grade of malignancy, 6 of the 2nd grade of malignancy and 6 of the 3rd grade of malignancy) were subjected to the analysis. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed and hybridized on cDNA microarrays. Pooled RNA from all of the tumours was used as a reference, and dye-swaps were performed. Then, the unsupervised hierarchical analysis was performed.
