TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of FlbD-, AbaA-, and WetA-dependent Genes in Fusarium graminearum Z-3639

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. Conidiogenesis had been intensively studied in Aspergillus nidulans and regulatory pathway genes have been known to regulate conidiogenesis in stage specific manner. We reported the functional analyses of flbD, abaA, and wetA orthologs in F. graminearum. To understand genome-wide transcriptional profiling of conidiation, we employed RNA-seq of the wild-type Fusarium graminearum Z-3639 and each gene deletion mutants with three time courses (0 h, 6 h and 12 h after induction of conidiogenesis).

DESIGN
AbaA experiment: 6 samples examined: 0 h, 6 h and 12 h after induction of conidiogenesis of Fusarium graminearum Z-3639 wild type and ΔabaA(ΔabaA::gen) mutant strains WetA experiment: 3 samples examined: 0 h, 6 h and 12 h after induction of conidiogenesis of Fusarium graminearum ΔwetA(ΔwetA::gen) mutant strains flbD experiment: 3 samples examined: 0 h, 6 h and 12 h after induction of conidiogenesis of Fusarium graminearum ΔflbD(ΔflbD::gen) mutant strains
