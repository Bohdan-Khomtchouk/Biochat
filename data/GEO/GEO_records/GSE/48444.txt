TITLE
Microarray-based gene expression data from BPLER tumor explants.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression of 6 different mouse xenografts initiated by BPLER cells analyzed by microarray. Basal-like triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have poor prognosis. To study the basal-like transcriptional profile of tumors transformed by defined genetic elements, the human breast epithelial cell line BPLER was injected into NOD/SCID mice. The resulting tumors were excised for expression analysis. Keywords: breast cancer, BPLER, metastasis, tumor stem cells, tumor initiating cells, breast adenocarcinoma

DESIGN
BPLER cells were derived from human primary breast epithelial cells propagated in WIT medium (Ince et al, Cancer Cell, 2007). These cells were transformed with hTERT, SV40 early region and hRASV12 by retroviral transduction. BPLER have a TNBC-like phenotype in vitro and are highly enriched for tumor-initiating cells. To define the phenotype of BPLER-derived tumors in vivo, BPLER cells were injected in the mammary fat-pad of 6 NOD/SCID mice. Once tumors were palpable, mice were sacrificed and tumors excised. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol. The gene expression profile of each tumor was assessed by mRNA microarray analysis. Based on histology and principal component analysis of microarray data, BPLER tumors were remarkably similar to human primary TNBC encountered in the clinic (Petrocca et al, Cancer Cell, 2013).
