TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome comparison between primary cultures of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and infantile hemangioma endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome comparisons of proliferating pure cultures of neonatal dermal microvacsular endothelial cells to infantile hemangioma endothelial cells.

DESIGN
The total RNA was obtained from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and infantile hemangioma endothelial cells.  Illumina microarrays were performed to determine the whole genome expression differences between the cell lines.
