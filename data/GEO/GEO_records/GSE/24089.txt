TITLE
Expression data from HPV(-) and HPV(+) squamous cell carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with nearly all carcinomas of the uterine cervix and have also become an increasingly important factor in the etiology of a subset of oropharyngeal tumors.  HPV-associated head and neck cancers (HNSCCs) have a distinct risk profile and appreciate a prognostic advantage compared to HPV-negative HNSCC. We analyzed the genome-wide expression patterns in two HPV(+) and two HPV(-) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines.

DESIGN
The Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform was used to assess genome-wide expression differences between the HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines utilizing the RMA normalization package available for R.  Cell lines analyzed: UM-SCC-4, UM-SCC-47, UM-SCC-74A, and CaSki.
