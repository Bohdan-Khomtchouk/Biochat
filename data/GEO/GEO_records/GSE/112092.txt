TITLE
Gene expression of the bacterium Glutamicibacter arilaitensis when grown with Penicillium in cheese

ORGANISM
Glutamicibacter arilaitensis

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used in combination with various analytical chemistry approaches to identify the chemical and genetic basis of pigment production of the bacterium Glutamicibacter arilaitensis when growing on cheese. This bacterium commonly found in cheese rinds where it co-occurs with Penicillium species and other molds. Pinkish-red pigments are produced by the bacterium in response to growth with Penicillium. Both chemical analyses and RNA-seq point to coproporphyrin III as the major metabolite leading to pigment formation.

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples were analyzed. 4 biological replicates were prepared for each of the two treatments (Glutamicibacter arilaitensis growing alone and Glutamicibacter arilaitensis growing with Penicillium sp. #12)

PLATFORM
GPL24753 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Glutamicibacter arilaitensis)
