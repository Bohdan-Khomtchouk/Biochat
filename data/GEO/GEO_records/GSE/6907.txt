TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by heavy metals and other chemicals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From the results of gene expression analyses of HepG2 under the exposure of 2,3-Dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), N-nitrosodimethylamine (DMN), phenol and six heavy metals We showed that biological action of six heavy metals were clearly related to that of DMNQ and distinguishable from the other chemicals. These results suggest that oxidative stress is major apparent biological action of high dose heavy metals, supporting the previous reports. Keywords: other

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix HG-Focus arrays, we compared the gene expression patterns of Hep G2 cells induced by six heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni, Sb, Hg or Cr) with that of DMNQ, DMN or phenol, and evaluated the toxicities of these heavy metals.
