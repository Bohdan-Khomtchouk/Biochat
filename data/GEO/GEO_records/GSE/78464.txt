TITLE
small RNA-seq from neural progenitor cell (ENCSR828LSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from H9-derived embryonic stem cells that were differentiated down a neuronal pathway. They are stranded SE101 length reads from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size that was pretreated with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase prior to cloning.
