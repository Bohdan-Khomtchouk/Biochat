SUMMARY
Time Course of TGF-beta treatment of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line on Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays; triplicate experiments. The goal of the experiment is to profile temporal gene expression changes during TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).   During EMT cancer cells loose their epithelial specifc proteins and gain mesenchymal proteins to acquire migratory and invasive phenotype essential for metastasis. Human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line was treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-beta for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 72 h to induce EMT.  The experiment was repeated 3 times.  Samples were assayed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays with 54675 probe-sets, using standard techniques. We provide the raw .CEL files and a supplementary Excel spreadsheet with log-transformed data and selected results from a statistical analysis.

DESIGN
Human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line was treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-beta for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 72 h.  The experiment was repeated 3 times.  Samples were assayed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays with 54675 probe-sets, using standard techniques.  The 2 h sample of the third experiment was not run on an array due to poor RNA, so that only 26 arrays were run.
