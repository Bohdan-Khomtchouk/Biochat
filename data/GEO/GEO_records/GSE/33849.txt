TITLE
Methylation data from normal thymocytes, 24 day pre-tumor Dnmt3b-deficient thymocytes, Wild-Type Tumors, and Dnmt3b-deficient Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dnmt3b is a DNA methytransferase which is an enzyme that methylated genomic DNA which contributes to genomic stability and transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
We genetically inactivated Dnmt3b in the hematopoeitic compartment in the context of MYC overexpression and analysed the resulting thymic lymphomas.
