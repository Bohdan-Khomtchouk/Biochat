TITLE
Transcriptome Study of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor from patients reached of Primary Myelofibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An increased number of circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (HP) and a prominent amplification of  dystrophic  megakaryocytes (MK) are observed in PMF patients. As transcriptome data from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors showed modulations of FLT3 and MAP kinase expression independently of the JAK2V617F mutation status

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on circulating CD34+ cells from PMF patients using Agilent 22K microarray and compared to CD34+ cells from blood and bone marrow from un-mobilized healthy donors. Indirect map: each tested sample was hybridzed with reference probe
