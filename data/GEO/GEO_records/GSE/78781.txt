TITLE
Trophoblast stem cells (TSC) global transcriptome in stemness conditions after treatment with Lsd1 inhibitor or induction of Lsd1 depletion [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq for  Lsd1-deficient TSCs or treated with Lsd1 inhibitor for 24hrs

DESIGN
TSC were treated with Lsd1 inhibitor or DMSO in stemness conditions for 24hrs; media and inhibitor where replaced every 12hrs along the duration of the experiment; 2 replicates were used for treatment  together with 2 control replicates in stemness; DFKZ genomics and proteomics. Please note that strain and targeting strategy had been described in the previous PMID: 24448552 publication
