TITLE
Analysis of Fetal liver cells from hnRNP L KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The regulation of post-transcriptional modifications of pre-mRNA by alternative splicing is important for cellular function, development and immunity. To investigate the role of hnRNP L in this process, we have generated conditional hnRNP L knockout mice carrying floxed alleles in order to generate a specific defect in hnRNP L activity.  We have previously characterized defects present in the thymocytes of hnRNP L -/- mice and the current study extends the analysis to examine the effects in fetal liver cells.  Overall these cells exhibit a very different phenotype from thymocytes characterized by significant cell death and a potential block in proliferation.  Further functional studies were performed to better characterize these effects.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from fetal liver cells of WT mice compared to KO (hnRNP L) mice
