TITLE
Salmonella wild type in LB, 2mM indole until OD1 and 2mM indole for 15 minutes

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type grown to OD600=1 in LB alone or in LB supplemented with 2mM Indole, or with 2mM indole for 15 min (called shock). The goal is to determine Salmonella response to indole at different time points.

DESIGN
Different conditions were tested. The reference on each hybridisation is the chromosome DNA of the wild type strain. 4 replicates each for LB and LB + Indole, 6 replicates for indole shock.
