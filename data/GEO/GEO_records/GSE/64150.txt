TITLE
Stable 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) Acquisition Marks Gene Activation During Chondrogenic Differentiation [seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of chondrogenic differentiation by DNA demethylation is little understood. The ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins oxidize methylated cytosines (5mC) to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC eventually leading to DNA demethylation. However, 5hmC is stable and can potentially act as an epigenetic mark as well. Here, we report that global changes in 5hmC mark chondrogenic differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of changing 5hmC levels in progenitor and differentiated chondrocytes.
