TITLE
Gene expression during dark-induced leaf abscission in Populus x tremula

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

SUMMARY
Identification of abscission regulated genes Genes involved in auxin transport and response are down-regulated in axils of shaded leaves.

DESIGN
For dark-induction experiments, fully expanded leaves with a petiolar angle of 75 ° to 90 ° from 1.5 m to 2 m tall trees were selected. Leaf blades were covered with aluminum bags for 9 days under standard greenhouse conditions. Control samples were bagged in transparent plastic bags of the same weight.
