TITLE
The C10orf10 protein profiling of breast cancer specimens based on a tissue array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression levels of C10orf10 protein were obtained for a series of 100 breast cancer tumor specimens.

DESIGN
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the antibody against C10orf10 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,sc-162735). The staining was evaluated for the tumor cells. The immunostaining was considered positive when ≥10% of the tumor cells being immunoreactive. The percentage of positive cells, as the extent of immunostaining, was quantified classified into 5 groups under microscope: < 10% positive cells for 0; 10% to 25% for 1; 26% to 50% for 2; 51% to 75% for 3 and ≥ 76% for 4. The intensity of staining was graded as negative (scored as 0), weak (1), moderate (2) or strong (3) positivity. The two pathologists independently reviewed all core biopsies. The sum of the percentage of positive staining and the intensity was used to define expression levels.
