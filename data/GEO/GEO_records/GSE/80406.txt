TITLE
Murine lung tissue: Gremlin-1 transgenic vs. wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of murine lung tissue comparing wild type to gremlin-1 transgenic untreated or silicon dioxide (silica)-treated for two months. Gremlin-1 transgene expression in lung type II epithelial cells under SPC promoter. Aim was to compare expression of fibrosis and inflammation associated genes.

DESIGN
Four condition experiment, wild type (WT), silica-treated WT, Gremlin-1 transgenic (TG) and silica-treated TG. Agilent dual color arrays with each channel analyzed independently.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
