TITLE
Gene Expression Data in Human Monocyte-derived Dendritic Cell (MoDC)  from Young and Aged Donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are major antigen-presenting cells that play a key role in initiating and regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are critical mediators of tolerance and immunity. The functional properties of DCs changes with age. The purpose of this study was to define the age-associated molecular changes in DCs by gene array analysis using Affymatrix GeneChips. We identified up and down-regulated gene expression changes in DC from aged donors compared to young donors.

DESIGN
Total 9 MoDC RNA samples from four young donors (20-27 years) and five aged donors (77-84 years) were analyzed using Affymetrix HG-U133A_2 Gene Arrays to compare differential gene expression changes in MoDC between aged and young groups
