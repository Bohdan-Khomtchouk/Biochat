TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of drug resistant cell lines (NGP-127).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to uncover transcriptome changes in NGP-127 cells during the acquisition of resistance to anticancer drugs Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Everolimus, Temsirolimus.

DESIGN
NGP-127 cells resistant to five target anticancer drugs were generated by growing naive cells serially treated with an increasing doses of Sunitinib up to 6 µM, Pazopanib up to 25 µM, Sorafenib up to 10 µM, Everolimus up to 20 µM and Temsirolimus up to 15 µM. Transcriptome analisys was made at the following time points: 4, 8, 14 and 18 weeks. Simultaneously untreated control sells were grown for the same period, transcriptome analisys was performed at 4, 8, 10,14 and 18 weeks.

PLATFORM
