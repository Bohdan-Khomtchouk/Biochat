TITLE
Gene expression analysis in soybean with respect to Pahakopsora pachyrhizii at V2 growth stage

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
A small number of genes (25) expressed differentially with respect to Phakopsora pachyrhizii at V2 growth stage. We used Affymetrix soybean microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying host reaction to Phakopsora pachyrhizii and identified differentially expressed genes during this process. Keywords: Infection by pathogen

DESIGN
Soybean cv. 5601T plants were grown in greenhouse in six 4-liter pots. Three weeks old plants at V2 growth stage in three out of six pots were inoculated with Phakopsora pachyrhizi and remaining three pots were used as control. Leaf samples from all pots were collected 72 hours after inoculation and RNA was extracted using Tri-Regent. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix platform.
