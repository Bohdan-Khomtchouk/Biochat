TITLE
Gene expression analysis in soybean with respect to Pahakopsora pachyrhizii at V2 growth stage

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
A small number of genes (25) expressed differentially with respect to Phakopsora pachyrhizii at V2 growth stage. We used Affymetrix soybean microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying host reaction to Phakopsora pachyrhizii and identified differentially expressed genes during this process. Keywords: Infection by pathogen
