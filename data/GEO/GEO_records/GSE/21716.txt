TITLE
Hepatic xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme gene expression through the life stages of the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using full-genome arrays, the expression of all XMEs was examined during fetal (gestation day (GD) 19), neonatal (postnatal day (PND) 7), prepubescent (PND30), middle age (12 mon), and old age (18 and 24 mon) in the C57Bl6/J mouse liver and compared to young adults.  Fetal and neonatal life stages had a dramatic effect on XME expression compared to the relatively minor effects of old age. At all life stages except PND30 down-regulated genes outnumbered up-regulated genes.  The altered XMEs included those in all of the major metabolic phases including phase I (alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase and Cyp genes), phase II (aldo-keto reductase, glutathione-S-transferases, sulfotransferases and UDP-glucuronosyl transferases) and phase III (transporters). We have generated a comprehensive catalog of XME hepatic gene changes through the life stages of the mouse that can be used to predict chemicals and chemical classes different life stages are more sensitive to. Some CEL files used in this study have been submitted through GSE21224. Keywords: gene expression/microarray

DESIGN
We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 19), neonatal (postnatal day (PND) 7), prepubescent (PND30), middle age (12 mon), and old age (18 and 24 mon) in the C57Bl6/J mouse liver using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver.. We also compared results to GD19, PND32, and PND67 C3H mice.  Total RNA was isolated from liver samples and gene expression analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChips.  Data from 28 samples, four mice in each of the age groups for C57BL/6 and C3H, were analyzed.
