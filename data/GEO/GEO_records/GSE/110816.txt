TITLE
Resident macrophage enhances an autoimmune lesion in Sjögren's syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are critical regulators of immune responses, and link innate immunity to acquired immunity. The precise mechanism of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases through tissue-resident macrophage is unclear. The role of the tissue-resident macrophages in the onset or development of autoimmunity was investigated using a murine model for Sjögren’s syndrome.

DESIGN
We focused on chemokine gene expression of salivary glands macrophages (sMΦs) of SS model mice to define a key role of different two subsets, CD11bhigh and CD11blow F4/80+ sMΦs, in the formation of autoimmune lesions. Chemokine mRNA gene expression was comprehensively compared between CD11bhigh and CD11blow F4/80+ sMΦs in SS model mice by qPCR gene expression profiling.Data are representative of 4 mice in each group.
