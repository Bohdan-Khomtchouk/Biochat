Human milk miRNAs primarily originate from the mammary gland resulting in unique miRNA profiles of fractionated milk

SUMMARY
Human milk (HM) contains an array of regulatory biomolecules including miRNAs, the origin, properties, distribution and functional significance of which are still undetermined. In this study, we used the TaqMan OpenArray System to profile 681 human mature miRNAs in two fractions of HM (cells and lipids) collected from healthy mothers in month 2 of lactation (n=10). Comparisons were performed with maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma collected from the same individuals, as well as with a bovine- and a soy-based infant formulae. HM cells (292 miRNAs) and PBMCs (345 miRNAs) had higher miRNA content than HM lipids (242 miRNAs) and plasma (219 miRNAs), respectively (p < 0.05). Despite the wide variation in miRNA profiles and expression between mothers, a strong association was found between HM cells and lipids within a mother, whilst PBMCs and plasma were distinctly different to the two milk fractions, with plasma displaying marked inter-individual variation. Considering the dominance of epithelial cells in mature milk of healthy women, these results suggest that HM cell and lipid miRNAs primarily originate from the mammary epithelium, whilst the maternal circulation may have a smaller contribution. Infant formulae contained very few human miRNA compared to HM. Our findings demonstrate that unlike infant formulae, human milk is a rich source of lactation-specific miRNA, which could be used as a biomarker of the performance and health status of the lactating gland. Given the recently identified stability and gene regulatory functions of food-derived miRNAs, HM miRNAs may contribute to infant protection and development.â€ƒ
