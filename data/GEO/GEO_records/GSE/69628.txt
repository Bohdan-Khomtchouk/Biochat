TITLE
Impact of dietary restriction (DR) on the transcriptome of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei [microarray]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
The aim was to understand the molecular basis of the parasite response to DR. Transcriptomic analysis of synchronized wildtype parasites, collected with 4h intervals, from mice under the two dietary conditions. We found that WT parasites on DR and control diets have different transcriptomes, with a remarkable general repression of transcription in DR.

DESIGN
Pairwaise comparison between the control and DR for each timepoint was performed. 3 biological replicates of each condition were used.
