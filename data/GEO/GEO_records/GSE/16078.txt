TITLE
Detection of transcription factor NRF1, YY1 and SP1 bound regions in human peripheral blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the correlation between sequence motif appearance, transcription factor binding and aberrant hypermethylation in the cell lines, we performed ChIP-on-chip analyses (on CpG island microarrays) for the transcription factors Sp1, NRF1 and YY1 in normal peripheral blood monocytes. Keywords: ChIP-on-Chip; comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Transcription factor bound genomic DNA was enriched using ChIP. On each microarray, the enriched material was compared to the genomic input to identify transcription factor bound regions. Two biological replicates were analysed for each factor.
