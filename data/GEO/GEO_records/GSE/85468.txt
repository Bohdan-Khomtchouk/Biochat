TITLE
Expression data from Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examine the toxic effect and molecular mechanisms of PM2.5 in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) . We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in HUVECs exposed to PM2.5 and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Cultured HUVECs which were treated with PM2.5 at the concentrations of 50 Î¼g/mL or DMEM for 24 h were collected for RNA  extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
