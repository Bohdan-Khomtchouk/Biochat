TITLE
Expression profiling in primary and stem-cell derived Human Endothelial and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome gene expression profiling of Normal Human Endothelial and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells

DESIGN
A NimbleGen Homo sapiens Expression Array [100718_HG18_opt_expr] study using total RNA recovered from endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells grown in cell culture. Each microarray measures the expression level of 23,611 genes using 45,033 probe sets with three 60-mer probes (PM) per probe set. Each probe set is represented once on the array.
