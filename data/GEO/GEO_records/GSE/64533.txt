TITLE
Expression data from E10.5 mouse embryo heads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Taspase1 (threonine aspartase) is a 50kD endopeptidase of the family of proteases possessing an Asparaginase_2 homology domain. Loss of Taspase1 function in Taspase1 null (Tasp1-/-) mice led to craniofacial malformations. We used microarrays to determine which genes are affected by loss of Taspase1 during craniofacial development.

DESIGN
E10.5 mouse embryo head (prosencephalon and mesencephalon) were dissected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To identify which genes are regulated by Taspase1 during development, we used RNA from three wild type and three Taspase1 KO embryos.
