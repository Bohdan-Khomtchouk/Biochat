TITLE
Dysregulation of microRNAs in neurodegeneration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains small RNA-seq data from six Alzheimer disease, three tangle-predominant dementia and seven control brains.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from human post-mortem autopsy brain and small RNA-seq was performed as described [Hafner, M., Renwick, N., Brown, M., Mihailovic, A., Holoch, D., Lin, C., Pena, J.T., Nusbaum, J.D., Morozov, P., Ludwig, J., et al. RNA-ligase-dependent biases in miRNA representation in deep-sequenced small RNA cDNA libraries. RNA. 2011; 17(9):1697-1712]
