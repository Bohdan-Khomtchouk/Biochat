TITLE
Analysis of alternative splicing in mouse tissues with differentiation, disease and development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two major goals for regenerative medicine are to reproducibly transform adult somatic cells into a pluripotent state and to control their differentiation into specific cell fates. These goals could be furthered by obtaining a complete picture of the RNA isoforms produced by these cells due to alternative splicing (AS) and alternative promoter selection (APS). To investigate the roles of AS and APS, reciprocal exon-exon junctions were interrogated on a genome-wide scale in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mouse myometrium throughout gestation and cardiac remodeling with disease using a prototype Affymetrix microarray. Using a custom analysis package named AltAnalyze ( http://www.AltAnalyze.org ), we identified a large number of putative AS and APS events, the majority of which were predicted to alter protein sequence and domain composition. Over a dozen AS and APS events were validated in mouse ESCs with differentiation to embryoid bodies.

DESIGN
Alternative splicing analysis of mouse tissue differentiation, disease and developmental remodeling paradigms.
