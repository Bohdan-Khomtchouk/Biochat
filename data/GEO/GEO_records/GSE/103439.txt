TITLE
Identification of genes involved in basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent malignant tumor of the eyelid. However, there is limited understanding of how altered gene expression of BCC of the eyelid related to the pathogenesis. In this study, to identify genes involved in basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from BCC of the eyelid and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
