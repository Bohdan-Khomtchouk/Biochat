TITLE
Microarray Analysis of MicroRNA Expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of critically ill Patients with Influenza A (H1N1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether differential expression of cellular microRNAs plays a role in the host response to Influenza A (H1N1) infection, we have employed the Agilent miRNA microarray (V3) as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs between the critically ill Patients with Influenza A (H1N1) and the healthy controls.

DESIGN
Five critically ill patients with a diagnosis of 2009 Inflluenza A (H1N1) and three healthy controls were included in the study. The Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated and total RNA was extracted respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL10850 Agilent-021827 Human miRNA Microarray (V3) (miRBase release 12.0 miRNA ID version)
