TITLE
Crosstalk between the effects of extracellular vesicles (Evs) and TNF on U937 human monocyte cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Under physiological conditions, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are present simultaneously in the extracellular compartment together with cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that EVs in combination with cytokines induce different responses of monocyte cells compared to EVs or cytokines alone. Human monocyte U937 cells were incubated with EV-containing or EV-free CCRF human T-cell supernatant, with or without the addition of TNF.

DESIGN
U937 cells cultured in EV-free supernatant, supernatant containing CCRF t-cell derived Evs, TNF or both. Each treatment option was measured in 3 replicates.
