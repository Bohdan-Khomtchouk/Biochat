TITLE
LXR activation in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages expressing LXRalpha.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify novel LXR target genes, we conducted transcriptional profiling studies using RAW264.7 cells ectopically expressing LXRalpha

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 macrophages ectopically expressing LXRalpha as described in Venkateswaran et al. (2000); PNAS 97, 12097-12102. Cells were cultured with DMSO or GW3965 (1 Î¼M) and LG268 (100 nM). Transcriptional profiling was performed at the UCLA microarray core facility using murine Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays.
