TITLE
Sav1 Loss Induces Senescence and Stat3 Activation Coinciding with Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our mouse model (Ksp-CreER/Sav1fl/fl ) offers novel insights into molecular events that are linked to fibrosis development from Sav1 loss.

DESIGN
RNAseq analysis was performed on cortex tissue from mouse kidneys with and without Sav1 loss.

PLATFORM
