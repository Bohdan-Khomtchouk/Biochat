TITLE
Ozone exposure of Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa ; Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa were exposed to either ambient air or an acute ozone exposure of 200 ppb for 9 hrs and ozone response was profiled for each genotype by hybridising control against ozone-exposed samples per genotype. Keywords: stress response, genotype comparrison, ozone exposure

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the fifth leaf below the first fully unfurled leaf for each plant. Control and ozone-exposed plants were then randomly paired for hybridisation.
