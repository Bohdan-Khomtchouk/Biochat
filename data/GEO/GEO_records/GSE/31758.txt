TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a wheat NIL pair carrying FHB resistant and susceptible alleles

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
In this study, we used the Affymetrix wheat GeneChip to examine the transcript accumulation in a near-isogenic line pair carrying resistant and susceptible alleles at the wheat Fhb1 locus. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify the overall response in wheat to F. graminearum infection; (2) to identify key genes involved in FHB resistance/susceptibility pathways in wheat; (3) to compare the transcript profiles of wheat and barley during F. graminearum infection; and (4) to examine the relationship between transcript accumulation, disease severity, fungal biomass and trichothecene accumulation in wheat.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Seungho Cho.

DESIGN
