TITLE
Age-dependent comparison of transcriptional signature of lamina propria anti-inflammatory macrophages of Il10rb-/- (KO) and Il10rb+/- (het) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that colonic lamina propria anti-inflammatory macrophages from Il10rb-/- (KO) mice at 12 weeks possessed significantly high levels of proinflammatory transcripts compared to the ones from Il10rb+/- (het) controls. While the transcriptional profile between macrophages from KO and het mice was comparable at 1 weeks and did not possess significant levels of proinflammatory transcripts, we show that the macrophages from KO mice were enriched for proinflammatory transcripts at 3 weeks compared to the ones from 3 week old het controls. These data indicate that the anti-inflammatory signature of colonic lamina propria macrophages from Il10rb-/- mice is compromized at 3 weeks.

DESIGN
Lamina propria macrophages were FACS sort-purified from 1, 3, and 12 weeks old KO and het mice based on gating strategy; CD45+CD11b+CD11cintCD103-CD64+Ly6C-MHCII+. One mouse each for 3, 12 weeks, and a pool of 3-5 mice at 1 weeks was included in RNA-seq analysis.
