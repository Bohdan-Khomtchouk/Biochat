TITLE
Gene expression profiling primary mouse mammary tumours from five different transplantable models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To delineate gene expression levels in whole non-metastatic and metastatic transplantable primary mouse mammary tumour allografts Abstract to be provided from publication

DESIGN
Primary mouse mammary tumours were grown till 400-600mm3 in size.  Five different tumour models were analysed in triplicate.  Thus, 3 different tumours/mice were used per model for a total of 15 mice. Each sample was applied to a separate microarray. Total RNA was prepared from whole primary tumours using Trizol reagent. Each sample was applied to Affymetrix gene expression arrays Mouse Gene 1.0ST.
