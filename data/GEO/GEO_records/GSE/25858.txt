TITLE
Gene expression profile of butyrate mediated prevention of coloractal cancer in a mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further elucidate the mechanism of butyrate mediated chemoprevention of colorectal cancer,we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that differentially expressed in mice from Butyrate group compared those from DMH group. The mice of DMH group were received normal diet (calcium concentration,1.24%) and subcutaneous injection of 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine at a dose of 20 mg/kg once weekly for 20 weeks; the mice of Butyrate group were received high calcium diet (calcium concentration,3%) with 1.5% Butyrate and subcutaneous injection of 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine at a dose of 20 mg/kg once weekly for 20 weeks. The mice were sarcrificed at 24 week. Nine normal colonic mucosa (3 from DMH group, 3 from Butyrate group mice with tumors, and 3 from Butyrate group mice without tumors) were used for the microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The differentially expressed genes were identified between butyrate group and DMH group,as long as differentially expressed pathways and gene ontology terms.
