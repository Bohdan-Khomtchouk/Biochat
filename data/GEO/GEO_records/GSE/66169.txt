TITLE
The linker histone H1.0 generates epigenetic and functional intratumor heterogeneity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of H1.0 genome wide distribution in in-vitro transformed fibroblast before its silencing in tumor CSCs and the localization of the histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of H1.0, H1.4, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in in vitro-transformed human skin fibroblasts. Two biological replicates each were analyzed.

PLATFORM
