TITLE
Gene expression in Rhagoletis pomonella and R. zephyria transplanted into snowberry and apple fruits

ORGANISM
Rhagoletis pomonella ; Rhagoletis zephyria

SUMMARY
Gene expression in feeding larvae reciprocally transplanted into snowberry and apple fruits

DESIGN
R. pomonella feeding in snowberry did not survive. The design includes R. pomonella feeding in apple and R. zephyria feeding in apple and snowberry 2 color Agilent custom microarrays, 6 biological replicates, 2-3 technical replicates, total 24 total 2-color arrays (however, R. pomonella feeding in snowberry arrays not included). Sample types: PA = R. pomonella larva transplanted into apple ZA = R. zephyria larva transplanted into apple ZS = R. zephyria larva transplanted into snowberry

PLATFORM
GPL19895 Agilent-028500 Rhagoletis pomonella custom Agilent cDNA array V2
