TITLE
A microRNA and snoRNA expression profile in the synchronous colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the profile of miRNA and snoRNA expression in 5 synchronous CRC and matched normal colorectal tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0 array. A total of 24 miRNA differential expressed transcripts which represent 27 mature miRNAs, including an oncogenic miR-17-92a and oncosuppressive miR-143-145 cluster, and a global up-regulation of snoRNAs were revealed in cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues. Global miRNA expression could distinguish synchronous cancer from normal mucosa. Our findings represent the first comprehensive miRNA and snoRNA expression signatures for synchronous CRC, which increase the understanding of the molecular basis of synchronous CRC, and firstly implicate that dysregulation of snoRNAs and miRNA clusters may present therapeutic targets for synchronous CRC.
