TITLE
Response to low R/FR light ratio in wt and brc1 mutant Arabidopsis axillary buds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To study the transcriptomic profile of wt and brc1 mutant axillary buds during the shade avoidance response, we simulated a canopy shade with a low R/FR light ratio. We treated plants with white light supplemented with far-red light (Red light = 29 μeinstein · m-2 seg-1, Far-Red light= 146 μeinstein · m-2 seg-1) for 8 hours. Control plants were left for 8 hours in white light (Red light = 29 μeinstein · m-2 seg-1, Far-Red light= 2.2 μeinstein · m-2 seg-1) .

DESIGN
Six biological replicates of 7-8 plants were collected for each genotype and condition (wt WL, wt FR, brc1 WL, brc1 FR). Samples were compared wt WL vs wt FR and brc1 WL vs brc1 FR.
