ORGANISM
Leuconostoc mesenteroides ; Enterococcus faecalis ; Enterococcus faecium ; Lactococcus lactis ; Lactobacillus acidophilus ; Lactobacillus delbrueckii ; Lactobacillus plantarum ; Lactobacillus sakei ; Lactobacillus fermentum ; Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis ; Lactobacillus curvatus ; Lactobacillus johnsonii ; Lactobacillus pontis ; Lactobacillus paralimentarius

SUMMARY
To study their metabolic potential in natural ecosystems, we developed a species-independent LAB microarray, containing 2,269 30-mer oligonucleotides, and targeting 406 genes that play a key role in the production of sugar catabolites, bacteriocins, exopolysaccharides, and aromas, in probiotic and biosafety characteristics, and in stress response. Also, genes linked to negative traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence are represented.  This experiment is a validation experiment, where we hybridized labelled RNA from 20 LAB strains, covering 86% of all oligos. Keywords: Platform validation experiment

DESIGN
Loop design, hence all RNA samples were hybridized once in each colour (Cy3 and Cy5).
