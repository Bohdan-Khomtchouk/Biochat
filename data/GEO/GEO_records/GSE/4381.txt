SUMMARY
Mean age of patients was 53.2 years old (range, 18–80). Twenty-two patients were males, and 7 were females. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 5 min of harvesting, and stored thereafter at －80℃. Samples were specifically re-reviewed by a board-certified pathologist in our institution, using observation of sections of paraffin-embedded tissues that were adjacent or in close proximity to the frozen sample from which the RNA was extracted. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
