TITLE
Variation in gene expression patterns in follicular lymphoma and the response to rituximab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract: Analysis of the patterns of gene expression in follicular lymphomas from 24 patients suggested that two groups of tumors might be distinguished. All patients, whose biopsies were obtained before any treatment, were treated with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the B cell antigen, CD20. Gene expression patterns in the tumors that subsequently failed to respond to rituximab appeared more similar to those of normal lymphoid tissues than to gene expression patterns of tumors from rituximab responders. These findings suggest the possibility that the response of follicular lymphoma to rituximab treatment may be predicted from the gene expression pattern of tumors.
