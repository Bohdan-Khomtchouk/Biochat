TITLE
mRNA-seq data of embryonic chicken digits

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Morphological characters are the result of developmental gene expression. Hence the identity of a character is ultimately grounded in the gene regulatory network directing development and thus whole genome gene expression data can provide evidence about character identity. Here we use transcriptomic data to address one of the most enduring paradoxes in evolutionary biology, the identity of the avian wing digits. Deep Sequencing of mRNA from embryonic chicken digits is performed and the gene expression profiles are analyzed.

DESIGN
Analysis of mRNA-seq data from 16 samples of chicken digits covering two embryonic stages.
