TITLE
Polysomal and total RNA in controls and after 10 min global brain ischemia and 8 hours of reperfusion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Complete global brain ischemia (CGBI) and reperfusion occur following resuscitation from cardiac arrest.  Different brain neurons are selectively vulnerable to CGBI: pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA3 survive 10 min CGBI but those of CA1 die at 3 days following 10 min CGBI. CA3 neurons are expected to have more robust stress responses and repair responses than CA1 neurons. We used microarrays to compared total and polysome-bound mRNAs in CA1 and CA3 at 8 hr reperfusion after 10 min CGBI in Long Evans male rats to ascertain differences in total vs polysome-bound gene expression.

DESIGN
Male Long Evans rats were subjected to (1) sham operation (non-ischemic control, NIC) or normothermic CGBI of 10 min followed by 8 hr reperfusion (8R). Hippocampal CA1 and CA3 were dissected. n = 5 CA1 or CA3 were pooled to give a single replicate and there were 3 or 4 replicates per group. Post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) was prepared. Twenty percent of PMS was TRIzol extracted to give total RNA. The remainder was run on a 20% sucrose pad to isolate polysome pellets, which were also TRIzol extracted to give polysome RNA.  Total and polysome RNA were then run on Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.0 microarrays.
