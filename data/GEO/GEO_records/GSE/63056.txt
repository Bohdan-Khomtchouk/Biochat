TITLE
Bacillus licheniformis isolated from Korean traditional food resources enhances the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through serotonin signaling

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The C. elegans lifespan in the presence of Bacillus licheniformis caused induction of a large number of genes associated with anti-aging activiy including beta-oxidation Inaddition, these results indicate the B. licheniformis enhances the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through serotonin signaling

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, C. elegans with B. lichemiformis 141 or E. coli OP50 (conrol) for 24 h. For preparing the total RNA, C. elegans were exposed to 20 mg of bacterial lawn in NGN agar for 24 h.

PLATFORM
GPL11346 Agilent-020186 C. elegans (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (Probe Name version)
