TITLE
Effect on gene expression upon deletion of Ada3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ada3 (alteration/deficiency in activation) is a transcriptional adaptor that forms a core structural component of multiple HAT complexes. In order to gain insights into physiological roles of Ada3, we made a conditional knockout mouse for Ada3 which was early embryonic lethal. Deletion of Ada3 in MEFs by using Adenovirus-Cre showed changes in global histone acetylation. We performed microarray analysis after deletion of Ada3 in these cells to compare gene expression changes caused due to Ada3 loss

DESIGN
Exponentially growing Ada3FL/FL MEFs were infected with control or Cre adenovirus. After 3 days of infection, we collected RNA from these cells to perform microarray analysis. The experiment was done using biological replicates
