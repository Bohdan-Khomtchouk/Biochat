TITLE
Identify novel muscle fusogenic factors for reconstitution of plasma membrane fusion in non-fusogenic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overall goal: To identify genes that will cause non-fusogenic fibroblasts to become fusogenic. Purpose of analysis: To generate transcriptional profile of non-fusogenic fibroblasts, using 10T1/2 fibroblasts transduced with empty retrovirus as model. Experimental structure: The profile generated from the RNAseq analysis would be compared with transcriptional profile of MyoD-expressing fibroblasts (GEO DataSet GSE34907) to identify genes regulating fusion in muscle cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq analysis of total RNA from 10T1/2 fibroblasts transduced with retrovirus carrying empty pBabe-X retroviral vector was carried out to generate a transcriptional profile of a model of non-fusogenic fibroblasts.
