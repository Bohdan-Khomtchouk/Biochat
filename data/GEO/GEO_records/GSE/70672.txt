TITLE
Differential expression profiling of  Arabidopsis ABHD11 knock-out mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ABHD11 has a acylhydrolase activity. Knock-out of abhd11 increases phospholipids in plant leaves. Wholegenome array was done to check the differential expressed genes in lipid metabolic pathway
