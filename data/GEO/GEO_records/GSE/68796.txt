TITLE
Comparative haploid genetic screens reveal divergent pathways in the biogenesis and trafficking of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative haploid genetic screens to annotate common and specialized genes required for the biogenesis of individual GPI anchored proteins. SEC62 and SEC63 were required for proper PrP targeting, and were dispensable for CD59. CD59 however, required a GPI side chain modification for maturation, in addition to the aspartyl intramembrane cleaving protease: SPPL3.

DESIGN
Examination of GPI trafficking requirements for two GPI anchored proteins using unbiased haploid genetic screens.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
