TITLE
ENPP1 deletion and infantile arterial calcification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify new mutations in the ENPP1 gene that produce infantile arterial calcification and fetal demise.  A stillborn (proband) was diagnosed with infantile arterial calcification.  Mutations in the ENPP1 gene account for ~80% of the cases of infantile arterial calcification through loss of function in both alleles (recessive inheritance).

DESIGN
The proband and parents were screened for mutations by sequencing.  The male parent was analyzed by microarray to verify and map a deletion suspected by sequence data analysis. The sample was called with a Europeans reference. ENPP1 position is located at chr6:132,170,849-132,257,988 (hg18). The matrix data provided contains only the deleted region and flanking probes.
