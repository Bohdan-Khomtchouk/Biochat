TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of Streptococcus pyogenes strain MGAS2221 with that of an isogenic PEL mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
PEL is a small regulatory RNA that is present within the S. pyogenes genome.  In some strains of S. pyogenes, the PEL sRNA regulates many of the known virulence factors produced by this pathogen.  A genome-wide analysis of PEL-regulated genes had not been performed previously so we analyzed this by comparing the parental M1T1 isolate MGAS2221 with an isogenic PEL mutant.  Comparing gene transcript levels between these two strains at the exponential and stationary phases of growth, we identified that PEL has no regulatory function in MGAS2221.

DESIGN
Three cultures of each GAS strain were grown in THY broth to exponential (O.D. 0.5) and stationary (O.D. 1.7) phases of growth.  Two volumes of RNA protect were added to samples recovered at these O.D.'s, the samples incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, and the bacteria collected through centrifugation.  Total RNA was isolated via a mechanical disruption method, converted to cDNA, fragmented, labeled, and hybridized to our Affymetrix microarray.  Estimates of gene expression were calculated using GCOS software v1.4.
