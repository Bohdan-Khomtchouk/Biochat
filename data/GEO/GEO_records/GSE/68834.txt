TITLE
UG26-1B6 stroma-derived factors regulate hematopoietic stem cell maintenance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) are regulated by their ’niche’, which limits activation of HSCs, to ensure their maintenance and self-renewal. To dissect the interactions involved during rapid activation in response to stress, we used cell co-culture as a model. Here, we studied gene expression changes of UG26-1B6 stromal cells in response to the presence of Lineage- Sca-1+ Kit+ (LSKs).

DESIGN
UG26-1B6 stromal cells were used in a total of 5 conditions (before co-culture (d0), after one (d1; 24 h), two (d2) and three (d3) days of co-culture with Lineage- Sca-1+ Kit+ (LSKs), after one (d1; 24 h) day of culture medium change (control)) with 2-3 technical replicates per condition.
