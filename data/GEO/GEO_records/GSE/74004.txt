TITLE
Expression data from H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)  differentiated to Early Mesoendoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during early hESC differentiation to Mesendoderm using FBS.

DESIGN
Samples of hESCs were taken at undifferentiated state (0h), 8h of differentiation, 24h of differentiation, and 72h of differentiation with three replicates (A, B, and C) at each time point.
