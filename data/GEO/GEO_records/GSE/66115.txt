TITLE
Human ileum stem cell differentiation by air-liquid interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite major advances with embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells or lineage-committed, p63-expressing stem cells of stratified epithelia, we know less about the indigenous stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and other columnar epithelia which collectively resist cloning in their elemental states.  Here we demonstrate the cloning of highly immature epithelial stem cells from defined regions of the human intestine and colon.  In this study, we have isolated ileal stem cells and performed air-liquid interface method to induce differentiation of human ileal stem cells. The differentiated structure showed villi-like epithelia which contains enterocytes, goblet cells, endocrine cells and paneth cells.

DESIGN
Human ileal stem cells are differentiated by air-liquid interface method and total RNA was collected for microarray preparation.
