TITLE
Identification of Cbt target genes in Drosophila wing imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide ChIP analysis to find the set of target genes regulated by Cbt in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We reported multiple transcriptional regulators and genes involved in the developlment, growth and patterning of the fruit fly.

DESIGN
Identification of Cabut binding sites in Wing imaginal discs cells
