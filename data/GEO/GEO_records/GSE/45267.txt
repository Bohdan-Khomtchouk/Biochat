TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human hepatocellular carcinoma (training set 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young subjects is rare but more devastating. We hypothesize that genes and etiological pathways are unique to young HCC (yHCC; â‰¤40 years old at diagnosis) patients. We therefore compared the gene expression profiles between yHCCs and HCCs from elderly patients.

DESIGN
In this dataset, a total of 87 gene expression profiles of tissue samples were collected, which containing 48 primary HCC samples, as well as those of 39 non-cancerous tissues, from 61 patients. HCC tissues were collected from 16 young HCC and 32 elder HCC patients.
