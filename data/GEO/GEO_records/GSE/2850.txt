TITLE
MOE430 whole mouse - mouse colon dilution series - RMA preprocessed

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data is part of a large-scale platform comparison experiment.  Whole mouse and adult mouse colon RNA was mixed at different concentrations (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) and distributed across multiple centers for analysis.  Eight microarray platforms and RT-PCR were tested for different labeling protocols, amplification protocols, and data preprocessing approaches in order to maximize data intercomparability.  The role of universal reference RNA was also examined.  Probes of different platforms were matched using gene symbols and/or RefSeq/GenBank accession numbers.  Several different normalization procedures were applied.  Evaluation criteria included linearity, sensitivity/specificity, and reproducibility within and between platforms, labeling methods, and laboratories. Keywords: dilution series
