TITLE
MOE430 whole mouse - mouse colon dilution series - RMA preprocessed

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data is part of a large-scale platform comparison experiment.  Whole mouse and adult mouse colon RNA was mixed at different concentrations (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) and distributed across multiple centers for analysis.  Eight microarray platforms and RT-PCR were tested for different labeling protocols, amplification protocols, and data preprocessing approaches in order to maximize data intercomparability.  The role of universal reference RNA was also examined.  Probes of different platforms were matched using gene symbols and/or RefSeq/GenBank accession numbers.  Several different normalization procedures were applied.  Evaluation criteria included linearity, sensitivity/specificity, and reproducibility within and between platforms, labeling methods, and laboratories. Keywords: dilution series

DESIGN
Whole mouse (sacrificed on day 1, strain: C57BL/6) and adult mouse (8 weeks, strain: C57BL/6 ) colon RNA from multiple animals was pooled respectively.  RNA was purified following the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations and integrity was analyzed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 according to manufacturer instructions. Five RNA samples were created by mixing the two original samples at different concentrations (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100).  The five master mix samples were then divided into duplicate sets of the five sample RNAs, distributed to individual laboratories, and hybridized to eight different microarray platforms at several different genome centers.  The five samples included here were prepared from 10ng of total RNA using a T7 double amplification protocol as described in Schwab et al., 2003 and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430 arrays as recommended by the manufacturer using the standard protocol.  No replicates were produced.
