TITLE
Transcription analysis of biofilm grown in different depth

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
Using DNA-microarrays analysis 39 differentially expressed genes were identified in 200 vs. 100 microns biofilms, which might be associated with thickness of S. mutans biofilm. Using DNA-microarrays analysis 29 differentially expressed genes were identified in 400 vs. 100 microns biofilms of S. mutans.
