TITLE
Transcription analysis of biofilm grown in different depth

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
Using DNA-microarrays analysis 39 differentially expressed genes were identified in 200 vs. 100 microns biofilms, which might be associated with thickness of S. mutans biofilm. Using DNA-microarrays analysis 29 differentially expressed genes were identified in 400 vs. 100 microns biofilms of S. mutans.

DESIGN
200 vs. 100 microns in depth: The arrays consisted of 1948 70-mer oligonucleotides representing 1960 ORFs from S. mutans UA159 and additional control sequences. The results represent the findings of two independent biological replicate arrays performed with two different RNA samples. In one of the arrays the 100-microns biofilm RNA sample was labeled with Cy5 and the 200-microns biofilm RNA with Cy3, while the second array was reversibly labeled. 400 vs. 100 microns in depth The arrays consisted of 1948 70-mer oligonucleotides representing 1960 ORFs from S. mutans UA159 and additional control sequences. The results represent the findings of three independent biological replicate arrays. In two of the arrays the RNA sample from 100-microns depths biofilm was labeled with Cy5 and the 400-micron - with Cy3, while the third array was reversibly labeled.
