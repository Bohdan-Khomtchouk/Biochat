TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas putida KT2440: Fuelling the central metabolism with aromatic compounds

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
We used Progenika oligonucleotide arrays to monitore the gene expression of P. putida during carbon source stimulus experiments.

DESIGN
After ensuring steady state conditions on benzoate, the stimuli were introduced by changing the carbon source from benzoate to glucose, from glucose to fructose and from fructose to benzoate, respectively. The single stimuli were monitored over a time period from 10 to 120 minutes after changing the carbon source by three representative timepoints. Moreover, the steady state conditions were compared among each other. Supplementary file: Individual normalized signal intensity VALUES for each channel of each array are provided in the FullNormalizedMatrix.txt file.
