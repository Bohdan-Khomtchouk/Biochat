TITLE
Human HPV16 positive CaSki cells: Control vs. virus oncogene e6/e7 silenced

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The infection with high-risk human papillomavirus is aetiologically linked to cervical cancer, the role of miRNAs regulated by virus oncogene in cancer progression remain largely unknown. Here, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs with miRNA array between virus oncogene e6/e7 silenced and not in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell lines
