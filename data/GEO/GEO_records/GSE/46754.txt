TITLE
Gene expression analysis of omental and mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our hypothesis is that in IBD patients intestinal bacteria translocation into the intra-abdominal fat depots affects adipocyte morphology and gene expression. The study aimed to study adipocyte gene expression  of omental (OM) and mesenteric (MES) adipose tissue of ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's disease (CD).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from isolated adipocytes from omental and mesenteric adipose tissue of CD and UC patients. Microarray experiments were performed in duplicates of 4 different pools of RNAs extracted from adipocytes isolated from OM and MES of UC patients (n=5) and CD patients (n=5) respectively.
