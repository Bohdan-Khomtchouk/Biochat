TITLE
Riding the spermatogenic wave: Profiling gene expression within neonatal germ and Sertoli cells during a synchronized initial wave of spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WIN 18,446/RA treatment of neonatal mice was used to synchronize the initial wave of spermatogenesis and identify novel messages expressed within either germ or Sertoli cells as spermatogonia enter meiosis.

DESIGN
germ cell-specific (Stra8-cre: RiboTag; or Ngn3-cre:RiboTag) and Sertoli cell-specific (Amh-Cre: RiboTag)

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
