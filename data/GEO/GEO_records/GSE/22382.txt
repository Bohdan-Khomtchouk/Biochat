TITLE
Organotypic Human Epithelial Neoplasia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Refined cancer models are required to assess the burgeoning number of potential targets for cancer therapeutics within a rapid and clinically relevant context.  Here we utilize tumor-associated genetic pathways to transform primary human epithelial cells from epidermis, oropharynx, esophagus, and cervix into genetically defined tumors within an entirely human 3-dimensional (3-D) tissue environment incorporating cell-populated stroma and intact basement membrane (BM). These engineered organotypic tissues recapitulated natural features of tumor progression, including epithelial invasion through the BM, a complex process critically required for biologic malignancy in 90% of human cancers. Invasion was rapid, and potentiated by stromal cells.  Oncogenic signals in 3-D tissue, but not 2-D culture, resembled gene expression profiles from spontaneous human cancers. Screening well-characterized signaling pathway inhibitors in 3-D organotypic neoplasia helped distil a clinically faithful cancer gene signature. Multi-tissue 3-D human tissue cancer models may provide an efficient and relevant complement to current approaches to characterize cancer progression.

DESIGN
Organotypic human cervical epithium expressing LacZ, cdk4 and Ras, or cdk and Ras with U0126 mediated MEK inhibition were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. There are 2 biologic replicates for each group.
