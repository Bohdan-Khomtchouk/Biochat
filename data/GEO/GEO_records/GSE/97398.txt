TITLE
Effect of PKN1 inhibition on androgen responsive genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study and compare the effect of siRNA-mediated PKN1 silencing and CEP701-mediated PKN1 inhibition on androgen-responsive genes.

DESIGN
1. Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells were transfected with siRNA SmartPools targeting PKN1 or a non-targeting siRNA SmartPool.  Forty hours after transfection, cells were treated with synthetic androgen R1881 (5nM) or vehicle.  Three biological replicates were generated per treatment group.  Forty-eight hours later, total RNA was isolated and processed for RNA-Seq analysis. 2. Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with synthetic androgen R1881 (5nM) or vehicle and CEP701 (50nM) or DMSO.  Three biological replicates were generated per treatment group.  Forty-eight hours later, total RNA was isolated and processed for RNA-Seq analysis. PRJNA380418
