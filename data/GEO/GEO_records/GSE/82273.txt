TITLE
Maternal age impacts the epigenetic profile of offspring

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms controlling genome methylation during human embryogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that maternal age at pregnancy permanently alters the epigenetic profile of offspring. We measured DNA methylation in blood at over 450,000 CpGs across the epigenome in 890 newborns.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 890 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
