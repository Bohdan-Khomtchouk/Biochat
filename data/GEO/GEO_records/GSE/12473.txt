TITLE
Hela Mitotic Selection - gene expression time series in early G1 phase of the human cell cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa mitotic cells were collected using a mitotic shakeoff apparatus to study gene expression in early G1 phase of the human cell cycle. This set includes microarray data from two shake-off experiments : shake 1 (0h-14h) which was conducted over  14 hours and RNA samples collected every 2 hrs, and shake 2 (0min-120min) which was conducted over 2 hours and samples collected every 15 minutes. Total RNA was prepared using ULTRASPEC RNA isolation system, and Reference RNA was extracted from asynchronously growing HeLa cells using TRIzol. For cDNA synthesis and microarray hybridization, refer to Whitfield ML. et al., Mol Biol Cell, 2002. 13(6): p. 1977-2000. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Age: g1 progression after mitotic shake-off Replicate: two biological replicates (shake1 and shake2) Keywords: time_series_design
