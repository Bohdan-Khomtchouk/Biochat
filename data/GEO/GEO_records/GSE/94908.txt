TITLE
P53 regulated microRNAs in the presence/absence of caesin kinase 1 alpha (CK1alpha)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the differential expression of mature miRNAs in the presence and absence of P53 using RKO isogenic cell lines. Additionally, we also wanted to study the imapct of CK1alpha on the regulation of these miRNAs

DESIGN
RKO P53 isogenic cell lines with/without validated CK1apha siRNA transfected at an end concentration of 100nM

PLATFORM
GPL19730 Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (Probe Name version)
