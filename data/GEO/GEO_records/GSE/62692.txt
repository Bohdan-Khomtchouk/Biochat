TITLE
Genome-wide omparism of Terc deficient ntESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haplo-insufficiency of telomerase genes in humans leads to telomere syndromes such as dyskeratosis congenital and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Generation of pluripotent stem cells from telomerase haplo-insufficient donor cells would provide unique opportunities towards the realization of patient-specific stem cell therapies. Recently, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) have been efficiently achieved by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We tested the hypothesis that SCNT could effectively elongate shortening telomeres of telomerase haplo-insufficient cells in the ntESCs using relevant mouse models. Indeed, telomeres of telomerase haplo-insufficient (Terc+/-) mouse cells are elongated in ntESCs. Moreover, ntESCs derived from Terc+/- cells exhibit naïve pluripotency as evidenced by generation of Terc+/-ntESC clone pups by tetraploid embryo complementation (TEC), the most stringent test of naïve pluripotency. These data suggest that SCNT could offer a powerful tool to reprogram telomeres and to discover the factors for robust restoration of telomeres and pluripotency of telomerase haplo-insufficient somatic cells.

DESIGN
RNAs from Terc+/+, +/- and -/- contain 3 biological repeatsin each group.
