TITLE
Expression Data from E. faecalis VE14089 and luxS mutant with and without DPD

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
Genes differentially regulated by the LuxS/AI-2 system in E. feacalis VE14089

DESIGN
E. faecalis VE14082ΔluxS cells were collected after 15 minutes challenge with and without 10µM DPD , for RNA extraction and hybridization onNimbleGen microarrays. As a control VE14089 cells were collected for the same purpose without DPD. For each condition replicates were made.
