TITLE
Unirradiated HCT116-CloneK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray study of unirradiated X-radiation (XR) sensitive HCT116-CloneK cells versus unirradiated HCT116-Clone10 cells. HCT116-Clone10 cells have similar XR response with parental HCT116 cells. Keywords = X-radiation (XR), XR sensitive, colorectal cancer cells, HCT1116 Keywords: repeat sample
