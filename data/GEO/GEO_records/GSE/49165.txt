TITLE
Expression data from mesenchymal stem cells of ossifying fibroma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ossifying fibroma (OF) is a common benign fibro-osseous neoplasm of orofacial bones, showing progressive enlargement of the affected jaw with deficiency in bone formation. Our aim is to discover the molecular difference between mesenchymal stem cells from OF and normal jaw bone to provide basis for development of clinical therapy. Global gene expression comparison and gene ontology analysis found that several singaling pathways are involved in the process, including TGFb signaling and Notch signaling. Inhibition of  TGFb signaling in mesenchymal stem cells of OF can increase the osteogenesis and decrease proliferation, shedding light on developing strategies for therapy.

DESIGN
RNA from mesenchymal stem cells of OF is compared to that of normal jaw bone.
