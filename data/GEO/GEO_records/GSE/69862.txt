TITLE
Gene profiling of v-Src transformed primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) under the condition of AP-1 repression

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of AP-1 in Src-mediated transformation, we undertook a gene profiling study to characterize the transcriptomes of v-Src-transformed CEF expressing either the c-Jun dominant-negative mutant TAM67 or JunD shRNA.

DESIGN
CEFs were transfected with B-type RSV viral vectors expressing JunD shRNA, GFP control, or the c-Jun TAM67 dominant negative mutant. Transfected CEFs were superinfected with the temperature sensitive A-type NY72-4 RSV. Infected CEFs were cultured at the non-permissive temperature until such time when temperature shift was performed to induce v-Src activation. All experimental groups consisted of three biological replicates except for NY72-4/RCAS(B)-JunD shRNA permissive which was conducted in sextuplicate.
