TITLE
Liver transcriptome (BXD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profile of Liver transcriptome of BXDs, C57BL6/J and DBA2/J. We use expression QTL analysis to discover disease loci and regulatory pathways regulating serum lipid levels. Keywords: strains

DESIGN
18 BXDs, DBA2/J C57BL6/J were sacrificed at 10-20 weeks of age.  Liver tissues were collected from three unfasted males for each of the mouse  used for these analyses. We then measured differences in gene expression profile between each RI/parents and B6 17.5 day embryos.
