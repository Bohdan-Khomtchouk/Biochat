TITLE
The expression profile of ABC transporter genes in post-treatment breast carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to development of resistance to anti-cancer drugs via ATP-dependent drug efflux. A major goal of our study was to investigate associations between expression of ABC transporters and outcome of breast carcinoma patients. ABCA5/6/8/9/10, ABCB1/5/11, ABCC6/9, ABCD2/4 and ABCG5/G8 were significantly downregulated and ABCA2/3/7/12, ABCB2/3/8/9/10, ABCC1/4/5/10/11/12, ABCD1/3, ABCE1, ABCF1/2/3 and ABCG1 upregulated in post-treatment tumors compared with non-neoplastic tissues. Significant associations of ABCC1 and ABCC8 levels in tumors with grade and expression of hormonal receptors were found. ABCA13 and ABCD2 levels significantly associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in post-treatment patients.

DESIGN
Transcript levels of all forty nine human ABCs were determined by qPCR in post-treatment tumor and non-neoplastic tissue samples from 68 breast carcinoma patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EIF2B1, MRPL19, IPO8, and UBB were used as reference genes for data normalization.
