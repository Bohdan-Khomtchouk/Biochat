TITLE
ChIP-Seq of constitutively expressed Ndt80A-Myc and Ndt80B-Myc in S. stipitis

ORGANISM
Scheffersomyces stipitis

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by the two Ndt80 paralogs in S. stipitis when constitutively expressed. Both paralogs were tagged with c-myc, the native Ndt80 promoter was replaced with the E. gossypii Tef1 promoter and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  Cells were grown unti log-phase in YPD.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

DESIGN
S. stipitis Ndt80A-myc vs. untagged control, and Ndt80B-myc vs. untagged control, with two technical replicates for each
