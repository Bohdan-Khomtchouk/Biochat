TITLE
Self-enforcing Feedback Activation between BCL6 and Pre-B Cell Receptor Signaling Defines a Distinct Subtype of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIPseq in primary pre-B acute lymphomablastic leukemia (ALL) cells to identify target genes of the oncogenes TCF3-PBX1 and BCL6 that are involved in leukemogenesis of TCF3-PBX1 pre-B ALL.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq using E2A (TCF3), PBX1, p300 and BCL6 antibodies in ICN12 cells (primary pre-B acute lymphomablastic leukemia)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
