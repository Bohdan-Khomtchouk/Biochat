TITLE
cDNA microarray data of bovine placenta

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns of bovine placenta from initial to late stage of pregnancy were investigated by using the our custom designed utero-placental cDNA microarray. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We analyzed 20 arrays performed using 10 polyA RNA samples. Total RNA were collected from bovine carancular and cotyledonary tissues (Day25, 60, 150, 250 of gestation) and endometrial tissues of non-pregnant cows. All hybridizations were performed in duplicate (Cy3 and Cy5 dyes), where reverse labeling was done.
