TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of human pancreatic endocrine cells from Juvenile, adult control and type 2 diabetic donors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We successfully sequenced and annotated more than 400 cells from child, adult control, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes donors. We detect donor-type specific transcript variation. We also report that cells from child donors have less defined gene signature. Cells from type 2 diabetes donors resemble juvenile cells in gene expression.

DESIGN
Cells from three adult controls (56, 74, 92), one donor with type 1 diabetes (91), two donors with type 2 diabetes (75, 143), and two child donors (40, 72) were sequenced. Numbers in parathesis indicates number of cells sequenced.
