TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of SMRT and NCoR in wild-type and Bcl6 knockout macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-seq, we reveal the SMRT and NCoR co-repressor cistromes, which each consist of over 30,000 half-shared binding sites.  Moreover, we identify Bcl6-bound sub-cistromes for each co-repressor, which are strongly concentrated on NF-ÎºB-driven inflammatory and tissue remodeling genes.  These results reveal a critical role for Bcl6 and its corepressors SMRT and NCoR in the prevention of atherosclerosis and chronic inflammation.
