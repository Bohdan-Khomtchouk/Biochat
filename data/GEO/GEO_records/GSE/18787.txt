TITLE
Gene regulation in osmpk6 mutant cells expressing OsMKK4DD

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsMKK4 is a rice MAPKK and immediately activated by treatment with chitin elicitor, a fungal MAMP. OsMKK4 phosphrylate and activate OsMPK6. We compared gene expression in osmpk6 and osmpk6 complemented cells expressing active OsMKK4 using rice 44K oligoarray.

DESIGN
We used transgenic osmpk6 mutant and osmpk6 complemented callus expressing active OsMKK4 (OsMKK4DD) under the dexamethazone (DEX)-inducible promoter. Callus were treated with DEX or control ethanol. Samples were derived from 3 biological replicates and labeled by one-color method.
