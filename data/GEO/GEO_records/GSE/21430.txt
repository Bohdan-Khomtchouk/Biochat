TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the T. thermophilus HB8 response to hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 0, 5, 15 and 30 min after the addition of 10 mM H2O2.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 2 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (1 mL) were inoculated into 1000 mL of the same medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C for 6.5 hours (A600 value being ~0.55). Then the 10 mM of H2O2 was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 0, 5, 15 and 30 min time point after the addition of H2O2, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip.
