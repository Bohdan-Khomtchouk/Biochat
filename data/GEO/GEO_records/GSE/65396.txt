TITLE
In depth characterization of the activity of a novel synthetic macrocyclic antifungal compound

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The systemic infections by peptogenous fungi member of the genera Candida and Aspergillus represent a serious threat for public health. During previous research we have successfully identified a family of compounds active against different Candida spp. including strains resistant to antifungal drugs currently on the market. We have further refined our knowledge on this field by identifying a possible molecular target that could justify the activity of these compounds. The research of the mode of action of the compounds object of this manuscript was supported also by fluorescent microscopy of labeled derivatives. Transcriptional data indicates that one of the macrocyclic antifungal induces a drug response involving ATP binding cassette transporters. Moreover the data show that the macrocyclic antifungal decrease expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes. Moreover, the quality of the compounds and their potential was tested in vivo revealing a promising profile in particular against fungal infection caused by resistant strains

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in Candida albians CAF2-1 exposed to the macrocyclic compound FR59 at 3 ÂµM at two time points (15 min and 45 min), The one-color system was used. Three independent experiments were performed using non-exposed cells, 15 min and 45 min exposed cells.
