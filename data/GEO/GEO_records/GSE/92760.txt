TITLE
Transcriptomic, Proteomic, and Metabolomic Landscape of Positional Memory in the Caudal Fin of Zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Regeneration requires cells to regulate proliferation and patterning according to their spatial position. Positional memory is a property that enables regenerating cells to recall spatial information from the uninjured tissue. Positional memory is hypothesized to rely on gradients of molecules, few of which have been identified. Here, we quantified the global abundance of transcripts, proteins and metabolites along the proximodistal axis of caudal fins of uninjured and regenerating adult zebrafish. Using this approach, we uncovered complex overlapping expression patterns for hundreds of molecules involved in diverse cellular functions, including developmental and bioelectric signaling as well as amino acid and lipid metabolism. Moreover, 32 genes differentially expressed at the RNA level had concomitant differential expression of the encoded proteins. Thus, the identification of proximodistal differences in levels of RNAs, proteins, and metabolites will facilitate future functional studies of positional memory during appendage regeneration.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on 5 biological replicates for each of 3 positions along the proximodistal axis of the caudal fin; proximal, middle and distal (15 total samples). Each biological replicate was a pool of fin regions cut from 2 male and 2 female zebrafish.
