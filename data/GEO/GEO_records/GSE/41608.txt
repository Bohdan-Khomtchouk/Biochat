TITLE
Chromatin Remodeling Enzyme Smarca5/Snf2h Regulates Cell Cycle Exit, Differentiation of the Lens Epithelium, and Denucleation of Lens Fiber Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide approach to identify the cell-autonomous role of Snf2h in lens fiber cell terminal differentiation. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Snf2h lens-conditional knockout and wildtype newborn mouse eyeballs, with subsequent comparison of this data with the Brg1 lens-conditional knockout mouse eyes expression data (GSE25168).

DESIGN
Four biological replicate experiments were performed.
