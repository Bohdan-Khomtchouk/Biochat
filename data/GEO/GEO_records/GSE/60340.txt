TITLE
Pathway Profiling of Replicative and Induced Senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed on LFS MDAH041 cells that were young (PD10-12), aging (PD17-19) and replicatively senescent (PD28-30), as well as spontaneously immortal cells and cells that were induced into senescence or quiescence,  in order to profile the pathways common in all 4 types of sensecence and the pathways affected as a cell approaches senescence.

DESIGN
RNA was sequenced in biological triplicates of each sample using the Illumina HiSeq2000

PLATFORM
