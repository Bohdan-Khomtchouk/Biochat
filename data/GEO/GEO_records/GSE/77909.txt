TITLE
Expression data from CD1d tetramer-sorted b-GL122/LGL1–specific human T cells or iNKT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability to detect and isolate bGL1-22/LGL1–specific human type II NKT cells allowed us to compare the global gene expression profiles of these cells with type I NKT cells using microarray analysis. Principal component analysis revealed that the gene expression profile signature for bGL1-22 and LGL1-specific T cells both before and after activation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads is distinct from that of type I NKT cells.

DESIGN
RNA from CD1d tetramer-sorted b-GL122/LGL1–specific T cells or iNKT cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chips. The data were analyzed with GeneSpring GX 12.5 (Agilent Technologies)
