TITLE
GR and Pol II interactions with regulatory elements in response to ultradian (pulsed) hormone stimulation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report changes in GR and Pol II binding profiles genome-wide upon treatment with corticosterone (Cort) for 20 minutes, treatment with Cort for 20 minutes followed by hormone withdrawal for 40 minutes, 60 minutes continuous stimulation with Cort, and  60 minutes continuous stimulation with Dexamethasone (Dex).

DESIGN
We examine GR binding upon following treatments: 0' Cort, 20' Cort, 60' Cort Pulsed, 60' Cort Constant; Pol II binding upon following treatments: 0' Cort, 20' Cort, 60' Cort Pulsed, 60' Cort Constant, 60' Dex Constant;  Pol II binding upon Mock treatments simulating 0' Cort, 20' Cort, 60' Cort Pulsed, 60' Cort Constant; CTCF binding profile of untreated cells.
