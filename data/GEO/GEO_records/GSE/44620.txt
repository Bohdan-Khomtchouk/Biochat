TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis sad1mutant during heat stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in sad1 mutant during heat stress

DESIGN
Ten-day-old seedlings of wild type (C24 accession) and sad1 mutant were subjected to 37 Â°C for 0, 2, and 6 h. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
