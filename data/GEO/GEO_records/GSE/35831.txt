TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of PKD1 in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ADPKD (Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) is the most common inherited disorders and is characterized by growth of numerous cysts filled with fluid in the kidneys. Ultimately, it leads to kidney failure. The mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 account for approximately 85 and 15 percent of ADPKD, respectively. However, the mechanisms related to genetic mutation of PKD1 and PKD2 are still unclear. To investigate altered gene expression levels, Affymetrix microarray was performed using the kidney tissue from normal and ADPKD patients.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from kidney of human normal (49 years old/ male) and ADPKD patients (62 years old/ male, 67 years old/ male) using NucleoSpin® RNA Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We used tha Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. Per RNA sample, 300 ng was used as the input into the Affymetrix procedure as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol.
