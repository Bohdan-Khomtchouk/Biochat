TITLE
Whole genome microRNA  expression profiling during C. elegans dietary restriction

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to get an insight into the complex interplay of miRNAs in dietary restriction, we profiled the small RNA polulation of wild-type and eat-2(ad1116) worms on Day 1 and Day 8 of adulthood by Next Generation sequencing. We compared the normalized expression  of wild-type vs eat-2(ad1116) on either day 1 or day 8 and found that most of the miRNAs were distinctly upregulated in eat-2(ad1116) on day 1.

DESIGN
We performed Next Generation sequencing to compare miRNA profiles of wild-type and eat-2(ad1116) at Day 1 and Day 8
