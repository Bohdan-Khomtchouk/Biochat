TITLE
Prospective molecular profiling of canine cancers provides a clinically relevant comparative model for evaluating precision medicine (PMed) trials

ORGANISM
Canis lupus

SUMMARY
Feasibility trial to examine the ability to conduct molecular guided therapy in a geographically distributed systems within strict time constraints

DESIGN
Canine patients were enrolled across a broad panel of tumor types where tumor samples were acquired and processed to preserve RNA quality for genomic analysis at distributed locations to predict possible effective therapies.  Genomic driven therapy suggestion derived using a collection of algorithms based on tumor expression levels.
