TITLE
Global mapping of epigenetic modifications of histone H3 Lysine 4 di- and trimethylation in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We present high-resolution maps of DNA methylation and H3K4 di- and tri-methylation of two entire chromosomes and two fully sequenced centromeres in rice shoots and cultured cells. Most transposable elements have highly methylated DNA but no H3K4 methylation whereas over half of protein-coding genes have both methylated DNA and  di- and/or tri-methylated H3K4. Methylation of DNA but not H3K4 correlates with suppressed transcription. In contrast, if both DNA and H3K4 are methylated transcription is only slightly reduced.  Transcriptional activity was positively correlated with H3K4Me3/H3K4Me2 within the gene body: genes with predominantly H3K4Me3 were actively transcribed whereas genes with predominantly H3K4Me2 were transcribed at moderate levels. Both H3K4Me2 and H3K4Me3 exhibited two peaks in long rice genes; a minor peak correlated with putative transcription start sites and a major peak downstream, implying possible roles in transcriptional initiation and elongation.
