TITLE
Transcript profiling of ERF115 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment was set up in order to identify the (direct) transcriptional targets of the Ethylene Response Factor 115 (ERF115) transcription factor. Because ERF115 expression occurs in quiescent center (QC) cells and strong effects on the QC cells were observed in ERF115 overexpression plants, root tips were harvested for transcript profiling in order to focus on root meristem and QC specific transcriptional targets.

DESIGN
Wild-type (Col-0 ecotype), erf115 mutant (SALK_021981) and ERF115 overexpressing (p35S:ERF115 ORF) root tips (three replicates each) were harvested and subjected to transcript profiling, using the Col-0 samples as control reference.
