TITLE
Activin A and BMP4 Modulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin Signaling Directs Fate Specification of Mesoderm Derivatives from Human Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the derivation of 2 different methods of generating cardiac myocytes from human ESCs. The traditional route is via cardiac progenitor cells and the second, new approach is through re-directing hemogenic endothelium into the cardiac lineage using inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different cardiac populations using RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
