TITLE
Cytokine Stimulated Vs Unstimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human bronchial smooth muscle cells were growth arrested.  One group was stimulated with 10ng/mL of IL-1beta, TNF-alfa, and gamma IFN for 20 hours.  For every cDNA sample, 2 dyeflipped slides were hybridized (these have the same date in the titles).  All cy3 (channel 2) measurements were normalized to the dye coupling control before a ratio of the values was taken. Keywords: parallel sample
