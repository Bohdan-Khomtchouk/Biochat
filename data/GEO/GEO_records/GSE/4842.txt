TITLE
Soybean, resistant & susceptible response to P.sojae

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean response to P.sojae infection, Harosoy 63 (resistant cultivar) & Harosoy (susceptible cultivar) at 0,3,6,12,24,48 hours after inoculation. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
11 microarray slides GPL3015; 2 soybean cultivars, Harosoy63 (resistant response) and Harosoy (susceptible reponse); 2 biological reps for each infected time point with dye swap on the 2nd rep. Total RNA isolated from the etiolated hypocotyl at 0,3,6,12,24 & 48 hours after infection. Slide data was analyzed in GeneSpringGX7.3 Agilent Technologies, using background subtracted values. The ratio for resistant/susceptible was calculated from the 2 colour hybridization (same slide) and relative expression for infection development in each cultivar was calculated using all the slides as single channel data.The slide identites are biological rep1 GSM108299 toGSM108303, biological rep 2 GSM108304 to GSM108308 and water inoculated, 0 hour, GSM108309

PLATFORM
GPL3015 Keck Glycine max 18kA cDNA Prints101-108
