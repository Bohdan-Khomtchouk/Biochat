TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of Gene expression changes in U2OS osteosarcoma cells with PML silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used next generation sequencing to analyze the gene expression changes in U2OS osteosarcoma cells expressing shRNA targeting the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene transcripts

DESIGN
cDNA libraries of U2OS cells expressing control shRNA or shRNA targeting PML were generated from one biological replicate

PLATFORM
