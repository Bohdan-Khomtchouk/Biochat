TITLE
Microarray gene-expression profiles of 50 pancreatic tumors tissue from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify biologically relevant tumor markers, and novel therapeutic target we have compared the tumor gene expression profiles of long (OS > =24 months,n=14) and short (OS < =7months, n=11) survival patients. Then we conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using all the 50 samples listed here. The Affymetrix gene-expression data of these 50 samples were also included in the earlier submission by us as GEO accession number GSE62452.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of long and short survival patients, significantly differentially expressed genes were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Significantly differentially expressed genes with 1.5 fold change were further analyzed by Coxregression Proportional harzard ratio.
