TITLE
Gene expression profile of wt-, S473A- and S473D-KAP1-re-expression in KAP1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We study the gene regulation function of serine 473 phosphorylation of KAP1 (pS473-KAP1) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Wild type KAP1, S473A-KAP1 (phospho-acceptor site mutant) and S473D-KAP1 (phospho-mimetic mutant) are re-expressed in KAP1 knockdown cells. We analyze the gene expression profile in these three cells and find that many mitochondrial complex genes are up-regulated in S473D-KAP1 re-expressing cells. This study provides information about pS473-KAP1-regulated gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA profile of wt-, S473A- and S473D-KAP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were generated by deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
