TITLE
The human skeletal muscle transcriptome â€“ sex differences, alternative splicing and tissue homogeneity assessed with RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The amount of RNA sequencing data on skeletal muscle is very limited. We have analyzed a large set of human muscle biopsy samples and provide extensive information on the baseline skeletal muscle transcriptome, including completely novel protein-coding transcripts.

DESIGN
Analyze of transcriptome in 23 skeletal muscle biopsy samples from six individuals. Four biopsies from each subject, two biopsies from each leg (except subject 6 which has only three biopsies in total).
