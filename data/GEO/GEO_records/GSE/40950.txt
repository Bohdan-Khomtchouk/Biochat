TITLE
Effect of live Mycobacterium leprae infection on global gene expression of primary human Schwann cells at 24 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an attempt to understand M. leprae interaction with the human host, Stanford Genomics HEEBO Arrays were use to identify modulated genes in primary human Schwann cells infected with live M. leprae at a MOI of 100:1 for 24 hours.

DESIGN
Dual channel competitive hybridizations between M. leprae infected and non infected Schwann cells including 3 independent biological replicates and a technical replicate in the form of dye swap.
