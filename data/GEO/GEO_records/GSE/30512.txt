TITLE
miRNA signatures of multiple endothelial cell types grown in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment explored what miRNA differences and similarities exist between endothelial cells obtained from different vascular beds.

DESIGN
Seven different endothelial cell (EC) types were grown in basal conditions.  RNA was harvested when cells were nearly confluent. miRNAs were evaluated for each EC type in biological replicates.
