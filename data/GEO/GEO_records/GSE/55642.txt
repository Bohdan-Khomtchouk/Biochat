TITLE
Existence of conventional dendritic cells in Gallus gallus revealed by comparative gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The existence of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) has not yet been demonstrated outside mammals. In this paper, we identified bona fide cDCs in chicken spleen. Comparative profiling of global and of immune response gene expression, morphology, and T cell activation properties show that cDCs and macrophages (MPs) exist as distinct mononuclear phagocytes in chicken, resembling their human and mouse cell counterparts. Using computational analysis, core gene expression signatures for cDCs, MPs, T and B cells across chicken, human and mouse were established, which will facilitate the identification of these subsets in other vertebrates. Overall this study, by extending the newly uncovered cDC and MP paradigm to chicken, suggests that the generation of these two phagocyte lineages occurred before the reptile to mammal and bird transition in evolution. It opens avenues for the design of new vaccines and neutraceuticals that are mandatory for the sustained supply of poultry products in the expanding human population.

DESIGN
Four independent replicates of RNA from 4 cellular populations have been purified  from histocompatible chicken spleens, based on surface markers and fluorecence cell sorting: putative conventional Dendritic cells  (F2+, MHC-II+ cells) ;  control B cells (BU-1+ cells; only 3 replicates  could be included in the study);  T cells  (CD3+ cells) and macrophage spleen population (MHC-II+, KUL-01+ cells).
