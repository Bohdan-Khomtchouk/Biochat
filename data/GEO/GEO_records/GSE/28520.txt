TITLE
Expression data from BMDCs treated with BI2536 or vehicle control and stimulated with LPS or poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Polo-like kinase inhibition with BI 2536 compound in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with Toll-like receptor agonists LPS and poly(I:C).

DESIGN
CD11c+ BMDCs were treated for 1 hour with BI 2536 (1ÂµM) or vehicle control (DMSO) prior to stimulation with LPS or poly(I:C) for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
