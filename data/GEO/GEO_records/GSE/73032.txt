TITLE
Transcriptomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae NCCP11945

SUMMARY
The overall goals and objectives of this study are to investigate the transcriptomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae using RNA-seq. This work will look at gene expression, start points of transcription, transcriptional termination, and differences between these in different conditions and between strains and growing cultures over time.

DESIGN
The starting baseline for this study is Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain NCCP11945, minimally passaged since it was genome sequenced, grown at 37C in 5% CO2. All other experiments would be based off of this, both in terms of number of samples and replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL20920 Ion Torrent PGM (Neisseria gonorrhoeae NCCP11945)
