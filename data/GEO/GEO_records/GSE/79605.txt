TITLE
Search for a novel therapeutic target in myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antibody-based therapy for cancer is now one of the most successful and important strategies for treating patients with hematological malignancies. However, the lack of efficient tumor-associated antigens restricts the targeting therapy of myeloid leukemia. Analysis of the gene expression proﬁles of primary bone marrow samples from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients or healthy donors was to identify and expand novel targets for the treatment of myeloid leukemias. we found that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is overexpressed in patients with AML.

DESIGN
we analyzed the gene expression proﬁles of bone marrow mononuclear cells from 2 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 2 healthy donors using an oligonucleotide microarray, to identify up-regulated genes in AML samples comparing with healthy tissues.
