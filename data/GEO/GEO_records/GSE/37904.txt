TITLE
Expression profiling of palatal shelves in Tbx1 mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the influence of Tbx1 on gene expression profile within the developing palate we performed a microarray screen using RNA isolated from dissected secondary palate shelves of E13.5 wild type, Tbx1+/- and Tbx1-/- mice. Significant differences were identified between genotypes, with a total of 67 genes demonstrating at least a 2-fold change (p < 0.05) in expression. These were clustered into 5 groups, including those downregulated in mutant compared to wild type and heterozygote (n=36); those progressively downregulated from wild type to mutant (n=12); those upregulated in heterozygote and downregulated in mutant compared to wild type (n=2); those progressively upregulated from wild type to mutant (n=12) and those downregulated in heterozygote and upregulated in mutant compared to wild type (n=5). High-throughput real time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed a total of 18 genes significantly changed between wild type and mutant and 24 between heterozygote and mutant. Amongst these, 15 were present in both groups and all except 1 were downregulated in the mutant. There were no significant differences in gene expression between wild type and heterozygous palatal shelves.

DESIGN
Secondary palatal shelf pairs were carefully microdissected from E13.5 Tbx1+/+; Tbx1+/- and Tbx1-/- embryos (3 embryos per genotype as biological replicates). RNA was extracted from each pooled shelf pair generating nine RNA samples in total, each one analysed using a single microarray.
