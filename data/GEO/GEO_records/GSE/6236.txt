TITLE
The human reticulocyte transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA from circulating blood reticulocytes was utilized to provide a robust description of genes transcribed at the final stages of erythroblast maturation. After depletion of leukocytes and platelets, Affymetrix HG-U133 arrays were hybridized with probe from total RNA isolated from blood sampled from 14 umbilical cords and 14 healthy adult humans. Keywords: Adult vs. fetal reticulocyte transcriptome comparison

DESIGN
Peripheral blood from 14 normal adult and 14 human umbilical cord were purified to obtain packed red blood cells and their purity was assessed by CELL-DYN4000. The contaminated WBC count was less than 1 out of 1 million cells. Total RNA from purified reticulocytes included in the purified red blood cells was extracted, labeled, and hybridized onto Affymetrix HG-U133 A and B arrays.
