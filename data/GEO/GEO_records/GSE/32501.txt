TITLE
Overexpression of four and a half LIM domains protein 2 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like phenotype in fish pre-osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) is a co-regulator of gene transcription relevant for many signalling pathways and physiological processes. In this work, the role of FHL2 in cell differentiation has been investigated during in vitro mineralization using a Sparus aurata pre-osteoblast cell line (VSa16, [1]). A global microarray analysis was then performed to characterize the molecular pathways affected by FHL2 overexpression.  [1] Pombinho, A.R., Laizé, V., Molha, D.M., Marques, S.M.P. and Cancela, M.L.

DESIGN
Sparus aurata oligo-DNA microarray (GPL6467) was used to compare gene expression profiles between Control (WT) and FHL2-transfected (F2) VSa16 cell lines. Gene expression profiles of both WT and F2 cells were assessed either at T0 (initial confluent cultures) or T4 (4 weeks of cell confluency). Four (4) pools of cells were taken from both WT and F2 groups at each time point and stored in RNA later at -20°C until RNA extraction.
