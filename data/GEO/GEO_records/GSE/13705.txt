TITLE
The effects of dietary curcumin on colonic gene expression in TNBS-induced colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound capable of preventing chemically induced colitis in mice. We used microarray analysis to detail the global programme of colonic gene expression in BALB/c mice fed standard or 2% curcumin-supplemented diet and treated with control or TNBS (trnitrobenzene-sulfonic acid, 2 mg/mouse) enema. Keywords: Diet and disease effect.

DESIGN
6-8 week old BALB/c mice were treated with respecive diet two days prior to enema administration (day 0) and sacrificed on day 7. Whole colon was dissected from  mice and their wild-type littermates and total RNA isolated for microarray analysis using Affymetrix murine MOE430 mouse array set. RNA was pooled from 3 mice in each dietary/treatment group.
