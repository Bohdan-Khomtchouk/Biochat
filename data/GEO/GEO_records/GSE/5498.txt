TITLE
Toxicogenomic response to chlorination includes induction of major virulence genes in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to hypochlorite, which involved initial growth inhibition and subsequent partial recovery. Keywords: Time course
