TITLE
Genome-wide map of long non-coding RNA steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) and its associated RNA heliase p68 in human pluripotent stem cells NTERA2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) of SRA and ChIP of p68 following by high-throughput sequencing in NTERA2 cell line. We find that SRA localizes with p68 genome-wide at genes whose function is involved in embryonic development.

DESIGN
SRA ChIRP and p68 ChIP of triplicate samples.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
