TITLE
Expression data from mouse ES cells after control RNAi (scramble siRNAs) or RNAi specific for Kdm6a treatment.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To address the functional role of KDM6A in the regulation of Rhox genes, male and female mouse ES cells were transfected with a mixture of three small interfering RNA duplexes, each of which targets a different region of Kdm6a mRNA. We found that Kdm6a knockdown in mouse ES cells caused a decrease in expression of a subset of Rhox genes, Rhox6 and 9. Furthermore, Rhox6 and 9 expression was decreased in female ES cells but not male ES cells indicating that KDM6A regulates Rhox gene expression in a sexually dimorphic manner.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells were treated by Invitrogen scramble siRNA duplexes or specific siRNA duplexes and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four RNA samples from two independent double-RNAi treatments and two single-RNAi treatment in undifferentiated female ES cells PGK12.1, and RNA samples from two single-RNAi treatments in undifferentiated male ES cells WD44 were assayed for expression changes by arrays.
