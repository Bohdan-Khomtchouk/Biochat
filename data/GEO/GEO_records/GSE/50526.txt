TITLE
Responses of Arabidopsis immune signaling mutants to Alternaria brassicicola infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A major part of plant immune response is mediated by signaling pathways controlled by three hormnes,  jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. The involvement of each of these hormone signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated in response to infection of a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, A. brassicicola. Arabideopsis mutants deficient in these hormone signaling pathways were compared to wild type.

DESIGN
Expression profiles were obtained from leaves of wild-type (Col-0), dde2-2, ein2-1, and sid2-2 plants at 9 and 24 hours after A. brassicicola inoculation. In addition, expression profiles were obtained from wild-type at 9 and 24 hours after mock inoculation. The replicates were made from three independent experiments (i.e., biological replicates). Please note that 'Col-0 at 24 hpi with A. brassicicola, biological rep 3' was excluded from data processing because the data did not pass a QC based on affyPML of Bioconducter.
