TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals heterogeneity within human pre-cDCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we use a microfluidics-based approach to prepare single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from 164 primary human conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) as well as cord blood (452) and blood (341) pre-cDCs. We examined heterogeneity between individual cells to document potential subpopulations within human cDCs and pre-cDCs.

DESIGN
RNA seq libraries from 957 single cells were prepared using the SMART-Seq 2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013) 341 Blood pre-cDC (Blood pre-cDC_S* data columns in the expMatrix.txt) 452 CB pre-cDC (CB pre-cDC_S* data columns in the expMatrix.txt) 87 CD141+ cDC (blood_bdca3_S* data columns in the expMatrix.txt) 77 CD1c+ cDC (blood_bdca1_S* data columns in the expMatrix.txt)
