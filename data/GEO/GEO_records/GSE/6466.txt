TITLE
Gene expression profiles of P1 and adult bladders isolated from SMGA (Actg2) transgenic mice. (GUDMAP Series ID: 11)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of the adult and postnatal day 1 bladder. Keywords: Gene expression comparison between postnatal day 1 and adult bladders

DESIGN
Bladders, from postnatal day 1 and adult transgenic mice in which EGFP is driven by a SMGA promoter/EGFP, were isolated by dissection and total RNA was extracted and underwent 2-round amplification (EpicentreÂ® Biotechnologies) for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix MOE430 microarray chip
