TITLE
Epigenetic and genetic influences on DNA methylation variation in maize populations

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that is frequently associated with epigenetic regulation in plants and mammals.  However, other genetic changes such as transposon insertions also can lead to changes in DNA methylation levels.  Genome-wide profiles of DNA methylation levels for 20 maize inbreds were used to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs).  The methylation level for each of these DMRs was also assayed in 31 additional maize genotypes resulting in the discovery of 1,966 common DMRs and 1,754 rare DMRs.  Analysis of recombinant inbred lines provides evidence that the majority of DMRs are heritable.  A local association scan found that nearly half of the DMRs with common variation are significantly associated with SNPs found within or near the DMR. Many of the DMRs that are significantly associated with local genetic variation are found near transposable elements that may contribute to the DNA methylation variation. The analysis of gene expression in the same samples used for DNA methylation profiling identifies over 300 genes with expression patterns that are significantly associated with the DNA methylation variation among genotypes.  Collectively, our results suggest that DNA methylation variation is influenced by genetic and epigenetic variation is often stably inherited and can influence expression level of genes in the population.

DESIGN
Methylation profiles in seedling tissue of a panel of 51 maize inbred lines using a custom 2.1M or 1.4M feature NimbleGen array. Methylation profiles in seedling tissue of maize inbred lines, teosinte and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from B73 and Mo17 using a custom 12x270K NimbleGen array. Inbred lines B73 and Mo17 each had 3 biological replicates, the other sample had 1 replicate.
