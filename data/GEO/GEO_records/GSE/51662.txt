TITLE
Distinct small RNA populations act antagonistically in formation of heterosis

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
This research reports the analysis of sRNAs in 14 and 7 inbred lines from a breeding population. We analyzed the contribution of sRNAs to the formation of heterosis via integrative association analysis with field data of 98 hybrids generated from the set of inbred lines. Our results indicate a contribution of sRNAs to heterosis. We were able to identify different sets of sRNAs associated with heterosis with distinct length and genome distribution patterns.

DESIGN
Analysis of sRNA contribution to the formation of heterosis in maize by an association study in a breeding population.
