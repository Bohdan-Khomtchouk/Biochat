TITLE
Gene expression determination in breast muscle associated with the phenotypic expression of feed efficiency (FE) in a single male broiler line

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Gene expression determination between breast muscle associated with the phenotypic expression of feed efficiency (FE) in a single male broiler line. Goal was to determine the changes of gene expression by feed efficiency (FE).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, high feed efficiency vs. low feed efficiency. Biological replicates: breast muscles from 4 high feed efficiency male broiler, breast muscles from 4 low feed efficiency male broiler

PLATFORM
GPL8764 Agilent-015068 Chicken Gene Expression Microarray 4x44k (Feature Number version)
