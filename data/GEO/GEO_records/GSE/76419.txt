TITLE
Dino-dependent gene expression signature in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetically modified Dino mice were generated with loxP sites flanking the mouse Dino gene. We set out to identify the set of genes regulated by Dino in DNA damaged mouse embryonic fibroblasts using 3' sequencing. Early passage Dino+/+ or Dino loxP/loxP MEFs were treated with 0.2ug/mL doxorubicin prior to addition of Trizol and RNA isolation.

DESIGN
We examined gene expression by 3seq in early passage Dino_+/+ and Dino_lox/lox MEFs treated with 0.2ug/mL doxorubicin or vehicle alone for 8 hours.
