TITLE
MiR-374a Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Metastasis of Breast Cancer (mRNA dataset)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alterations following miR-374a transduction in breast cancer cells. We find a significant elevation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling transcriptional targets.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably transduced with miR-374a precursor or vector control. Two biological replications for each treatment.
