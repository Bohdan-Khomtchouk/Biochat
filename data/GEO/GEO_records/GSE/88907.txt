TITLE
Centromere location in Arabidopsis is unaltered by extreme divergence in CENH3 protein sequence

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the binding profile of A. thaliana CENH3, L. oleraceum CENH3 and Z. mays CENH3 in the genetic background of A. thaliana Col ecotype. The L. oleraceum CENH3 and Z. mays CENH3 ChIP was performed in a cenh3 homozygous mutant background expressing CENH3 homologs as transgenes.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) variants in 3 different A. thaliana genotypes.
