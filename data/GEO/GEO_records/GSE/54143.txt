TITLE
DC-specific lincRNA controls dendritic cell development and function through interacting with STAT3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the functional non-coding RNAs in human DC development, we explored the gene expression profiles during DC development from peripheral monocytes. Using microarray technique, we identified many annotated lncRNAs with markedly altered expressions during human DC differentiation and maturation.

DESIGN
RNA samples from cells during the process of DC development from human peripheral blood monocytes were collected. Each time point sample was the pool of RNA from 3 donors.
