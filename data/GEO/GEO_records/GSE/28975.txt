TITLE
Identification of differential gene expression modulated by knockdown of MUC1 in MKN45 gastric carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcripts upregulated or downregulated by knockdown of MUC1 were identified through expression profiling of a total of 12,135 genes in comparison with MKN45- MUC1 RNAi clones and control clones.

DESIGN
We endeavored to identify genes which expression is affected by MUC1 by performing cDNA microarray analysis on two MKN45 MUC1 RNAi clones and one control clone.
