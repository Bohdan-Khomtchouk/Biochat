TITLE
miRNAs trigger widespread epigenetically-activated siRNAs from transposons in Arabidopsis [PARE-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Utilizing whole-genome Parallele Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE)-seq to analyze the degradome to assess miRNA-binding of transposons in DNA methylation mutants, and RNAi mutants, compared to wildtype.

DESIGN
Genome-wide small RNA profiling was done by Illumina TruSeq sample preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
