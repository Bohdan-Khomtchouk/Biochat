TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing analysis using splenic DCs freshly isolated from Wild Type and TBK1-DKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we analyzed the gene expression profile of WT and TBK1-deficient splenic DCs by RNA sequencing based on three independent samples. The results revealed significant alterations in the expression of a number of genes, most notably the enhanced expression of a large subset of IFN-responsive genes in the TBK1-deficient DCs.

DESIGN
Fresh splenic DC mRNA profiles of 8-week old wild type (WT) and TBK1-DKO mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate
