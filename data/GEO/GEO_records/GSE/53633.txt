SUMMARY
Identification of the determinants of PDGFRA activity in PTCL/NOS (Peripheral T-cell lymphoma/not otherwise specified) and to elucidate the biological consequences of its activation.

DESIGN
We generated GEP from samples of primary PTCL/NOS cells treated or not with imatinib mesylate (see below) as well as from EOL1 cells (3 samples each)
