TITLE
Spatiotemporal- and sex-specific Dynamics of lncRNA expression links to brain development and aging in Rhesus Macaque (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Dynamic remodeling in architecture and function of mammalian brain, especially in primate, rely on a precisely orchestrated molecular and cellular regulation at distinct levels. Here, we applied comprehensive RNA-seq and CAGE-Seq analysis to characterize dynamics of lncRNA expression in Rhesus macaque brain across postnatal development and aging. We identified 18 anatomically diverse lncRNA modules and 14 mRNA modules representing spatial, age and sex specificities respectively. Highly spatiotemporal- and sex-specific dynamic changes in lncRNA but mRNA expression and the negative correlation between lncRNAs and mRNAs, functionally associate with brain development and aging, especially in the neocortex. Together with in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) data, our findings provide an initial insight into spatial-, age- and sex-related dynamics of lncRNA expression during postnatal brain development and aging in macaque, implying that high dynamics of lncRNA expression might represent a previously unappreciated regulatory system in shaping brain architecture and function.

DESIGN
Examination of 8 different brain regions in Rhesus Macaque across the four ages (1-, 4-, 10- and 20-years old).
