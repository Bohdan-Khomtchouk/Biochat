TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of the DTT induced ER-stress response in Plasmodium falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Plasmodium falciparum lacks the homologs of UPR machinery and is unable to upregulate the known targets of UPR. Therefore, we have carried out microarray analysis to identify novel unfolded protein response (UPR) target genes in this parasite.
