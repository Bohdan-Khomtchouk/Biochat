TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of H3K79 methylation in  CD34+ CD19+ cells from normal marrow, MLL-rearranged or MLL-germline ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We created a mouse model where conditional expression of physiologic levels of an Mll-AF4 fusion oncogene induces development of acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemias (AML). ChIP-chip analysis demonstrated increased histone H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) dimethylation that correlated with Mll-AF4 associated gene expression profiles in murine ALLs, and in human MLL-rearranged leukemias. In addition, human MLL-rearranged ALLs can be distinguished from other ALLs by their genome-wide H3K79 methylation profiles. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
DNA immunoprecipitated with anti-dimethyl-H3K79 antibodies from  normal CD34+CD19+ cells, leukemic bone marrow from MLL-rearranged ALL or MLL-germline ALL was hybridized to Affymetrix promoter tiling microarrays.
