[E-MTAB-599] Mouse Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sequencing the transcriptome of DBAxC57BL/6J mice. To study the regulation of transcription, splicing and RNA turnover we have sequenced the transcriptomes of tissues collected DBAxC57BL/6J mice. We strongly encourage researchers to contact us if there is any queries about referencing or publishing analysis based on pre-publication data. This data is part of a pre-publication release. For information on use of the data and the data release policy please see: ArrayExpress Release Date: 2011-04-09 Publication Title: Sequence variation amongst 17 classical and wild-derived mouse genomes and its effect on gene regulation and phenotypic variation.
