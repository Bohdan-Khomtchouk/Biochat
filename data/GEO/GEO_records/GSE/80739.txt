TITLE
Expression data from Myc/Bcl2-transformed primary mouse leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unfavorable patient survival coincides with the lineage plasticity observed in ~20% of human acute leukemias. These cases are assumed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have stable multipotent differentiation potential. However, here we report that plasticity in leukemia can result from instable lineage identity states inherited from differentiating progenitor cells. Using mice with enhanced c-Myc/Bcl2-expression, we show that T-lymphoid progenitors retain broad malignant lineage switching potential with a high capacity to differentiate into myeloid leukemia.

DESIGN
Affymetrix whole genome cDNA expression array data were generated from flow-sorted myeloid (CD11b+Gr1+/CD3–CD4–CD8–) splenocytes of leukemic recipient mice that had received Myc/Bcl2-transformed granulocyte-macrophage-progenitors (GMPs), Lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK, as a population enriched for hematopoietic stem cells) from the bone marrow or CD4/CD8 double negative 2 (DN2) cells from the thymus of C57/Bl6 CD45.2 donor wildtype mice.
