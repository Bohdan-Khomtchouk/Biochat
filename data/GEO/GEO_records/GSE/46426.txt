TITLE
The Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) CREB family transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dynamic gene expression in the PSM of vertebrates is critical for the spatial and temporal patterning of somites. Using microarray analysis, we explored in detail, genes that are differentially regulated upon removal of CREB family function from the mouse PSM.

DESIGN
Mouse PSM from R26R^AC/AC (Control) and R26R^AC/AC;T-Cre (Mutant) were harvested for RNA extraction. Nine PSM's from control and mutant genotypes were combined to generate three biological replicates (three PSM's/replicate). Samples were then applied to microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes between controls and mutants.
