TITLE
DNA microarray analysis following gefinitib/luteolin administration to PC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further investigate the molecular mechanism of cell death induction by luteolin and/or gefitinib, we performed DNA microarray analysis, which may reveal the change of gene expression pattern following treatment with these chemicals. We examined PC-3 cells after 24h of treatment with 60μM luteolin and/or 60μM gefitinib because subG1 population has not appeared yet at this timing, which helps to avoid the secondary effects of apoptosis on the alteration of the gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
PC-3 cells were treated for 24h with DMSO, 60μM luteolin (Lut), 60μM gefitinib (Gef) or their co-administration (Lut+Gef). To calculate the fold change, we compared the hybridization signal intensity between time zero (before addition of any reagents to PC-3 cells) and 24h after addition of DMSO, luteolin, gefitinib and luteolin+gefitinib. Each sample was run in duplicate.
