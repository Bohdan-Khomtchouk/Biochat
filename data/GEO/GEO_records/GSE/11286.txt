TITLE
Cardiac and pulmonary responses to diesel engine particulate in Apo E(-/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice deficient in Apolipoprotein E (Apoe E(-/-)) vs wild type mice were exposed to diesel engine particulate by single dose intratracheal instillation.  The transcript-level response of the hearts after 24h  and of the  lungs after 24 h and 5 days were subsequently analyzed by the 2-color microarray method. Keywords: stress response, disease state analysis
