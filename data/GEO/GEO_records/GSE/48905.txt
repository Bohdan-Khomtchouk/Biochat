SUMMARY
The NEWEST (Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Women with  Estrogen-Sensitive Tumours) trial compared the clinical and biological  activity of fulvestrant 500 mg vs 250 mg in the neoadjuvant setting.  In this multi-centre phase II study, post-menopausal women with  operable, locally advanced (T2, 3, 4b; N0-3; M0) ER-positive breast  tumours were randomised to receive neoadjuvant treatment with either  dose of fulvestrant for 16 weeks before surgery. Tumour core biopsies  were obtained at baseline, 4 weeks and at surgery for assessment of  changes in biomarker expression.  Tumour volumes were measured by 3-D  ultrasound at the same timepoints.  In this trial, the percentage of  patients who showed a reduction in tumour volume or stabilisation of  disease (using RECIST criteria) after treatment with fulvestrant 500  mg was 36% (26 out of 69 patients).  Therefore, within a population of  endocrine-therapy naive patients whose tumours were confirmed as being  ER-positive at the time of study entry, there is a subgroup who gained  particular clinical benefit from fulvestrant treatment.  These  clinical response data together with the availability of biological  response information and frozen tumour tissue from participants makes  the NEWEST trial an attractive setting in which to investigate the  potential of new markers of response to fulvestrant.
