TITLE
Gene expression in the isolated islets of 10 day old, 4 wk old, 12 wk old, and 20 wk old Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice compared to healthy age matched control NOD.B10 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the islets of diseased NOD mice compared to congenic healthy NOD.B10 mice at various ages, during the progression of NOD disease.

DESIGN
Islets were isolated from individual NOD and NOD.B10 mice by collagenase digestion. RNA was extracted using Trizol, combined with the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Pico Reagent Kit (Agilent). Microarrays were performed using the Whole Mouse Genome Microarray Kit, 4Ã—44K 2-color arrays (Agilent Technologies).

PLATFORM
