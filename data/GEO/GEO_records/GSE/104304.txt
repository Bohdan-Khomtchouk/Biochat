TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in control and ChRO1 depleted C2C12 (Myoblasts and Myotubes)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The novel lncRNA ChRO1 (Chromatin ReOrganization associated lncRNA 1) which we discovered seems to be involved in myogenesis by association with heterochromatin reorganization during muscle differentiation. We wanted to identify which genes are influenced by ChRO1 depletion in muscle differentiation. Analysis of the function of ChRO1 during myogenesis in gene expression level. The hypothesis in present study was that ChRO1 promotes myogenesis. Results provide important information that ChRO1 is involved in expression of various myogenic genes.

DESIGN
mRNA obtained from wild-type myoblasts and myotubes (Scr_MB,Scr_MT), and ChRO1 depleted myoblasts and myotubes (sh#1_MB,sh#1_MT)
