TITLE
Androgen receptor DNA binding in response to different ligands across three prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed AR ChIP-seq in LNCaP-AR, VCaP and CWR22PC cells in the presence of vehicle, androgen, or androgen plus antiandrogen. These three cell lines showed variable sensitivity to these drugs.

DESIGN
To determine the effects of AR agonist (R1881 vs DHT) and antagonists (Bicalutamide vs MDV3100) on the AR cistrome across a panel of prostate cancer cell lines.
