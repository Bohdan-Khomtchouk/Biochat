TITLE
Expression data from control and mutant TIFIACaMKCreERT2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We inhibited RNA polymerase I by genetic ablation of the basal transcription factor TIF-IA in adult hippocampal neurons. Nucleolar stress resulted in progressive neurodegeneration, although with a differential vulnerability within the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus. Here, we investigate the consequences of nucleolar stress on learning and memory. The mutant mice do not show any impairment in the behavioral memory tests, suggesting the activation of adaptive mechanisms. In fact, we observe a significantly enhanced learning and re-learning corresponding to the initial inhibition of rRNA transcription and accompanied by aberrant synaptic plasticity.

DESIGN
To explore the putative molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptative changes we profiled global gene expression of control and TIFIACaMKCreERT2 mutant mice (5-6 mice/genotype) 4 weeks after induction of the mutation (injection of tamoxifen).
