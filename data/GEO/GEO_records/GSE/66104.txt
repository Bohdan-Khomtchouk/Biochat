TITLE
Transcriptomes of mesonephros- vs. ovary-derivd Gli1+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This goal of this microarray analysis is to determine whether the mesonephros-derived theca cells exhibt a different gene expression profile from that of the whole theca cell population

DESIGN
The mesonephros-derived (n=3, Tamoxifen at E12.5, E14.5 and E16.5) and the neonatal ovary-derived Gli1-positive cells (n=3 Tamoxifen at P1-3 via lactating dams), were isolated from the adult ovaries of Gli1-CreERT2; Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice at 2 months of age and were sorted by FACS
