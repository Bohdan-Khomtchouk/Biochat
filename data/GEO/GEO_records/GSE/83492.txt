TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of human lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lung epithelial subpopulations (alveolar type 2, basal and airway luminal cells) freshly dissociated from human lung were isolated by FACS. RNA-seq gene expression profiling was used to determine gene signature from each population.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from the small airway (SA) and large airway (LA) of 3 human lungs
