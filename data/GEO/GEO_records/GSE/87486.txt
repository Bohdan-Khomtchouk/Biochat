TITLE
Expression data from chick embryo olfactory placodes during initial period of GnRH neuronal production

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) generation and delamination from the olfactory placode.

DESIGN
Olfactory placodes were dissected from chick embryos at HH stages 16, 18 and 20.
