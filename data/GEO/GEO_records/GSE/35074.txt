TITLE
SNAI1 induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition miRNA study in time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs participating in SNAI1-orchestrated regulatory pathways, we analysed time-resolved microarray data of SNAI1-induced EMT, obtained during conditional expression of SNAI1 in a “Tet-Off” MCF7-SNAI1 breast carcinoma cell model (Vetter et al, 2009).

DESIGN
miRNA time series study for 7 times points (4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h) in 3 replicates. For each time point, we compared induced and non-induced samples. Overall, we have 42 samples (21 hybridizations).
