TITLE
Expression data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblast, pluripotent genes are up-regulated. Once iPSCs are successfully reprogrammed, the global gene profiles of iPSCs are comparable to mouse ESC. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in iPSCs, mESCs, MEFs.

DESIGN
We picked four clones of iPSCs, three clones of mESCs, and one mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) primary culture cells for microarrays.
