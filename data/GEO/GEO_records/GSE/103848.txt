TITLE
Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1: exponential phase control vs. 24 hours starvation vs. 24 hours recovery after starvation

ORGANISM
Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of marine ammonia oxidizing archaea Nitrosopumilus maritimus cells comparing exponential phase control cells with cells under 24 hours starvation and with cells under recovery after 24 hours starvation.  Goal was to determine the effects of global transcriptional responses of N. maritimus cells under ammonia starvation and recovery conditions.

DESIGN
three-condition experiment, AS24 vs. ML cells & AR 24 vs. AS24. Biological replicates: 3 exponential control replicates, 3 AS24 replicates and 2 AR24 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL24013 Custom Nimblegen Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 Array (090209_N_maritimus_SCM1_expr)
