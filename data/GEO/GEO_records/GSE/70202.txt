TITLE
Transcriptomic impact of AWR5 effector expression in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The type III effector (T3E) AWR5 from the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum causes disease in many plants relevant in agriculture. Heterologous expression in yeast of AWR5 from an integrated tetO promoter caused strong growth inhibition. In this series of experiments we investigate the possible changes in the transcriptional profile in a time-course (2, 4 and 6 h) response to AWR5 production.

DESIGN
Yeast strains were grown overnight in rich YPD medium with doxycycline 15 Âµg/ml (repressing conditions), then normalized to OD600=0.05 and grown resumed in YPD+dox (non-inducing conditions) or YPD (inducing conditions). Samples were taken at  2, 4 or 6 hours for each condition. Two biological replicates were made for each time point.
