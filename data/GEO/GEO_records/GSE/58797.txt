TITLE
H2A.Z knockdown RNAseq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment seeks to ascertain the transcriptional changes in the adult mouse hippocampus (CA1 subregion) that occur following viral knockdown of the histone variant H2A.Z. We are especially interested in understanding the role of this histone variant in memory formation and memory maintenance in the adult central nervous system.

DESIGN
This experiment includes 3 groups, each with 3 biological replicates. Samples S108, S109, and S110 are from controls infected with an AAV expressing a scrambled shRNA control. Samples A100, A101, A102, A104, A106, and A107 were infected with an AAV expressing an shRNA against H2A.Z. Samples A100, A101, and A102 were naive animals, whereas samples A104, A106, and A107 were trained in contextual fear conditioning.
