TITLE
Gene expression profiling after stimulation of THP-1 cells with a2NTD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background:  Identifying the immune components that are regulated by a2NTD, a peptide cleaved from the N-terminus of the a2 vacuolar ATPase. Methods:  In this study, we used pathway-focused PCR arrays to determine the genes that are regulated in human monocytic cell line, THP-1 after a2NTD stimulation over time. Results:  a2NTD up-regulated several cytokines including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10.  Several chemokines were also upregulated including the MCP and MIP families. Conclusion:  We believe a2NTD to be an immune modulator made by tumor cells that aid in preventing immune surveillance by up-regulating proteins in monocytes that are both pro-and anti-inflammatory in nature.

DESIGN
The Human Inflammatory Response and Autoimmunity RT² Profiler™ PCR Array profiles the expression of 84 key genes involved in autoimmune and inflammatory immune responses. It represents the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as their receptors. It also contains genes related to the metabolism of cytokines and involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Thoroughly researched panels of genes involved in the acute-phase response, inflammatory response, and humoral immune responses are represented as well. Using real-time PCR, you can easily and reliably analyze expression of a focused panel of genes related to inflammatory and autoimmune responses with this array.
