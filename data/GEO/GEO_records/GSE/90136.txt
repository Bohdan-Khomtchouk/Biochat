TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Cdc73 deletion in AML cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Polymerase Associated Factor (PAFc) complex is an epigenetic regulating complex that has been shown to to be important for Acute Myeloid Leukemias harboring an MLL chromosomal translocations, such as MLL-AF9 leukemias. This study describes the transcriptomic profiling of AML cells following genetic deletion of the PAFc subunit Cdc73.

DESIGN
Cdc73floxed cells were transformed to an AML using MLL-AF9 oncogene transduction. The cells were also transduced with a 4OHT inducible CreER. The cells were then treated for 24 or 48 hours with 4OHT to induce genetic excision of Cdc73 and polyA mRNA was isolated for sequencing of the transcriptome. Biological duplicates are labelled _1 and _2.
