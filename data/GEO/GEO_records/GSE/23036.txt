TITLE
Gene expression signatures and molecular markers associated with clinical outcome in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of our study was to identify expression signatures and molecular markers associated with tumor recurrence and survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We studied the expression profile of 63 pre-treatment tumor biopsies obtained from locally advanced HNSCCs treated with standard treatments. Cluster analysis identified three tumor subtypes associated with significant differences in local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tumor subtype 1, associated with short LRFS, PFS and OS, showed features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and undifferentiation. It also overexpressed genes involved in cell adhesion, NF-ÎºB and integrin signalling. Tumor subtype 3, associated with longer LRFS, PFS and OS, showed a high degree of differentiation and overexpressed genes located in chromosomal regions 19q13 and 1q21. Tumor subtype 2, which had a clinical outcome intermediate between subtype 1 and subtype 3, overexpressed genes involved in branching morphogenesis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a subset of genes associated with local recurrence and survival. We validated the association between gene cluster classification and patient survival using two HNSCC data sets obtained from two independent patient cohorts. Finally, using the gene expression profile of the pre-treatment tumor biopsy, we generated a gene expression signature that could predict survival in locally advanced patients.

DESIGN
Sixty three pretreatment HNSCC biopsies and five normal mucosas were assayed using the Affymetrix HG-U133A2.0 array.
