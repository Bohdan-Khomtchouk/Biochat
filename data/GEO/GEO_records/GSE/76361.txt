TITLE
Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid - enriched high fat diet delays skeletal muscle degradation in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effects of EPA/DHA enriched high fat diets (HFD) compared to HFD-Corn oil after 8 weeks intervention on age/obesity induced skeletal muscle degradation. Results provides novel information on the signalling pathways regulated by EPA and DHA enriched HFD in delaying the onset of muscle degradation in C57Bl/6J mice compared with HFD-Corn oil.

DESIGN
Four mice representing each diet group on the basis of body weight, plasma triglyceride and plasma cholesterol levels were selected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis. Total RNA from skeletal muscle of these selected animals was purified using the RNeasyÂ® Plus Universal Mini kit (Qiagen Nordic, Sollentuna, Sweden) by following the manufacturer?s instruction carefully. The extracted RNA was quantified by NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and the quality of the RNA was estimated by RNA 6000 Nano LabChip for Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).
