TITLE
Use of QC Array for Ethnicity Assignments (along with HPV L1-Amplicon Sequencing)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to provide ethnicity information to compare to HPV types (and confirm patient-to-sample mapping), we processed DNA samples with the QC Array in addition to sequencing L1-Amplicons

DESIGN
Three different archive types were collected for HPA L1-Typing (archived DNA, frozen tissue, and FFPE tissue).  Two of these sample types were processed with the QC array (archived DNA and frozen tissue).  In terms of making ethnicity assignments, there is no reported race information for the archived DNA samples, but that information was available for frozen tissue samples (although neither sample type had ethnicity information to distinguish Hispanic individuals).
