TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in mouse subcutaneous adipose tissue in cold compared to thermal neutrality

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression pattern of subcutaneous adipose tissue from mice housed in cold (6-degree Celsius) or in thermal neutrality (30-degree celsius).Verify canonical white adipose tissue beiging pathways and genes that are regulated by cold-exposure as well as identify gap junction genes that are regulated by cold in white adipoes tissue.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse subcutaneous tissue from mice house at two different temperature; RNA extracted from 3-4 mice was pooled into one sample.
