TITLE
Natural genetic variation perturbs collaborative transcription factor binding required for enhancer selection and function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Natural genetic variation between two mouse strains was used as a natural mutagenesis screen to test various aspects of the proposed model for enhancer selection and function.

DESIGN
Chromatin marks H3K4me2, H3K27Ac, and transcription factors PU.1, C/EBPa, and p65 were assessed by ChIP-Seq and GRO-Seq and RNA-Seq were used to measure gene expression in C57BL6/J and BALBc/J inbred mouse strains

PLATFORM
