TITLE
Gene expression of anti-TNF induced macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anti-TNF induced macrophages from MLR (6) were compared to IFNγ (6), IL-4 (6) and IL-10 (6) polarized macrophage subsets.

DESIGN
PBMC from healthy volunteers were co-cultured in a 1:1 ratio to create a MLR. Anti-TNF (infliximab) was added on day 2 and CD14+ macrophages were isolated on day 7. Monocytes from the same donors were isolated from PBMC on day 0 using Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were then polarized with IFN-γ, IL-4 or IL-10 for 7 days.
