TITLE
miRNA expression profile in intestinal ischemia reperfusion of adult mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) contributes to tissue damage, cellular apoptosis, systemic inflammatory responses, and even multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, however, underlying mechanisms remain unkown. In this report, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the expression of 1177 miRNAs on intestine tissues from mice suffering from sham and intestinal I/R. We find that 57 miRNA are up-regulated and 74 are down-regulated significantly. MiRNAs may be integral modulators of intestinal inflammation and enterocyte apoptosis associated with I/R and represent novel targets for future therapeutics.
