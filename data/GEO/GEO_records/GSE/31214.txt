TITLE
Ecological transcriptomics of lake-type and riverine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) muscle tissue

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus nerka

SUMMARY
We sampled lake-type and riverine sockeye in the pristine natural habitats of Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, Alaska USA.

DESIGN
Samples were taken on the same day and close proximite in time. We sampled 17 riverine individuals from Albert Johnson Creek and 13 individuals from Surprise Lake. cDNA from a single individual on the Cy5 was compared with a reference of aRNA on the Cy3.
