TITLE
Histone methylation and transcription factor binding during intestinal cell differentation

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell differentiation requires epigenetic modulation of tissue-specific genes and activities of master transcriptional regulators, which are recognized for their dominant control over cellular programs. Using novel epigenomic methods, we characterized enhancer elements specifically modified in differentiating intestinal epithelial cells and found enrichment of transcription factor-binding motifs corresponding to CDX2, a master regulator of the intestine. Directed investigation revealed surprising lability in CDX2 occupancy of the genome, with redistribution from hundreds of sites occupied only in progenitors to thousands of new sites in mature cells. Knockout mice confirmed distinct Cdx2 requirements in dividing and differentiated adult intestinal cells, including responsibility for the active enhancer configuration associated with maturity. Dynamic CDX2 occupancy corresponds with condition-specific gene expression and, importantly, to differential co-occupancy with other tissue-restricted transcription factors: HNF4A in mature cells and GATA6 in progenitors. These results reveal dynamic, context-specific functions and mechanisms of a master transcription factor within a cell lineage.
