TITLE
Analysis of differences in the transcriptome of WAT from Wildtype and 14-3-3zeta knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Due to inherent differences in adipcoyte size between wildtype and knockout animals, we sought to examine if the decrease in adipocyte size was due to differences in the transcriptome and more specifcially, adipogenic genes.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome in wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) gonadal white adipose tissue from adult mice

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
