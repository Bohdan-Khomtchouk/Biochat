TITLE
Dynamic regulation of chromatin signatures during Drosophila embryonic glial differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Employ affinity purification approach to capture different stages of glial-specific information on gene expression, nucleosome occupancy and histone modifications (HMs) in Drosophila melanogaster embryo

DESIGN
Cell type-specific nucleosome and histone modification maps were generated from GBs and glias nuclei, which isolated from 5–7h-old gcm-Gal4,UAS-mCDGFP/cyo;UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap and 12–14h-old repo-Gal4,UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap/Tm3B D. melanogaster embryos by the method INTACT (Steinner et al., 2012). We determinated nucleosome occupancy in these nuclei by micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-Seq). We also performed ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing) for five histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K4me1,H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3). Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 using signle end protocol.
