TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression during osteogenic and myogenic differentiation from adipose- derived stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the current study, we have performed a gene expression analysis of well characterized and defined populations of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) before and after in vitro induction of osteogenic and myogenic differentiation that allows identifying DNA methylation- regulated differentiation genes. We have also address the extent of the epigenetic programming of hASCs- derived differentiated cells by comparing the expression profiling of these cells with their somatic counterparts from primary tissues. Finally, we also compared the patterns of expression of hASCs (and their derivatives)

DESIGN
Identify all genes or probe-sets whose expression was significantly different between control hASCs and each one of the two differentiated cell types (DIF.M and DIF.O),
