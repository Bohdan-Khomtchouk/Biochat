TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of supressing miR-34a on urothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-34a appears to be protective against cancer. Blocking miR-34a results in pro-tumorigenic phenotypic changes. The purpose of this experiment was to identify gene expression changes that could potentially explain the  pro-tumorigenic effects of anti-miR 34a transfection.

DESIGN
Transfected cells with anti-miR 34a versus negative control construct

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
