TITLE
Definition of global transcriptional variation in wild type Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and its phosphorothioate modification (PT) deficient mutant by RNA-seq analysis

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
To determine whether PT modifications are involved in the epigenetic control of specific genes, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to define global transcriptional changes in early log-phase cultures of wild-type pf0-1 and the PT modifacation related genes(dndBCDE) deletion mutant TT-5. Compared with wild-type pf0-1, a total of ten genes in TT-5 exhibited differential expression of greater than 2-fold (log2-ratio > 1 or < -1, p-value < 0.05, FDRâ‰¤0.001), including 6 up-regulated genes and 4 down-regulated genes (Table 1). Compared with pf0-1, the most significantly downregulated genes were dndBCDE themselves due to the in-frame deletion in TT-5. Of the 6 up-regulated genes, two are phage-related proteins (Pfl01_1169 and Pfl01_3496); the rest are genes encoding a putative membrane protein (Pfl01_0900), xanthine dehydrogenase (Pfl01_1797), N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (Pfl01_5657) and a hypothetical protein (Pfl01_2488). The transcription levels of the differentially expressed genes varied to different degrees and the genes belong to different COG groups.
