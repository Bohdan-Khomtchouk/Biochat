TITLE
Genome-wide maps of PARP-1-bound nucleosomes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PARP-1 binds to specific nucleosomes to regulate gene activity. While PARP-1's role in transcription inititaion is known, a surprising finding here was that PARP-1 is highly enriched at exon-intron and intron-exon boundaries, sort of demarcting exons. This indicating a role in alternative splicing.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of PARP1-bound nucleosomes as well as MNase-seq of total nucleosome in Drosophila S2 cells

PLATFORM
GPL14601 AB SOLiD 4 System (Drosophila melanogaster)
