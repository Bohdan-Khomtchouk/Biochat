TITLE
Measuring cell-type specific differential methylation in human brain tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation of NeuN+ and NeuN- fractions in three brain regions using comprehensive high throughput arrays for relative methylation (CHARM).

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from cell-sorted post-mortem brains using NeuN antibody and hybridized to Nimblegen microarrays (091020_HG19_CHARM_HX1 arrays).

PLATFORM
GPL13611 NimbleGen Human 2.0M array [091020_HG19_CHARM_HX1]
