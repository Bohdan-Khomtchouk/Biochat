TITLE
Disease Model of GATA4 Mutation Reveals Transcription Factor Cooperativity in Human Cardiogenesis [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heterozygous mutations in GATA4 cause congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy through unknown mechanisms. To gain insights into the open chromatin status during human cardiac development due to GATA4 heterozygosity, we performed ATAC-seq of  wildtype and GATA4-G296S diseased cardiac progenitors.

DESIGN
ATAC sequencing of wildtype and diseased pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
