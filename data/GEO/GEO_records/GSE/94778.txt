TITLE
Comparison of extracellular vesicles released from mouse WEHI-231 B cells under isotype or anti-CD24 antibody stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WEHI-231 extracellular vesicles, regardless of stimulation, predominantely contain 5S and  5.8S rRNA. No differentially expressed transcripts were identified, but CD24 induces an overall reduction in protein coding transcripts.

DESIGN
Examination of the RNA in extracellular vesicles released by cells under 2 different stimulations
