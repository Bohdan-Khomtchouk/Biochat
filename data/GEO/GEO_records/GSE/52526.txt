TITLE
An In Vivo Screen Uncovers Repression of Lipoprotein Lipase by MiR-29a as a Mechanism for Lipid Flux Away From the Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We screened for miRNA-regulated genes in adult mouse hepatocytes by a novel AAV8-Ttr-Cre delivery system deleting a floxed Dicer1 and blocking the processing of mature miRNAs. We then used a microarray to analyze the genes at T0 (just before injection), T1 (2 weeks after injection), T2 (4 weeks after injection)

DESIGN
Dicer1 fl/fl male mice on a mixed 129S4 and C57BL/6 background were injected at 8-10 weeks of age with AAV8-Ttr-Cre to delete hepatocyte-specific Dicer1. Liver RNA analyzed at 0, 2 and 4 weeks.
