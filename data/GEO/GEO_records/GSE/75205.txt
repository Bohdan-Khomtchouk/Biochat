TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human colon cancer cell lines stimulated with dsDNA90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of dsDNA90 stimulated human colon cancer cell lines. Genes whose expression that are affected by cytosolic DNA will be identified and compared between normal vs cancer colon epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Human normal or colon cancer cells were transfected with dsDNA90 for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted for array analysis.
