TITLE
KLF15 dependent REV-ERBa binding in the heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By comparing the ChIPseq signal of REV_ERBa in control (Flox) and cardiomyocytic KLF15 knockout (cKO), we identified the KLF15 dependent REV-ERBa binding and repression in the heart. We further compared the differential binding sites to KLF15 binding site, using a FLAG tagged cardiomyocytic transgenic (cTG1) mice.

DESIGN
Examination of REV_ERBa binding in cardiomyocytic KLF15 knockout (cKO) and control (Flox) mice hearts.

PLATFORM
