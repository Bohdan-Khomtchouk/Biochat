SUMMARY
Alkylating agents are a frontline therapy for the treatment of several cancers including pediatric glioblastoma, a devastating lethal tumor in children. Unfortunately, many tumors are resistant to this therapy. We sought to identify ways of sensitizing tumor cells to alkylating agents while leaving normal cells unharmed; increasing therapeutic response while minimizing toxicity. Here we report using a siRNA screen targeting over 240 DNA damage response genes identified novel sensitizers to alkylating agents. In particular the base excision repair (BER) pathway, including 3-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), as well as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) were identified in our screen. Interestingly, we identified MPG as a direct novel substrate of ATM. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of MPG was required for enhanced MPG function. Importantly, combined inhibition or loss of MPG and ATM resulted in increased alkylating agent-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and prolonged survival in vivo. The discovery of the ATM-MPG axis will lead to improved treatment of alkylating agent-resistant tumors.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from snap frozen biopsy and surgical brain tissue from paediatric high grade gliomas Copy number analysis on Affymetrix SNP 250K arrays was performed for 35 paediatric high grade glioma samples and HapMap samples.
