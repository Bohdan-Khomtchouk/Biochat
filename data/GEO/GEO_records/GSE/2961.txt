TITLE
Expression profiling soybean response to P. syringae reveals rapid HR-specific down regulation of photosynthesis genes

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Transcript profiling during susceptible (S) and HR-associated resistance (R) responses was determined in soybean (Glycine max). Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea carrying or lacking the avirulence gene avrB, was infiltrated into cultivar Williams 82. Leaf RNA was sampled at 2, 8, and 24 hours post inoculation (hpi). Significant changes in transcript abundance were observed for 3,897 genes during the experiment at p = 0.000005. Many of the genes showed a similar direction of increase or decrease abundance in both the S and R responses, but the R response generally showed a significantly greater degree of differential expression. More than 25% of these responsive genes had not been previously reported as being associated with pathogen interactions, as 704 had no functional annotation and 378 had no homolog in NCBI databases. The highest number of transcriptional changes was noted at 8 hpi including the down regulation of 94 chloroplast-associated genes specific to the R response. Photosynthetic measurements were consistent with an R-specific reduction in photosystem II operating efficiency (FPSII) that was apparent at 8 hpi for the R response with little effect in the S or control treatments. Imaging analyses suggest that the decreased FPSII was a result of physical damage to PSII reaction centers.
