TITLE
Human HCT-116 cells: Control vs CDK2 knockout, NU6102 treated and resistant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of isogenic human colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116, comparing parental cells, CDK2 knockout cells, cells treated with the CDK2-selective inhibitor NU6102 and cells resistant to 50ÂµM NU6102. The aim was to compare effects of loss of CDK2 gene or kinase activity and determine potential mechanisms of inhibitor-resistance

DESIGN
Four condition experiment. 2 biological replicates of each condition

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
