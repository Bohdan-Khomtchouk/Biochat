TITLE
Identification of target genes regulated by ΔNp63α in SaOS-2 cells stably expressed with ΔNp63α

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the target gene of ΔNp63α, in osteosarcoma cells, we performed the global gene expression profiling in SaOS- 2 cells stably overexpressing the ΔNp63α gene (SaOS- 2-ΔNp63α). ΔNp63α target genes were identified by comparison  with genes expressed from  SaOS-2-EV  transfected with an empty vector ( SaOS-2-EV).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from  SaOS- 2-ΔNp63α and SaOS-2-EV cells  cultured in  three independent replicates for each condition. Cy3-labeled cRNA was synthesized and hybridized to  Agilent  human 8 x 60K   microarrays. Raw data, obtained after array image analysis were normalized and used to retrieve differentially expressed genes in ΔNp63α overexpressing SaOS- 2 cells and genes from control SaOS-2-EV cells.
