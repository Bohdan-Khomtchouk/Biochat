TITLE
Silencing of ASCL1 in U87MG glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ASCL1 is known to act as transcriptional activator of notch signaling pathway. We have found that ASCL1 is over expressed in secondary glioblastoma. In order to delineate its functional role in gliomagensis we have used gene silencing approach to identify genes differentially regulated upon ASCL1 down regulation in U87MG glioma cell line.

DESIGN
U87MG cells either mock silenced using scrambled si RNA or silenced using siRNA targetted against ASCL1 were harvested at 48hrs post transfection. Gene expression was profiled after microarray for control and ASCL1 silenced cells.
