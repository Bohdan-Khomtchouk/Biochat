TITLE
SMAD1/5 binding regions of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) treated with BMP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad1/5 are transcription factors that engage in BMP-induced transcription. We determined and analyzed Smad1/5 binding sites by ChIP-sequencing. We used expression microarrays to compare the Smad1/5 binding sites identified by ChIP-seq to BMP-induced gene expressions.

DESIGN
PASMCs were treated with BMP for 1.5 h, and anti-SMAD1/5 ChIP-seq analyses were performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
