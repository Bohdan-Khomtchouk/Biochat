TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from SK-N-DZ (ENCSR569JKX)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from cytoplasmic fractions of a neuroblastoma immortalized cell line SK-N-DZ erived from a metastatic site in the bone marrow of a 2 year old female. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
