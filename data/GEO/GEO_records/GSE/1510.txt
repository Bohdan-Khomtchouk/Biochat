TITLE
Human UniGene Set RZPD 1 - Zipf's Normalization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Five microarrays from a larger dataset used to demonstrate a normalization technique base on Zipf's law. The original data-set generated using a global genome-wide cDNA clone set (Human UniGene clone set RZPD 1 - http://www.rzpd.de - Build 138, NCBI), which consisted of ~33,792 cDNA clone inserts spotted in duplicate onto membranes (18). These microarrays (n=31) were hybridized with 33P-labeled cDNA derived from total RNA extracted from biopsy material from the sigmoidal colon of normal (control, n=11), and patients with Crohn's disease (condition A, n=10) and ulcerative colitis (condition B, n=10). Microarrays were probed according to established protocols and exposed to imaging plates overnight (BAS-MS 2325) and scanned at a 50  m resolution on a FLA-3000G phosphoimager (Raytest, Germany). Image gridding was carried out using VisualGridÂ® software ( http://www.gpc-biotech.com ). Keywords: other
