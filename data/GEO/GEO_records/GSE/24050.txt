TITLE
Biological replicates of Ruditapes philippinarum digestive gland pools

ORGANISM
Ruditapes philippinarum

SUMMARY
Four pools of digestive glands were treated as biological replicates in order to evaluate the repeatability of Ruditapes philippinarum oligo microarray platform.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed four (4) independent pools of Ruditapes philippinarum digestive glands. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Agilent-027304 Ruditapes philippinarum Oligo Microarray platform (1 arrays) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
