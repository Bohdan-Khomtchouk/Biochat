TITLE
Systems analysis of high-fat diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptomes and genome-wide H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me3 (chow diet only) enrichments from chow diet and 16 week high-fat diet-fed mouse livers.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA and H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me3 were profiled by sequencing from chow diet and 16 week high-fat diet mouse livers.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
