TITLE
BTH treated mkk1, mkk2 and mkk1/2 knockout mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene Expression profiling of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAP Kinase Kinases 1 (mkk1), MAP Kinase Kinases 2 (mkk2) knockout mutants and the double mutant mkk1/mkk2 before and 24 hours after treatment with the salicylic acid analog BTH, was measured by hybridisation to an Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip. Keywords: Gene expression. Combined mutant and treatment study

DESIGN
Whole Arabidopsis thaliana mkk1, mkk2 and mkk1/mkk2 knockout mutants and wild type plants (Col-0) were sampled in triplicates before and 24 hours after BTH treatment.
