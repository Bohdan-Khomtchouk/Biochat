Comparison of Yersinia pestis from rat buboes and laboratory cultures

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
Yersinia pestis causes bubonic plague in humans and rats. The disease is characterized by an enlarged, painful lymph node, termed a bubo, that develops following bacterial dissemination from an intradermal flea bite injection site. In susceptible animals, the bacteria quickly overcome host innate immune defenses in the lymph node, spread systemically through the blood, and produce fatal sepsis 1,2. At the terminal stage of disease, the bubo contains massive numbers of extracellular bacteria, necrotic lymphoid tissue, hemorrhage, and fibrin 2. The extreme virulence of Y. pestis has been largely ascribed to its ability to avoid innate immunity by preventing phagocytosis, selectively killing immune cells, and down regulating the proinflammatory response 3. Here we report that two innate immune effector mechanisms are generated during bubonic plague in the rat: iron limitation and nitrosative stress. The expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) was induced in the bubo, and mutation of the Y. pestis hmp gene, which encodes a flavohemoglobin important for resistance to nitric oxide (NO), attenuated virulence. Thus, although Y. pestis avoids uptake and intracellular killing by phagocytes, it still encounters innate immune effector molecules, particularly phagocyte-derived reactive nitrogen species, in the extracellular environment of the bubo.
