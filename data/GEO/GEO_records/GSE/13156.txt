TITLE
Murine corticotroph pituitary AtT-20 cells:  Crh treatment time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As the Crh-system and the HPA-axis are known to be crucially involved in the onset, development and maintainance of psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression and regulate the behavioural and endocrine stress responses the further analysis of Crhr1-dependent signaling cascades is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms behind these psychiatric diseases. In this project, new candidate genes involved in Crhr1-dependent signaling cascades were dissected in the cell line model of AtT-20 cells by transcriptional profiling of mouse pituitary corticotroph cells comparing control untreated AtT-20 cells with AtT-20 cells treated with 100 nM Crh at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Keywords: time course, treatment response

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: untreated vs. 100 nM Crh treated AtT-20 cells with a time curve of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hours. Technical replicates: 6 for each time point, including dye-swap each with 3 replicates
