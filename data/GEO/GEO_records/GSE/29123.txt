TITLE
ABBERANT GENE EXPRESSION BY EBERs IN EBV-NEGATIVE NPC HK1 CELL LINE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in RNA isolated from stably-transfected EBERs-negative versus EBERs-positive HK1 cell lines We established stable transfection of EBERs in the EBV-negative NPC cell line, HK1,to elucidate the role of the EBERs in NPC pathogenesis.  Microarray gene expression profiling was carried out to investigate candidate genes which expression correlates with the expression of the EBERs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from each cell line and processed using GeneChip® Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labelling Assay and then analyzed with GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Array, with three repeats.  Candidate genes differentially expressed between the two transfected HK1 cell lines were identified using GeneSpring GX 10 (Agilent Technologies).
