A Krüppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) regulated network in HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A Krüppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) regulated network in HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cells encompassing adhesion proteins, steroid- and menstrual cycle-regulated proteins of the uterine endometrium, novel membrane proteins, and nuclear receptors

DESIGN
The 4S and 9S sub-lines were derived from the original human HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cell line and contain a stably transfected expression plasmid encoding full-length Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), whereas the 2AS and 3AS sub-lines contain a stably transfected plasmid encoding an antisense (AS) RNA to KLF9. All cell lines were derived concurrently. The ‘sense’ (S) and ‘antisense’ (AS) cell lines differ in relative levels of KLF9 protein and activity, with sense greater than antisense, respectively. For the present work, the 4S and 2AS sub-lines were propagated to near confluence. The 9S and 3AS sub-lines were propagated on a different occasion than for the 4S and 2AS cell lines.RNA preparationRNA was harvested using TRIzol reagent. Two replicate cRNA targets were generated from each HEC-1-A sub-line RNA preparation; all eight targets were made and sized at the same time.
