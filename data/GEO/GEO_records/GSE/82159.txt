TITLE
Expression data of lymphoblastoid B-cell line (LCL), T-cell, dermal fibroblast (DF), and iPSCs established from them.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies indicated that iPSCs retain an epigenetic memory relating to their cell of origin that affected their properties and their functions as PSCs. Then, we used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression reflecting the effect of cell type of origin, and carefully compared the characteristics of iPSCs from LCL, T-cell, and DF based on their expression profiles .

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from LCL, T-cell, DF, and iPSC generated from them (total 12 samples) for the gene expression microarray analysis. All of the iPSC lines we used were low passage number (less than 15).
