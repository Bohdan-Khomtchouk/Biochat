TITLE
RNA-seq of IL-4 stimulated human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we aim to determine the role of IL-4/STAT6 in gene expression in human keratinocytes using RNA-sequencing approach. Human keratinocytes were cultured for 2 or 5 days with calcium chloride to induce terminal differentiation as determined by the expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes. The cells were then stimulated with IL-4 for 3 and 24 hours, or along the 5 days culture period.  We observed that IL-4 inhibits fully differentiation of keratinocytes, induces genes involved with production of inflammatory mediators, and reduces the healing capacity of human keratinocytes. Moreover, STAT6 controlled important genes involved with calcium binding, inflammation and epidermis development.

DESIGN
Human keratinocytes were differentiated with calcium chloride for 2 days and incubated with media alone or 20ng/ml of recombinant human IL-4 for 3 and 24 hours. Human keratinocytes were differentiated with calcium chloride for 5 days with or wihout recombinant human IL-4 (20ng/ml). Keratinocytes transfected with control or STAT6 siRNA were differentiated with calcium chloride for 2 days and then stimulated with recombinant huma IL-4 for 24 hours.
