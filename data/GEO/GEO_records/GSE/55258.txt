TITLE
Th17, Th22 and Treg cells are enriched in the healthy human cecum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of CD4+ T cell populations leads to intestinal inflammation, but the regional differences of these T cell populations remained unclear in the healthy population. We first used flow cytometry to show that Th17 and Th22 cells are specifically enriched in the human cecum, while Th1 and Th2 cells do not differ regionally. We subsequently performed transcriptional profiling and found that Th17 was positively associated with the expression of RETN and negatively associated with TFF1, suggesting that the differential enrichment of Th17 cells in the healthy human cecum was underlined by the metabolic differences in this environment.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling with microarray on human intestinal pinch biopsies obtained from different sites of the healthy colon.
