TITLE
Deep sequencing identifies PD0325901 modulated microRNAs in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PD0325901 is involved in improving reprogramming efficiency during inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain a blastocyst-like state in embryonic stem cells (ESC). However, the knowledge about this small molecule regulating miRNAs in ESC was limited. To understand the role of miRNAs during PD03-induced ESC maintenance and gain an insight how PD0325901 regulates miRNAs expression; we performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 under the compounds treatment. The data show the miRNAs regulated by PD0325901.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented with PD0325901 for 24 hours, J1 treated with DMSO was set as control. Then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
