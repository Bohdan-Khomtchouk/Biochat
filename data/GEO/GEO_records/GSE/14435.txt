TITLE
Pilot-study for a novel universal tool for detection of oncogenic fusion transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A novel oligonucleotide microarray design is described whereby one can screen for all known oncogenic fusion transcripts by one microarray hybridization. Measurements of chimeric transcript junctions are combined with exon-wise measurements of individual fusion partners. Keywords: Nimblegen custom-design

DESIGN
The pilot data included a design with 68,861 oligonucleotide probes covering all combinations of chimeric exon-exon junctions from 275 pairs of fusion genes, as well as sets of oligos internal to all the exons of the fusion partners. Proof of principle was demonstrated by detection of known fusion genes (such as TCF3:PBX1, ETV6:RUNX1, and TMPRSS2:ERG) from six positive controls consisting of leukemia cell lines and prostate cancer biopsies.
