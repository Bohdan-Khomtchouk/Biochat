TITLE
Amaranth's transcription factors overexpression, AhERF and AhDOF, increase drought and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis rossette leaves comparing WT Col-0 with a transgenic line overexpressing AhERF or AhDOF genes from Amaranthus hypochondriacus under different conditions.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment of WT vs AhERF OE plant leaves. The analyzed conditions were: normal growth conditions, 5 days of water stress (no irrigation) and 24 hrs of recovery after watering water-stressed plants. Besides, a two-condition experiment where WT vs AhDOF OE plant leaves were compared. The experimental conditions were: normal growth conditions and plants watered with 40mL of 400mM NaCl solution for three straight days to produce salt stress.
