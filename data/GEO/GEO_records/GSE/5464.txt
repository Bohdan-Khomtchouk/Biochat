TITLE
Effect of Cyclic stretching on the gene expression in human spinal ligament cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine is characterized by progressive ectopic bone formation in the spinal ligament. To identify the genes related to ectopic ossification of human spinal ligament affected by mechanical stress, analyses using cDNA microarray were carried out using cultured human spinal ligament cells that had been subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretching. cDNA microarrays revealed that ranges of distribution of both up- and down-regulated genes evoked by cyclic stretching were significantly wider in cells from than in non-OPLL cells. Keywords: mechanical-stress response
