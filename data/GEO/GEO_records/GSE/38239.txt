TITLE
Expression analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 under accumulation of the bacterial alarmone ppGpp

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ppGpp accumulation caused by ectopic expression of RelA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave rise to marked changes in gene expression with both upregulation and downregulation, including changes in mitochondrial gene expression. The most prominent upregulation (38-fold) was detected in the function-unknown hypothetical gene YBR072C-A, followed by many other known stress-responsive genes. ppGpp acuumulation resulted in enhancement of tolerance against various stress stimuli, such as osmotic stress, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and high temperature.

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recoverd from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TN2080 (accumulating ppGpp) and TN2077 (vector control) grown to mid-growth phase (8h) in SC-uracil medium. The plasmid pYC2/CT (V5-epitope tag vector) was used as a vector to express Sj-RSH.
