TITLE
Expression analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 under accumulation of the bacterial alarmone ppGpp

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
ppGpp accumulation caused by ectopic expression of RelA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave rise to marked changes in gene expression with both upregulation and downregulation, including changes in mitochondrial gene expression. The most prominent upregulation (38-fold) was detected in the function-unknown hypothetical gene YBR072C-A, followed by many other known stress-responsive genes. ppGpp acuumulation resulted in enhancement of tolerance against various stress stimuli, such as osmotic stress, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and high temperature.
