TITLE
affy_aba_ath1-Characterization of aba3-1 suppressor mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
affy_aba_ath1 - affy_aba_ath1 - In order to identify new genes implicated in ABA signalisation pathways, we have carried out a screen for suppressor mutants of the ABA deficient mutant aba3-1. Infrared thermography was used to identify plants whose cold leaf phenotype was reverted. The transcriptome analysis of four recessive suppressor mutants was undertaken to determine which genes are differentially expressed compared to the wild type or aba3-1. Such genes could represent the mutated gene itself or indicate signalling or response pathways affected by the mutation-comparison of four suppressor mutants (g-radiation induced) to wild type and the ABA deficient mutant aba3-1 Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison
