TITLE
Gene expression change in placental labyrinth zone from Pregnancy-Associated Hypertension (PAH) mice with different Nrf2 expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed differences in placental gene expressions.  We examined the mRNA expression profile in placental labyrinth zone from normal pregnant mice, and PAH mice with different Nrf2 expressions (WT, Nrf2 Knockout [KO], Keap1 Knockdown [KD])

DESIGN
Human Angiotensinogen (hAGT) transgenic female mice showes perinatal hypertension (PAH mice) by mating male human Renin (hREN) transgenic mice. But hAGT female mice did not showes gestational hypertension (Normal pregnancy; NP mice) by mating male hAGT mice.  We performed microarray analyses using placental labyrinth zone from NP mice and three types of PAH mice with different Nrf2 expression(PAH mice, PAH-Nrf2KO mice PAH-Keap1KD mice), n = 2 each.
