TITLE
Tumorigenic carryover effects of early life exposure to dichloroacetic acid in male B6C3F1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we investigated the longterm carryover effects of dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a common by-product of drinking water chlorination, on hepatic tumorigenesis in mice. Our findings demonstrate that postnatal exposure to a common drinking water contaminant results in longterm carryover effects on tumorigenesis, potentially via epigenetic events altering cellular respiration and metabolism.

DESIGN
The gene expression study followed a stop-promotion design in which 7d male B6C3F1 mice received the following treatments: deionized water alone (dH2O, control); 0.06% phenobarbital (PB), a rodent liver mitogen and tumor promoter; or DCA (3.5g/L) for 10 weeks followed by dH2O for 90 weeks.
