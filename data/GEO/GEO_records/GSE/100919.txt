TITLE
Mutant Kras-induced upregulation of CD24 enhances prostate cancer stemness and bone metastasis in prostate cancer.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse Prostate cancer cells comparing Pbsn-Cre LSL-KrasG12D P53L/L cells with Pbsn-Cre LSL-BrafV600E P53L/L cells, and to determine the effects of Kras or Braf mutantion on  murine PCa gene expression.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Pbsn-Cre LSL-KrasG12D P53L/L cells vs. Pbsn-Cre LSL-BrafV600E P53L/L cells vs. Pbsn-Cre P53L/L cells: 2 wild type replicates, 2 KrasG12D mutant replicates and 2 BrafV600E mutant replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
