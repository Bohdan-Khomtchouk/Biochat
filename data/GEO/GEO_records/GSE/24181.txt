TITLE
Large intergenic non-coding RNAs as novel modulators of reprogramming: human embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (LincRNA expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of non coding RNAs using tilling arrays from ES, Fibroblasts and Fibroblasts derived iPSC LincRNA profiles of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human ESCs, fibroblast, and fibroblast-derived iPSC lines, then hybridized to Nimblegen tiling array GPL8791; Human lincRNA 364k Tiling Array V1

PLATFORM
GPL8791 Human lincRNA 364k Tiling Array V1
