TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CALGB 9741 patient tumor samples using the nCounter RUO-PAM50 signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer was performed using an nCounter RUO-PAM50 gene expression assay to determine the ability of instrinsic subtyping to predict what patients may benefit from altered chemotherapy  scheduling in the CALGB 9741 clinical trial population.

DESIGN
FFPE primary breast tumor samples archived at the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office (PCO) were used to obtain total RNA for instrinsic subtyping using the nCounter Analysis System. Gene-expression profiles were generated for 1321 of 1471 patient samples (90%) suitable for inclusion in this study.
