TITLE
Global analysis of RAR-responsive genes in the Xenopus neurula

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Retinoid signaling is important for patterning the vertebrate hindbrain and midaxial regions. We recently showed that signaling through retinoic acid receptors (RARs) is essential for anteroposterior patterning along the entire body axis. To further investigate the mechanisms through which RARs act, we employed microarray analysis to investigate the effects of modulating RAR activity on target gene expression. We identified 334 upregulated genes (92% of which were validated) including known RA responsive genes, known genes that have never been proposed as RA targets and many hypothetical and unidentified genes (n = 166). 67 validated downregulated genes were identified including known RA responsive genes and anterior marker genes. The expression patterns of selected upregulated genes (n = 45) were examined at neurula stages using whole mount in situ hybridization. We found that most of these genes were expressed in the neural tube and many were expressed in anterior tissues such as neural crest, brain, eye anlagen, and cement gland. Some were expressed in tissues such as notochord, somites, pronephros and blood islands, where retinoic acid (RA) plays established roles in organogenesis. Members of this set of newly identified RAR target genes are likely to play important roles in neural patterning and organogenesis under the control of RAR signaling pathways and their further characterization will expand our understanding of RA signaling during development.
