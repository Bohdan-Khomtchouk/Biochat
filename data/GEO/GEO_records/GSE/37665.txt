TITLE
The effect of alpha, beta, gamma interferon receptors on host reponse to influenza virus in mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to examine the host transcriptional response to high and low pathogenecity viruses in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from different mouse genetic backgrounds to further understand the contribution of interferon signaling pathways to host response to influenza.

DESIGN
WT, IFNgR-/-, IFNabR-/-, or IFNabgR-/- MEFs were mock-infected or infected with the A/WSN/33 (WSN), reconstructed 1918 (r1918), or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) strains of influenza virus at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell.  At 24 h p.i., total RNA was isolated from the cells and used for microarray hybridization.  Experiments with VN1203 and r1918 were performed seperately (experiment a) from experiments with WSN (experiment b). Appropriate mock samples were harvested in each experiment. All gene expression profiles are compared to time-, experiment-, and genotype-matched mock-infected samples.
