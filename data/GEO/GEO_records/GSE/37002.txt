TITLE
m6A mapping in human RNA (with treatments)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach, m6A-seq, for high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape, based on antibody-mediated capture followed by massively parallel sequencing.

DESIGN
Identification of m6A modified sequences in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were incubated with either IFNg (200ng/ml) or HGF/SF (10 ng/ml) over night. Stress effects were tested in HepG2 cells by either 30 minutes incubation at 43ÂºC (heat shock) or UV irradiation of 0.04 J/cm2 followed by 4 hours of recovery in normal growing conditions prior to harvesting using Trypsin.
