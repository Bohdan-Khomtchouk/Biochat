TITLE
Genetic regulation of gene expression of barley in response to stem rust (Pgt isolate TTKS)

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The QxSM doubled-haploid mapping population was generated from a single Q21861 x SM89010 F1 plant (Borovkova et al. 1995; Steffenson et al. 1995). Four flats (each flat contained 75 DH lines + 4 replicates of each parent = 81 cones/flat) were grown in a completely randomized design at the ARS Cereal Disease Lab, University of Minnesota, St. Paul.  The four flats were divided into two replicates of two flats each.  Nine days after sowing, one flat of each replicate was inoculated (INOC) with TTKS urediniospores were suspended in Soltrol oil with an inoculum weight of 0.25 mg per flat and the other was mock-inoculated (MOCK).  Each (MOCK and INOC) replicate was incubated in its own dew chamber overnight.  After inoculation, replicates were placed in separate mist chambers for 16 hours in the dark, followed by lights for 5 hours, and then moved to the greenhouse for 2 hours.  The growth stage of barley was first leaf unfolded (PO:0007094) and five seedlings were harvested and placed in liquid nitrogen for each line in the population within a 1.5 hour period at 24 hours after inoculation (hai).   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Roger P.
