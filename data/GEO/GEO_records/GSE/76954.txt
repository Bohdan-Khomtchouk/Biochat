TITLE
Investigation of a Quality Check for Plasma Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasma samples from healthy volunteers were used for the microarray analysis. The fresh sample and intentionally hemolyzed one due to negative pressure were examined. Microarray analyses were performed using the 3D-Gene microRNA microarray platform, and RNA extraction was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Only a very small amount of total RNA was present in the plasma samples; therefore 2 out of the 4 µl of total RNA extracted from 300- µl of plasma samples were used in microarray experiments.

DESIGN
The purpose of this study is to identify hemolysis related microRNA. Plasma samples from healthy volunteers were used for the microarray analysis. The fresh sample and intentionally hemolyzed one due to negative pressure were examined.
