TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cells undegoing oncogene induced senescence upon knockdown or ARID1B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used IMR90 ER:RAS cells infected with an empty vector or an shRNA for ARID1B and induced senescence by addition of 4OHT. 6 days later RNA was collected for gene expression analysis. With a functional screen we previously identified ARID1B as a new regulator of cellular senescence. By performing gene expression analysis we confirmed this finding and showed that knockdown of ARID1B prevents the expression of genes induced during senescence.

DESIGN
3 samples examined: Non-senescent cells (vector - 4OHT), Senescent cells (vector + 4OHT), Senescent cells expressing shRNA for ARID1B (shARID1B + 4OHT)
