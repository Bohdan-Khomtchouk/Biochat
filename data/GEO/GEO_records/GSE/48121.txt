TITLE
Expression data from human pancreatic cells PANC-1 infected with oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h153

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease associated with resistance to conventional therapies. GLV-1h153 is an oncolytic virus which has shown promise for the targeted treatment of cancer, and is engineered to carry the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) for the imaging of viral replication within tumors via enhanced uptake of several radionuclide probes. We used microarrays to determine changes in gene expression patterns over time associated with infection and susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to GLV-1h153. Understanding into the molecular mechanisms associated with PANC-1 sensitivity to GLV-1h153 may enable identification of cancers resistant to viral therapy, avoid undesirable side effects associated with the need for higher doses of viral treatment, and development of safer and more efficacious oncolytic virotherapies.

DESIGN
PANC-1 cells were infected with GLV-1h153. Zero (T0), 6 (T6) and 24 (T24) hours after infection, 3 samples of each time point were harvested and gene expression patterns assessed using HG-U133A cDNA microarray chips as compared to uninfected control (T0).
