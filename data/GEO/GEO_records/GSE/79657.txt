TITLE
Characterization of human Merkel cells and their response to Merkel cell polyomavirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Merkel cells are epidermal mechanoreceptor cells responsible for the perception of gentle touch. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and highly aggressive skin cancer. Although MCC histologically resembles Merkel cells, the cell of origin for MCC is unknown. MCC frequently contains integrated Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), a small DNA tumor virus with widespread prevalence. Whether MCPyV can transform Merkel cells is unknown. Here, we describe the isolation and long-term expansion of human Merkel cells from neonatal foreskin. We validated the expression of several Merkel cell-related factors by RNASeq, and assessed the ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Culture of Merkel cell preparations on an artificial basement membrane promoted the formation of structures containing both Merkel and non-Merkel cell populations. To determine whether Merkel cells were susceptible to transformation, we expressed tumor-derived MCPyV T antigens and additional oncogenes. We were unable to demonstrate tumorigenesis in immunodeficient mice, but were able to detect T antigen expression from excised cells weeks after implantation. These results highlight that foreskin-isolated Merkel cells can be propagated extensively, sustain expression of MCPyV T antigens, but are not susceptible to transformation by MCPyV, suggesting that Merkel cells from non-glabrous skin may not be a cell of origin for MCC.

DESIGN
Comparison of MKL-1 Merkel cell carcinoma cell line to primary CD56 Merkel cells expressing either GFP or Merkel cell poylomavirus (MCCL21) early-region.
