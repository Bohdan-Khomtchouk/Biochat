TITLE
Modulation of dietary methionine intake elicits potent, but distinct, anticancer effects on primary vs metastatic tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Methionine concentration in diet influences the growth rate of metastatic cells in vivo

DESIGN
Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1x10^5 B16-F10.1 cells via the tail vein. Mice were allowed 21 days to develop pulmonary metastases and then were fed a methionine adequate, methionine deficient or methionine restricted (25% of normal) diet for 2 weeks. Metastatic tissue was then collected and RNA extracted for sequencing.

PLATFORM
