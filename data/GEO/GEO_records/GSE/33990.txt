TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Etoposide-treated 293 cells expressing p65 wt or p65 S547A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported a direct phosphorylation of the Ser547 of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kB by ATM kinase. A comparative transcriptomic analyse with HEK293 cells expressing exclusively HA-p65wt or a non-phosphorylable mutant HA-p65S547A was conducted to identify the genes regulated by this phosphorylation after an Etoposide treatment.

DESIGN
HEK293 cells expressing exclusively HA-p65wt or HA-p65S547A were treated during four or eight hours with Etoposide or left untreated. This was performed three times to obtain independent triplicates for the microarray expermiment.
