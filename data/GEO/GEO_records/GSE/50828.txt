TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of E.coli K12 MG1655 exposed to prolonged stationary phase

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This study explores the effects of prolonged stationary phase, on whole genome expression of Escherichia coli. In summary these results imply that prolonged stationary phase cells have shown less growth rate compared to fresh cells due to the low abundance of transcripts for translation initiation factor infC, and for all the seven rrn operons of 5S, 16S, 23S ribosomal RNA which further delayed in protein synthesis leading to low biomass in prolonged stationary phase cells.

DESIGN
28 days old E.coli cells were grown in the presence of LB broth and LB broth supplemented with 10% v/v glycerol. RNA was extracted from these samples, cDNA was prepared, fragmented cDNA was labled with labeling reagent and hybridized with Affymetrix E.coli2.0 genome array chips.Data was analysed to get the effect of glycerol on E.coli gene expression
