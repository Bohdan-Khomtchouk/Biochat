TITLE
Expression data for primary localized prostate cancer versus castration-resistant bone metastatic prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared 22 primary Pca (hormone-dependent) versus 29 metastatic Pca (CRPC). The expression of genes related to cell cycle, proliferation, DNA synthesis, and androgen metablism are significantly increased in CRPC group. The expression of AR-stimulated genes were partially reactivated. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status was determined for the samples by PCR. The expression of ERG was highly increased in fusion positive versus negative.

DESIGN
120 snap-frozen CT-guided bone marrow biopsies from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were collected as a source of material. 29 independent biopsies containing mostly tumor were identified as CRPC group through carefully microscopical examination. 4 samples containing no tumor were identified as normal bone marrow group. Primary tumor was isolated by LCM from frozen biopsies of hormone-naive patients. 22 samples were selected as primary PCa group.
