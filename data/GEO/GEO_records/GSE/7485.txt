TITLE
A transcriptome analysis of the Vibrio fischeri LuxR-LuxI regulon

ORGANISM
Aliivibrio fischeri

SUMMARY
Acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) quorum sensing was first discovered in Vibrio fischeri where it serves as a key control element of the seven-gene luminescence (lux) operon. Since this initial discovery, other bacteria have been shown to control hundreds of genes by acyl-HSL quorum sensing. Until recently, it has been difficult to examine the global nature of quorum sensing in V. fischeri. However, the complete genome sequence of V. fischeri is now available and this has enabled us to use transcriptomics to identify quorum-sensing regulated genes and to study the quorum-controlled regulon of this bacterium. In this study, we used DNA microarray technology to identify over two-dozen V. fischeri genes regulated by the quorum sensing signal N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL).
