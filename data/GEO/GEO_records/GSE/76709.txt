TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of Romidpesin treated GCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina 450k DNA methylation microarray analysis of TCam-2, 2102EP, NCCIT and JAR cells 16 h after 10 nanomolar Romidepsin application. DMSO treated cells were used as controls. These data are part of the article 'The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Romidepsin is a Novel Therapeutic Option for (Cisplatin-resistant) Germ Cell Cancers' (Nettersheim et al., 2016).

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated by PCI extraction from TCam-2, 2102EP, NCCIT and JAR 16h after 10 nanomolar Romidepsin treatment. DMSO treated cells served as control.
