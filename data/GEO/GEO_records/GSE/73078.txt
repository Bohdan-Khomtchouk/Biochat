TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Methylation Profiling in Skeletal Muscle from Lean and Obese Subjects [Microarray expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is a metabolic disease caused by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors.  However, the epigenetic mechanisms of obesity are incompletely understood. The aim of our study was to identify skeletal muscle DNA methylation patterns in combination with transcriptomic changes in obesity.

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies were obtained basally from lean (n=10) and obese (n=10) participants in combination with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps to assess insulin sensitivity. We performed microarray (SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v2) analysis on RNA isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. This represents the expression profiling component only.
