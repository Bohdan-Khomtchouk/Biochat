TITLE
Expression data in Hepa1c1c7 cells treated with Nrf2 activator, diethyl maleate (DEM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the gene expression profile of Hepa1c1c7 cells in response to DEM, we performed microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Two independent RNA samples from Hepa1c1c7 cells (a mouse hepatoma cell line) treated with 100-ÂµM DEM or DMSO for 6 hours were used for the microarray analysis.
