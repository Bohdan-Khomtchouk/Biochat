TITLE
Genomic Analysis of Individual Differences in Ethanol Drinking: Evidence for Non-genetic Factors in C57BL/6 Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we identify persistent and substantial variation in ethanol drinking behavior within an inbred mouse strain and utilize this model to identify gene networks influencing such non-genetic variation in ethanol intake. C57BL/6NCrl mice showed persistent inter-individual variation of ethanol intake in a two-bottle choice paradigm over a three week period, ranging from less than 1 g/kg to over 14 g/kg ethanol in an 18h interval. Whole genome microarray expression analysis in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area of individual animals identified gene expression patterns correlated with ethanol intake.  Results included several gene networks previously implicated in ethanol behaviors, such as glutamate signaling, BDNF and genes involved in synaptic vesicle function.  Additionally, genes functioning in epigenetic chromatin or DNA modifications such as acetylation and/or methylation also had expression patterns correlated with ethanol intake.  Our results thus implicate specific brain regional gene networks, including chromatin modification factors, as potentially important mechanisms underlying individual variation in ethanol intake.
