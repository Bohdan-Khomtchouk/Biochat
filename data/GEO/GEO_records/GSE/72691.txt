TITLE
Photophysiological and Genetic Factors Underlying Fast Photosynthetic Growth of Unicellular Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002

ORGANISM
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002

SUMMARY
Application of genome-scale 'omics approaches to dissect subcellular pathways and regulatory networks governing the fast-growing response of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 response to variable irradience levels.

DESIGN
We employed controlled cultivation and next-generation sequencing technology to identify transcriptional responses of euryhaline unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 grown under steady state conditions at six irradiance levels ranging from 33 to 760 Âµmol photons m-2 sec-1.
