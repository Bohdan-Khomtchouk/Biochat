TITLE
miRNA profile induced by RET/PTC1 oncogene in human thyrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain a PTC cell model, primary human thyrocytes have been infected with a retrovirus expressing RET/PTC1 oncogene, using parental thyrocytes as control. The obtained RET/PTC-dependent differential miRNA expression profile, representing the effects of RET/PTC1 oncogene present in about one third of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), models the early event of thyrocytes transformation ending to PTC.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles of thyrocytes expressing RET/PTC1 oncogene and parental thyrocytes were compared. Biological replicates could not be generated.
