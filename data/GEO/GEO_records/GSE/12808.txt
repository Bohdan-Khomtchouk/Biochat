TITLE
Detection of chromosomal aberrations in renal tumors by virtual karyotyping with SNP microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal epithelial neoplasms have characteristic chromosomal imbalances that can be used for classification. We have previously shown that virtual karyotypes (v-karyotype) derived from SNP microarrays can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples but a direct comparison with karyotypes obtained by conventional cytogenetics has not been done. 20 archival FFPE tumor samples were analyzed with Affymetrix 10K 2.0 or 250K Nsp SNP microarrays.
