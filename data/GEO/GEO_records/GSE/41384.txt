TITLE
Methylation profiling in intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of promoter methylation profile associated with cervical cancer progression. The Ilumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs from 19 cervical samples (including normal, CIN I-II, in situ and invasive cervical cancer tissues).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 19 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
