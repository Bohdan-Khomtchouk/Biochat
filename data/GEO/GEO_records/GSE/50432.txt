TITLE
Gene expression in the spleen; effect of maternal exposure to carbon black nanoparticle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of administration of carbon black nanoparticle (CB-NP) to pregnant mice on the development of lymphoid tissues in infantile mice. Pregnant ICR mice were treated with a suspension of CB-NP 95 microg/kg/time) by intranasal instillation, twice, on gestational day 5 and 9. Spleen and thymus were collected from offspring mice at 5 days post-partum.

DESIGN
RNA sample was taken from spleen of 5-day-old mouse prenatally received carbon black nanoparticle, while control RNA was taken from control counterpart prenatally received distilled water. Comparisons among groups were made by one-color method with normalized data from Cy3 channels for data analysis.
