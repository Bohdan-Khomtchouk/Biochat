TITLE
Analysis of expression of genes involved in glycan and GBP synthesis in control and differentiated dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression of genes involved in glycan and glycan-binding molecule synthesis in dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns for unstimulated dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes were compared. Also, gene expression patterns for dendritic cells and macrophages stimulated with LPS for 4 and 18 hours were compared to unstimulated cells. Three replicate samples of RNA were taken from human cells, one sample per donor. Samples were prepared and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 array.
