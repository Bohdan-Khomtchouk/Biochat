TITLE
Genome-Wide Profiling of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ in Primary Epididymal, Inguinal, and Brown Adipocytes Reveals Depot-Selective Binding Correlated with Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we have employed chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing to map and compare PPARγ  binding in in vitro differentiated primary mouse adipocytes isolated from epididymal, inguinal, and brown adipose tissues. While these PPARγ binding profiles are overall similar, there are clear depot-selective binding sites. Most PPARγ binding sites previously mapped in 3T3-L1 adipocytes can also be detected in primary adipocytes, but there are a large number of PPARγ binding sites that are specific to the primary cells, and these tend to be located in closed chromatin regions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The depot-selective binding of PPARγ is associated with highly depot-specific gene expression. This indicates that PPARγ plays a role in the induction of genes characteristic of different adipocyte lineages and that preadipocytes from different depots are differentially preprogrammed to permit PPARγ lineage-specific recruitment even when  differentiated in vitro.

DESIGN
Examination of PPARγ binding in in vitro differentiatied adipocytes isolated from three different adipose depots.
