TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler) rosette leaves after the release of singlet oxygen inside plastids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used the flu mutant of Arabidopsis to detail gene expression in response to singlet oxygen. The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis accumulates excess protochlorophyllide in the dark within chloroplast membranes that upon illumination acts as a photosensitizer and generates singlet oxygen. Immediately after the release of singlet oxygen mature flu plants stop growing, whereas seedlings bleach and die. Within the first 30 min after the release of singlet oxygen rapid changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by other reactive oxygen species, superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Keywords: Time course
