TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler) rosette leaves after the release of singlet oxygen inside plastids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used the flu mutant of Arabidopsis to detail gene expression in response to singlet oxygen. The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis accumulates excess protochlorophyllide in the dark within chloroplast membranes that upon illumination acts as a photosensitizer and generates singlet oxygen. Immediately after the release of singlet oxygen mature flu plants stop growing, whereas seedlings bleach and die. Within the first 30 min after the release of singlet oxygen rapid changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by other reactive oxygen species, superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were harvested after 30 min, 1h, and 2 h of reillumination following a 8h dark period for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.  Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1. For each sample, the rosette leaves of five to six 3-week-old plants (before they start bolting) were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from two separate biological experiments were pooled for the preparation of cDNA and the subsequent synthesis of biotin-labeled complementary RNA as recommended by Affymetrix.
