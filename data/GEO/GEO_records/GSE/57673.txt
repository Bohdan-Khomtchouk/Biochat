TITLE
The effects of arsenic on Silurana tropicalis embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Arsenic is a carcinogenic metalloid element found naturally in the environment; however human activities such as mining and pesticide use have led to increased concentrations in some areas.  Silurana tropicalis eggs were exposed to sublethal concentrations  of sodium arsenate (0, 0.5 and 1 ppm) for 3 days during embryogenesis. Four pooled of 10 larvae were sampled per treatment and analyzed for gene expression changes using a microarray approach.

DESIGN
Silurana tropicalis eggs were exposed to sublethal concentrations  of sodium arsenate (0, 0.5 and 1 ppm) for 3 days during embryogenesis. There were 5 controls, 5 low dose and 6 high dose microarrays perfomed.
