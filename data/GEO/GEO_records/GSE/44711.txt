TITLE
Gene expression in Early-Onset Preeclampsia Placentas and Controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the DNA methylation and gene expression of 20 chorionic villi samples from early onset preeclampsia placentas to 20 gestational age matched controls. From this we were able to see a widespread disregulation in DNA methylation across a subset of genes in the genome. This may help to elucidate the underlying biological problems that lead to early onset preeclampsia. We noted that there were DNA methylation changes in many genes of importance as well as in different genomic elements such as enhancers.

DESIGN
RNA from 8 Early Onset Preeclampsia placentas and 8 gestational age matched controls
