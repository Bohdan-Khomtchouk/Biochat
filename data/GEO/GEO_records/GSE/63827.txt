TITLE
Global gene transcriptional profiles in RAW 264.7 cells following mica fine particle stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We focused on how mica fine particle influences macrophage activities.

DESIGN
We analyzed altered transcription in RAW 264.7 cells at 0, 12, and 48 h following the stimulation with 100 Âµg/mL of mica fine particles.
