TITLE
Genome wide chromatin modification associated with brown adipose tissue.

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to find regions enriched for  the histone modifications, H3K27ac in perirenal adipose tissue  in late gestation sheep fetuses, (i.e.~ 2 weeks before birth) .   This tissue has a primary role in maintaining thermogenesis in new-born mammals.

DESIGN
Genome wide chromatin modification  profiles  for H3K27ac and H3K4me3 of perirenal adipose tissue from sheep fetuses at 132 days of gestation (132 d post conception (dpc); term =150Â±3d) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GA11X or HiSeq2000 sequencing platform. Two biological replicates were analysed. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to sheep genome  assembly OARv3.1.74 using the mapping protocol in the CLC Genomics Workbench (v7.0).
