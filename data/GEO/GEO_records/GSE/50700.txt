TITLE
Profile the RNA composition of cell-free saliva and salivary exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptomic content of salivary exosomes vs. whole saliva via microarray (Affymetrix HU133 plus 2.0).

DESIGN
Unstimulated saliva samples and derived exosome-like microvesicles were obtained from 3 healthy volunteers and processed for RNA isolation and microarray analysis.
