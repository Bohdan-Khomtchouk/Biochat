TITLE
Searching for Brca1 regulated X-linked genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the expression levels of X-linked genes in the mammary glands of Brca1 D11/D11;p53+/- mutant and control (p53+/-) mice at three different stages of the mammary cycle:  virgin, pregnant day 16.5, and lactation day 1, using a cDNA microarray. In about 690 X-linked genes that are expressed at these three stages of mammary cycle of development, we found 16 X-linked genes showed altered expression levels in Brca1 D11/D11;p53+/- mammary glands in comparison with controls at all three time points. Among them, 9 genes were up-regulated and 7 were down-regulated. This result indicates that mutation of Brca1 could affect expression of a few X-linked genes in mammary tissues. However, this was unlikely caused by failure of X chromosome inactivation, as seven of them were down-regulated, and Xist RNA was expressed in all the Brca1 mutant mammary tissues.
