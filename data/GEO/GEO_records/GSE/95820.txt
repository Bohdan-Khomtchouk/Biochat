TITLE
Gene expression profiles of activin-A-induced human Tr1-like regulatory T cells and T conventional cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our studies was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of human Tr1-like regulatory T cells by the cytokine activin-A. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the whole T cell transcriptome and characterized the  transcriptional profile of activin-A-induced human Tr1-like regulatory T cells (act-A-iTr1 cells) and compared it to those of Tconventional cells (Tconv). Our studies identified novel  immunoregulatory molecules/pathways involved in the differentiation and effector function of human act-A-iTr1 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human CD4+ T conventional and act-A-iTr1 cells. Two biological replicates were used for each condition. RNA-sequencing libraries were generated using the Illuminaâ€™s TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 and the sequencing was implemented with HiSeq 2000.
