TITLE
The gene expression of numerous SLC transporters is altered in the immortalized hypothalamic cell line N25/2 following amino acid starvation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The immortalized mouse hypothalamic cell line N25/2 was treated with medium containing amino acids or medium lacking all amino acids for 1, 2, 3, 5 or 16 hours, and the gene expression was measured for 28270 genes using microarray. Numerous transporters from the SLC family were transcriptionally regulated in response to changed amino acid levels.

DESIGN
Singlet's were run in in each treatment group (controls vs. starved cells) for all times (1, 2, 3 and 16 hours), except for 5 hours with four replicates in each treatment group.
