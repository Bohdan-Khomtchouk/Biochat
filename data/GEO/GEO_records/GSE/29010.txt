TITLE
Cell autonomous role of PTEN in regulating castration-resistant prostate cancer growth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alteration of the PTEN/PI3K pathway is associated with late stage and castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  However, how PTEN loss involves in CRPC development is not clear.  Here we show that castration-resistant growth is an intrinsic property of Pten-null prostate cancer (CaP) cells, independent of cancer development stage.PTEN loss suppresses androgen-responsive gene expressions by modulating androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor activity. Conditional deletion of AR in the epithelium promotes the proliferation of Pten-null cancer cells, at least in part, by down-regulating androgen-responsive gene FKBP5 and preventing PHLPP-mediated AKT inhibition. Our findings identify PI3K and AR pathway crosstalk as a mechanism of CRPC development, with potentially important implications for CaP etiology and therapy

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying a tet-inducible Pten transgene were generated by retro viral infection and antibiotic selection.  Cells were treated with 2 ug/ml doxycycline for 24 or 48 hours in tet-free FBS (5%)/MEF media (n=2).  Reference samples were either cells before treatment (n=2).  After each time point cells were washed twice with PBS and RNA trizol extracted.  WT samples (n =2) were also included as a control.
