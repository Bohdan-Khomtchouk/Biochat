TITLE
Integrative genomic characterization of oral squamous cell carcinoma identifies frequent somatic drivers (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a disease with extensive morbidity and mortality and few useful molecular targets. Multiplatform integrated genomic analysis was performed in order to identify genomic drivers and molecularly discernible tumor subtypes. mRNA, miRNA and methylation data are all submitted to GEO

DESIGN
We measured methylation of 42 OSCC tumors, 2 normal oral epithelial tissues, and 2 normal blood samples with Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
