TITLE
MiRNA Expression data from Tk6 cell treated with arsenic, gamma-IR, or grown under folate-deficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Folate deficiency, arsenic exposure, and gamma-IR are known developmental toxicants and have carcinogenic effects.  The mechanism by which IR is known, but the effect of arsenic or folate deficiency remains unclear.  Their effect may be mediated by epigenetic alterations, leading to miRNA expression changes, and this experiment examined this hypothesis We used microarrays to detail the miRNA expression profiles of TK6 cells treated with 2 uM sodium arsenite for 6 days, folate-deficient media for 6 days, or 2.5 Gy IR exposure either acutely at 4 hours post exposure or long-term at 6 days post exposure, as well as requiste controls, all in biological triplicate. Keywords: exposure differences
