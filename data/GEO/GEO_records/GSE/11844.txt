TITLE
Mouse Igf1 null publication analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different mutations in the gene encoding humans IGF-I cause intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal growth failure, microcephaly, mental retardation, bilateral sensorineural deafness and multiple dysmorphic features. Insight into the role of IGFs in inner ear cochlear ganglion neurogenesis has come from the study of genetically modified mice. Postnatal cochlear development is severely impaired in mice Igf1-/-, which develop smaller cochlea and cochlear ganglia, an immature tectorial membrane and they display a significant decrease in the number and size of auditory neurons. We used microarrays to define the genetic signatures of Igf-1 +/+ and Igf-1-/- mouse cochea and identify the differentially expressed genes. Keywords: comparison between WT and KO
