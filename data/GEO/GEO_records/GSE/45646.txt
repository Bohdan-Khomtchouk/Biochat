TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver tumor-initiating cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is important for tumor-initiating cells. We used microarrays to obtain gene profiling data in order to increase understanding of the pathways.

DESIGN
Liver tumor-initiating cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
