TITLE
Differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes, introduced with siRNA against phf21a gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipogenic differentiation and metabolic adaptation are initiated through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. In particular, dynamic changes in histone modifications may play central roles in the rearrangement of gene expression patterns. BHC80 protein, encoded by phf21a gene, is a part of LSD1 histone demethylase complex and is essential for the demethylation activity. To address the importance of histone demethylation in adipogenic differentiation and function, we performed cDNA microarray in BHC80-deficient 3T3-L1 cells

DESIGN
3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with either BHC80-specific siRNA or control siRNA (siGL3). 24 hours later, cells were subjected to adipogenic induction. 24 hours later, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction.
