TITLE
Expression data for OVE26 diabetic mouse podocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Podocytes form filtration barrier through foot process around glomerualar basement membrane and selectively permit permeability of molecular smaller than albumin. Diabetes  can cause podocyte pathological changes leading to high urine albumin level. Diabetic mouse model OVE26 has extremly high urine albumin and previously studies indicated its podocyte damaged. Here we try to find the key genes change in OVE26 diabetic mouse model podocyte by microarray assay while normal FVB mouse podocyte set as control.

DESIGN
Podocyte eGFP transgenic mice were made on FVB background and crossbred to OVE26 diabetic model. Glomeruli isolated from OVE-GFP mice were digested by trypsin into signal cell. Podocytes with GFP were sorting out by FACS.
