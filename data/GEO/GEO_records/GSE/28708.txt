TITLE
LPS inflammation model and thalidomide effect using PBMC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this research, we use DNA microarray analysis to clarify the gene expression responses from thalidomide in PBMC cells after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment.

DESIGN
Analysis used PBMC as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples: PBMC stimulated with LPS and PBMC stimulated with LPS treated with LPS. Indirect comparisons were made across multiple arrays with raw data pulled from different channels for data analysis and comparison to the control data.
