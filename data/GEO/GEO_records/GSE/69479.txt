TITLE
Genome-wide map of SOX2 occupancy in human ES cells (hESCs) and hESC derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the genome wide binding profiles of SOX2 in hESCs and hNPCs, we carried out SOX2 ChIP-seq in the two cell types and dissected the the cell type and stage dependent regulatory groups of SOX2, thus providing important information for the mechanism underlying SOX2's dynamic functions in hESCs and hNPCs.

DESIGN
Comparative analysis of SOX2 genome-wide occupancy in hESCs and hNPCs
