TITLE
Global Transcriptome Analysis of Spermatogenically Regressed, Recrudescent, and Active Testis of Seasonally Breeding Wall Lizards Hemidactylus flaviviridis

ORGANISM
Hemidactylus flaviviridis

SUMMARY
Reptiles are phylogenically important group of animals as mammals are evolved from them. Clearly distinct phases of reproductive cycle in wall lizard enable us to study mechanisms regulating spermatogenesis. We have performed microarray hybridizations on mouse whole genome 60K gene chip using RNA from regressed, recrudescent and active phase of reproductive cycle. Microarray data was analyzed considering regressed phase as control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of transcriptome analysis of whole testis of wall lizard from various phases of reproductive cycle. Microarray results reveal that maximum number of differential gene expression is in between regressed and recrudescent phase than in between recrudescent and active phase. The genes prominently expressed in recrudescent and active phase testis are cytoskeleton organization, cell growth and division, osmo-regulation, differentiation and apoptosis. The genes showing higher expression in regressed phase belonged to functional categories such as negative regulation of growth, repression of transcription, maintenance of stem cell niche and muscle related proteins. Summarily, this is first exploratory study profiling transcriptome of three drastically different conditions of wall lizard testis. This study will pave the way for deeper insight into gene regulatory mechanisms in spermatogenesis and evolution of spermatogene processes.
