TITLE
Chromatin and Sequence Features that Define the Fine and Gross Structure of Genomics Methylation Patterns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a new method for genome-wide methylation profiling that is able to probe methylation status in both single-copy DNA and interspersed repeats.  This method, MethylMAPS, uses methylation-sensitive and -dependent enzymes to fractionate the genome according to methylation state.  Methylated and unmethylated fragments are then sequenced with Next-Gen sequencing to map methylated and unmethylated CpG sites in the genome. We have used this method to determine the methylation status of > 275 million CpG sites in human and mouse DNA from breast and brain tissues. We conclude that methylation is the default state of most CpG dinucleotides and that a combination of local dinucleotide frequencies, the interaction of repeated sequences, and the presence or absence of histone variants or modifications shields a population of CpG sites (most of which are in and around promoters) from DNA methyltransferases that lack intrinsic sequence specificity.

DESIGN
Genome-wide methylation mapping in two normal human breast tissues, human brain tissue and mouse brain tissue.
