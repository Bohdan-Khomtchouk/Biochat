TITLE
Single-nucleus RNA-seq on undifferentiated human KD3 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes and mononucleated cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-nucleus-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of transcriptome in immortazalized human myoblast KD3. By obtaining over sixty billion bases of sequence from mRNA, we generated comprehensive transcriptome profiles from KD3 undifferentiated myoblast and differentiated  multi-nucleated myotube and mono-nucleated cells. We find that the data from single-nucleus RNA-seq is consistent with the transcriptome from single-cell RNA-seq.  The pri-mRNA expression characterized by single-nucleus RNA-seq can reflect the actual miRNA level in the whole cell.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome in 1 cell type in 3 differential stages.
