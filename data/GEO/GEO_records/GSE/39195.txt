TITLE
Effect of denervation on mouse skeletal muscle mRNA levels.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle denervation causes skeletal muscle atrophy. The goal of these studies was to determine the effects of denervation on skeletal muscle mRNA levels in C57BL/6 mice. For additional details see Ebert et al, Stress-Induced Skeletal Muscle Gadd45a Expression Reprograms Myonuclei and Causes Muscle Atrophy. JBC epub. June 12, 2012.

DESIGN
Left sciatic nerves of C57BL/6 mice were transected. Seven days later bilateral tibialis anterior muscles were harvested.  mRNA levels in denervated muscles were normalized to levels in contralateral innervated muscles.
