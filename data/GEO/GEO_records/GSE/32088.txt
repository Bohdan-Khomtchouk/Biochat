TITLE
Gene expression of a Photorhabdus M-form variant relative to the wild type P-form cells

ORGANISM
Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1

SUMMARY
Photorhabdus luminescens bacteria alternate lifestyles between its pathogenic insect host and its mutualistic nematode host. We found that Photorhabdus changes radically from the insect pathogenic form (P-form) to slow growing small cells when initiating mutualism (M-form). Here we characterize the gene expression of the M-form relative to the P-form.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from mid-exponential phase bacterial cultures of genetically locked P-form and M-form cells in LB media supplemented with 1 g/liter sodium pyruvate at 28 degree celcius. M-form gene expression was calculated relative to P-form. Three replicates were performed for each biological sample.
