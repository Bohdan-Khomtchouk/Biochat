TITLE
Nitrogen-ion-beam implantation effect on rice dry seeds

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Analysis of 96-hours-old-rice seedlings with promoted-growth induced by implantation with low-energy nitrogen ion beam. Ion-beam implantation can induce changes in 351 up-regulated transcripts and 470 down-regulated transcripts, including signaling proteins, kinases, plant hormones, transposable elements, transcription factors, non-coding protein RNAs, secondary metabolites, resistance proteins, peroxidase, chromatin modification and even miRNAs. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of biological effects of plants that implanted by ion beam.

DESIGN
Three sample groupsâ€”the controls, the ion-beam implanted samples and vacuum-treated samples. Three replicates were included in each sample group. Radiation induced gene expression rice seedlings was measured at 96 hours after germination of the seeds.
