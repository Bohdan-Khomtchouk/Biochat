TITLE
Nitrogen-ion-beam implantation effect on rice dry seeds

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of 96-hours-old-rice seedlings with promoted-growth induced by implantation with low-energy nitrogen ion beam. Ion-beam implantation can induce changes in 351 up-regulated transcripts and 470 down-regulated transcripts, including signaling proteins, kinases, plant hormones, transposable elements, transcription factors, non-coding protein RNAs, secondary metabolites, resistance proteins, peroxidase, chromatin modification and even miRNAs. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of biological effects of plants that implanted by ion beam.
