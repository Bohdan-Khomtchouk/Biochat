TITLE
Transcriptomics of THP-1 host cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection is a dialog between the pathogen and the host. Understanding the molecular basis of infection requires understanding the responses and adaptations of both the pathogen and host as a consequence of this dialog. We studied Mtb infection in human THP-1 cells by transcriptomics profiling of host expression over the course of an acute to anestablished infection.
