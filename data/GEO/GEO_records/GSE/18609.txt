TITLE
MicroRNA Expression in Kidney Development Comparing E14.5 and P1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was performed to identify miRNAs that are differentially regulated during mouse kidney development. Two stages (E14.5 and P1) were analyzed. Differential expression was verified using qPCR and/or in situ hybridization.

DESIGN
Multiple kidneys were dissected, pooled and processed for total mRNA isolation. Probe labeling, hybridization and data analysis were performed by Exiqon. The three submitted sample files are technical replicas using the same mRNAs.
