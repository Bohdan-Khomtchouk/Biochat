TITLE
MicroRNA Expression in Kidney Development Comparing E14.5 and P1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was performed to identify miRNAs that are differentially regulated during mouse kidney development. Two stages (E14.5 and P1) were analyzed. Differential expression was verified using qPCR and/or in situ hybridization.
