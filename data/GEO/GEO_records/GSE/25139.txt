TITLE
miRNA expression profile of follicular (FO) and marginal zone (MZ) B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed miRNA expression profile in FO and MZ B cells to identified differentially expressed miRNAs between this two subsets that could be potencially involved in the regulation of terminal B cell differentiation

DESIGN
Spleens from CD19-Creki/+Dicerfl/+ and CD19-Creki/+Dicerfl/fl mice were collected and after erythrocyte lysis, splenocytes were stained with anti-B220, anti-CD21 and anti-CD23 antibodies. B220+CD21brightCD23+ (MZ) and B220+CD21+CD23bright (FO) B cell populations were sorted and total RNA of purified populations was extracted with TRIzol. miRNA microarray hybridations were performed on Mouse miRNA Microarray platform (Agilent Technologies).
