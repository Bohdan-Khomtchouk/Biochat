TITLE
Expression data from human airway epithelia exposed to IL13

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL13 exposure results in a distinct gene expression profile in human airway epithelia. We investigated whether this expression profile can be used to identify compounds able to block goblet cell metaplasia We used microarrays to determine transcriptional changes in cultures of primary human airway epithelia grown at the air-liquid interface after exposure to 20 ng/mL recombinant human IL13

DESIGN
Air-liquid interface cultures of primary airway epithelia from 3 de-identified human donors with no known disease were exposed to apical and basolateral IL13 or vehicle at a concentration of 20ng/mL for 21 days. RNA was extracted and processed for Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
