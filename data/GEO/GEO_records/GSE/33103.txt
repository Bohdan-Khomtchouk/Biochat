TITLE
Overall aiEMT in surgical samples of esophageal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Surgical samples have long been used as important subjects for cancer research. In accordance with an increase of neoadjuvant therapy, biopsy samples have recently become imperative for cancer transcriptome. On the other hand, both biopsy and surgical samples are available for expression profiling for predicting clinical outcome by adjuvant therapy; however, it is still unclear whether surgical sample expression profiles are useful for the prediction by the use of biopsy samples because little has been done about comparative gene expression profiling between the two kinds of samples. When gene expression profiles were compared between biopsy and surgical samples, artificially induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (aiEMT) was found in the surgical samples. This study will evoke the fundamental misinterpretation including underestimation of the prognostic evaluation power of markers by overestimation of EMT in past cancer research, and will furnish some advice for the near future as follows: 1) Understanding how long the tissues were under an ischemic condition; 2) Prevalence of biopsy samples for in vivo expression profiling with low biases on basic and clinical research; and 3) Checking cancer cell contents and normal- or necrotic-tissue contamination in biopsy samples for prevalence.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles between 31 biopsy (A, D) and 65 surgical (O) samples derived from the cancerous portion of the esophagus of different esophageal cancer patients.
