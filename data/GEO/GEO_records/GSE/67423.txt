TITLE
MiR-29a regulates liver fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To confirm the mechanism of miR-29a in liver fibrosis healing, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes. CCl4 and TAA liver fibrosis model mouse were used for this experiment. After five weeks liver fibrosis induction period, mouse have been observed for one week (1w) or two weeks (2w) and negative control nucleotide (N.C) or miR-29a were injected every 3 days on this period. We used CCl4 1w N.C (n = 1), 1w miR-29a (n = 1), 2w N.C (n = 1), 2w miR-29a (n = 1), and also used TAA model mouse (total n = 8) liver samples for microarray analysis. We can get only one gene (PDGF-c) as a target of miR-29a which relate to liver fibrosis and down-regulated more than 1.5 times in common miR-29a injected group than N.C group.

DESIGN
CCl4 and TAA liver fibrosis model mouse were used for this experiment. After five weeks liver fibrosis induction period, mouse have been obserbed for one week (1w) or two weeks (2w) and negative control nucleotide (N.C) or miR-29a were injected every 3 days on this period. We used CCl4 1w N.C (n = 1), 1w miR-29a (n = 1), 2w N.C (n = 1), 2w miR-29a (n = 1), and also used TAA model mouse (total n = 8) liver samples for microarray analysis.
