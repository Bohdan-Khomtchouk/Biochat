TITLE
cirDNA methylome analysis in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA modification profiling of circulating DNA (cirDNA) from plasma samples from prostate cancer patients (T2-3N0Mx), benign prostatic hyperplasia and control individuals Epigenetic differences are a common feature of many diseases, including cancer, and disease-associated changes have even been detected in bodily fluids. DNA modification studies in circulating DNA (cirDNA) may lead to the development of specific non-invasive biomarkers.

DESIGN
Three-conditions experiment: Prostate cancer (n=19), bening prostatic hyperplasia (n=20), controls without any know prostatic disease (n=20). cirDNA was isolated and the modified fraction of the genome was enriched using DNA-modification-sensitive digestion and adaptor-mediated PCR. Enriched fraction was labelled with Cy3. DNA samples extracted from white blood cells (WBC) of 20 individuals unrelated to this project were pooled and used as reference (Cy5-labelled).
