TITLE
Developmental changes in transcriptomes of two key transport tissues in maize kernels: The Maternal Transfer Zone (MATZ) and Basal Endosperm Transfer Layer (BETL)

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles of MATZ and BETL tissues are compared across three stages of development. Sugars and other nutrients unloaded from vascular tissues in the MATZ are imported by the BETL for utilization by the developing endosperm.  Pronounced changes in gene expression occur in both tissues during kernel development.

DESIGN
RNAseq data were obtained from duplicate tissue samples isolated by cryomicrodissection of developing maize kernels at three developmental time points; 8 days post-pollination (DAP), 14 DAP and 20 DAP.

PLATFORM
GPL15463 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Zea mays)
