TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their differentiated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the gene expression changes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during differentiation, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from undifferentiated hESCs and their differentiated cells incubated for 1 week or 2 weeks in ESC medium.

DESIGN
Human SNUhES3 ESCs (Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea) were cultured on mitotically-arrested STO feeder cells (ATCC, Manassas, USA) in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement (KSR). The embryoid bodies were incubated for 1 or 2 weeks in the above ESC medium without bFGF. Cells were then lysed and RNA was isolated.
