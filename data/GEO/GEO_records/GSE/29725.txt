TITLE
Global gene expression analysis for mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells and adult mouse hepatocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to characterize iHep cells more precisely, we conducted global gene expression analyses using microarrays to compare among the gene expression profiles of MEFs, iHep cells and adult mouse hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Three MEF samples that were individually prepared from 13.5 days post coitum (dpc) embryos, three types of iHep cells and hepatocytes obtained from the adult mouse liver were used.
