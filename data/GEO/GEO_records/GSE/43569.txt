TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Botrytis cinerea  conidial germination reveals upregulation of infection-related genes during the pre-penetration stage

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Botrytis cinerea wild type conidia during germination in comparison to the bmp1 MAP kinase deletion mutant.

DESIGN
A 18 chip study using total RNA recovered from four different time points for the wild-type and one time point for the bmp1 deletion mutant. Each time point was analyzed with three biological replicates. Expression level of 20,885 genes from Botrytis cinerea strain B05.10 and T4 with three 60mer probes per gene was analysed.
