TITLE
Network-based analysis of carbohydrate-active gene transcription in Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Transcriptomics was performed on batch cultivations of A. niger grown on three monosaccharides and three complex carbohydrates with defined compositions as to allow the detection of cross-induction if present, and for demonstration of how enzyme interaction graphics can be used to visualize the global transcription response.

DESIGN
Batch cultivations of A. niger were grown in shake-flasks on one of three monosaccharides (arabinose, glucose, xylose) or one of three complex carbohydrates (arabinan, starch, xylan). Three replicates were performed for each monosaccharide and complex carbohydrate, except for starch, where two replicates were performed.
