TITLE
AngII-regulated genes sensitive to CsA in Vascular Smooth muscle cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a platform to identify  AngII -regulated genes sensitive to CsA.  VSMC were treated with AngII with or without CsA ( as an inhibitor of the CN/NFAT pathway).

DESIGN
4 independent VSMC cultures (4 replicates) from aortas of C57BL/6 mice were used for each condition (1uM AngII or 1uM AngII+200ng/ml CsA).

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
