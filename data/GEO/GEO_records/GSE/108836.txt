TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing reveals candidate NF-κB target genes involved in cocaine sensitization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor complex that is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli. In the current study, we performed next-generation high-throughput sequencing of the prefrontal cortex in a mouse model of cocaine sensitization combined with pharmacological NF-κB inhibition in order to identify NF-κB target genes that mediate cocaine addiction.

DESIGN
1µg of RNA from a pool of 5 animals (200ng each) of each group was sequenced: (1) saline + saline (SS, n=10), (2) DDTC + saline (DS, n=10), (3) DDTC + cocaine (DC, n=10), and (4) saline + cocaine (SC, n=10)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
