TITLE
Vibrio cholerae vpsT microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Rugose V. cholerae cells with an in-frame deletion of vpsT (VCA0952) were used in this study.  Cells containing pBAD-Myc/His-B vector, or the vector containing a wild-type copy of vpsT, or vpsT with point mutations M17D, D60A, R134A, or I141E were grown to exponential phase and expression profiles compared.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were performed for each strain and dye swaps were performed for each treatment.  Reference sample consisted of V. cholerae cells with an in-frame deletion of vpsT carrying the pBAD-Myc/His-B vector.
