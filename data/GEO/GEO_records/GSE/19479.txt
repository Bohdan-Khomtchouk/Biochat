TITLE
Vibrio cholerae vpsT microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Rugose V. cholerae cells with an in-frame deletion of vpsT (VCA0952) were used in this study.  Cells containing pBAD-Myc/His-B vector, or the vector containing a wild-type copy of vpsT, or vpsT with point mutations M17D, D60A, R134A, or I141E were grown to exponential phase and expression profiles compared.
