TITLE
RNA sequencing of WT and Uhrf1 KO  iNKT cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of Uhrf1 resulted in stage 1-specific defects during iNKT cell development. To investigate the molecular mechanism, we sorted WT and Uhrf1-KO stage 1 iNKT cells and performed RNA-seq. By comparing gene expression profile, we found metabolic defects in Uhrf1-KO stage 1 iNKT cells. The expression of CD71 (Tfrc), two subunits of CD98 (Slc3a2 and Slc7a5) and Glut3 (Slc2a3) was reduced in stage 1 iNKT cells. Besides, the downstream pathways of AKT-mTOR axis were significantly reduced. Collectively, our results suggest that Uhrf1 is required for iNKT cell development by regulating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

DESIGN
We first sorted WT and Uhrf1-KO stage 1 iNKT cells, extracted the mRNA and performed RNA-seq. We then analyzed the differentially expressed genes and performed KEGG pathway analysis. We used RT-PCR to verify the expression of the key nutrient related genes (Tfrc, Slc3a2, Slc7a5 and Slc2a3) and used flow cytometry to test the protein level of metabolic related molecules. Besides, we also analyzed the expression of genes of mTOR downstream pathways to demonstrate that Uhrf1 mediated AKt-mTOR axis regulates iNKT cell development.
