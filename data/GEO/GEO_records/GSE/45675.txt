TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in host defense during high multiplicity mycobacterial infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment is to compare the transcription patterns of mouse macrophages (J774A.1) infected with BCG, H37Ra and M. smegmatis under high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Through the global transcriptome profiling study, we define a pathogen specific host gene expression pattern and indicate that SRC likely plays a central role in regulating multiple unique signaling pathways activated by MTB infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infects an estimated one-third of the global population and is one of the main causes of mortality due to an infectious agent.

DESIGN
high multiplicity mycobacterial infection of BCG, H37Ra and M.semg
