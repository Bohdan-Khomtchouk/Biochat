TITLE
Expression data from yeast cells with pop2 deletion and overexpressing STM1 or STM1 R237K mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A880 has pop2 deletion and a very slow-growth phenotype with glycerol as carbon source. A880 transformed with 2-micron plasmids encoding STM1 can grow robustly on glycerol plates. The Arg237 on Stm1p can be methylated by Hmt1p. A880 transformed with 2-micron plasmids encoding the Stm1p R237K mutant retain the slow-growth phenotype on glycerol plates. We used microarrays to assess the transcription profiles of A880, and A880 transformed with STM1 or STM1 R237K mutant. The goal is to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated in the presence of STM1 R237K mutant but not in the presence of the wild type STM1.

DESIGN
BY4741 (wild type control), A880 (BY4741 with pop2 deletion), A880STM1 (A880 transformed with STM1) and A880STM1K (A880 transformed with STM1 carrying an Arg237 to lysine substitution) cells were grown in SC medium with glucose as carbon source to early log phase. The cells were shifted to SC medium containing 2% glycerol and incubated for 12 hours before harvesting.  Total RNAs were extracted for microarray analysis. Two data sets were generated from separate experiments and cell cultures.
