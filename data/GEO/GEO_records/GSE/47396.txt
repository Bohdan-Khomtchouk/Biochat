TITLE
Sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine is affected by microRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the relationship between miRNA expression and the sensitivity of CCA cells to Gem. Two intrahepatic CCA cell lines, HuH28 and HuCCT1 were used. HuCCT1 cells were more sensitive to Gem than were HuH28 cells. The miRNA expression profiles of HuH28 and HuCCT1 were determined by microarray analysis. Eighteen miRNAs were differentially expressed whose ratios over ± 2log2 between HuH28 and HuCCT1. Among these 18 miRNAs, ectopic overexpression of each of three downregulated miRNAs in HuH28 (miR-29b, miR-205, miR-221) restored Gem sensitivity to HuH28. Suppression of one upregulated miRNA in HuH28, miR-125a-5p, inhibited HuH28 cell proliferation independently to Gem treatment.

DESIGN
Cell lines and cultures  Two human intrahepatic CCA cell lines, HuCCT1 and HuH28, were purchased from Japan Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Each cell line was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corp., CA, USA) that contained 10% fetal bovine serum (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and in humidified conditions at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2. Antibiotics were not added to the culture medium when cells were prepared for transfection with miRNA mimics or oligonucleotides.   Gem treatment  Gem hydrochloride was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). A stock solution was prepared at 1 mmol/L (1 x 10-3 M) and was further diluted to anyone of several different final working concentrations from 1 x 10-4 to 1 x 10-7 M with cell culture medium that lacked antibiotics. Transfection of miRNA mimics, antisense oligonucleotides, or siRNA for miRNA target genes were performed 24 hr before the Gem treatment. All assays were conducted 72 hr after Gem treatment.
