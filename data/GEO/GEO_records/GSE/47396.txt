TITLE
Sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine is affected by microRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the relationship between miRNA expression and the sensitivity of CCA cells to Gem. Two intrahepatic CCA cell lines, HuH28 and HuCCT1 were used. HuCCT1 cells were more sensitive to Gem than were HuH28 cells. The miRNA expression profiles of HuH28 and HuCCT1 were determined by microarray analysis. Eighteen miRNAs were differentially expressed whose ratios over Â± 2log2 between HuH28 and HuCCT1. Among these 18 miRNAs, ectopic overexpression of each of three downregulated miRNAs in HuH28 (miR-29b, miR-205, miR-221) restored Gem sensitivity to HuH28. Suppression of one upregulated miRNA in HuH28, miR-125a-5p, inhibited HuH28 cell proliferation independently to Gem treatment.
