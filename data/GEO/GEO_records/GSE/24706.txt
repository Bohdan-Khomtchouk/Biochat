TITLE
Gene Expression profiling of human PBMCs with different ANA titer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total 48 samples with different ANA titer were analyzed for their gene expression profiles with Illumina HumanWG-6 V3 chips

DESIGN
10 healthy control (HC) samples with high ANA, 7 first degree relative of SLE patientw (FDR) with high ANA, 10 HCs with low ANA, 6 FDR with low ANA, 15 SLE patients (SLE) with high ANA were used for the microarray analysis.
