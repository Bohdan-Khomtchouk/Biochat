TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of HEK 293T cells depleted of endogenous miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of AdV-VP55 mediated degredation of host miRNAs on the cellular transcriptome.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HEK 293T cells treated with type 5 Adeno vectors expressing either GFP or GFP-VP55 for 24 hours
