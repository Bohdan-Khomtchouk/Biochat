TITLE
miRNAs expression in HepG2-HBx and HepG2-URG11

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compare microRNAs expression when HepG2 cells stably expressing HBx protein with HepG2 control cells expressing baterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Compare microRNAs expression when HepG2 cells stably expressing URG11 protein with HepG2 control cells expressing baterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase

DESIGN
