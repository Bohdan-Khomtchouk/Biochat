TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes during long-term induction of EMT in EpRas tumor cells by TGF-b1.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EMT is a developmental process, which can be reactivated in cancer cells. Cancer cells maintaining EMT in the circulation may have pro-metastatic properties. We used microarrays to profile EMT-related gene expression changes after 14 d of TGF-b1 treatment.

DESIGN
EpRas cells were cultured in standard conditions either in the presence of absence of recombinant TGF-b1 (2 ng/ml) for 14 d. After this period, RNA was isolated from triplicate wells of treated and non-treated cells, and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
