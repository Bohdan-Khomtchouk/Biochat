TITLE
Adult versus P7 mouse brain gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory studies the role of carbohydrates in the development of the central nervous system.

DESIGN
Comparison of glycosyltransferase gene expression in developing rodent cerebellum with the aim of understanding the regulation of tissue-specific glycans RNA from adult and postnatal day 7 BALB/c mouse cerebellum was extracted and analyzed for differences in glycosyltransferase expression. Three replicate samples were processed for each age group and hybridized to the GLYCOv2 array.
