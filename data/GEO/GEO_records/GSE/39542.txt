TITLE
Isw2 and Ume6 ChIP-chip in transcription factor deletion (Δume6, Δnrg1, Δcin5, and Δsok2) and DNA-looping deficient (sua7-1) cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The sequence-specific transcription factors Ume6, Nrg1, Cin5, and Sok2 and the general transcription factor TFIIB mediate the genome-wide targeting of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme Isw2.

DESIGN
At least two biological replicates comparing Isw2-ChIP (Isw2-K215R ChIP DNA competitively hybridized against WT Isw2 ChIP DNA) in WT and Δume6, Δnrg1, Δcin5, Δsok2, and sua7-1 strains or Ume6-ChIP (ChIP DNA competitively hybridized again Input DNA) in WT and sua7-1 strains
