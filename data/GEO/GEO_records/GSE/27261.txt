TITLE
Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) conditional knockout expression analysis of P28 testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) is a conserved transcriptional regulator of male differentiation required for testicular development in vertebrates.  This study examines the result of conditional removal of Dmrt1 from Sertoli cells in P28 testis tissue.

DESIGN
Testes from P28 Dmrt1 flox/flox mice were compared to testes from P28 Dmrt1 flox/flox mice with the Sertoli cell-specific Sf1 (Nr5a1; MGI:1346833) or Dhh (MGI:94891) promoters driving Cre expression.
