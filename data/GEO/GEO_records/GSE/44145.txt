SUMMARY
We determined pattern of miRNAs of mild-to-severe human pulmonary arterial hypertension and compared the with health controls using microarray and subsequently validated by QPCRs Manuscript Title: Circulating miRNAs as novel marker for pulmonary hypertension.  (Under Revision Plos One  Manuscript ID: PONE-D-12-38535)

DESIGN
Performed microRNA microarray from one healthy and one severe PH patient and compared the results using additional samples by qPCR for other miRNAs
