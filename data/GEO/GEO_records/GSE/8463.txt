TITLE
Whole genome ChIP/chip tiling of human ES cells for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using monoclonal antibodiesd. DNA was amplified, fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a series of 38 arrays containing a total of 14.6 million 50-mer oligonucleotides Keywords: ChIP-chip hES whole genome

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from H3K4me
