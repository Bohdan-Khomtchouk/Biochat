TITLE
Identify the dysregulated miRNA in human colorectal cancer tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulated miRNA in human colorectal cancer (CRC) were identified through comparison between 4 CRC tumors and their adjacent normal tissues by miRNA array. Histologically-confirmed CRC were included in this study. CRC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were obtained from the resected surgical specimens. The adjacent normal tissue is composed of normal colonic mucosa located at approximately 10 cm away from the cancer tissue. miRNA profiling of 754 human miRNAs was performed using TaqMan Human MiRNA Array Set v3.0. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was performed using Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed by the SDS RQ Manager 1.2 software (Applied Biosystems).

DESIGN
4 CRC tissues and 4 adjacent normal tissues were subjucted to qPCR based miRNA expression profiling. Equal amount of total RNA were used for analysis.
