TITLE
Characterization of an abiraterone ultra-responsive phenotype in castration-resistant prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular signature associated with abiraterone acetate (AA) response and mechanisms underlying AA resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).

DESIGN
SCID mice bearing LuCaP 136CR, 77CR, 96CR, and 35CR PDXs were treated with AA. Tumors response were followed, and tumors were harvested 7 days post-treatment (D7) and at end of study (EOS) for gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array Plate platform.  Four replicates per PDX, treatment, and timepoint were profiled.
