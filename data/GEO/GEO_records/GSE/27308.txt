TITLE
Using Model Organism Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to Evaluate the Differential Effects of ELF-MF and RF-EMF exposure on Global Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The potential health hazard of exposures to electromagnetic fields (EMF) continues to cause much public concern. However, the biological and health effects of exposures to EMF remain controversial and their biophysical mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify genes responding to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and to radiofrequency (RF) EMF exposures. The expression of genes was analyzed by microarray screening and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction. In confirmation experiments, we found that there was no statistically significant change in three of the ELF-MF responsive candidate genes (P > 0.05). On the other hand, out of the forty genes that responded to RF-EMF, the confirmation experiments found that only five were affected: structural maintenance of chromosomes 3-gene (SMC3), aquaporin 2 –gene (AQY2), halotolerance protein 9 –gene (HAL9), yet another kinase 1 -gene (YAK1) and one of unknown function gene (open reading frame: YJL171C) (P < 0.05). Overall, this study has demonstrated that the yeast cells did not respond to 50 Hz ELF-MF and that the response to RF-EMF is limited to only five genes. The biological consequences of the observed gene expression changes induced by RF-EMF await further investigation.

DESIGN
The yeast cells were exposed to 0.4 mT 50 Hz ELF-MF or 1800 MHz RF-EMF at a specific absorption rate of 3.5 W/kg for 6 hours.
