TITLE
Site-specific silencing of regulatory elements as a mechanism of X-inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The inactive X chromosomeâ€™s (Xi) physical territory is microscopically devoid of transcriptional hallmarks and enriched in silencing-associated modifications. How these microscopic signatures relate to specific Xi sequence is unknown. This study reports the profiling of Xi gene expression and chromatin states at high-resolution via allele-specific sequencing in F1 hybrid mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Datasets provided include those generated from strand-specific RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, FAIRE-Seq, and DNase-Seq protocols. Included for each dataset are FASTQ files, BED alignments and WIG files with coordinates relative to UCSC genome build mm9, and _snp files that report the location of all SNP-overlapping reads.

DESIGN
The F1 TSC lines profiled were generated from crosses between CAST/EiJ (Cast) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice. C/B denotes a Cast mother and B6 father, and B/C denotes a B6 mother and Cast father.
