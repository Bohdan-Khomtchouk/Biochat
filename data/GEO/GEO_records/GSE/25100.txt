TITLE
Expression data from CD19-positive splenic B cells isolated from 1-month old ID4+/-TCL1-tg and ID4+/+TCL1-tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The function of ID4 in CLL development was studied in vivo using TCL1 transgenic mouse model that develop leukemia similar to human CLL. TCL1 mice with ID4 single knockout gene have accelerated CLL progression. Results from the animal study suggest ID4 as a tumor suppressor gene that might regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in B lymphocytes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in CD19-positive splenic B cells collected from 1-month old ID4+/-TCL1-tg and ID4+/+TCL1-tg mice was compared by microarray, the goal is to find ID4-regulated genes involved in CLL development.
