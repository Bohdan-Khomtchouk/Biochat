TITLE
PatE in transcriptional activation of acid-resistance pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain EDL933

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
An experiment to identify the downstream targets of PatE, a prophage encoded AraC-like transcriptional regulator, in transcriptional activation of acid-resistance pathways of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain EDL933 using deletion and complementation strains (Delta3 and Delta3_1, respectively).

DESIGN
Incomplete 2 factor with dye swaps. Genotype: 3 levels (wt, detla3, delta3_1)  Bicarbonate: 2 levels (pos, neg) on wt only. 4 biological replicates, 2 in each dye orientation. Microarrays processed at Australian Genome Research Facility.

PLATFORM
GPL15383 Agilent-020666 EHEC_EDL933_O157_H7_Antisense
