TITLE
Daphnia miRNA expression data from Cadmium exposed and none-exposed samples

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile the Dapnia pulex miRNA expression under Cadmium exposure and identified Cadmium-responsive miRNAs

DESIGN
D. pulex were exposed to Cadmium concentration of 0 ppb (control), 20ppb(Cd-low) and 40ppb(Cd-high) for 48h.  Each treatment has three biological replicates for expression profile by Affymetrix microarray.
