TITLE
Gene expression changes associated with KIAA1199 expression in SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify gene expression changes upon expression of KIAA1199 in a colon cancer cell line.

DESIGN
Inducible expression of KIAA1199A was achieved with a two-step procedure. First, SW480 cells were transfected with the pcDNA6TR vector (Invitrogen) and the tetracycline repressor-expressing cells selected with 7 Î¼g/ml blasticidin S (InvivoGen).  The blasticidin-resistant cells were then transfected with the pT-Rex-DEST30-KIAA1199 construct (see below) and selected with 0.4 mg/ml G418.  The growth medium used for these cells was supplemented with 10% Tet-system-approved fetal calf serum (Biochrom).
