TITLE
expression data of WT and ced1 under osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ced1 mutant has reduced expression of NCED3  in response to osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol) treatments compared to the wild type.  Other ABA biosynthesis genes are also greatly reduced in ced1 under osmotic stress. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression under osmotic stress treatment and identified distinct classes of up/down-regulated genes in the stress pathway.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings were selected at 16 days with 6hr PEG treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. From Norther data we have known some of well-known stress responsive gene were significantly changed. We sought to obtain whole gene expression to analysis which genes were affected in the osmotic stress pathway.
