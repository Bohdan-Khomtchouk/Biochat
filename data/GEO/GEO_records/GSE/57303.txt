TITLE
Expression data from 70 gastric cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the spectrum of genetic aberrations of Chinese gastric cancer, 70 samples were further profiled by Affymetrix Hu133Plus2 arrays for mRNA expression

DESIGN
70 gastric cancer frozen tumor tissues were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All these samples have been also profiled using Agilent 244K array CGH technology.
