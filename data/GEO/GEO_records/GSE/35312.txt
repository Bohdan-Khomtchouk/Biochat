TITLE
Integrative array-based approach identifies MZB1 as a frequently methylated putative tumor-suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma  (MeDIP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The analysis of DNA methylation profiles was performed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) using anti-5-methylcytidine antibody (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) followed by the Human 244K Agilent CpG island microarray (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA)

DESIGN
Genomic DNAs from Hep3B, HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were used for cancer samples and that from a normal liver tissue from surgical sample of colon cancer metastasis, as a control sample (C20)

PLATFORM
GPL4126 Agilent-014791 Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K (G4492A) (Feature Number version)
