TITLE
Role of Tet1 and Tet3 genes and Chromatin Remodeling in Cerebellar Circuit Formation [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of mRNA samples purified from developing cerebellar granule cells and ES cell-derived granule cells using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method. Although mechanisms underlying early steps in cerebellar development are known, evidence is lacking on genetic and epigenetic changes during the establishment of the synaptic circuitry. Using metagene analysis, we report pivotal changes in multiple reactomes of epigenetic pathway genes in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) during circuit formation.  During this stage, Tet genes are up-regulated and vitamin C activation of Tet enzymes increases the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at exon start sites of up-regulated genes, notably axon guidance genes and ion channel genes.  Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet3 by RNA interference in ex vivo cerebellar slice cultures inhibits dendritic arborization of developing GCs, a critical step in circuit formation.  These findings demonstrate a role for Tet genes and chromatin remodeling genes in the formation of cerebellar circuitry.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression of cerebellar granule cells and ES cell-derived granule cells using the Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by metagene analysis which was developed by the Broad Institute.
