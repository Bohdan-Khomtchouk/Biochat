TITLE
Affymetrix 250K StyI SNP array data from PBMCs and cell lines of metastatic melanoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Allele call files from on 250K StyI SNP array using DNA from 60 human cell lines from metastasized melanoma and from 44 corresponding peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CEL and CHP files provided).

DESIGN
Analysis of the 250K StyI arrays was performed for 60 malignant melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic tumors of melanoma patients with GCOS and GTYPE (Affymetrix). In addition, DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was available for 44 of the 60 samples.
