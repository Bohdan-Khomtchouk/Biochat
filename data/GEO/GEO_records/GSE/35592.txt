TITLE
Microarray analysis of wildtype and Klf3 KO E14.5 fetal liver cells (TER119- and TER119+)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to investigate the role of KLF3 in regulating gene expression at different stages throughout the erythroid maturation process. Affymetrix microarrays were performed on fetal liver cells (both TER119- progenitor cells and TER119+ erythroblast cells) from E14.5 wildtype and Klf3 KO mice.

DESIGN
Four wildtype TER119- replicates, four Klf3 KO TER119- replicates, four wildtype TER119+ replicates, three Klf3 KO TER119+ replicates. All are from E14.5 fetal liver.
