TITLE
Temporal gene expression profiling of myeloid cells during the peritoneal foreign body response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study dermined the temporal gene expression profile of myeloid subpopulations recruited to the peritoneal cavity to encapsulate implanted foreign material.

DESIGN
Sterile foreign objects  were inserted into the peritoneal cavities of MacGreen mice (in which the Csf1r promoter directs myeloid-specific EGFP expression).  At various time-points post-surgery (days 2, 4, 7, 14), mice were euthanased, and peritoneal exudate cells removed by lavage.  Peritoneal exudate cells from MacGreen mice that had not received implants were used as controls (day 0; 'unstimulated').  Free-floating objects encapsulated with tissue were removed from the peritoneal cavities of different mice at days 7, 14, 21, 28 days, and single cell suspensions obtained by collagenase digestion.  Single-cell suspensions from peritoneal exudate or tissue capsules  were separated on the basis of size/granularity and EGFP  fluorescence using FacsVantage SE Diva. Total RNA was extracted from FACS-sorted EGFP-hi cells.
