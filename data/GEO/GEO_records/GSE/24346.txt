TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in Sfmbt1-knockdown C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed to identify Sfmbt1-dependent regulation in myogenic programs. To establish the magnitude of the Sfmbt1 effect on muscle cells, we have compared gene expression profiles of C2C12 cells transduced with lentiviruses expressing scramble shRNA control or shSfmbt1. Our analysis suggested that Sfmbt1 critically confers transcriptional silencing of muscle genes in myogenic progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for each sample group: C2C12 cells stably transduced with pLKO.1 expressing scramble shRNA control and C2C12 cells transduced with pLKO.1 shSFMBT1. Samples were independently cultured and RNAs were then harvested for microarray analysis.
