TITLE
Characterizing the contrasting roles of JMJD3 and UTX histone demethylases in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [GSKJ4_RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an immature hematopoietic malignancy driven mainly by oncogenic activation of NOTCH1 signaling. In this study we chemically inhibited the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3 using the GSKJ4 inhibitor and assayed for genome-wide changes in H3K27me3 and JMJD3 enrichment. This piece of data was further integrated to expression changes using RNA sequencing as well as ChIP-Sequencing analysis of H3K27me3 upon genomic knock-down of JMJD3 and UTX. These results, coupled to genomic analysis of primary samples for the genomic status of the UTX gene in T-ALL, helped us to identify a hitherto unknown role of JMJD3 as an oncogenice facilitator in leukemia whereas UTX seems to play a tumor suppressor role.

DESIGN
Whole RNA was extracted from 1-5 million primary cells from CUTLL1 human T cell leukemia cells untreated or treated with 2micromolar GSKJ4 using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Poly-A+ (magnetic oligodT-containing beads (Invitrogen)) or Ribominus RNA was used for library preparation. cDNA preparation and strand-specific library construction was performed using the dUTP method. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 50bp single-read method. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between knockout vs wild-type background samples. Analysis was performed using DEGseq package leading to very similar conclusions.
