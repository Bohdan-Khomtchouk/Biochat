TITLE
MAPK/ERK activation determines a distinct transcriptional program following neuronal activity in the murine hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kanate was used to induce seizures in mice, and gene expression in the hippocampus was measured Using MEK inhibitors, MEK-dependent gene expression was assessed.

DESIGN
Untreated controls were measured in biological quadruplicates, three mice were used for each condition (3 hippocampi for vehicle controls, kinate induced seizures, MEK inhibitor treated, and MEK inhibitor plus kinases induced seizures)
