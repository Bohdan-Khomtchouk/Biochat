TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 swap

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome abundance analysis of Salmonella Typhimurium strain SL1344 swap which has been genetically engineered to express the hns open-reading frame from the stpA promoter and the stpA open reading frame from the hns promoter. This strain is designated SL1344(swap). Transcript abundance was compared with that of wild-type SL1344. This comparison was performed to determine the effect of chromosome location of the expression of two related global regulators and how alterations to their expression patterns would impact on their regulons.

DESIGN
Three independent RNA samples were harvested from wild-type SL1344 and SL1344(swap) grown to exponential phase (OD600nm = 0.3) and hybridized to a microarray containing multiple probes for each of the SL1344 open reading frames. Please note that the original raw data file for the 'SL1344_wildtype_BR2' sample is unavailable, however, the 'wildtype SL1344 BR2.gpr' contains the raw data missing only the header information.
