TITLE
Regional difference in gene expression of proliferating human choroidal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the differences in gene expression between matched human macular and peripheral choroidal endothelial cells (CEC) and matched human macular inner and outer CEC. The gene expression profiles of the unpassaged cell types were compared using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.

DESIGN
9 arrays are included. 6mm diameter samples were dissected from 3 regions of the eye: peripheral inner choroid, macular outer choroid and macular inner choroid.  RNA extracts from cells were hybridised to Affymetrix HGU133plus2 arrays in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
