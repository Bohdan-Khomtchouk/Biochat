TITLE
Over-expression of truncated FMRP with 295 amino acid residues: HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in stably transfected HEK 293T cells of the over-expression of truncated FMRP containing 295 amino acid residues, which were compared with control (stably transfected HEK 293T cells of empty lentiviral vector (pLEX-MCS).

DESIGN
Stably transfected HEK 293T cells of empty lentiviral vector (pLEX-MCS) and the over-expression of truncated FMRP were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
