TITLE
Expression data from Sertoli cells treated with 0.1μM NP, 0.1mM MBP, 0.1μM NP+0.1mM MBP and solvent control

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The combined effects of NP and MBP were much more toxic than NP or MBP exposed alone. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes and miRNAs after treated with 0.1μM NP, 0.1mM MBP, 0.1μM NP+0.1mM MBP and solvent control.

DESIGN
Rat Sertoli cell were selected from rat testis for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs in 0.1μM NP, 0.1mM MBP, 0.1μM NP+0.1mM MBP and solvent control treated Sertoli cells, respectively.
