TITLE
Transcriptional response of Candida dubliniensis during hypha formation and environmental change

ORGANISM
Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of Candida dubliniensis during hypha formation and environmental change (temperature, pH, density and nutrients). Transcript profiling of C. dubliniensis identified a core shared transcriptional response with C. albicans during hypha formation and growth at alkaline pH. However, C. albicans expresses several unique hypha-specific genes, including ALS3, HYR1 and SAP4 and 5. Transcript profiling also revealed a novel role for NRG1 in regulating ferric reductases in C. dubliniensis.

DESIGN
8 experimental parameters were analysed, each carried out in quadruplicate. Dye-swaps were performed.

PLATFORM
