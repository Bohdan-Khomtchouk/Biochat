TITLE
Small RNAs from Arabidopsis plants infected with CMV-∆2b

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We focused our analyses on the description of viral (CMV-∆2b) and, based on genetic and molecular evidence, classified them and discussed their relevance in antiviral defense.

DESIGN
Small RNAs from Arabidopsis plants from different genetic backgrounds infected with (CMV-∆2b) were sequenced before or after immunoprecipitation with antibodies against key proteins involved in antiviral defense.

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
