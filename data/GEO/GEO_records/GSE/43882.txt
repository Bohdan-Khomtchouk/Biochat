TITLE
SW1 mutant vs. Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
The prophage and RF DNA of SW1 were removed from WP3 to construct the phage-free strain. The two strains were cultured at 4°C and the transcriptional profiles were compared.

DESIGN
WP3ΔSW1 is the test sample and WP3 wild-type is the reference sample. Three independent cultures were used for RNA extraction, and the RNA samples were combined into one sample for microarray. Each microarray slide has 3 spots for a single gene, and as dye-swaps were performed, 6 spots were used to determine the expression level of one gene.
