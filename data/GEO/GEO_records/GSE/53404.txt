TITLE
Analysis of global gene expression in fetal astrocytes and pluripotent stem cell derived neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared between two sets of commercially obtained fetal astrocytes and two sets of neuronal stem cell lines derived from iPSC and ES cells.  Pathways and genes critical for astrocyte development and maintenance were identified in the analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from fetal astrocytes from two sources compared to total RNA obtained from two neuronal stem cell lines.
