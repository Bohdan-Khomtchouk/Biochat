TITLE
RNA Sequencing Analysis to evaluate essential oil dietary supplementation effects in lamb liver and muscle transcriptome

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Purpose:  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of essentail oil dietary supplementation on gene expression in liver and muscle tissue.

DESIGN
A total of 32 RNA samples, 16 for muscle and for liver (8 control and 8 treatment) were sequenced on two lanes of Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform generating 101 base-paired end reads.

PLATFORM
GPL24603 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Ovis aries)
