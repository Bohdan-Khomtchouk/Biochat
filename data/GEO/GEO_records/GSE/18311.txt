TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in wild type and angustifoila3 leaf primorida

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Development of a flat structure of leaves depend on active expansion of leaf blades mediated by cell proliferation. The angustifolia3 (an3) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are defective in cell proliferation in leaf primorida. AN3 encodes a transcription coactivator and interacts with a putative transcription factor AtGRF5. To investigate how AN3 control cell proliferation, we compared gene expression profiles between an3 and wild type. This analysis provide an insight into AN3-dependent cell proliferation pathway.

DESIGN
Comparison between an3-4 and wild type. Two replicates for each sample.
