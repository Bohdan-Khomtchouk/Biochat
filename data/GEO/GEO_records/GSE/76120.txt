TITLE
Transcriptional regulators compete with nucleosomes post-replication

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Every nucleosome across the genome must be disrupted and reformed when the replication fork passes, but how chromatin organization is re-established following replication is unknown. To address this problem, we have developed Mapping In vivo Nascent Chromatin with EdU and sequencing (MINCE-seq) to characterize the genome-wide location of nucleosomes and other chromatin proteins behind replication forks at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the characteristic chromatin landscape at Drosophila promoters and enhancers is lost upon replication. The most conspicuous changes are at promoters that have high levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalling and DNA accessibility and show specific enrichment for the BRM remodeler. Enhancer chromatin is also disrupted during replication, suggesting a role for transcription factor (TF) competition in nucleosome re-establishment. Thus, the characteristic nucleosome landscape emerges from a uniformly packaged genome by the action of TFs, RNAPII and remodelers minutes after replication fork passage.

DESIGN
Using MINCE-seq, we mapped the newly replicated and maturing chromatin landscape at promoters and enhancers. There are 24 samples, 12 input-pulldown pairs. Three of these pairs are biological replicates.
