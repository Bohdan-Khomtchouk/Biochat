TITLE
Characterizing the transcriptomic response of mice infected with A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7), and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), and a pandemic H1N1 human virus, A/Mexico/4482/2007 (H1N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Modulating the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza, a virus whose pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response it elicits. Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus has been reported in several animal models, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. To this end, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) or H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and H1N1 early in infection, but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased cytokine response, decreased lipid metabolism and decreased coagulation signaling. This three-pronged signature has previously been observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza strains.

DESIGN
Groups of 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with either A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), or pandemic H1N1 human virus, A/Mexico/4482/2007 (H1N1). Infections were done at 10^5 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 3 and 5 d.p.i. There were 4-5 infected and 3 mock infected animals/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load and transcriptional analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
