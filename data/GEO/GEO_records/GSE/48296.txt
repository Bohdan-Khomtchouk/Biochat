TITLE
Expression data from human sarcoma patient samples treated with either vehicle control or Nutlin-3a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study has examined the molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a, a non-genotoxic activator of the p53 pathway. Human patient material was collected immediately following surgical resection, dissected into small pieces and ex planted onto gelatin sponges immersed in media containing either vehicle control or Nutlin-3a  (10uM and/or 50uM) for 48 hours. Nutlin-3a represents a novel targeted therapy for the treatment of sarcomas. We have examined expression profiles of genes upregulated in sarcoma patient derived tissues following nutlin-3a treatment ex vivo

DESIGN
16 samples ((Vehicle control and Nutlin-3a (10uM and 50uM) treated samples)) from 6 sarcoma patients
