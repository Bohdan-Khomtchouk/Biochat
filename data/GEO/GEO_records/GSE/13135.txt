SUMMARY
In this study, we systematically identified the RNAs associated with a selective sample of 40 of ~600 yeast RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To identify RNAs associated with each putative RBP, C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged proteins, expressed under control of their native promoters, were affinity purified from whole cell extracts of cultures grown to mid-log phase in rich medium [1-3]. Extracts were incubated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) agarose beads, washed, and ribonuclear protein complexes were eluted by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease treatment (Text S2). We performed two to four independent isolations with each tagged strain. As controls, we performed 13 immunoaffinity purifications (IPs) of untagged strains to identify and exclude potential false-positive RNA targets. We purified total RNA from the whole-cell extracts and TEV-purified fractions, reverse transcribed with an amino-allyl-dUTP/dNTP mix, coupled the purified cDNA to Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, respectively, mixed the two differentially labeled cDNA pools, and then hybridized them to DNA microarrays (Datasets S1-S4). An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Genotype: strain expressing tagged version of RNA-BP Keywords: all_pairs
