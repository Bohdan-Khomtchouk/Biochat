TITLE
The redox-sensitive transcription factor, Nrf2, regulates murine hematopoietic stem cell survival

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the differentiation and survival defect of Nrf2-/- HSPC, we performed gene expression studies on KSL cells isolated by FACS from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice. Gene expression data suggests that loss of Nrf2 leads to global defects in cytokine signaling, and the administration of the exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) improved HSPC survival despite increasing intracellular ROS.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from young healthy Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice (n=5 per genotype ) were pooled, stained with KSL cell marker and FACS.  Total RNA was isolated from the pooled KSL cells, quantified, amplified and profiled. One pooled RNA sample from each genotype (Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/-) was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene ST 1.0 chips.
