miRNA expression profile of of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cell line treated with single or fractionated ionizing radiation doses

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Radiotherapy is one of the most common therapies for cancer. Approximately half of all cancer patients will receive radiotherapy at some point during treatment. Consequences of IR treatment are dose dependent and different sensitivity to IR of various types of cells is well established. To reduce the damage of IR to most sensitive cells of normal (noncancerous) tissue radiotherapy is administered as fractionated dose treatment applying radiation in ~2 Gy fractions every 24 hours, 5 times per week. However, during the therapy intrinsic and acquired tumor radioresistance may result in treatment failures. Comprehensive mechanisms of the resistance to irradiation as well as mechanisms of cellular response to fractionated dose IR remain unclear. Different gene expression patterns may be partially influenced by short ~22 nt non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) via translational regulation or RNA degradation mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study we evaluated global miRNA changes in murine Lewis lung carcinoma LLC1 cells following X-ray irradiation of single 2 Gy or 10 Gy and 2 Gy x 5 fractionated doses.

DESIGN
Total RNA enriched in small noncoding RNAs was isolated from mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells 4h after treatment of single (2 Gy or 10 Gy) or fractionated (5x2 Gy) ionizing radiation dose.
