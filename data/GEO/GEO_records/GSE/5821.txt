Rapamycin treatment of CEM_C1 cells 24 hours

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. Here we use a novel approach to identify rapamycin as a glucocorticoid resistance reversal agent. A database of drug-associated gene expression profiles was screened for molecules whose profile overlapped with a gene expression signature of glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity/resistance in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells. The screen indicated the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin profile matched the signature of GC-sensitivity. We thus tested the hypothesis that rapamycin would induce GC sensitivity in lymphoid malignancy cells, and found that it sensitized cells to glucocorticoid induced apoptosis via modulation of antiapoptotic MCL1. These data indicate that MCL1 is an important regulator of GC-induced apoptosis, and that the combination of rapamycin and glucocorticoids has potential utility in ALL. Furthermore this approach represents a novel strategy for identification of promising combination therapies for cancer. Keywords: drug treatment

DESIGN
CEM-C1 cells were treated with 10 nM rapamycin or DMSO and harvested for microarray analysis at 24 hours
