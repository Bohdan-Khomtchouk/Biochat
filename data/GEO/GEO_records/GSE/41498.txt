TITLE
Profiling of ovarian tumour and benign lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of malignancy-associated expression of gene sets based on ovarian tumour histone modification status.

DESIGN
A single serous epithelial ovarian tumour (which was assayed using ChIP-seq to determine histone modification profiles; SRA059358) was profiled using the HGU133 plus 2 GeneChip, along with 8 benign ovarian lesions (1 serous cyst, 3 serous cystadenomas and 4 serous cystadenofibromas) for comparison. Expression levels of genes marked in the tumour with particular histone modifications were compared between the tumour and the benign samples.
