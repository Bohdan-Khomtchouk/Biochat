TITLE
Expansion of SFTPC+ cells from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CPMhigh progenitor cells by forming alveolar organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on CPMhigh progenitor cells, P0 SFTPC+ cells,  P2 SFTPC+ cells, and P5 SFTPC+ cells derived form human induced pluripotent stem cells (B2-3 SFTPC-GFP reporter hiPSCs), and parental 201B7 hiPSC-derived proximal airway epithelial cells (PAECs) and primary isolated human adult alveolar epithelial (adult AT2) cells, respectively.

DESIGN
CPMhigh progenitor cells stepwisely induced from hiPSCs were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on day 21. Isolated CPMhigh cells were cocultured with human fetal lung fibroblasts forming alveolar organoids (AOs). P0 SFTPC+ cells were isolated from AOs on Day 35. We further expanded SFTPC+ cells by passaging in AOs. Passaged SFTPC+ cells were isolated on Day 63 and Day 105 (P2 and P5, respectively).
