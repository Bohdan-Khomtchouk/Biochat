TITLE
HEK293 cells 100 cell RNAseq profiling  on Ion Proton

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Five  libraries  from 100 HEK293 cells  each were prepared using a Smartseq based custom library preparation approach with unique molecular identifiers. One batch of 2 replicates (A) and one batch of 3 replicates (B) were prepared from different cell cultures. Libraries were sequenced on an Ion Proton

DESIGN
HEK293 cell  (100 cells)  5' selective RNAseq profiling, N4H4 unique molecular identifiers, 2 replicates (A) and 3 replicates (B)

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
