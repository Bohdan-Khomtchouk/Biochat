TITLE
Distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins DREF in Drosophila Kc167 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we map the localization of DREF Drosophila replication related element binding factor in Drosophila Kc cells.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic occupancy for DREF, control samples used for Drosophila Kc were previously described (Wood, Van Bortle et al., 2011 GSE30740 and GSE32584). The GSM number for the input for Total Chip_seq data is GSM762849.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
