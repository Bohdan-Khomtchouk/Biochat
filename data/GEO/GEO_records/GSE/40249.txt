TITLE
Expression data from vaginal tissue from estrogen-treated WT and Fbln5-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression changes in wild type and Fbln5-/-  adult mice.  Estrogen status was controlled

DESIGN
Wt and Fblin5 KO mice of same strain (C57Bl6) were ovariectomized at 2 wks and then treated with estradio (50 µg/kg/d) x 3 d

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
