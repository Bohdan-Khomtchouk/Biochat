TITLE
Genome-wide methylation profiles of forensically relevant body fluids [Set3]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability to predict tissue type and donorâ€™s age from molecular profiles of crime scene samples has practical implications in forensics. In order to identify body fluid- and age-associated DNA methylation changes, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was carried out for body fluids including blood, saliva, semen, menstrual blood, and vaginal fluid obtained from individuals aged 20 to 59. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in bisulfite converted DNA. Samples included 12 of each blood, saliva and semen samples from 18 male donors aged 20 to 59, and 3 of each vaginal fluid and menstrual blood samples from 4 female donors in their twenties.

DESIGN
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of body fluids obtained from individuals aged 29 to 41. The Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450K CpGs from human body fluids including blood, saliva and semen. Bisulfite converted DNA from the 6 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
