TITLE
Expression data from Aristolochic Acid and Ochratoxin A treated Tsc2 mutant (Eker) and corresponding wild type rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Renal gene expression profiles of Eker and wild type rats, gavaged with AA or OTA, respectively for 1, 3, 7 or 14 days We used Affymetrix RAE230A microarrays for the analysis of early gene expression changes in the renal cortex_ outer medulla of carcinogen treated Eker and corresponding wild type rats Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Eker and wild type rats were gavaged daily with OTA (210Âµg_ kg BW) or AA (10mg_ kg BW), dissolved in 0,1M sodium bicarbonate. Time-matched vehicle controls were gavaged with 0,1M sodium bicarbonate. Following 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment, Narcoren (pentobarbital) anesthetized rats were sacrificed by exsanguination subsequent to retrograde perfusion with PBS. Left kidneys were collected, cross-sectioned into 5mm slices and stored in RNAlater for subsequent RNA isolantion and chip hybridisation
