TITLE
Expression data from Aristolochic Acid and Ochratoxin A treated Tsc2 mutant (Eker) and corresponding wild type rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Renal gene expression profiles of Eker and wild type rats, gavaged with AA or OTA, respectively for 1, 3, 7 or 14 days We used Affymetrix RAE230A microarrays for the analysis of early gene expression changes in the renal cortex_ outer medulla of carcinogen treated Eker and corresponding wild type rats Keywords: time course
