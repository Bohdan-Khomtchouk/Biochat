Identification of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control hematopoietic stem cell functioning

SUMMARY
We have combined large-scale mRNA expression and gene mapping methods to identify genes and loci that control hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functioning. mRNA expression levels were measured in purified HSC isolated from a panel of densely genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts were mapped. Comparison of the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. In addition, multiple trans-acting control loci were highlighted that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of co-regulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of strong candidate genes involved with HSC turnover.  We compared expression QTLs in HSC and brain from the same animals, and document both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of co-regulated transcripts. Keywords: other
