TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of wide-type and PirBTM MLL-AF9 LSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How the stemness of adult stem cells and cancer stem cells is regulated by environmental cues through surface receptors is poorly understood. In this gene expression analysis, we found that, in the mouse MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model, a deficiency in intracellular signaling of inhibitory receptor PIR-B resulted in increased differentiation and decreased stemness of leukemia stem cells, revealing that PIR-B supports leukemia development. Our study indicates unexpected functional significance of a classical immune inhibitory receptor in the maintenance of stemness of cancer stem cells.
