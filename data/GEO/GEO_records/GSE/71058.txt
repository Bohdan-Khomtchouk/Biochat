TITLE
Gene expression profiling in dentate granule cells from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with or without hippocampal sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common neuropathological finding of medically intractable cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common form of partial epilepsy. Within the dentate gyrus, HS may be associated with granule cell dispersion and aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, and these pathological changes are accompanied by a range of molecular changes. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of dentate granule cells of MTLE patients with and without HS to show that next-generation sequencing methods can produce interpretable genomic data from RNA collected from small homogenous cell populations and to shed light on the transcriptional changes associated with HS.

DESIGN
12 samples of dentate granule cells from patients with mesial tempora lobe epilepsy, 5 with hippocampal sclerosis and 7 without hippocampal sclerosis. 10 samples had replicates.
