TITLE
Evolution of microrna expression at the onset of drosophila metamorphosis by miRNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila simulans ; Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
We found two lines of evidence suggesting that miRNA abundance  has been shaped by different evolutionary regimes at the two developmental stages. Attributed to functional constraints, which points to mechanisms more subtle and diverse than previously thought.

DESIGN
6 genotypes, sex and 2 developmental states were investigated in this study, each with 4 biological replicates, a total of 72 hybridizations were conducted. Differential analysis between genotypes or sexes were analyzed.
