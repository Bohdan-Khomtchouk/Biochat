TITLE
Analysis of mature miRNA levels in the context of CHO cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mature microRNA transcripts were analyzed in 9 CHO cell lines growing at different proliferation rates. The goal was to identify microRNAs that correlate positively or negatively with CHO proliferation rates.
