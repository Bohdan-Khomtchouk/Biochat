TITLE
Characterization of gene expression profiles induced by HIC-1 reactivation on breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanisms and signal pathways induced by restoring tumor suppressor gene HIC-1 on breast cancer cells.  We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the differential genes induced by HIC-1 gene activation. Small activating RNA (saRNA) that targeted promoter region was used, and MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was selected as cell model. After 96h for saRNA transfection, the cells were collected and the whole genome expression profiles were analyzed. Three independent experiments were repeated for different groups. With the treshold of  p < 0.01 and fold change > =2 or < -2, there were 1375 differential expression genes, which are related to cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration, cell invasion and cell proliferation.

DESIGN
SaRNA induced gene expression in human breast cancer cell MCF-7 was measured at 96 hours after transfection by 50 nM saRNA. Three independent experiments were performed for experimental group and control group.
