TITLE
Whole blood transcriptomics to define adaptive biochemical pathways of exercise during aging

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the current study was to characterize the genetic adaptive pathways altered by exercise in veteran athletes and age-matched untrained individuals. Two groups of 50-60 year old males: competitive cyclists and untrained, minimally active individuals were examined. All participants completed an acut bout of submaximal endurance exercise and blood samples pre- and post-exercise were analyzed for gene expression changes utilizing genome-wide DNA microarray analysis. Our results indicate distinct differences in gene expression involving energy metabolism, lipids, insuling signaling and cardiovascular function between the two groups. These findings may lead to new insights into beneficial signaling pathways of healthy aging and help identify surrogate markers for monitoring exercise and training load.

DESIGN
Blood samples from the control and athlete groups were analyzed at three time-points: T1 (before exercise); T2 (immediately after exercise) and T3 (24 hours after exercise). There were n = 4 samples in each of control and athlete group at T1 and T3; and n = 7 for control group and n = 8 for athlete group at T2. One athlete sample (Sample # 010201) at time - point T2 had a technical replicate.
