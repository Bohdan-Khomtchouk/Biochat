TITLE
Cardiac left ventricles of 12 week-old male C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J-chrY < A/J/NaJ > mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have reported previously that when chromosome Y (chrY) from the mouse strain C57BL/6J (abbreviated as B) was substituted for that of A/J mice (ChrY < A > ), cardiomyocytes from the resulting 'chromosome substitution' C57BL/6J-chrY < A > strain (abbreviated as B.Y) were smaller than that of their C57BL/6J counterparts.  In reverse, when chrY < A > from A/J mice was substituted for that of chrY < B > , cardiomyocytes from the resulting A/J-chrY < C57 > strain were larger than in their A/J counterparts.  We further used these strains (B and the consomic B.Y) to test whether the origin of chrY could also be linked to differences in the profile of gene expression in their cardiac left ventricles in adult mice where either sham surgery (intact animals)  or  castration has been performed at 3-4 weeks of age..

DESIGN
Samples from 4 different mice were used in each group.  For hybridization, probes generated from samples were randomized on 2 different Illumina MouseRef v2.0 BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
