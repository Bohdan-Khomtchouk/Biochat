TITLE
Estrogen-modulated gene expression in c-kit+ stem cells and CD44+ stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The recent interest in the role of bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells in the benefits of estrogen on cardiovascular health brought us to evaluate if estrogen could affect cardiac repair more broadly by regulating biological processes involved in the functional organization of the bone marrow stem cell niche. To assess such possibility, we evaluated gene expression profiles of bone marrow c-kit+ stem cells and CD44+ stromal cells, derived from primary whole bone marrow cultured system, after exposure to a physiological concentration of 17β-estradiol (17βE). Keywords: estrogen treatment response

DESIGN
6 samples per cell type (c-kit+ stem cells or CD44+ stromal cells) were analysed.  Of these, triplicates of 17βE treated and corresponding control non-treated cells are included.
