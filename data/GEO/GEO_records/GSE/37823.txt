TITLE
LIX11 vs H37Rv under Log vs stationary phase growth

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcription analysis of Î”pknK mutant (LIX11) versus wild type H37Rv during logarithmic and stationary phase growth. This will elucidate the genes regulated by PknK during transition from logarithmic growth to stationary phase growth.

DESIGN
Two color Experiment,Organism: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Genotypic Technology designed Custom Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv Whole Genome 8x15k GE Microarray (AMADID-26323 and AMADID-23057
