TITLE
The effect of a dexamethasone and a FK506 on the induction of chemokines in human mast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mast cells produce a large amount of several chemokines after cross-linking of FceRI and participate in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate FceRI-mediated chemokine induction in human mast cells and the effect of a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) and a calcineurin inhibitor (FK506). Human peripheral blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with anti-IgE antibody in the presence of dexamethasone or FK506. Expression of eight chemokines was significantly induced in mast cells by anti-IgE stimulation. Induction of CCL2, CCL7, CXCL3 and CXCL8 by anti-IgE was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone. In contrast, induction of CCL1, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL18 was significantly inhibited by FK506. Combination of dexamethasone and FK506 suppressed production of all chemokines by anti-IgE stimulation. These results suggest that corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors inhibit expression of distinct subsets of chemokines and a combination of these drugs almost completely suppresses the induction of all chemokine genes in human mast cells in response to FceRI-dependent stimulation.

DESIGN
Human peripheral blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with anti-IgE antibody in the presence of dexamethasone or FK506. Gene expression profiles were evaluated using GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 probe arrays (Affymetrix).
