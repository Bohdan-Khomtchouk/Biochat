TITLE
Early microbial colonisation affects transcriptome of pig jejunum perfused with E. coli F4, F4 fimbria or Lact. amylovorus

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
An early settlement of a complex gut microbiota can protect against gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, but the effects of neonatal microbiota colonization on the gut barrier upon the further encounter of favorable bacteria or not, are largely unknown. The jejunal transcriptome of differently perfused intestinal loops of 12 caesarian-derived pigs previously associated with microbiota of different complexity was studied. Pigs received pasteurized sow colostrum at birth (d0), 2 mL of starter microbiota (10^7 CFU of each Lactob. Amylovorus (LAM), Clostr. glycolicum, and Parabacteroides spp.) on d1-d3 of age and either a placebo inoculant (simple association, SA) or an inoculant consisting of diluted feces of an adult sow (complex association, CA) on d3-d4 of age. On days 26-37 of age, jejunal loops were perfused for 8 h with either enterotoxigenic E. coli F4 (ETEC), F4 fimbriae (F4), LAM or saline (CTRL) and jejunal samples were obtained from each piglet immediately afterwards.

DESIGN
The analysis of whole mRNA transcript expression was done by Affymetrix©Porcine Gene 1.1 ST array strips, a Robust Multichip Analysis was performed on the CEL files, and Transcripts ID’s were associated to 13,406 Human gene names, based on Sus scrofa Ensemble
