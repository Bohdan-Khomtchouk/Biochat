TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of isolated hyper-producer carotenoids mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of isolated hyper-producer carotenoids mutants obtained via adaptive evolution.  Transcriptome of isolated strains was compared with the ancestral strain as reference. To emulate evolution experiments, the cells were grown in YPD until late-exponential phase.

DESIGN
Three biological replicas of 4 samples vs reference (sample SM12 contains 4 replicas).  Location of the samples in the two microarrays are described below.
