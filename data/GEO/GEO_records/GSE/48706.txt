TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor HPL-2::GFP Binding Regions in L1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3834 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: YL474(official name : YL474 genotype : lin-35(n745) I; unc-119(ed3) III; vrIs64[pGES-1::HPL-2::GFP FLAG: HPL-2 3-UTR genotype : unc-119 (+)] outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : The HPL-2::GFP fusion protein is driven by the ges-1 promoter and expressed in the intestine. The original transgene was subsequently crossed into a lin-35 mutant. made_by : Michelle Kudron in Reinke lab ); Developmental Stage: starved L1; Genotype: lin-35(n745) I; unc-119(ed3) III; vrIs64[pGES-1::HPL-2::GFP FLAG: HPL-2 3-UTR; Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage starved L1; Target gene lin-35; Strain YL474(official name : YL474 genotype : lin-35(n745) I; unc-119(ed3) III; vrIs64[pGES-1::HPL-2::GFP FLAG: HPL-2 3-UTR genotype : unc-119 (+)] outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : The HPL-2::GFP fusion protein is driven by the ges-1 promoter and expressed in the intestine. The original transgene was subsequently crossed into a lin-35 mutant. made_by : Michelle Kudron in Reinke lab ); temp (temperature) 20 degree celsius
