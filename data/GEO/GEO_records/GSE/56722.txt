TITLE
Whole transcriptome responses among females of the filariasis and arbovirus vector mosquito Culex pipiens implicate TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification as key drivers of diapause induction

ORGANISM
Culex pipiens ; Culex quinquefasciatus

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level differences in Culex pipiens (SB) and C. quinquefasciatus (JHB) at three time points (8, 16, and 24 hours post-exposure) during the early pupal state in standard (25°C; 16 h light/8 h dark) and diapause-inducing (18°C; 8 h light/16 h dark) conditions.

DESIGN
A forty-eight chip study (4 Expr12x135K slides) using cDNA from total RNA collected from two species in the Culex pipiens complex at 3 time-points during the early pupal stage to study gene expression differences between standard (25°C; 16 h light/8 h dark) and diapause-inducing (18°C; 8 h light/16 h dark) conditions, and between Culex pipiens  (diapause) and C. quinquefasciatus (no diapause).  Each chip measures the expression level of 18,692 protein coding genes, with 3 probes per gene and two-fold technical redundancy. Each of the 12-plex slides was used for one of four biological replicates. Probes were designed using the C.quinquefasciatus CpipJ1.2 geneset in VectorBase.
