TITLE
The TfoY regulon of Vibrio cholerae.

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the TfoY regulon of V. cholerae using RNA-seq to better uderstand the protein's function.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of a WT V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain (A1552) and of a TfoY-producing derivative of the WT strain (A1552-TntfoY). 3 independent biological replicates are provided for each bacterial strain. The bacteria were grown to high cell density and in the presence of arabinose (to induce TfoY in strain A1552-TntfoY).

PLATFORM
GPL19265 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Vibrio cholerae)
