TITLE
Ribosome profiling of whi3 mutant yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In general, RNA-binding proteins act to modulate gene expression at transcript level through degradation or at protein level through translation.  To elucidate the effect of Whi3, a yeast RNA binding protein, on gene expression, we performed ribosome profiling experiment on whi3 mutant and wildtype cells.

DESIGN
Comparison ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data between whi3 mutant and wildtype cells

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
