TITLE
Identification of known and novel germ cell cancer specific (embryonic) miRs in serum by high throughput profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Very recently, a number of independent studies showed that serum levels of embryonic micro-RNA (miR) clusters 371-3 and 302abc/367 are predictive for the presence of testicular type II germ cell tumors. These miRs could be used to sensitively detect SE and EC components which are indeed known to express these miRs [1-7]. This study investigates ca 750 miRs in a high throughput approach to validate these previously identified markers and identify novel potential miR markers for testicular type II germ cell tumors.  1.

DESIGN
35 serum samples were profiled for ca. 750 micro RNAs. These consisted of serum from 10 patients with non-seminomas (2 YS, 2 TE, 2 EC and 4 mixed NS which all contained EC) and 14 SE cases. Controls (C) consisted of serum from 3 individuals with normal testis tissue showing adequate spermatogenesis (Johnson Score 8-10) and serum from 8 patients with non-GCT testicular masses. These contained on epidermoid cyst, three epidermis cysts, one low grade liposarcoma, two neuro-endocrine tumors and a case of paratesticular hemorrhage.
