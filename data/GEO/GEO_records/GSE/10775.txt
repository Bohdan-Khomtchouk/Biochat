TITLE
Expression profiling of mammalian Schwann cells in response to treatment with NRG and/or IGF

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the changes in mitochondrial gene expression  of cells in which extracellular growth factors and/or mitogens have been added. Keywords: Input of growth and mitogenic pathways in mitochondria biogenesis

DESIGN
Primary Rat Schwann cells were arrested and synchronized with aphidicolin for 24 hours in 3% FCS containing medium. Cells where then transferred to defined conditions (no factors) with aphidocolin for another 24 hours before appropriate factors were applied for 15 hours prior to cell collection.
