TITLE
Listeria monocytogenes Transcriptome with RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
The stationary phase stress response transcriptome of the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes was defined using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer.  Specifically, bacterial transcriptomes were compared between stationary phase cells of L. monocytogenes 10403S and an otherwise isogenic DsigB mutant, which does not express the alternative sigma factor ÏƒB, a major regulator of genes contributing to stress response. Keywords: Transcriptome and differential expression analyses

DESIGN
a laboratory strain, 10403S and its otherwise isogenic mutant lacking sigB were analyzed. Two replicates of each strain were analyzed for a total of 4 runs

PLATFORM
GPL9363 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Listeria monocytogenes)
