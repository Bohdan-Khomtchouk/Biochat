TITLE
Gene expression analysis of gingival fibromatosis gingiva

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gingival fibromatosis (GF) is a rare oral condition characterized by proliferative fibrous overgrowth of both the attached and marginal gingiva, and the interdental papilla. But there were no papers about gene expression of gingival fibromatosis. The aim of this study was to identify the differential expression of genes in GF using cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gingival fibromatosis gingiva tissue was collected from a GF patient. Gene expression profiles were conducted using cDNA microarray analysis.
