TITLE
SNPchip analysis of single cell products

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-cell human genome analysis using whole-genome amplified product is hampered by allele bias during amplification. Using an oligonucleotide SNP array, we examined the nature of the allele bias and its effect on the chromosomal copy number analysis. Keywords: single cell, copy number analysis, whole genome amplification, brain

DESIGN
TB106, lymphoblastoid cell line; CMK11-5 and CMK86, cell line; WGA, whole-genome amplified from bulk DNA; SC, whole-genome amplified product from single cell. Genotype and copy number status were compared between non-amplified products and their single cell products.
