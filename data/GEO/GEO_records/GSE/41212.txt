TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination timecourse

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This series analyses germinating Arabidopsis seeds with both temporal and spatial detail, revealing two transcriptional phases that are separated with respect to testa rupture. Performed as part of the ERA-NET Plant Genomics grant vSEED.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seeds were dissected into four tissues at nine time-points during seed germination. The tissues were the combined micropylar and chalazal endosperm (MCE), the remaining endosperm (PE), the radicle and embryonic axis (RAD) and the cotyledons (COT). At testa and endosperm rupture the seeds were sampled in separate pre- and post-ruptured populations.
