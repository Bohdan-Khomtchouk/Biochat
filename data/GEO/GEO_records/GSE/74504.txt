TITLE
The Solanum lycopersicum WRKY3 Transcription Factor Regulates Salt Stress Tolerance In Tomato

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The tomato SlWRKY3 transcription factor was overexpressed in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)and transgenic plants transcriptome was compared to that of wild-type plants.

DESIGN
At least 4 plants were collected for RNA extraction. The aim of the experiment was to compare transcriptomes of 35::SlWRKY3 plants and wild-type plants grown together and on MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium in vitro for 4 weeks. A technical replicate (dye swap) was conducted.
