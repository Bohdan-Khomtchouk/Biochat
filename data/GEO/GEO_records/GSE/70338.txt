TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of app1Δpah1Δdpp1Δlpp1Δ

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Deletion mutant of the yeast app1Δpah1Δdpp1Δlpp1Δ were studied for gene expression levels. Significant difference in expression levels was observed in genes pertaining to mitochondria, lipid etc. as compared to the W303-1A wild type.
