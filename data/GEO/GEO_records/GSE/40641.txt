TITLE
Dissecting the grey zone between follicular lymphoma and nodal marginal zone lymphoma using morphological and genetic features

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nodal marginal zone lymphoma is a poorly defined entity in the WHO classification, largely based on criteria by exclusion and the diagnosis often remains subjective. Follicular Lymphoma lacking t(14;18), have similar characteristics which results in a major potential diagnostic overlap which this study aims to dissect. Four subgroups of lymphoma samples (n=56) were analyzed with high-resolution arrayCGH; Nodal marginal zone lymphoma, t(14;18)-negative Follicular Lymphoma, localized t(14:18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma and disseminated t(14;18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma. Gains on chromosomes 7, 8 and 12 were observed in all subgroups. The mean number of aberrations was higher in disseminated t(14;18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma compared to localized t(14:18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma (p < 0.01) and the majority of alterations in localized t(14:18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma were also found in disseminated t(14;18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma. Nodal marginal zone lymphoma was marked by 3q gains with amplifications of four genes. A different overall pattern of aberrations was seen in t(14;18)-negative Follicular Lymphoma compared to t(14;18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma. t(14;18)-negative Follicular Lymphoma is marked by specific (focal) gains on chromosome 3 as observed in Nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Our results support the notion that localized t(14:18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma represents an early phase of disseminated t(14;18)-positive Follicular Lymphoma. t(14;18)-negative Follicular Lymphoma bears aberrations that are more alike Nodal marginal zone lymphoma, suggesting a relation between these groups.

DESIGN
Four subgroups of follicular lymphoma were analyzed: NMZL (n=14), t-FL (n=12), LOC t+FL (n=16), DIS t+FL (n=14).
