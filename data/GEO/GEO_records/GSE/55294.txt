TITLE
The differences between CD166+ pancreatic cancer cells and CD166- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses using CD166+ and CD166- pancreatic cancer cell lines from both Panc-1 and SW1990 cells.

DESIGN
We carried out microarray analyses using the CD166+ and CD166- separated cells from both Panc-1 and SW1990. The quality of the RNA samples was evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). We used a Human HT-12v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for these analyses. The data were analyzed using BeadStudio software version 3.2.3 (Illumina).
