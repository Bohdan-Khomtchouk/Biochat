TITLE
Interference of PrfA with glucose uptake

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strains expressing high levels of the virulence regulator PrfA (mutant PrfA* or wild-type PrfA) show strong growth inhibition in minimal media when supplemented with glucose but not when supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate compared to the isogenic strains expressing low levels of PrfA. A significantly reduced rate of glucose uptake is observed in the PrfA* over-expressing strain growing in LB supplemented with glucose. Comparative transcriptome analyses were performed with RNA isolated from a prfA mutant and the isogenic strain carrying multiple prfA or prfA* copies on a plasmid. The analysis reveals in addition to high transcriptional up-regulation of the known PrfA-regulated virulence genes (group I), less pronounced up-regulation in the expression of several phage- and metabolic genes (group II) and strong down-regulation of several genes involved mainly in carbon- and nitrogen- metabolism in the PrfA* over-expressing strain (group III). Among the latter genes are in particular the nrgAB-, gltAB-, glnRA- (involved in nitrogen metabolism), ilvB- operons (involved in biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids) and genes for some ABC transporters. Most of the down-regulated genes have been shown previously in Bacillus subtilis to belong to a class of genes whose expression is negatively affected by impaired glucose uptake. The results lead to the conclusion that excess PrfA(*) interferes with component(s) essential for PTS-mediated glucose transport. Keywords: Metabolism and Virulence gene expression
