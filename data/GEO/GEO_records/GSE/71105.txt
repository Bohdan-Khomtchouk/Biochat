TITLE
Gene expression analysis on ganglia derived from TH-MYCN mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amplification of the MYCN oncogene predicts treatment resistance in childhood neuroblastoma. Using a MYC target gene signature that predicts poor neuroblastoma prognosis we identified the histone chaperone, FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT), as a crucial mediator of the MYC signal and a therapeutic target in the disease. FACT and MYCN expression created a forward feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells that was essential for maintaining mutual high expression. FACT inhibition by the small molecule Curaxin compound, CBL0137, markedly reduced tumor initiation and progression in vivo. CBL0137 exhibited strong synergy with chemotherapy in standard use by blocking repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxic drugs, thus creating a synthetic lethal environment in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cells and a treatment strategy for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma

DESIGN
Superior Cervical ganglia and Coeliac ganglia were disected from Th-MYCN+/+ mice and wildtype age-matched littermates. RNA was isolated for hybridisation on Agilent arrays
