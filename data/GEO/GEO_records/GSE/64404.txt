TITLE
Comparative genome analysis of grapevine trunk pathogens reveals distinctive expansion of gene families associated with cell wall degradation, secondary metabolism, and induction of cell death

ORGANISM
Phaeoacremonium minimum

SUMMARY
The integration of RNA-seq with Augustus & Maker predictions did not only increase the number of protein-coding genes, but also improved the predicted gene structures, evidenced by wider alignment coverage (Fig. S3C) and greater percent identity when aligned to the proteomes of other ascomycetes (Fig. S3D).

DESIGN
T. minima was grown in-vitro in Potato dextrose agar and minimal media agar with dormant canes of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and V. vinifera L. cv. Merlot with three biological replicates for each media.
