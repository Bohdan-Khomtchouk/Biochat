TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the effects of organic dust in lung epithelial and THP-1 cells reveals inductive effects on inflammatory mediators [452 expt: THP-1 vs BEAS 2B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to characterize gene expression profiles of lung epithelial and THP-1 monocytic cells influenzed by exposure to poultry dust extract. Gene expression profiles were determined by DNA microarrayanalysis using Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression bead chip, and changes in significantly induced transcripts validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Significantly induced genes included IL-8, IL-6, ICAM-1, CCL2, CCL5, TLR4 and PTGS2. Pathway analysis indicated that dust extract treatment induced changes in gene expression influenced functions related to immune and inflammatory responses.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with medium alone (control) or dust extract (0.1% or 0.25%) for 1, 3 or 6 h (reference).
