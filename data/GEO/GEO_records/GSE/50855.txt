TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Host Immune Responses in CD11b positive cells isolated from lungs of the UV inactivated SARS-CoV-immunized mice following Lethal SARS-CoV Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the biological pathways by which UV inactivated SARS-CoV-induced pulmonary eosinophilia occurs, we examined global transcriptional changes in macrophages from the lungs of mouse.

DESIGN
Female BALB/c mice were used at 21 weeks of age.  Mice were subcutaneously immunized with UV inactivated SARS-CoV (UV-V) or UV-V and Toll like receptor (TLR) ligands at 6 and 1 weeks prior to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (n=6 per group).   Mice were intranasally challenged with 1E+6 TCID50 in 30Î¼L.  MEM was challenged in six mice as control infection.  Mice were sacrificed and collected lungs at 1 days after challenge, then CD11b positive cells were isolated from the lungs of these mice. These cells were used for the analysis of microarray.
