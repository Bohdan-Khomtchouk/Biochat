TITLE
Repeat elements study in pluripotent stem cells [expression array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed RNA-Seq data to identify those TEs that are transcriptionally active uniquely in human pluripotent cells. We identified one endogenous retrovirus (HERV-H) family, uniquely found in primates as being unusually abundant in the transcriptome. The microarray data provided is to support our human naive cell hypothesis.

DESIGN
Total of 18 samples of the human ESC line H9 were analyzed for gene expression.
