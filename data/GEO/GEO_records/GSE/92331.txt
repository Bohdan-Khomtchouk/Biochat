TITLE
Gene expression of mice PDL , WT and Mkx KO (10 weeks and 4 weeks)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The periodontal ligament (PDL), which connects the teeth to the alveolar bone, is essential for periodontal tissue homeostasis. Although the significance of the PDL is recognized, molecular mechanisms underlying PDL function are not well-known. We report that Mohawk homeobox (Mkx), a tendon-specific transcription factor, regulates PDL homeostasis by preventing its degeneration. Mkx is expressed in the mouse PDL at the age of 10 weeks and 12 months. In Mkx-/- mice, age-dependent expansion of the PDL at the maxillary 1st molar (M1) furcation area was observed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that Mkx-/- mice presented collagen fibril degeneration in PDL with age, while the collagen fibril diameter gradually increased in Mkx+/+ mice. PDL cells lost their shape in Mkx-/- mice, suggesting changes in PDL properties. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses of Mkx-/- PDL revealed an increase in osteogenic gene expression and no change in PDL- and inflammatory-related gene expression. Additionally, COL1A1 and COL1A2 were upregulated in Mkx-overexpressing human PDL fibroblasts, whereas osteogenic genes were downregulated. Our results indicate that Mkx prevents PDL degeneration by regulating osteogenesis. Mohawk transcription factor is essential for homeostasis of the periodontal ligament by regulating osteogenic changes with age.

DESIGN
PDL were prepared from wild type and Mkx knockout mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent technologies.
