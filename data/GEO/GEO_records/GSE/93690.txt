TITLE
The genomic distribution of G9a, H3K9me2, H3K27me3 and Mef2c in cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from G9a-KO and Cre mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the histone methyltrasferase G9a (also known as Ehmt2) in the normal heart has not been studied extensively. To identify  the genomic regions bound to G9a in cardiomyocytes (CMs),we first generated a conditional, cardiac-specific KO mouse for this gene using the Cre-Lox approach, crossing G9a flox/flox mice with αMHC-MerCreMer mice (Cre mice were used as controls). Then we performed ChIP-seq for G9a and H3K9me2 – the main histone methylation catalysed by the HMT – on isolated G9a-KO and Cre CMs, and considered the best G9a-bound genomic regions as those that had a loss or decrease of G9a binding as well as a lower level of H3K9me2 in G9a-KO CMs. Since G9a contributes to trimethylation of H3K27 at a set of developmental genes through its interaction with PRC2, we also evaluated whether the loss of G9a had an effect on the distribution of this histone mark. To this end, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 in Cre CMs and G9a-KO CMs. Finally co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that G9a interacts with Mef2c, thus to elucidate the function of the G9a–Mef2c interaction in adult cardiomyocytes, we used ChIP-seq to define the genomic distribution of Mef2c in Cre CMs and G9a-KO CMs.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for G9a, H3K9me2, H3K27me2 and Mef2c carried-out with cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from G9a-KO and Cre mice. Two biological replicates were profiled for each antibody type.
