TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of genome wide Brg1 binding in mouse primary keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed Brg1 binding genomeiwide in freshly isolated newborn mouse epidermal keratinocytes using ChIP-seq technology

DESIGN
Mouse epidermal keratinocytes were isolated form the newborn C57Bl6 mice and Brg1 binding in their chromatin was analyzed using ChIP-seq technology on Hi-Seq 2500 machine

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
