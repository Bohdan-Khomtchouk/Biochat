TITLE
Early-onset sporadic rectal cancer : Wnt- vs. Wnt+ rectal tumor [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number profiling of early-onset sporadic rectal adenocarcinoma, comparing Wnt- and Wnt+ rectal tumor. Goal was to determine differentially altered genes between them based on global copy no.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wnt- vs. Wnt+ rectal tumors. Wnt- tumors: 26, Wnt+ tumors: 16
