TITLE
Expression profile for overproduction of ArT

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous throughout bacterial and archaeal genomes.  TA systems consist of a stable toxin that inhibits growth and a labile antitoxin that prevents toxicity of the toxin. Here we made an artificial TA system (arT/arA) and performed a DNA microarray study for overproduction of the toxin.

DESIGN
arT was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BW25113 and compared to the empty vector.
