TITLE
investigation of the pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza virus and swine streptococcus suis serotype 2 co-infection in pigs by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Swine H1N1 influenza virus and streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) are two important contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex, which have significant economic impacts. Clinically, swine influenza virus and swine streptococcus suis co-infection is common, which will increase the mortality. However, the pathogenesis of the co-infection remains largely unkown. To explore it, gene expression profiling was to performed to detect comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by H1N1 virus infection alone, SS2 infection alone, H1N1-SS2 co-infection and PBS control.

DESIGN
A total of 12 healthy pigs were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 3 pigs each: H1N1 group, SS2 group, H1N1-SS2 group and control group. At the age of 35 days, pigs in H1N1 and H1N1-SS2 groups were intranasaly challenged with A/swine/Hubei/101/2009(H1N1) strain and others were treated similarly with PBS. 3 days after H1N1 virus challenge, pigs in SS2 and H1N1-SS2 groups were inoculated intranasally with PBS containing SS2 strain ZY05, others were treated similarly with PBS.
