Expression data from human blood samples

SUMMARY
Genetic factors contribute to the development of ischemic stroke but their identity remains largely unknown. We tested the association with ischemic stroke of 210 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pathways functionally related to stroke. We observed an association between the rs7956957 SNP in LRP1 and next performed microarrays analysis in healthy individuals to investigate possible associations of LRP genotypes with the expression of other genes. Twelve blood samples were obtained from twelve different healthy subjects carrying different genotypes for the rs7956957 SNP of the LRP1 gene (GG, CG or CC).

DESIGN
Blood was extracted from 12 subjects. EDTA tubes were centrifuged at 3500rpm for 15 min to obtain the white blood cell fraction and the samples were stored at -80ºC until RNA isolation. RiboPureTM -Blood kit from Ambion (Ambion, Woodward st. Austin, USA) was used to extract total RNA following manufacturer’s instructions. Globin RNA from erythrocytes that causes interference was extracted using the Globin-Clear kit (Ambion, Woodward st. Austin, USA).
