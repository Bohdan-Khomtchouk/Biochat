Wide-ranging fucntions of E2F4 in transcriptional activation and repression revealed by genome-wide analysis

SUMMARY
The transcription factor E2F4 is a member of the E2F family of regulators which has critical roles in cell cycle control and differentiation. We investigated the genome-wide binding profile of E2F4 using a newly developed peak calling program based on a kernel density estimation and identified approximately 16 thousands E2F4 binding sites at a 1% FDR threshold, which potentially modulate 7,346 downstream target genes. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis of E2F4 target genes revealed several novel functions of E2F4 including I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade, protein transport and targeting, protein folding, and sterol biosynthetic process. In addition to mRNA target genes, E2F4 also binds and regulates some miRNA targets such as let-7a, mir-17 and mir-22. Interestingly, we found that about 20% of E2F4 sites are in intergenic regions, which suggests that E2F4 may function at enhancer sites. De novo motif discovery revealed 5 novel, significantly enriched motifs within E2F4 sites. Only 5% of binding sites contain a canonical motif, indicating that E2F4 can use diverse motifs to bind DNA and regulate transcription. Overexpression of E2F4 and its cofactors such as RBL2 and DP-1, followed by microarray analysis, revealed that E2F4 functions as an activator and a repressor. Taken together, our genome-wide E2F4 ChIP sequencing data provided evidences of versatile physiological roles of E2F4 and insights into its functions.
