TITLE
LOXL2 dependent genes in RA induced mES differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our results indicate that oxidation of TAF10 by LOXL2 induces its release from its promoters, leading to a block in TFIID-dependent gene transcription. Since TFIID complex is crucial for the expression of Nanog, Klf4, Sox2 and Oct4 and for maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells, TAF10 oxidation by LOXL2 leads to inactivation of the pluripotency genes and a loss of pluripotent capacity in embryonic stem cells. Moreover, in vivo results demonstrate an essential role of LOXL2 in neural differentiation during zebrafish development: in the absence of LOXL2 the neural progenitor gene Sox2 is aberrantly overexpressed and neural differentiation is impaired.

DESIGN
12 samples were analyzed: mES transduced with control shRNA (n=3); mES transduced with LOXL2 shRNA (n=3), ES transduced with control shRNA and treated with RA (n=3); ES transduced with LOXL2 shRNA and treated with RA (n=3)
