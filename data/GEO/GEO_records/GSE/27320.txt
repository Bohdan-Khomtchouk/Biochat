TITLE
Expression data in wheat (T. aestivum L.) near isogenic lines in response to powdery mildew infection

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We used two wheat genotypes, the susceptible wheat cultivar ‘8866 ’(S) and its near isogenic line with single powdery mildew resistance gene ‘pm30’ (R), to investigate gene expression changes in response to powdery mildew infection by using Wheat Genome Array

DESIGN
wheat young leveas of near isogenic lines before or 12 hours after powdery mildew infection were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.The leaf samples were harvested from three independent biological replicates, and the leaves without inoculation were regarded as control.
