TITLE
Down-regulation of CD9 by methylation decreased bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bortezomib therapy has been proven successful for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance has already been observed. In this study, we explored the relationship between CD9 expression and bortezomib sensitivity in MM Both intrinsic and acquired resistance has already been observed. In this study, we explored the relationship between CD9 expression and bortezomib sensitivity in MM. We found that down-regulation of CD9 by methylation decreased bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of U266 cells and three separate cultures of U266 with CD9 overexpression. Each chip measures the expression level of 45,033 genes from Homo sapiens with fourteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
