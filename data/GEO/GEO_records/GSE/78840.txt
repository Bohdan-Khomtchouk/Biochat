TITLE
Pathogenic Implications for Autoimmune Mechanisms Derived by Comparative eQTL Analysis of CD4+ Versus CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inappropriate activation or inadequate regulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Studies on disease-associated genetic polymorphisms have highlighted the importance of biological context for many regulatory variants, which is particularly relevant in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. Here we show cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene. Most remarkably, we identify a common missense variant in IL27, associated with type 1 diabetes that results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells only. Altogether, our results indicate that eQTL mapping in purified T cells provides novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases.

DESIGN
The study includes 304 individuals, no replicates. From each individual there are CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and peripheral blood samples extracted. The total number of good quality samples is 653, of which 293 have CD4+ T cell, 283 have CD8+ T cell and 77 have peripheral blood data. GSE59065 contains the DNA methylation data for samples with the same names.
