TITLE
Tet-mediated imprinting erasure following reprogramming of spermatogonial stem cells to induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from three preparations each of murine Gfra1+ spermatogonial stem cells (SSC), SSC- derived SSEA1+ induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and fibroblast (skin derived mesenchymal cells) derived SSEA1+ iPSC

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in SSC and SSC derived iPSC and compared with fibroblast derived iPSC.
