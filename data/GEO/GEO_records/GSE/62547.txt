TITLE
In vitro assessment of drug-induced liver steatosis based on human dermal stem cell-derived hepatic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human skin-derived precursor cells (hSKP) are a post natal stem cell population isolated from the dermis. These cells acquire hepatic characteristics upon differentiation with hepatogenic factors. Differentiated hSKP show characteristics of hepatocyte precursor cells and respond to hepatotoxic compounds in a comparable way as human hepatocyte cultures. We used microarray analyses to evaluate the modulation of gene expression due to exposure to a steatosis-inducing compound.

DESIGN
hSKP obtained from 3 different donors were firstly differentiated and cultivated in the presence or absence of sodium valproate (Na-VPA). Control and Na-VPA samples were collected after 24h exposure.
