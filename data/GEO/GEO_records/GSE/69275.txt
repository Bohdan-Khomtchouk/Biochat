TITLE
Effects of Triclosan exposition on fetal hypothalamic transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Triclosan (TCS), an antibacterial compound commonly added to personal care products, could be an endocrine disruptor at low doses. Although TCS has been shown to alter fetal physiology, its effects in the developing fetal brain are unknown. The objective of this study was to use transcriptomics and systems analysis to determine significantly altered biological processes in the late gestation ovine fetal hypothalamus after direct or indirect exposure to low doses of TCS. We found that short-term infusion of TCS induces vigorous changes in the fetal hypothalamic transcriptomics, which are mainly related to food intake pathways and metabolism.

DESIGN
For direct TCS exposure, chronically catheterized late gestation fetal sheep were infused with vehicle (n=4) or TCS (250 μg/day; n=4) iv. For indirect TCS exposure, TCS (100 μg/kg/day; n=3) or vehicle (n=3) was infused into the maternal circulation. Fetal hypothalami were collected after 2 days of infusion, and gene expression was measured using Agilent 15k ovine microarrays.
