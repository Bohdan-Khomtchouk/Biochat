TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CD4+ T cells infected with Ebolavirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluating the transcriptome profiles of CD4+ T cells that were cultured with mock, LPS, or recombinant Ebolavirus strain Mayinga (EBV) with a particular interest in characterizing the T lymphocyte cell death-associated pathways.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of CD4+ T cells cultured with three treatments, mock, LPS, and Ebolavirus.  For each treatment, samples were taken from four donors on two separate days, day 1 and day 4 post-infection.
