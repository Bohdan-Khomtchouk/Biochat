TITLE
Expression data from RAW 264.7 macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IFNg is a pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic cytokine that leads to macrophage activation. Adenosine has well-documented anti-inflammatory properties. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression profile in mouse macrophages stimulated with IFNg alone and those cells treated with IFNg and adenosine. We determined that adenosine suppressed the expression of many IFNg-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other pro-atherogenic genes. Keywords: treatment response

DESIGN
RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 4 hours with either IFNg or IFNg plus adenosine. Following treatment, total RNA was extracted and treatment groups were pooled from 2 separate experiments for hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays.
