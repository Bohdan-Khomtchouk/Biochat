TITLE
Replicative senescence in human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional abundance in each of senescent populations from three cell lines (WS1, WI38 and BJ) is compared with abundance in isogenic early passage proliferating cells and also with abundance in early passage quiescent cells. A strain or line experiment design type assays differences between multiple strains, cultivars, serovars, isolates, lines from organisms of a single species. Keywords: strain_or_line_design
