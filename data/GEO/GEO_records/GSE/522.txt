TITLE
X-radiation (XR) sensitive HCT116-CloneK: XR at 0 and 4 Gy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray study of X-radiation (XR) sensitive HCT116-CloneK cells without XR, 10 minutes, 6 hours, or 24 hours after XR at 4Gy versus unirradiated HCT116-Clone10 cells. HCT116-Clone10 cells have similar XR response with parental HCT116 cells. Keywords = X-radiation (XR), XR sensitive, colorectal cancer cells, HCT1116 Keywords: time-course
