TITLE
Vitamin D treatment of M.tb. infected macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As macrophages are the primary site of Mtb infection and are sites of vitamin D signaling, we have used these cells to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of the immune response by the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Microarrays were used to measure the changes in gene expression induced by 1,25D treatment of H37Rv-infected THP-1 cells

DESIGN
Cells were infected at an MOI of 5 or left uninfected, and treated with 10^-7 M 1,25D for 24 hours
