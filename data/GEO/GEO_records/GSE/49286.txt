TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of c-Myb-responsive gene expression in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of c-Myb-regulation of  gene expression. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that c-Myb influences the expression of specific sets of genes that are involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair. Results provide important information on c-Myb-responsive genes that may be crucial to the cell survival and the progression of prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from c-Myb siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells compared to negative control siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells 48 h after siRNa transfection.

PLATFORM
