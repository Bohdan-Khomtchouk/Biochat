TITLE
PrEC response to Alanine or Sarcosine at 6 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PrEC cells treated with either 50uM alanine or 50uM sarcosine (N-methylglycine). Gene expression is measured after 6 hours. We wish to look at the effects of sarcosine addition in relation to alanine addition. Keywords: Amino acid addition response

DESIGN
A technical replicate is analyzed for both the alanine and the sarcosine treated cells (4 arrays total). Untreated PrEC cells are used as the reference.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
