TITLE
Integrated analysis of transcript level regulation of metabolism during human adipocyte differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we have focused on studying the link between metabolic changes driven by the differentiation into mature adipocytes of a human preadipocyte cell line (SGBS) and their regulation, through a combined experimental and computational approach. By collecting data on gene expression, PPARg, CEBPa, LXR and H3K4me3 genome-wide ChIP-seq profles and transcriptome-wide microRNA target identification for miR-27a, miR29a and miR-222, and using constraint-based modeling to estimate metabolic reaction activity, we obtained a comprehensive set of information highlighting how epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation impacts the metabolic network.

DESIGN
Illumina Solexa sequencing: Six samples in total. Two ChIP-seq samples were prepared using an antibody against H3K4me3 active TSS chromatin marker from human SGBS preadipocyte and day 10 differentiated SGBS adipocyte cells. From day 10 differentiated SGBS cells additional three samples were prepared using an antibody against PPARg, CEBPa and LXRa to determine their genome-wide binding. One input control sample is included.
