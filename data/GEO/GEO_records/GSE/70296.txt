TITLE
Effect of GW4064 on primary cultured mouse kidney proximal tubule cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression in primary cultured mouse kidney proximal tubule cells treated with either DMSO or 1uM GW4064 (an FXR agonist) was compared. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying effects of FXR activation on gene expression in mouse kidney proximal tubule cells.

DESIGN
Male C57/BJ mice aged 6 weeks were sacrificed under anesthesia and kidney proximal tubule cells were cultured until confluent. Cells were treated with either GW4064 (1uM) or equal amount of DMSO and incubated for 24 hours. 4 total RNA samples per group were analyzed and gene expression was compared between the groups. GW4064 is a compound which activates FXR, a bile acid nuclear receptor. The natural FXR agonists are usually bile acids, such as cholic acid and CDCA. GW4064 is an artificial FXR agonist which is synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich.
