TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of ascending aorta from patients with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing the gene expression profiling of dissected ascending aorta with that of control. Results provide important information to indicate pathogenesis of aortic dissection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from dissected ascending aorta compared to normal ascending aorta.
