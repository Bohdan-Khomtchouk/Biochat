TITLE
circRNA expression in HCC and matched non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the circRNA expression profile in HCC and matched non-tumor tissues, we used circRNA microArray analysis form Arraystar to examine the expression of circRNAs in HCC and matched non-tumor tissues.

DESIGN
Hepar tissues from HCC surgery were distributed into two experimental groups: normal tissue group and tumor tissue group, then perform circRNAs chips by Arraystar Human circRNAs chip (Arraystar)
