TITLE
C. elegans gene expression in healthy and PA14-infected wild-type and fshr-1 mutant worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in worms exposed to PA14 for 4 hours.  Worms used were wild-type or fshr-1(ok778) mutants.  Comparisons allowed determination of fshr-1-dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates were analyzed for each of the four conditions.  For any given replicate, all four conditions were prepared in parallel.  Conditions were N2 worms on OP50, N2 worms on PA14, fshr-1(ok778) worms on OP50, and fshr-1(ok778) worms on PA14
