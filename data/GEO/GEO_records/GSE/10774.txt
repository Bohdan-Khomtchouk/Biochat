TITLE
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (HNSCC) compared with normal keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of human HNSCC lines were compared with human normal keratinocytes by 24K cDNA microarray. The ten HNSCC analyzed are derived by the University of Michigan (UM-SCC), representing late stage SCC of different anatomic sites. Principle component analysis and hierarchical gene clustering classified ten cancer cell lines into two subsets, and associated each of the subsets with a distinctive p53 status. Keywords: Gene expression array-based
