TITLE
Omics analysis of transgenic chickens compared with non-transgenic chickens [genotypes]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To investigate food safety made from genetically modified organisms and genome editing organism, we researched the difference of the metabolic substances between wild type and transformant in chicken blood by using transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis. In this study, we compared the difference of gene expression between wild type and GFP hetero transformant in leukocyte extracted from 1-2 month old female chickens.

DESIGN
To compare gene expressions between transformant and wild type in leukocyte of 1-2 month old chickens. Compare hetero GFP transformants vs wild type with each triplet samples in brute force.

PLATFORM
