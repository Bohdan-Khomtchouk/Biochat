TITLE
Sodium arsenate response of wild type and slt2 deficient cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type (BY4741) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and their isogenic slt2 deficient counterparts, were treated for 2 hours with sodium arsenate 100 micromolar. Control (untreated) cells were also collected. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by microarray hybridization. The data obtained from these experiments allows to determine those genes that are regulated by Slt2 activity after arsenate treatment.

DESIGN
The experiments was designed as follows: Four types of samples were used: untreated wild type cells, treated wild type cells, untreated slt2- cells and treated slt2- cells. 3 independent replicates were performed for each experiment.
