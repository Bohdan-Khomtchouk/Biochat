TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of quorum sensing null strain in Yersinia pestis CO92 at 30°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Yersinia pestis is the etiology of plague that is able to sense cell density by quorum sensing. The function of quorum sensing in Y.pestis is not clear. Here, the process of quorum sensing was investigated by comparing transcript profiles when three quorum sensing synthase genes are knocked out. Two strains, ∆pgm (pigmentation-negative) mutant R88 as treatment and 3XQS mutant with mutation (∆pgm, ∆ypeIR, ∆yspIR, and ∆luxS) R115 as control are used in this analysis.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from R115 cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from R88 cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. Dye-swap design was used to remove the Cy5 and Cy3 dye bias.
