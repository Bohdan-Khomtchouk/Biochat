TITLE
Identification of tRNA sequences in Lactococcus lactis

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
we report the identification and sequences of the tRNAome of industrially relevant microorganism Lactococcus lactis

DESIGN
Three Next Generation sequencing runs annotated as S1, S2 and S3 were performed. Cells were harvested at exponential phase and tRNA was isolated. S1 and S2 were spiked with Phe-tRNAGAA from yeast and Lys-tRNAUUU from E. coli prior to cell lysis. S3 was spiked with Phe-tRNAGAA from yeast and Lys-tRNAUUU from E. coli before the library preparation to estimate the possible loss of tRNA in the extraction process.
