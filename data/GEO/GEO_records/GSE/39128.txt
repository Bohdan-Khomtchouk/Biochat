TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Transcript Isoform mapping

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Extensive transcriptional heterogeneity revealed by isoform profiling

DESIGN
Application of TIF-Seq (Transcript IsoForm Sequencing) to S.cerevisiae. The method was applied to simultaneously identify the 5' capped mRNA transcription start site and the 3' polyadenylation site in different conditions: WT cells grown in glucose media [ypd, 2 biological replicates (bio) and 3 independent library preparations, technical replicates(lib)], WT cells grown in galactose media [ypgal, 4 biological replicates (bio) and 3 independent library preparations, technical replicates(lib)]. A modified protocol designed to enrich in long mRNA molecules was performed for WT cells grown in glucose media [ypd, 2 biological replicates (bio)] and in galactose media [ypgal, 2 biological replicates (bio)] conditions. Finally, control samples performed with a modified protocol designed to identify non-capped but polyadenylated molecules was performed in WT cells grown both in glucose (nypd) and galactose (nypgal) media.
