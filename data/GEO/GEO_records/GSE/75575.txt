TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of developing seeds from low and normal phytic acid soybean lines

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Purpose: Comprehensive comparison of gene-expression profiles between 3mlpa (mutant with low phytic acid) and 3MWT (non-mutant with normal phyic acid) soybean lines (Glycine max) at five stages of seed development using RNA-Seq approaches. Methods: mRNA sequencing reads (101SE) were generated in triplicate from five seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3MWT soybean line using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: A total of 4235 differentially expressed genes, including 512-transcription factor genes were identified. Eighteen biological processes such as apoptosis, glucan metabolism, cellular transport, photosynthesis and 9 transcription factor families including WRKY, CAMTA3 and SNF2 were enriched during seed development. Genes associated with apoptosis, glucan metabolism, and cellular transport showed enhanced expression in early stages of lpa seed development, while those associated with photosynthesis showed decreased expression in late developmental stages. Conclusion: This study provides a global perspective of transcriptomal changes during soybean seed development in 3mlpa mutant. The results suggest that low phtic acid-causing mutations in 3mlpa play a role in inducing and suppressing plant defense responses during early and late stages of seed development, respectively.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of five seed developing soybean seeds from mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n triple mutant line (with low phytic acid) and MIPS1/MRP-L/MRP-N non-mutant line (with normal phytic acid). The mRNA libraries from three biological replicates of each sample were sequenced as 101 SE using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
