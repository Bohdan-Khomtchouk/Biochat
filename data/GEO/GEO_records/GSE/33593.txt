TITLE
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) SigR regulon

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
We determined the genomic locations of the SigR binding sites by chromatin immuno-precipitation of cross-linked DNA and hybridization on a tilling oligonucleotide array after 20 minutes of diamide treatment on cell cultures.

DESIGN
Three independent biological samples were prepared separately from the wild-type cells and pooled before hybridization on a single array. Three more independent biological samples were prepared from sigR deletion mutant cells, pooled, and hybridized on another single array. After normalization, the signal from the mutant cells was subtracted from the signal from the wild-type cells to recover SigR specific signal.
