TITLE
microRNA expression signatures of imatinib-treated and non-treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microRNA expression profiling in  a series of fresh-frozen neoadjuvantly imatinib-treated and non-treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), using a microarray approach. Significant differentially expressed microRNAs among imatinib-treated and non-treated groups were identified using SAM analysis.

DESIGN
Agilent microarray platform with probes matching 903 human microRNAs was used to determine miRNA expression profiles in 34 GISTs (19 imatinib-treated and 15 non-treated). Re-analysis of GSE45901 for 17 imatinib-treated GISTs. To validate the microarray platform, the expression levels of selected microRNAs were evaluated using qRT-PCR.
