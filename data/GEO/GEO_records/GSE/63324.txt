TITLE
The cohesin offloading factor Wapal is required for proper polycomb-mediated gene silencing [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cohesin offloading protein Wapal also acts as a polycomb factor in flies.  We examined its role in transcriptional role in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed on a tagged version of Wapal.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
