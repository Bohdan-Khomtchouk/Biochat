TITLE
Elevated Hedgehog signalling suppresses DNA damage responses in ageing haematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background and Aims: Detection of aging induced changes in the transcriptome of common myeloid progenitors of wild type mice. Methods: Common myeloid progenitors were harvested from bone marrow of young and aged wild-type mice.

DESIGN
Common myeloid progenitors derived from young adult (3-4 month old) and aged (22-26 month old) C57BL/6J mice were FACS sorted and RNA was extracted. Agilent Mouse 8x60K arrays were used.

PLATFORM
