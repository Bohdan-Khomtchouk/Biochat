TITLE
SOX7-enforced expression promotes the expansion of adult blood progenitors and blocks B cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we use a microarray approach to define at the molecular level the consequences of SOX7-mediated effect on B lymphopoiesis and progenitor proliferation. Transcriptome profiling analysis was performed on two subpopulations expressing low and high level of SOX7::GFP.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells extracted from iSox7 transgenic mice were treated with and without dox in duplicate
