TITLE
IRF4/BATF and interleukin-33 orchestrate development and maintenance of adipose tissue resident regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the differentiation of effector Tregs in more detail, we have performed transcriptional profiling of central Tregs and effector Tregs, based on Blimp1 expression. We performed RNA-sequencing of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, comparing Blimp1/GFP+ and Blimp1/GFP- cells

DESIGN
Three biologically independent samples for each condition were sequenced (condition 1: CD4+ CD25high Blimp1/GFP+; condition 2: CD4+ CD25high Blimp1/GFP-); cells were sorted from pooled spleens and lymphnodes of Blimp1/GFP reporter mice
