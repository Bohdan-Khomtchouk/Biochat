TITLE
Multi-platform Characterization of Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma (miRNA profiling)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA expression profiling of Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma and non-tumor adjacent tissues. The Nanostring nCounter Human miRNA Expression Assay Kit version 1.6 (Nanostring, Seattle, WA) was used to obtain microRNA profiles of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues excised from Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma patients.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from tumor and matching adjacent non-tumor lung using miRNA Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, and 100 ng were used for hybridization to Nanostring nCounter Human miRNA Expression Assay Kit version 1.6 (Nanostring, Seattle, WA) following processing protocol recommended by the manufacturer.

PLATFORM
GPL18410 NanoString nCounter Human miRNA assay (v1.1)
