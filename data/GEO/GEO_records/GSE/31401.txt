TITLE
RNA-Seq on SOLiD platform of DrosDel deficiency and w1118 flies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq reads of DrosDel deficiency (Df/+) and parental strain diploid flies along with spike-in controls was performed on the SOLiD platform. Samples are named in this dataset according to the following sample naming scheme: tissue_genotype shorthand_sex_biological replicate #_platform_technical replicate.

DESIGN
We sequenced mRNA from pools of female or male DrosDel and w1118 (parental strain for the Df/+ flies).  The same sample was sequenced across two flow cells on the SOLiD platform.

PLATFORM
GPL14601 AB SOLiD 4 System (Drosophila melanogaster)
