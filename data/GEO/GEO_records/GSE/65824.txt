TITLE
Expression data from Mvt-1 clonal isolates over-expressing Ndn 50T or Ndn 50C

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ndn is a candidate metastasis suppressor gene that has been reported to regulate transcription. We examined the changes in gene expression caused by the stable over-expression of allelic variants of Ndn, 50T or 50C, using lentiviral transduction in the mouse mammary tumor cell line Mvt-1.

DESIGN
A total of 9 samples were analyzed. In pairwise comparisons using Partek, genes with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change â‰¥abs(2.5) were selected.
