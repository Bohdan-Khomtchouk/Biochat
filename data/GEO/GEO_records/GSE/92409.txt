TITLE
A global transcriptome analysis of skin wounds of diabetic mice (db/db) treated with miR-132 or control mimics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MiR-132 is one of the most upregulated miRNAs in human skin wounds at the inflammatory phase of healing. MiR-132 inhibits inflammation but promotes growth of epidermal keratinocytes, indicating that it may facilitate the inflammatory-proliferative phase transition during wound repair. Following this line of research, here we evaluated the therapeutic potential of miR-132 in chronic wound using mouse in vivo wound model. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of skin wounds of leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice treated with miR-132 or control mimics. Db/db mouse has been used as a type 2 diabetic model with impaired wound healing capacity.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of skin wounds of db/db mice locally treated with miR-132 or control mimics for 6 days (5 mice in each group) was performed using Affymetrix mouse Clariomâ„¢ D assay.
