SUMMARY
Time course of early development of peripheral nerve, from embryonic day 9.5 to postnatal day 0. Origin of samples: mouse embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in neural crest stem cells and later glial cells under the control of the proteolipid protein gene (Plp) promoter. At E9.5 the trunk region was dissected out. At E12, E14, E16, E18 and P0 the sciatic nerve was taken. GFP-expressing cells were isolated by FACS sorting. Three or 4 separate batches of embryos analyzed at each stage. Keywords: time-course
