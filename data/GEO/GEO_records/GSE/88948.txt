TITLE
LncRNA from metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) compared with non-metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 3 metastatic and 3 non-metastatic ccRCC tissues were collected from patients. These tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery and subsequently stored at -80â„ƒ. All the resected nodules or metastatic masses were identified as renal tumor by pathologic examination. No patients received anticancer treatments before surgery in this study. We analyzed gene expression microarray data from our gene chip with 3 metastatic ccRCC tissues compared with 3 non-metastatic ccRCC tissues.

DESIGN
3 metastatic ccRCC tissues compared with 3 non-metastatic ccRCC tissues were selected for RNA extraction on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain different expression profiles for LncRNA, microRNA and mRNA between metastatic and non-metastatic ccRCC tissues. To that end, we identified differently expressed 320 lncRNAs, 27 microRNA and 560 mRNAs from the gene chip test series tissues.
