TITLE
Modeling the functional genomics of autism using human neurons.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined whether a human neuronal culture system could be used to assess the transcriptional program involved in human neural differentiation and in modeling some of the molecular features of a neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism.

DESIGN
Primary normal human neuronal progenitors differentiation for 0, 2, 4, or 8 weeks.
