TITLE
Zinc-dependent regulation of zinc import and export genes by Zur

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
We determined the genomic locations of the Zur binding sites by chromatin immuno-precipitation of cross-linked DNA and hybridization on a tilling oligonucleotide array on exponentially grown cultures of M145 and zur mutant.
