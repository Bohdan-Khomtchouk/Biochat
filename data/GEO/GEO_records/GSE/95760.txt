TITLE
Zinc-dependent regulation of zinc import and export genes by Zur

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
We determined the genomic locations of the Zur binding sites by chromatin immuno-precipitation of cross-linked DNA and hybridization on a tilling oligonucleotide array on exponentially grown cultures of M145 and zur mutant.

DESIGN
Three independent biological samples were prepared separately from the wild-type cells and pooled before hybridization on a single array. Three more independent biological samples were prepared from zur deletion mutant cells, pooled, and hybridized on another single array. After normalization, the signal from the mutant cells was subtracted from the signal from the wild-type cells to recover Zur specific signal.
