TITLE
Macs isolated E-cadherin positive Fetal liver stem progenitor cells vs adult mouse liver (pooled)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The isolation of hepatic stem cells from the adult liver has not yet been achieved due to the lack of specific surface markers.  To identify new surface markers for hepatic stem cells, we analyzed differences in the gene expression profile of fetal liver epithelial cells (FLEC) and adult liver by microarray technology.  In contrast to previous microarray studies on fetal liver, we purified FLEC by immunomagnetic selection for E-cadherin to more than 90% to analyze their specific expression profile. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Three independent biological repeats of purified FLEC were compared with adult liver and for each analysis, a dye switch was included to control for preferential dye incorporation, using a total of 6 microarrays.
