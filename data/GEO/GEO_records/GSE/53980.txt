TITLE
Beneficial Metabolic Effects of Rapamycin are Associated with Enhanced Regulatory Cells in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of rapamycin effects on white adipose tissue at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that rapamycin could modify immune cell composition and inflammatory state of the adipose tissue of obese mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA prepared from the adipose tissue of obese mice treated with rapamycin or its excipient solution (referred as vehicle), compared to adipose tissue of lean mice.
