TITLE
Influence of TCDD onto HCC cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HepG2 cell lines were treated with TCDD, as an activator for the TF AhR/arnt since it  is a known ligand for AhR. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal disease with currently very limited beneficial therapies. MicroRNAs (miRs), which are considered to be master regulators of gene expression, have significant influence on cellular pathways and phenotype, and are de-regulated in HCC, and hence are thought to be of great therapeutic potential as novel targets. We identified hsa-miR-191 as a potential target for HCC therapy. Inhibition of this miR causes decreased cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vitro as well as a significant reduction of tumor mass in vivo in an orthotopic liver xenograft model. This miR was also found to be up-regulated by a dioxin, a known liver carcinogen, and was found to be a key regulator of cancer related pathways.

DESIGN
HCC cell lines  treated with TCDD and control. Although this experiment was done with dual channel, chanels are not compared, irrelevant samples were on the reciprocal channel. Sample data tables represent relevant, single channel data.
