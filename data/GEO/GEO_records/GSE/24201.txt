TITLE
miRNA profiling of HPCX1 linked prostate cancer patients and their healthy brothers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression levels in the lymphoblastic cells of prostate cancer patients and their healthy brothers from HPCX1 linked prostate cancer families were analyzed to trace variants that might alter miRNA expression  and explain partly an inherited  genetic predisposion to prostate cancer.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines were detected using an Agilent Human miRNA V2 Oligo Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies).100 ng of total RNA was used as a starting material, and miRNAs were labeled using the Agilent miRNA Labeling Kit. Labeled RNA was hybridized to Agilent miRNA arrays with eight identical arrays per slide, with each array containing probes directed against 723 human and 76 human viral miRNAs. Slides were scanned (Agilent microarray scanner) after hybridization and data was extracted using Feature Extraction software, version 9.5.1. (Agilent Technologies). Altogether 14 cancer patients and 15 healthy brothers from 11 families were included with no replicates.
