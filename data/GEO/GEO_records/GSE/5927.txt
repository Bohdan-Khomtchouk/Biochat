TITLE
SNP expression data from breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP Expression profiling of human breast cancer: 29 tumor samples, 4 pure normal breat samples and 8 lymphocytes samples Keywords: Human Cancer

DESIGN
In the operating theater, morphologically visible tumors were removed by surgery and examined by a surgical pathologist to confirm the presence of cancer cells by cryosections. The tissue samples were divided into discrete aliquots, flash frozen and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen. Pure normal breast tissues are got from costmetic surgery and pure lymphocytes samples are from donators.
