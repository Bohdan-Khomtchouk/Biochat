TITLE
Sister chromatid cohesion establishment by acetylation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cohesion between sister chromatids depends on the chromosomal cohesin complex and allows the spindle apparatus in mitosis to recognize replicated chromosomes for segregation into daughter cells. Sister chromatid cohesion is established concomitant with DNA replication, and requires the essential Eco1 protein, a replication fork-associated acetyl transferase. The mechanism by which Eco1 establishes sister chromatid cohesion is not known. Here, we show that the cohesin subunit Smc3 is acetylated in an Eco1-dependent manner during S phase to establish sister chromatid cohesion. We isolated spontaneous suppressors of the thermosensitive eco1-1 allele in budding yeast, and identified the suppressor mutations from the hybridization pattern of genomic DNA on oligonucleotide tiling arrays. An acetylation mimicking mutation of a conserved lysine in Smc3 to asparagine (K113N) makes Eco1 dispensable for cell growth, indicating that Smc3 acetylation is Eco1â€™s only essential function. We identified a second set of eco1-1 suppressor mutations in the budding yeast ortholog of the cohesin regulator Wapl (Wpl1/Rad61). Wapl destabilizes cohesin on chromosomes, and Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation during S-phase might render cohesin resistant to Wapl. Our results clarify the role of Eco1 in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, and suggest that Eco1 modifies cohesin to stabilize an Eco1-independent cohesion establishment reaction.
