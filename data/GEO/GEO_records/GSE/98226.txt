TITLE
Gene expression of cardiac tissues in dietary obese mice administered with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (Dpp4) inhibitors are used worldwide to combat diabetes, however, their roles in cardiovascular disorders are yet to be defined. Here we show that a DPP4 inhibitor, linagliptin, contributes for the suppression of capillary rarefaction in cardiac tissues of dietary obese mice model. Imposing a high fat diet into mice induced capillary rarefaction and cardiac dysfunction. These pathologies associated with high DPP4 level in circulation, and the administration of linagliptin into dietary obese mice suppressed the development of capillary rarefaction and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction. Early growth response protein 1 (EGR1), known as an angiogenic transcription factor, is significantly reduced in the cardiac tissue upon metabolic stress, and this suppression was inhibited by the administration of linagliptin.
