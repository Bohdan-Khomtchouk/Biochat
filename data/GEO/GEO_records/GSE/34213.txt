TITLE
Gene expression data of micro RNA from skeletal muscle sample of pig DL and Pi breed

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Total of 675 porcine miRNA candidates datasets revealed by 100% aligment homologs and review literatures publication. Probe-sets were screened, analysed for differential expression between different breeds (german landrace and pietrain) at different stages of development (63, 91 dpc and adult stage)

DESIGN
microRNAs of skeletal muscle from german landrace and pietrain at 63, 91 dpc and adult stages were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA arrays.
