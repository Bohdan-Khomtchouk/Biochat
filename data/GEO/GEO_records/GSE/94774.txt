TITLE
Next generation sequencing of RNA expression on total splenic B cells  from NOD mice fed variable diets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study is to examine if  feeding NOD mice with diets supplemented with SCFAs causes altered gene expression in Splenic B cells Methods: B cell RNA profiles from NOD.LT mice fed fed different diets, a non-purified diet (n=4), a high amylose diet (n=4), a high amylose diet supplemented with acetate (n=4) or a high amylose diet supplemented with butyrate (n=4) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, by Illumina 100 - base HT mode the sequence reads that passed quality filters were summarized into gene models using featureCounts from the Rsubread package, and differential gene expression for the various contrasts between dietary treatments was identified using the EdgeR analysis in R Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 20 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build GRCm38) and identified 16,257 transcripts present in B cells from NOD.LT mice fed different diet. Conclusions: Our study investigates how differing diets alter the expression of important genes in B cells, allowing us to further understand the role diets can play in modulating T1D development.

DESIGN
B cell mRNA profiles of 15 week NOD.LT mice fed either NP (N=4), HAMS (N=4), HAMSA (N=4) or HAMSB (N=4) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using ?.
