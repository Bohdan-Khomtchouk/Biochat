TITLE
Gene expression profile of TBBR modified T cells compared to control ΔTGFbRII T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this experiment was to compare the transcriptional profile of TBBR (TGFbRII ectodomain fused to 41BB endodomain) vs control ΔTGFbRII (truncated version that lacks an endodomain) modified T cells. RNA samples were isolated from trangenic T cells generated from three independent donors.

DESIGN
T cells were sorted 5 days post transduction using a SH800S cell sorter (SONY Biotechnology) to normalize for the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between transgenic T cells. RNA was isolated at 24 hours after stimulating the transgenic T cells with OKT3 and TGFb using the RNeasy mini plus kit (QIAGEN) and hybridized to the nCounter PanCancer immune profiling panel (human codeset).
