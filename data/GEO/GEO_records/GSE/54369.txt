TITLE
Human male and female GBM cells stably transfected with shRNA targeting CDCA7L

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CDCA7L is expressed higher in male astrocytoma/GBM than female tumors or normal cells, and knockdown of CDCA7L blocks growth of male tumor cells, but not female tumor cells. We stably depleted CDCA7L in human GBM cells and compared gene expression to control GBM cells expressing non-trageting scrambled shRNA in male and female cells to identify gene expression differences between male and female cells and between CDCA7L-depleted and scrambled shRNA control cells.

DESIGN
Independent established cell lines taken from human male and female patients with malignant gliomas were stably transfected with either shRNA targeting CDCA7L or non-targeting scrambled shRNA control. Two independent human male GBM cell lines and two independent human female GBM cell lines were used: male LN18 GBM cells, male U118MG GBM cells, female U87MG GBM cells, and female SF539 GBM cells (2 technical replicates per each cell line except for SF539).
