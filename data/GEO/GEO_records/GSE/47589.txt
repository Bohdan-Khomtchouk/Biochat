TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli C strains (wt and PKH5000, a butanol-tolerant mutant) after 1-butanol treatment

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to explore genes that are differentially expressed in E. coli C strains (wt and a butanol-tolerant mutant) after 1-butanol treatment. The butanol-tolerant mutant strain PKH5000 (denoted by 'E' for 'evolved') were derived from KCTC 2571 (wt) (denoted by 'A' for 'ancestral') by proton beam irradiation. 0 and 1 in sample title mean before and after butanol treatment, respectively.

DESIGN
All microarray experiments were carried out in triplicate (rep1-3). Probes were spotted in duplicate on separate area of each microarray slide, which produces two GPR files (a and b suffixes).
