TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison between brain regions of behaviorally distinct wild and domesticated zebrafish (Danio rerio) populations

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish populations recently collected from the wild differ from domesticated populations in anxiety-related behaviors. We measured anxiety-related behaviors in wild and domesticated zebrafish populations and performed a multi-brain region transcriptional comparison using microarrays to try to understand the genetic changes that accompany behavioral adaptation to domestication.

DESIGN
We performed a microarray analysis comparing the midbrain and telencephalon brain regions of male and female adult zebrafish from four populations varying in domestication history (Wild: Nadia (N) and Pargana (P), and Domesticated: Scientific Hatchery (S) and Transgenic Mosaic 1 (T)). We collected 16 samples per brain region (4 samples per zebrafish population, with 1 telencephalon sample missing for the S population). We attempted to maintain equal sex ratios within each zebrafish population, but this was not always possible due to sex biases within some populations.
