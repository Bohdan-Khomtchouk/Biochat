TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of rhesus macaques vaccinated with ALVAC-SIV/gp120 adjuvanted in Alum or MF59.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Canarypox/gp120/Alum vaccines decreased the risk of HIV acquisition in humans. We demonstrate here the efficacy of this vaccine regimen also in the SIVmac251 macaque model when we used the alum but not the MF59 adjuvant. Analysis of innate and adaptive cell responses, envelope antibodies Fc profiles and glycoforms demonstrated a lower inflammatory response with alum than MF59. Alum elicited mucosal V2 peptide-specific IgG associated with vaccine efficacy whereas the MF59 induced mucosal V2 peptide-specific IgG associated with increased risk of infection. Alum modulated the expression of 12 genes, 7 of which are part of the RAS pathway, that correlates with vaccine efficacy and were linked to innate responses that preserve mucosal integrity and adaptive mucosal antibody response to V2. Thus, activation of the RAS pathway, preservation of mucosal integrity and mucosal antibody to V2 in concert, reduce the risk of SIVmac251 acquisition.
