TITLE
Inflammasome-driven catecholamine catabolism in macrophages blunts lipolysis during ageing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed whole transcriptome profiling on sorted tissue macrophages from the spleen or from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of wild-type mice that are 3-month or 24-month of age or from 24-month Nlrp3-/- mice

DESIGN
Profiles were generated on fluorescence-activated-cells (FACs) sorted F480+CD11b+ cells from spleen or adipose tissue, using sequencing analysis
