TITLE
miRNA expression during differentiation of white and brown adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA array of a timecourse of 3T3-L1 differentiating into white adipocytes and C3H10T1/2 into brown adipocytes

DESIGN
3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into white adipocytes, C3H10T1/2 were differentiated into brown adipocytes, and samples were havested at different timepoints of differentiation.
