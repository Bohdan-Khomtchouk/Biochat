TITLE
In Vitro Characterization of SK-ES1 Preclinical Radiation-Adapted Model for Ewing Sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in wild type SK-ES1 Ewing Sarcoma cells when compared to SK-ES1 Ewing Sarcoma cells that received six 4 Gy fractions (cumulative dose of 24 Gy) of ionizing radiation (radiation-adapted cell line). The hypothesis tested being that repeated ionizing radiation exposure of modifies radiation therapy response in Ewing Sarcoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from wild type SK-ES1 cells and radiation-adapted SK-ES1 cells.
