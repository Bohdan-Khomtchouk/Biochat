TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of PIAS1 knockdown by siRNA on the androgen regulated gene programs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of PIAS1 co-regulation in the androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer cell line.

DESIGN
VCaP cells were exposed to control (siSCR) or PIAS1 (siPIAS1) targeted siRNA for 96h. After 16h of 100 nM testosterone (or without) treatment the total RNA was isolated, each treatment included three replicates.
