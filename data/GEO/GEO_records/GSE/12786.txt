TITLE
FLO1 is a variable green beard gene that drives biofilm-like cooperation in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has emerged as an archetype of eukaryotic cell biology. Here we show that S. cerevisiae is also a model for the evolution of cooperative behavior by revisiting flocculation, a self-adherence phenotype lacking in most laboratory strains. Expression of the gene FLO1 in the laboratory strain S288C restores flocculation, an altered physiological state, reminiscent of bacterial biofilms. Flocculation protects the FLO1-expressing cells from multiple stresses, including antimicrobials and ethanol. Furthermore, FLO1+ cells avoid exploitation by non-expressing flo1 cells by self/non-self recognition: FLO1+ cells preferentially stick to one another, regardless of genetic relatedness across the rest of the genome. Flocculation, therefore, is driven by one of a few known “green beard genes”, which direct cooperation towards other carriers of the same gene. Moreover, FLO1 is highly variable among strains both in expression and in sequence, suggesting that flocculation in S. cerevisiae is a dynamic, rapidly-evolving social trait. This dataset contains raw transcriptome data of flocculating cells (that express FLO1 driven by the GAL1 promoter) and non-flocculating cells (that do not express FLO1).

DESIGN
Cultures of flocculating and non-flocculating cells were grown for 24 hours in YPGal medium.  Subsequently, RNA was isolated from these cultures, converted into cDNA and analyzed using commercially available Afymetrix S98 arrays.  For each culture, two biological replicates were analyzed.
