TITLE
Circadian regulation in rat abdominal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms are oscillations with a periodicity of 24 hours that are controlled by an endogenous clock and are observed in virtually all aspects of mammalian function from expression of genes to complex physiological processes. The master clock is present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the anterior part of the hypothalamus and controls peripheral clocks present in other parts of the body.  Although much is known about the mechanism of the central clock in the SCN, the regulation of clocks present in peripheral tissues is still unclear.  This study is designed to examine fluctuations in gene expression in abdominal white adipose tissue within the 24 hour circadian cycle in normal animals. The objectives of this study is  to identify and analyze circadian oscillation in gene expression in white adipose tissue, and to identify the role of circadian regulation in coordinating the functioning of this dynamic tissue.

DESIGN
Fifty-four male normal Wistar rats (250-350 g body weight) were housed in a strictly controlled stress free environment with light:dark cycles of 12 hr:12hr. Three animals were sacrificed at each of 18 selected time points within the 24 hour cycle. RNA was prepared from abdominal adipose tissue for gene arrays.  Two samples were not used due to RNA degradation: Adipose .25-1 and Adipose 11-2. Time point designations reflect time after lights on in hours.
