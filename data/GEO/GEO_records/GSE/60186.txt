TITLE
Expression data from WT and IL-2 secondary CD4 T cell effectors responding towards infuenza A virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How IL-2 produced by secondary CD4 T cell effectors, derived from resting memory cells, impacts memory CD4 T cell function and survival to memory following antigen re-encounter is unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences between WT and IL-2 deficient secondary CD4 T cell effectors purified from the lung on day 7 following A/PR8/34-OVAII influenza infection.

DESIGN
Congenic primed memory DO11.10 TCR trangenic CD4 T cells were sort purifed from the lungs of infected mice on day 7 post infection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain only CD4 T cell populations that had entered into the immune response by also sorting and collecting only those cells that had divided at least 5 times by CFSE analysis.
