TITLE
Genomic comparison of M. tuberculosis PDIM spontaneous mutants

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Genomic comparisons among PDIM positive and negative isolates. Standard in vitro exponential phase cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC27294 were plated on 7H11 plates. Individual colonies were sub-cultured in 7H9 broth and metabolically labeled with [14C] propionic acid. The apolar lipid fraction was then extracted from those cultures and assayed for PDIM (phthiocerol dimycocerosate) content via TLC. Individual isolates producing and deficient in PDIM were selected for performing genomic comparisons.

DESIGN
Four M. tuberculosis clones derived from the same parental strain were compared. Two of them were PDIM producers while the other two were PDIM deficient. Two replicates were performed for each comparison.
