TITLE
Hepatocyte-specific knockout of Pten and of Pten and Tgfbr2 in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of hepatocyt-specific knockout of Pten and of Pten and Tgfbr2 in mice as a model for human cholangiocarcinoma  was determined Affymetrix Mouse 1.0ST chips were used to measure gene expression

DESIGN
Gene expression of the following mouse livers were characterized A. WT  (n=3). B. Pten-/- (n=4). C. Pten-/- Tgfbr2-/- (n=4).
