TITLE
Impact of sucrose retrieval upon ex vitro acclimatization

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Hybridization and study was conducted to measure the impact of short-term sugar deprivation, on an acclimatization time-scale, imposed to plantlet transferred from in vitro to ex vitro culture conditions. We thus submitted in vitro tomato plantlets to sugar deprivation for 24-h in order to better understands the impact of sucrose retrieval upon ex vitro acclimatization.

DESIGN
A total of six microarrays were used for this experiment. More precisely, three biological replicates represented by individually grown in vitro plantlet from both treatments were hybridized. Dye swap was conducted as technical replicate in order to minimize dye bias.
