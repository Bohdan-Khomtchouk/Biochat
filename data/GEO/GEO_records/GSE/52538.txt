TITLE
Verfication of immunogenic nature by microarray screening

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Screening of 14 novel proteins derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 identified prior via screening of cDNA libraries. The full-length proteins were attached using a specific HaloTag to their corresponding ligand surface, HaloLink. Screening was performed using two different polyclonal antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae (Acris AP00792PU-N and Abcam ab20947) and detection achieved by Goat polyclonal to rabbit IgG conjugated with Chromeo-546 (Abcam ab60317). In order to assess their potential immungenic nature and rank the proteins investigated, comparative analysis using already described antigens from K. pneumoniae were used in the assay.

DESIGN
Each microarray was seperated into different incubation chambers using the 16-well ProPlate (Grace Biolabs) multi-well gaskets. As positive references ompA and mdh were used. For negative control gapA was used and the crude lysates of the expression host (Acella E.coli) and buffer were spotted as well.Samples and controls were spotted with five replicates each. Incubation was performed using different antibodies reactive to K. pneumoniae.
