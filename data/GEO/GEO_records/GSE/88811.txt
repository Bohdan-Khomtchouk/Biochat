TITLE
Microarray expression profiling of dysregulated long non-coding RNAs between RCC tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During the past decade, increasing evidence has shown that lncRNAs play important roles in oncogenesis and tumor suppression; however, the roles of lncRNAs in RCC are poorly understood. To address this issue, we used Agilent human lncRNA microarray chips and bioinformatics tools to assess lncRNA expression in 5 pairs of RCC tissues. A dysregulated lncRNA expression profile was identified by microarray and verified by qRT-PCR in 60 pairs of renal cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
5 pairs of RCC tissues were analyzed by lncRNA microarray chips, parts of the dysregulated lncRNAs were further validated in an additional cohort of 55 samples by qRT-PCR.
