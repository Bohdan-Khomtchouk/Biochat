TITLE
Expression analysis of purified intestinal phagocytes in Schmidtea mediterranea

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Identification of differentially expressed genes in intestinal phagocytes, compared to non-intestinal cells in Schmidtea mediterranea.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from either intestinal phagocytes or non-intestinal cells (control). Four independent biological replicates were conducted with two dye swaps. Labeled targets were hybridized to two oligonucleotide arrays on which 11,521 planarian transcripts were represented.
