TITLE
BRD2 cooperates with CTCF to enforce transcriptional and architectural boundaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BET (bromodomain and extraterminal motif) proteins are pharmacologic targets for the treatment of diverse diseases, yet the roles of individual BET family members remain unclear. We find that BRD2 colocalizes with the architectural/insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) genome-wide. To test a role for BRD2 in chromatin architecture we performed HiC in uninduced G1E-ER4 cells (-GATA1), and compared it to HiC in BRD2-depleted G1E-ER4 cells

DESIGN
HiC in the G1E-ER4 cell line in the uninduced (-GATA1) condition, comparing unedited control cells to two independent G1E-ER4-derived cell lines in which BRD2 was depleted to undetectable levels using CRISPR/Cas9 (C8 = BRD2 KO cell line #1, D = BRD2 KO cell line #2).

PLATFORM
