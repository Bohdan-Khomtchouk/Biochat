SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify immediate early transcriptional targets of ephrin-B1 forward signaling that are relevant to palatogenesis. The Ephs compose a family of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling molecules that can be activated by their cognate ligands, the ephrins.  Despite the importance of Eph/ephrin signaling in a wide variety of developmental and cell biological processes, a potential downstream transcriptional response has not been explored.  To understand the role of ephrin-B1 signaling in palatogenesis, we examined transcriptional response to ephrin-B1 in a primary mouse embryonic palatal shelf cell culture system.  We find an immediate early signature of gene expression that reflects the activation of Erk/MAPK signaling by ephrin-B1 signaling in the palatal shelves.
