TITLE
Expression data of Frankia sp. strain CcI6 under salt stress, osmotic stress, and control conditions (no salt/osmotic stress)

ORGANISM
Frankia sp. CcI6

SUMMARY
Purpose:to identify the response of  Frankia sp.strain CcI6 to salt and osmotic stress. Frankia sp.strain CcI6 was exposed to salt  and  osmotic stress for seven days. RNAseq analysis was carried out to ge an insight into the response of the bacterium under salt and osmotic stress conditons

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Frankia sp. CcI6 grown under three different condions (control, salt stress, and osmotic stress) were generated by deep sequencing and mapped to the genome by CLC Genomic workstation. The transcriptome profile of the strain under salt and osmotic stress conditions was compared to the transcriptome profile under control conditons (no salt stress)
