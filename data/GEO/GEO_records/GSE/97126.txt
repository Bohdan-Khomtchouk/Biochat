TITLE
Constitutive Activation of HH-GLI Signaling in the Metanephric Mesenchyme causes Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction during Mammalian Embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study explores the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of congenital intrinsic obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction. A hedgehog-dependent mechanism underlying mammalin intrinsic ureteropelvic obstruction is defined.

DESIGN
Tissue was microdissected from the kidney-ureter junction at E13.5, one day after the onset of Ptc2-lacZ expression, from PTC-/-MM mice; 2 PTC2+ and 2 PTC2- cell populations were isolated using antibodies specific for PTC2 and FACS sorting.
