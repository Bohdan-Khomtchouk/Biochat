TITLE
Chronic psoriatic skin inflammation leads to increased monocyte adhesion and aggregation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Psoriasis patients exhibit an increased risk of death by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and have elevated levels of circulating intermediate (CD14++CD16+) monocytes. This elevation could represent evidence of monocyte dysfunction in psoriasis patients at risk of CVD, as increases in circulating CD14++CD16+ monocytes are predictive of myocardial infarction and death. An elevation in the CD14++CD16+ cell population has been previously reported in patients with psoriatic disease, which has been confirmed in the cohort of our human psoriasis patients.  CD16 expression was induced in CD14++CD16neg classical monocytes following plastic adhesion, which also elicited enhanced β2 but not β1 integrin surface expression, suggesting increased adhesive capacity. Indeed, we found that psoriasis patients have increased monocyte aggregation among circulating PBMCs which is recapitulated in the KC-Tie2 murine model of psoriasis. Visualization of human monocyte aggregates using imaging cytometry revealed that classical CD14++CD16neg monocytes are the predominant cell type participating in these aggregate pairs. Many of these pairs also included CD16+ monocytes, which could account for apparent elevations of intermediate monocytes. Additionally, intermediate monocytes and monocyte aggregates were the predominant cell type to adhere to TNF-α and IL-17A-stimulated dermal endothelium. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrated that monocyte aggregates have a distinct transcriptional profile from singlet monocytes and monocytes following plastic adhesion, suggesting that circulating monocyte responses to aggregation are not fully accounted for by homotypic adhesion, and that further factors influence their functionality.
