TITLE
Expression data from three rice lines (1-control, 1-transgenic and 1-negative segregant) throughout generations and under salt stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The approval of genetically modified (GM) crops is preceded by years of intensive research to demonstrate safety to humans and environment. We recently showed that in vitro culture stress is the major factor influencing proteomic differences of GM vs. non-GM plants. This made us question the number of generations needed to erase such memory. We also wondered about the relevance of alterations promoted by transgenesis as compared to environment-induced ones. Here we followed three rice lines (1-control- C, 1-transgenic- Ta and 1-negative segregant- NSb) throughout eight generations after transgenesis, and further analyzed their response to salinity stress on the F6 generation.

DESIGN
Three pools of 10 whole fifteen days-old rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) were selected from each line at F4, F6 and F8 generations. Because salinity stress was imposed on half of the seedlings (C, Ta and NSb) in F6 generation, from this generation onwards we worked with six rice lines (C, Csalt, Ta, Tasalt, NSb, NSbsalt).
