TITLE
Infection of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with the Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000 cor- carrying the effector HopBB1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana infected with the Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000 cor- carrying the type three secretion system effector HopBB1

DESIGN
Two-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col-0 ecotype) were sprayed with a mock solution (10 mM MgCl2) or bacteria [Pto DC3000 (EV), Pto DC3000 cor- (EV); Pto DC3000 cor- (HopBB1); Pto DC3000 cor- (HopBB1G126D)] at OD600=0.2 with 10mM MgCl2 and 0.04% Silwet L-77. Samples were harvested 24 hours after infection. This experiment included three biological replicates, each one corresponding to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
