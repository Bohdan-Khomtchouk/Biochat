TITLE
Gene-expression differences in peripheral blood between lithium responders and non-responders in the “Lithium Treatment -Moderate dose Use Study” (LiTMUS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene-expression changes in treatment responders vs non-responders to two different treatments among subjectrs participating in LiTMUS. Results provide information on pathways that may be involved in the clinical response to Lithium in patients with bipolar disorder.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from PAXgene blood RNA tubes from 60 subjects with bipolar disorder, randomized to 2 treatment groups (OPT, Li+OPT) at 2 time-points (baseline, 1 month after treatment)
