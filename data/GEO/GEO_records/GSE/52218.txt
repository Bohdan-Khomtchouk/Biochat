TITLE
Transcriptional consequences of Zfy1 and Zfy2 expression in GV oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sex-reversed ‘XYSry-’ female mice that lack Sry due to the 11 kb deletion Srydl1Rlb have very limited fertility, partly due to the effects of posessing only a single X chromosome. However, the fertility deficit is even worse in sex-reversed XY females than in XO females, implicating Y-linked genes in the further loss of fertility. Transgenic addition of Yp-linked genes to XO females and also to normal XX females implicated Zfy2 (but not the related Zfy1) as the cause of this effect.  This study examines the transcriptional effects of Zfy2 and Zfy1 in GV oocytes from normal XX females.

DESIGN
18 samples representing 3 biological replicates from each of 6 genotypes. Genotypes are XX (normal control); XX,Zfy2-nf (control with non-functional Zfy2 transgene); XX,Zfy2 (with Zfy2 transgene); XX,Zfy2+Eif2s3y (contaminated sample, XX with Zfy2 transgene and also an Eif2s3y transgene in proportion of the cells), XX,Zfy1-lo (with single-copy Zfy1 transgene); XX-Zfy1-hi (with multi-copy Zfy1 transgene).
