TITLE
Effects of starter microbiota on the gastric transcriptome profile of 2 weeks old caesarean derived pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
An early settlement of a complex gut microbiota can protect against gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, but the effects of neonatal microbiota colonization on the maturation of the porcine gastric mucosa are largely unknown. The transcriptome of the oxyntic mucosa of  12 caesarian-derived pigs previously associated with microbiota of different complexity  was studied. Pigs received sow blood serum at birth (d0), 2 mL of starter microbiota (10^7 CFU of each Lactob. Amylovorus (LAM), Clostr. glycolicum, and Parabacteroides spp.) on d1-d3 of age and either a placebo inoculant (simple association, SA) or an inoculant consisting of diluted feces of an adult sow (complex association, CA) on d3-d4 of age. Then   pigs were fed a moist diet . Gastric samples were obtained at on euthanised pigs at 2 weeks of age.

DESIGN
The analysis of whole mRNA transcript expression was done by Affymetrix©Porcine Gene 1.1 ST array strips, a Robust Multichip Analysis was performed on the CEL files, and Transcripts ID’s were associated to human gene names, based on Sus scrofa Ensemble
