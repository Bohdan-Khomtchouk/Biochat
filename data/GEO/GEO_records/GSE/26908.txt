TITLE
(1) Murine CD4 T cells: naïve vs peptide treated and naïve vs peptide+LPS treated. (2) Murine CD8 T cells naïve vs HY-specific cells from tolerant mice and naïve vs cells from rejecting mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
(1) Transcriptional profiling of mouse CD4 T cells comparing naïve HY-specific TCR transgenic T cells with the same cells recovered after adoptive transfer into WT female C57BL/6 mice on day 5 following treatment with HY peptide (100microgrammes intranasally days 1,2 and 3) and comparing naïve HY-specific TCR transgenic T cells with the same cells recovered after adoptive transfer into WT female C57BL/6 mice on day 5 following treatment with HY peptide plus LPS (100microgrammes peptide and 20microgrammes LPS intranasally day 1) (2)Transcriptional profiling of mouse CD8 T cells comparing naïve CD8 T cells with HY-tetramer positive cells recovered from tolerant peptide treated (see above) WT female C57BL/6 mice on day 22 after male skin graft or 10-15 days after treatment with male spleen cells and comparing naïve CD8 T cells with HY-tetramer positive cells recovered from untreated (rejecting) WT female C57BL/6 mice on day 22 after male skin graft or 10-15 days after treatment with male spleen cells.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment comapring naïve cells with cells from tolerant or immunised mice - both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Biological replicates: CD4s: Naïve, 4 replicates from pools of at least 3 mice; peptide-treated 3 replicates from pools of cells from 18 mice; peptide+PLS-treated 4 replicated from pools of cells from 15 mice. CD8s: Naïve, 3 replicates from pools of at least 3 mice; peptide-treated tolerant, 4 replicates from pools of 14 mice; untreated rejecting, 3 replicates from pools of 10 mice.
