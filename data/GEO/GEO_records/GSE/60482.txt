TITLE
Stretch-Enhancers Delineate Disease-Associated Regulatory Nodes in T Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T Cell stretch-enhancers are vulnerable to Jak inhibitor tofacitinib

DESIGN
Treatment of T cells with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, disproportionately altered the expression of RA risk genes with stretech-enhancer (SE) structures.
