TITLE
Expression data from rat cardiac fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The overall data contains expression profile of rat genes of cardiac fibroblasts. G-protein signaling is regulated in cardiac fibroblasts. The expresssion of angiotensin II receptor or cytokine such as interleukin is regulated by PTX (which is suggested to suppress Gi function) treatment. Keywords: control or PTX treatment

DESIGN
Rat cardiac fibroblasts were primarily isolated and plated onto 6 well plate. Cells were treated with water (Ctl 1-3) or PTX for 24 hr (PTX 1-3) and lysed by Buffer RLT. Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN kit and gene expression was analysed using Affymetrix Gene Chip system and GCOS analysis.
