TITLE
Expression data from rat cardiac fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The overall data contains expression profile of rat genes of cardiac fibroblasts. G-protein signaling is regulated in cardiac fibroblasts. The expresssion of angiotensin II receptor or cytokine such as interleukin is regulated by PTX (which is suggested to suppress Gi function) treatment. Keywords: control or PTX treatment
