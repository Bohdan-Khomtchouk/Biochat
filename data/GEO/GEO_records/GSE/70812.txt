TITLE
MntR(Rv2788): a transcriptional regulator that controls manganese homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of SirR and manganese regulated expression of genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains comparing high manganese vs. low manganese in Rv (wild type Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and ST70 (mntR mutant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis)

DESIGN
Two strains each with two conditions experiment, Rv (Mycobacterium tuberculosis wild type strain) high manganese vs. low manganese and ST70 (mntR mutant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) high manganese vs. low manganese.  Number of biological replicates is 3 for each condition for each strain.
