TITLE
Effects of caerulein on Mist1KO pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse pancreas from wild type and MistKO animals were induced either with caerulein or saline as control and processed for RNA.  Targets from three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Mouse Expression chips 430.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with differential expression patterns of genes which might contribute to pancreatitis. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
3 wild type saline, 3 wild type caerulein, 3 Mist1KO saline and 3 Mist1KO caerulein pancreata were used and biological replicates were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL339 [MOE430A] Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array
