TITLE
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis reveals lineage relationships between mouse and human gliomas and identifies stem cells and PNET as distinct entities

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine and human genome-wide microarray expression profiles (including GSE19404) were compared using Partek and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in order to identify similarities. A murine PNET-like tumour by morphology was found to resemble human ATRT, whereas experimental glioma resembled a particular human glioblastoma subclass.

DESIGN
Tumour material was resected or neurosphere cultures pelleted. Part of the material was processed for histological analysis, another was snap-frozen for isolation of RNA. RNA was then labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix MoEx-v1 arrays and analysed using Partek. This array dataset comprises Affymetrix MoEx-v2 microarrays hybridised with RNA from brain-derived tumour material (CA), subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived growth transformed neurospheres (CATR) and control neurospheres (CS, GFP).
