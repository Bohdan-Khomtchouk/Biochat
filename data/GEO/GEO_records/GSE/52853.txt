TITLE
Human Dental Pulp Cells Mature vs. Immature stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report screening of genes differentially expressed in cells isolated from immature and mature third molar teeth. Among them, a homeobox transcription factor, distal-less homeobox 4 (DLX4) was highly expressed in immature human dental pulp cells, and significantly enhanced iPSC colony formation in combination with OCT3/4, SOX2, and KLF4 to the level comparable with that using classical combination of Yamanaka's factors, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of developmental stage of teeth on global gene expression, we compared DPCs isolated from immature (14-16yr) and mature (23-60yr) teeth.
