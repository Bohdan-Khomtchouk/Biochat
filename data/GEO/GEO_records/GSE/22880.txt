TITLE
Gene expression profile of primary human naive and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression data of primary human naive and memory CD4+T lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood are generated to be analyzed in different ways such as for traditional searching of differentially expressed genes between the two cell subsets or in combination to in-silico data of microRNAs target prediction for microRNAs known to be characteristically expressed in the two cell subsets.

DESIGN
Two cell subsets (cell types) FACS purified from peripheral blood of six samples/healthy donors (samples #3,5,6,7,026,065). Naive CD4+ T cells were extracted from all 6 samples and 6 biological replicas were obtained (3N, 5N, 6N, 7N, 026N, 065N), while memory CD4+T cells were extracted from 4 samples and 4 biological replicas were obtained (3m, 5m, 6m, 7m). Both naive and memory replicas from samples 3, 5, 6 and 7 were hybridized onto two beadsarrays each while those from samples 026 and 065 were hybridized on 1 beadsarray each (for a total of 18 beadsarrays used). For analysis purposes naive cells samples 3N, 5N, 6N and 7N can be considered paired with memory samples 3m, 5m, 6m and 7m respectively, since they are obtained from the same blood samples/healthy donors.
