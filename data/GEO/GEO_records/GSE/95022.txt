TITLE
Analysis of influence of Excretory Secretory Products from wild and laboratory Fasciola hepatica isolates on LPS activated bovine macrophages

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
F. hepatica is a parasite causing losses of great importance in animal production. It is also considered a zoonosis of growing importance. During the infection the parasite releases a number of antigens (called Excretory Secretory Products - ESP) facilitating the parasites survival. A number of ESP components have immunomodulatory properties.  To determine if ES from various F. hepatica isolates have different immunomodulatory abilities LPS activated “BOMA” cells were stimulated with ES of laboratory Weybridge (FhWey-ES) and wild (FhWild-ES) Fasciola hepatica isolates.

DESIGN
The experiment was performed in quadruplicate. Cells were seeded in 24 deep well plates. Four wells were stimulated and four were unstimulated and treated as controls. RNA was isolated from cells from each well followed by labelling with Cy3 (control cells) or Cy5 (stimulated cells). The material was hybrised to four bovine mRNA microarrays (Agilent).

PLATFORM
GPL11648 Agilent-023647 B. taurus (Bovine) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
