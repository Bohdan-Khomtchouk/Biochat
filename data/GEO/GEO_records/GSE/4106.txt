TITLE
Gene expression induced by Nanosecond pulsed electric fields

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use a human whole genome microarray to analyze the effects of nanosecond pulsed electric fields on Jurkat cells with the focus on early response genes to DNA damage. Keywords: nanosecond pulsed electric fields, jurkat cells, DNA damage

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles before, 30min and 60min after electric field radiation are surveyed. Three replicates for each time point.
