TITLE
Effect of co-culture with macrophages on two colon cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These data suggest that co-culture with macrophages increases expression of NDRG-1 in epithelial cell lines.  The finding is confirmed in 1 mouse epithelial cell line, and in tissue derived from mice genetically and dietetically altered to increase macrophage infiltration of the small and large intestinal epithelium.  NDRG1 is identified as a potential mediator of macrophage effects on tumorigenesis in the large and small intestine. Array data is part of a larger study involving the effects of Vitamin D, in concert with macrophages, on intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis, entitled Cell autonomous and non-autonomous interactions of a western-style diet and the vitamin D receptor in intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis

DESIGN
Cells from human colon cancer cell lines were cultured either alone, with Vitamin D3, with THP1 macrophages, or with THP1 macrophages and Vitamin D3, in a system which allowed no physical contact but exchange of soluble factors between the cell types.
