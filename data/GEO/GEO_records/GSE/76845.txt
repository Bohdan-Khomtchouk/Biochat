TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in human plasma of hypertension patients from North China

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the plasma of human with hypertension and healthy controls from North China.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs for hypertension healthy control samples from North China. Each sample (total RNA) was pooled from  the total RNA of three age and gender matched subjects (hypertension patients or healthy controls).
