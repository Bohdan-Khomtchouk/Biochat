TITLE
Ebf2 is a selective marker of brown and beige adipogenic precursor cells (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brown adipocytes, muscle and dorsal dermis descend from precursor cells in the dermomyotome, but the factors that regulate commitment to the brown adipose lineage are unknown. Here, we prospectively isolated and determined the molecular profile of embryonic brown preadipose cells. Brown adipogenic precursor activity in embryos was confined to Pdgfrα+, Myf5Cre-lineage-marked cells. RNAseq analysis identified Early B Cell Factor-2 (Ebf2) as one of the most selectively expressed genes in this cell fraction. Importantly, Ebf2-expressing cells purified from Ebf2-GFP embryos or brown fat tissue did not express myoblast or dermal cell markers and uniformly differentiated into brown adipocytes. Interestingly, Ebf2-expressing cells from white fat tissue in adult animals differentiated into brown-like (or beige) adipocytes. Loss of Ebf2 in brown preadipose cells reduced the expression levels of brown preadipose-signature genes, whereas ectopic Ebf2-expression in myoblasts activated brown preadipose-specific genes. Altogether, these results indicate that Ebf2 specifically marks and regulates the molecular profile of brown preadipose cells.

DESIGN
Embryonic fibroblasts, isolated from dorsal body wall of E14.5 Myf5-CrE;mTmG embryos, were further fractionated based on the expression of PDGFRα, Itga7 and Myf5-cre (GFP).  Total mRNA profiles from Myf5-cre(GFP)+PDGFRα+ and  Myf5-cre(GFP)+PDGFRα-Itga7+ cells were generated by deep sequenceing
