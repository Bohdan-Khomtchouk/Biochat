TITLE
Examine strain and gender associated gene expression in Schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
We utilised a 22,575 feature custom oligonucleotide DNA microarray designed from public domain databases of schistosome expressed sequence tags to explore differential gene expression between the Philippine (SJP) and Chinese (SJC) strains of S. japonicum, and between male and female S. japonicum. We found that 593, 664 and 426 probes were differentially expressed between the two geographical strains when we compared mix sexed adults, male worms and female worms. Additionally, the study revealed that 1,163 male- and 1,016 femaleassociated probes were differentially expressed in SJP whereas 1,047 male- and 897 female-associated probes were differentially expressed in SJC. Keywords: Strain and Gender Comparison

DESIGN
Five comparisons, each with dye-swapped replicates were done.  Design 1 used four arrays to compare mixed sex adult S. japonicum (Strain Philippine) to mixed sex adult S. japonicum (Strain Chinese).  Design 2 used two arrays to compare adult male S. japonicum (Philippine strain) to adult male S. japonicum (Chinese strain).  Design 3 used two arrays to compare adult female S. japonicum (Chinese strain) to adult female S. japonicum (Philippine Strain).  Design 4 used two arrays to compare adult male S. japonicum (chinese strain) to adult female S. japonicum (chinese strain).  Design 5 used two arrays to compare adult male S. japonicum (philippine strain) to adult female S. japonicum (philippine strain).
