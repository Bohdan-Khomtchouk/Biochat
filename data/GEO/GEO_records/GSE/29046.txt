TITLE
Yarrowia lipolytica fed-batch biolipid production.

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptomic profilling of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, during a controlled fed-batch. A nitrogen limitation was applied during the course of the fed-batch to initiate de novo biolipid synthesis.

DESIGN
Dual staining, one replicate per slide. On each slide, a time point sample and a reference sample are spotted. Reference samples were obtained by pooling the RNAs from the time-course samples.
