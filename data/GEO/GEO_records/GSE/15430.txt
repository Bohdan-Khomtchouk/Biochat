TITLE
ChIP-chip of H3K27Ac in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: H3K27Ac at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM386179..GSM386187]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM386216..GSM386224]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM386334..GSM386342]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development (second dataset) [GSM418501..GSM418509]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Adult male [GSM441405..GSM441410]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM441411..GSM441419]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM441420..GSM441436]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM441437..GSM441445]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM441446..GSM441931]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in L1 [GSM441933..GSM441941]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in L2 [GSM441943..GSM441951]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in L3 [GSM441984..GSM441992]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Adult male [GSM441995..GSM442003]: ChIP-chip of H3K27AC in Pupae For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
