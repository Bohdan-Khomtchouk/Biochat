TITLE
Chromatin remodeling enzyme Brg1 is required for mouse lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and their denucleation [lens tissue]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide approach to identify the cell-autonomous role of Brg1 in lens fiber cell terminal differentiation. To examine roles of Brg1 in mouse lens development, a dnBrg1 transgenic construct was expressed using the lens-specific alphaA-crystallin promoter in postmitotic lens fiber cells. Morphological studies revealed abnormal lens fiber cell differentiation in transgenic lenses resulting in cataract. Electron microscopic studies showed abnormal lens suture formation and incomplete karyolysis (denucleation) of lens fiber cells. To identify genes regulated by Brg1, RNA expression profiling was performed in E15.5 embryonic wild type and dnBrg1 transgenic lenses. In addition, comparisons between differentially expressed genes in dnBrg1 transgenic, Pax6 heterozygous, and Hsf4 homozygous lenses identified multiple genes co-regulated by Brg1, Hsf4 and Pax6. Among them DNase IIbeta, a key enzyme required for lens fiber cell denucleation, was found downregulated in each of the Pax6, Brg1 and Hsf4 model systems. Lens-specific deletion of Brg1 using conditional gene targeting demonstrated that Brg1 was required for lens fiber cell differentiation and indirectly for retinal development but was not essential for lens lineage formation.
