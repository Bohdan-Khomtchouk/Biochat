TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Medicago truncatula upon sulfur deficiency stress and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
In this work we aimed to get a first overview on S-stress responses in leaf and root tissues of mycorrhized and non mycorrhized plants. Several hundred genes showed a significant different transcript accumulation. Their annotation and GO ID association allowed us to investigate the our data in order to identify biological processes and molecular functions preferentially affected, and to better understand in which terms the symbiotic relation avoid the plant to face deleterious S-deficiency effects.

DESIGN
Four chips study, of leaves or roots from mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized Medicago plants grown in normal or S deficient conditions. Up to six biological repetitions per condition.
