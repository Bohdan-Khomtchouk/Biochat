TITLE
Mucosal gene expression profiling in (un)inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated if miRNA expression in UC mucosa is altered and correlated our findings with mucosal mRNA expression. Integration of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling may allow the identification of functional links between dysregulated miRNAs and their predicted target mRNA.

DESIGN
Colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained during endoscopy from 13 UC (7 active and 6 inactive) patients and 8 normal controls. Total RNA was isolated from colonic mucosal biopsies, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip Human Gene 1.0ST Arrays.
