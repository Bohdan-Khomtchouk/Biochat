TITLE
Recurrent disruption of HIP1 identified in patients with epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disability, and neurobehavioral abnormalities

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report 12 individuals from ten unrelated families with epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disability, and neurobehavioral abnormalities, who segregated a microdeletion distally adjacent to the Williams-Beuren syndrome region. In six families, a recurrent ~ 1.1 Mb deletion likely resulted from nonallelic homologous recombination between flanking large complex low-copy repeats. Three smaller sized microdeletions (~ 180-500 kb) enabled us to narrow the critical region to one gene, HIP1, encoding Huntington interacting protein 1.

DESIGN
genomic DNA from blood was used to analyse 12 samples  with control sample using custom made NimbleGen 12x135K microarrays for chr7 region.
