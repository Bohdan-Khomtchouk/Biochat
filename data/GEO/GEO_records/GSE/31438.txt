TITLE
The DNA Methylomes of a Newborn and a Centenarian

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examination of two DNA methylomes at the most extreme points of their lives to see differences that might contribute to explain the aged phenotype

DESIGN
We have performed Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) and methylation array technology of newborn and a centenarian samples to address the Epigenetic drifts in Human aging, which might be an alternative pathway to explain the age-associated alterations. In addition, we used SNP array platforms to exclude an influence of copy number changes with age and SNPs on the identification of differentially methylated regions. This Series represents the methylation array data. The WGBS data are available in GSE31263.
