TITLE
Drivers of gene expression in cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of 82 patients with cervical cancer was performed. The expression data were correlated with copy number alterations of the same patients, as assessed with array CGH in a separate study, in order to identify drivers of cervical cancer carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
In total, 82 patients with cervical cancer, stage 1b bulky through 4a, were included. Pretreatment biopsies were taken from the tumors and analyzed with Illumina gene expression BeadArrays (Human WG-6 v3).
