TITLE
RNAseq changes in fibroblasts after treatment with selected protein(s) or E16.5 skin extract

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify the cellular processes upregulated in fibroblasts after treatment with selected protein(s) or E16.5 skin extract Methods: To explore the mechanism of extract-induced HF neogenesis, adult dermal fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of E16.5 extract or selected protein(s) for 3 days before being tested. Results: we determined how the exposure of adult fibroblasts to E16.5 extract, the selected protein mix or each of the selected proteins and compared the resultant transcriptomes with those of adult DP and embryonic dermal fibroblasts. Conclusions: Gene expression of adult fibroblasts exposed to E16.5 extract and selected proteins mix, the key DP signature genes became upregulated.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts mRNA profiles of mouse with different treatments and adult DP and embryonic dermal fibroblasts were generated by next generation sequencing. SRA study accession: SRP081009; BioProject accession: PRJNA337890
