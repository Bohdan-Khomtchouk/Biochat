TITLE
Distinct chromosomal aberrations in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia harbouring HPV16 versus HPV31

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3) represents a heterogeneous disease both with respect to clinical behaviour and chromosomal aberrations detected. The current study aimed to investigate whether CIN2/3 harbouring different hrHPV types vary with respect to their chromosomal aberrations, including both number of aberrations and specific chromosomal loci affected.

DESIGN
DNA from microdissected CIN2/3 tissues: 43 samples total. 16 HPV16, 3 HPV18, 14 HPV31, 1 HPV33, 4 HPV45, 1 HPV51, 2 HPV52, 2 HPV58.

PLATFORM
GPL8693 Agilent-019015 HD CGH Microarray (2X105K) Oxford design AMADID#019015 (Feature number version)
