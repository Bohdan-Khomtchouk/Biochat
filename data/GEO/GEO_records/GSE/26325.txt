TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cell lines with different sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using high-density DNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene-expression profile of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of these cell lines for cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin, etoposide, melphalan) and compared the gene-expression profile of chemotherapy-resistant and -sensitive cell lines.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines and hybridized with Affymetrix HG_U133A microarrays.
