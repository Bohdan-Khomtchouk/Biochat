SUMMARY
Purpose. Simian virus 40 (SV40)-immortalized human corneal epithelial (HCE-T) cells have been widely used as an in vitro model of human corneal epithelial cells. To better understand the nature of this cell line, we assessed it for genomic aberrations and cellular heterogeneity. Methods. For the quantitative measurement of genomic aberrations, array based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed. For identification of cellular heterogeneity, cell morphology, growth kinetics, trans-epithelial electrical resistance and transcriptional efficiency were analyzed. We also carried out real-time PCR and chromosomal fluorescent in situ hybridization (cFISH) against some gained or lost loci in order to assess genomic heterogeneity. To assess differences in the gene expression profiles between HCE-T cells and normal corneal epithelial cells, we collected expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for this cell line. Southern blotting and inverse PCR analyses were used to determine the genomic integration site of the SV40 large T antigen gene (LTAG). Results. Array CGH analysis indicated that the genomic content of HCE-T cells is different from the normal healthy genome. Our results from cellular functional assays, real-time PCR and cFISH strongly showed that HCE-T cells consist of a not insignificant number of heterogeneous cell populations. The genomic integration site of the SV40 large T antigen was at p22.1 of chromosome 9. Conclusions. Our results indicate that HCE-T cells have an altered genomic content and that they are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. This should be considered when conducting experiments or interpreting the results of studies which use this cell line. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
