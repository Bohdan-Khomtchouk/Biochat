TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana treatments to trigger somatic embryo formation under RNAseq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis clf/swn mutant is able to form somatic embryos under the proper treatment conditions. In order to get more information about the process, we compared the expression profiles of wt and clf/swn in absence of treatment, Injury, Auxin, and Auxin+Injury treatments

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between the clf/swn mutant and wt under different treatments

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
