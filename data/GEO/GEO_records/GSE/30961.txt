TITLE
FTC-238/hrTPO/RSK008 treated with thyroid peroxidase-disrupting chemicals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These experiments have systematically assessed the potential utility of transcriptomic endpoints as enhancements to the guaiacol assay. Previously, we demonstrated that benzophenone-2, benzophenone, perfluorooctane sulfonate, bisphenol A bis ether, and vinclozolin decreased TPO activity, and that dibutyl phthalate, carbaryl, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, and methylmercury increased TPO activity. In this study, we used human oligonucleotide chips to examine changes in the gene expression profile of FTC-238 human follicular thyroid carcinoma cells expressing human recombinant TPO, after exposure of the cells to TPO activity-disrupting agents.

DESIGN
FTC-238/hrTPO/RSK008 cells were seeded and after incubation for 24 h at 37C, the cells were treated with non-toxic dose for 48 h. And after total RNA isolation, gene expression analysis was conducted using a 8x60-k or 4x44-k whole human genome microarray. Labeling and hybridization were performed using a FairPlay microarray labeling kit, followed by the coupling of Cy3 (controls) or Cy5 (treated samples) dye. The hybridized slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner, and the images were analyzed using GenePix 4.1 software to obtain gene expression ratios. The fluorescence intensity of each spot was calculated by local median background subtraction. We then used the robust scatter-plot smoother LOWESS function to perform intensity-dependent normalization of gene expression. Scatter-plot analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2000. A significance analysis of microarray (SAM) was performed for genes with significant changes in expression.
