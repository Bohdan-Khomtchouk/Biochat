TITLE
Profiling gene expression in HeLa cells  by hsa-mir-98 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples from three biological replicates in which the hsa-mir-98 was overexpressed in HeLa cells  were profiled by gene expression. As negative control, we used total RNA samples from HeLa cells transfected with cel-mir-67 Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
hsa-miR-98 transfection

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
