TITLE
P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 responses to bean leaf extract

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola

SUMMARY
Many genes involve in pathogenicity and virulence are induced only in plant or in the presence of host components. Bean leaf extract was obtained from healthy bean leaves.  In this work we investigated the effect of bean leaf extract on the transcriptomic profile of the bacterium, when grown at low temperature in minimal medium with or without extract from healthy bean leaves.

DESIGN
Two RNA samples were compared, one prepared from cells grown in minimal medium and the other from cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with bean leaf extract. To control de biological variation that might interfere with data interpretation, a minimum of three biological replicates were prepared and two technical replicates with the same RNA (swap).
