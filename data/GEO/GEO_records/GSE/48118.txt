TITLE
Gene expression analysis upon UGT1A_i2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluate modulation in gene expression modulation upon UGT1A_i2 knockdown in basal conditions and also under pharmacological treatment (SN-38)

DESIGN
6 samples in duplicate (12 samples total); HT115 colorectal cell line was infected with either UGT1A_i2 shRNA or non-target shRNA and left untreated or treated with either vehicle or SN-38 (0.5 uM)
