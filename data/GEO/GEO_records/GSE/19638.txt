TITLE
Compounds profiling on MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of several compounds on the MCF7 human adenocarcinoma mammary cell line were analysed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Tested compounds: HSP90 inhibitors: 17AAG (Tanespimycin), NVP-AUY922,  NMS-E973 (cpd developed at NMS). CDK inhibitors: CDK-887 (cpd developed at NMS). Topoisomerase inhibitors: Doxorubicin, SN38 (active metabolite of Irinotecan). The MCF7 cell line was treated with the different compounds for 6 hours at a dose equal to 5 times the IC50. Untreated MCF7 cells were used as a control. Two replicates per treatment.
