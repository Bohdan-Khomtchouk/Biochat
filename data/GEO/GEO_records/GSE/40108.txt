TITLE
Human breast cancer cells: control vs treated with breast cancer patients' sera

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the significant differently expressed genes upon the stimulation of breast cancer patients' sera.

DESIGN
Cells were untreated or treated with 10% breast cancer patients' sera for 24h followed by isolation of total RNA using TRIZOL. Gene-expression profiling was performed on the CapitalBio 35k human Genome Array microchips  (Beijing, China).
