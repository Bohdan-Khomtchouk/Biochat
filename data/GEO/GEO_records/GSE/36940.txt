TITLE
Cross-Species Comparison Identifies Proneural specific patterns of genetic alterations in Glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The determinants of the genetic complexity of Glioblastoma are poorly understood. We generated murine Glioblastomas by transforming glial progenitors in the adult brain with PDGF expression and PTEN deletion +/- p53 deletion. PDGF+PTEN-/- tumors developed additional deletions of specific genes in up to 100% of the tumors, whereas PDGF+PTEN-/-p53-/- tumors did not. Cross-species comparison with data from tCGA database and published in Verhaak, 2010, showed that consistent genetic deletions observed in mouse tumors were specific to human Proneural Glioblastoma. These findings show that the genetic alterations that accumulate during tumor progression are determined by the initiating genetic alterations and by the cellular context in which they occur.

DESIGN
Murine gliomas were induced in vivo by retroviral mediated PDGF overexpression, PTEN deletion with or without p53 deletion using Cre/lox system. Tumors were subsequently harvested for sequencing and aCGH analysis. Paired liver DNA was used for hybridization. For PDGF+PTEN-/- tumors, different timepoints were obtained including 21, 35 days post tumor induction, as well as endstage tumors.
