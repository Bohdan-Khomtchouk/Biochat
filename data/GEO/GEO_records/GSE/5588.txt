SUMMARY
For microarray experiments starting with nanogram amounts of RNA it is essential to implement reproducible and powerful RNA amplification techniques. Available methods were mainly tested for reproducibility, only a few studies concentrated on potential amplification bias. We evaluated three amplification protocols, which are less time-consuming than the commonly used T7-RNA polymerase based in vitro transcription protocols and therefore may be more suitable for clinical use: Template Switching (TS)-PCR (SMART-PCR Kit, BD), Ribo-SPIA (single primer isothermal amplification, Oviation, Nugen) and a random primer-based PCR. Additionally a more sensitive labeling method, Dendrimer-labeling (Genisphere), was evaluated. All methods were compared to unamplified RNA labelled at reverse transcription. Hybridizations  were carried out on a targeted two-colour oligonucleotide microarray. From our results we conclude that RNA amplification with TS-PCR is highly reproducible and results in a reliable representation of the starting RNA population. We then assessed whether RNA amplification of clinical breast and thyroid cancer samples with TS-PCR showed robust performance when altered cycle numbers or partially degraded RNA were used. According to our experiments TS-PCR proved to be a very reliable method for global RNA amplification, even when starting from partially degraded RNA down to a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 4.3.
