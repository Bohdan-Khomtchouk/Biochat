TITLE
Antitumor activity of a pyrrole-imidazole polyamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that a DNA minor groove binding hairpin pyrrole-imidazole (Py-Im) polyamide interferes with RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) activity in cell culture.  Genome-wide mapping of RNAP2 binding shows reduction of occupancy preferentially at transcription start sites (TSS), while occupancy at enhancer sites are is unchanged.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of RNA polymerase II in LNCaP cells treated with DHT and DHT with Py-Im polyamide.
