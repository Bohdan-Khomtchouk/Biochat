TITLE
Genomic expression analysis of human monocyte-derived DCs and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the functional non-coding RNAs in human DC development, we explored the gene expression profiles during DC development from peripheral monocytes. Using RNA-seq, we identified many annotated lncRNAs with markedly altered expressions during human DC differentiation and maturation.

DESIGN
RNA samples from human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs were collected. RNAs from 3 donors were pooled together to form monocyte sample or DC sample and then these two samples were subjected to RNA-seq and analysis.
