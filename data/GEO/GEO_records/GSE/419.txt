SUMMARY
The expression profiles of Drosophila Kc167 and SL2 cells were compared on the CDMC_Drosophila_7k2 array platform.  Three independent RNA samples from each cell line were isolated and compared in a pairwise fashion.  Dye-flip experiments were also performed.  See Neal et al. 2003 for results and discussion.
