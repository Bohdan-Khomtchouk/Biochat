TITLE
HMGA2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) associated with truncations of its 3’ untranslated region (UTR) with let-7 micro RNA-complementary sequences have been identified in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Here, we generated transgenic mice (∆Hmga2 mice) with a 3’UTR-trncated Hmga2 cDNA that overexpress Hmga2 mRNA and protein in hematopoietic organs. ∆Hmga2 mice showed proliferative hematopoiesis that mimicked a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-like phenotype with increased numbers of all lineages of peripheral blood cells, hypercellular bone marrow (BM), splenomegaly with extramedullary erythropoiesis, and erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony formation compared to wild-type mice. ∆Hmga2 BM-derived cells took over most of hematopoiesis in competitive repopulations during serial BM transplants. When we bred mice with circulating PNH cells (Piga- mice) with ∆Hmga2 mice, the lack of GPI-linked proteins did not add an additional clonal advantage to the ∆Hmga2+ cells. In summary, our results showed that the overexpression of a 3’UTR-truncated Hmga2 leads to a proliferative hematopoiesis with clonal advantage, which may explain clonal expansion in PNH or MPN at the level of HSC.

DESIGN
Eight independent preparations of RNA, which included each 2 samples of KLS cells and MEP cells from ∆Hmga2 mice and 2 each from WT mice. Each preparation was made from 4 or 6 mice.
