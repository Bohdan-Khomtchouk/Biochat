SUMMARY
The critical role of the endothelium in governing vascular, tissues homeostasis and pathological processes is increasingly recognized (Deanfield et al., 2007). Cellular senescence of endothelial cells has been proposed to be involved in endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis (Minamino T et al., 2007), although the mechanisms underlying the aging induced attenuation of endothelium dependent functions are yet to be clarified. Recent evidences implicated overall miRNA levels and miRNA in regulating angiogenesis and endothelial function (Suarez et al., 2007; Kuehbacher et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2008; Fish et al. 2008; Wang et al., 2008).
