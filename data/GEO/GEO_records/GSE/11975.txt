TITLE
Gene Expression in Adipose Tissue during Weight Loss

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the regulation of adipose tissue (AT) gene expression during different phases of a dietary weight loss program and its relationship with insulin sensitivity. Obese women followed a weight reduction program composed of an energy restriction phase (ER) with a 4-week very-low-calorie diet and a weight stabilization period (WS) composed of a 2-month low-calorie diet followed by 3 to 4 months of a weight maintenance diet. At each time point, body composition, plasma parameters and glucose disposal rate were assessed and subcutaneous AT biopsies were performed. Variations in mRNA levels were determined using DNA microarrays and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Distinct sets of AT genes are regulated during calorie restriction and weight stabilization revealing an unexpected temporal pattern in the link between AT and insulin sensitivity during weight loss.
