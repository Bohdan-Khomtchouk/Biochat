TITLE
c-Jun protein expression in vivo induces systemic fibrosis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Time course analysis of c-Jun expression at 24h resulted in upregulation of a number of well-known fibrogenesis-associated factors.

DESIGN
We compared the global gene expression pattern of mouse whole bone marrow after c-Jun induction in vivo at 24h with no induction and applied to standard Affymetrix mouse arrays.
