TITLE
Direct reprogramming of human astrocytes into neural stem cells and neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ectopic expression of the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, or NANOG into human astrocytes in specific cytokine/culture conditions activated the neural stem gene program and induced generation of cells expressing neural stem/precursor markers.

DESIGN
Here we compare the whole gene expression profile of primary human astrocytes (Astro) with neural stem cells (HNSC) derived from astrocytes reprogramming
