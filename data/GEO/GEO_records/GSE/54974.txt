TITLE
The effect of GPR30 agonist G-1 on androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant LNCaP xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G-1 is an agonist to GPR30. Activation of GPR30 by G-1 inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in LNCaP xenografts regrown after catration of the host (nude mice), but not in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP xenograft grown in an intact host. Results provide insights into the molecular basis of G-1 action in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Male nude mice were injected with LNCaP cells. When the LNCaP tumors reached 150â€“300 mm3, mice were divided into two groups: intact (androgen-sensitive tumor) and castrated. For the intact group, mice were subcutaneously injected with vehicle alone (95% PBS, 2.5% DMSO, 2.5% ethanol) or G-1 (4 mg/kg/day in vehicle) daily for 16 days.   For the castrated group, tumors regressed and then regrew to ~300-400mm3. Mice were treated daily with vehicle or G-1 as described for 16 days. Tumors were harvested for RNA extraction and microarray experiments.
