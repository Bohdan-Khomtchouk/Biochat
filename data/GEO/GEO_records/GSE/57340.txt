TITLE
S. aureus gene expression of WT (USA300) vs fakAKO

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
S. aureus response to fakA deletion Gene expression profiles were generated by microarray analysis of S. aureus WT (USA300) or fakAKO

DESIGN
S. aureus was grown in LB to an OD600nm of 0.45, and RNA was extracted to look at the gobal gene expression.

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
