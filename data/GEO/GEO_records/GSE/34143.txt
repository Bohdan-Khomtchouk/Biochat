TITLE
Gene expression of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) positive nodal peripheral T cell lymphoma, unspecified (PTCL-U)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EBV positive PTCL-U is a very rare but aggressive disease entity. To investigate gene expression profile, we performed gene expression analysis using two different types of microarray kits (Agilent chip 4x44K and 8x60K)

DESIGN
We compared gene expression between in 3 EBV positive PTCL-Us and in 6 normal reactive lymph nodes.
