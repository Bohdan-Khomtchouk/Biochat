TITLE
LMP1 mediated gene expression changes in transfected CD10+ GC B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the effect of LMP1 on gene expression in normal human GC B cells using a non-viral vector based system Keywords: transfection of viral oncogene in normal human B cells

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between LMP1-transfected and control vector-transfected GC B cells from three patients. RNA from the FACS-sorted transfected GC B cells was amplified. 10ug of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) with a 1.5 fold change threshold and the q-value threshold set to 5%.
