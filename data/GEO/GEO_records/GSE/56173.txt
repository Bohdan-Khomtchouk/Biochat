TITLE
Expression data from Adult Drosophila with controled microbiota

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The microbial population that live within the gut of animals influences their physiology. We used axenic and recolonized flies to identify genes whose expression is modulated by the presence of a bacterial flora in the gut. We identified several up regulated genes, most of which are described as enriched in the midgut, and related either to immunity or to metabolism. This work also suggests that most microbiota regulated genes are Relish dependent.

DESIGN
We raised axenic Flies and eitherÂ : (1) kept them germ free or (2) recolonized their environment with a set of 4 known commensal bacteria of lab-raised drosophila (Commensalibacter intestini, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Acetobacter pomorum). Flies were maintained in their respective (axenic or recolonized) environment from emergence to 7 days of age. Then females were collected, and total RNA extraction was performed on groups of 20 whole bodies.
