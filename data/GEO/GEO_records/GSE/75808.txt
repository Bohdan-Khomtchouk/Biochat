TITLE
Differential Ly6C Expression after Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Identifies Unique Macrophage Populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell type implicated in injury, repair, and fibrosis after AKI, but the macrophage population associated with each phase is unclear.results of this study in a renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model allow phenotype and function to be assigned to CD11b+/Ly6C+ monocyte/macrophage populations in the pathophysiology of disease after AKI. we used a renal bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury mouse model to identify unique monocyte/macrophage populations by differential expression of Ly6C in CD11b+Â cells and to define the function of these cells in the pathophysiology of disease on the basis of microarray gene signatures and reduction strategies

DESIGN
Macrophage populations were sorted by Flow Cytometry into low and intermediate populations by Itgam(Cd11b) and Ly6c markers. The cells obtained in 5 weeks sham, 5 weeks IR, 9 day sham, and 9 day IR with 6 samples per group (3 int and 3 low). Cells were sorted in 350ul of RLT lysing buffer and kept at -80c until RNA extraction.Sample amplification, fragmentation, hybridization,washing and scanning were performed according to validated Affymetrix protocol in a CLIA certified lab.
