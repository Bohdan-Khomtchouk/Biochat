TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between myxoid and round cell component in myxoid liposarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Round cell component is a resk factor associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in myxoid liposarcoma. To identify microRNAs which play a role in the malignancy of round cell component, we performed microRNA microarray analysis and compared the miRNA expression profilings between myxoid and round cell component.

DESIGN
microRNA expression profiles were measured in myxoid component and round cell component. Eight sample pairs from clinical myxoid liposarcoma FFPE were included. All enrolled patients did not receive any chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
