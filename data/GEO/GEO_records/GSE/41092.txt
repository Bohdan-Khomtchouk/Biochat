TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Cleome hassleriana for different tissues

ORGANISM
Tarenaya hassleriana

SUMMARY
We have sequenced the whole genome of Cleome hassleriana by NGS [SRA accession number SRA058749] and build a reference sequence for this genome. In order to improve quality of gene models, a mix transcriptome sample extracted from the bud, leaf, petiole, stems and flowers of Cleome.

DESIGN
A mixed RNA pool extracted from the tissues of bud, leaf, petiole, stems and flower is sequenced for Cleome hassleriana.

PLATFORM
