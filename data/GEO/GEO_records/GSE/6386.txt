TITLE
Expression data from healthy (control) and Staph aureus mastitis cows' milk somatic cells (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in milk somatic cells (MSCs) that occur with Staph Aureus mastitis. We used in house microarrays to indicate the changes that occur in gene expression in the BMCs as a result of mastitis Keywords: single time point, comparison mastitis animal vs control animal

DESIGN
Milk was taken from 7 pairs of Holstein cows identified as chronic S. aureus carriers (mastitis susceptible) and the ages, herds, stage of lactation and parity-matched control cows with no evidence or previous history of S. aureus mastitis.  Total RNA was extracted from milk somatic cells (MSCs) and reverse transcripted to cDNA.  Labelled cDNA probes (Cy3 and Cy5) derived from BMCs and MSCs) of infected quarters and healthy quarters of controls were hybridised to a bovine immune-endocrine cDNA array containing immune and endocrine related genes and the resulting changes in gene expression were analysed.
