TITLE
Expression data from healthy (control) and Staph aureus mastitis cows' milk somatic cells (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in milk somatic cells (MSCs) that occur with Staph Aureus mastitis. We used in house microarrays to indicate the changes that occur in gene expression in the BMCs as a result of mastitis Keywords: single time point, comparison mastitis animal vs control animal
