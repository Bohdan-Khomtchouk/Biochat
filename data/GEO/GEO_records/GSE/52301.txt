TITLE
Chip-chip from Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens with H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic changes commonly occur in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are associated with aberrant gene expression. Recently, we demonstrated the pivotal role of abnormal H3K4me3 methylation, which is catalyzed by the menin/MLL, a TrxG family, in HCC development. Meanwhile, there is clear evidence that increasing global levels of H3K27me3 are activated in human primary HCC. To further elucidate the functional relatedness of the repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 histone remodeling in HCC, we performed H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-on-chip screen using three HCC specimens and their adjacent tissues.

DESIGN
Comparison of  ChIP-on-chip results between tumor(C) and  adjacent tissues(N) from three HCC specimens with H3K27me3
