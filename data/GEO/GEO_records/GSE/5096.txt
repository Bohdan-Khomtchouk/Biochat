TITLE
Genomic responses to Phenobarbital in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Phenobarbital is a well studied xenobiotic compound. In this study, we describe the genomic responses in fruit flies and examine whether animals mutant for DHR96, an ortholog of xenobiotic nuclear receptors PXR and CAR, plays a role in mediating xenobiotic responses in Drosophila. Keywords: dose response in mutant vs. wild type

DESIGN
Canton S is a commonly used wild type control strain for xenobiotic studies. Wild type or DHR96 mutant flies were starved overnight and then exposed to either sucrose alone or sucrose supplemented with 0.3% Phenobarbital.
