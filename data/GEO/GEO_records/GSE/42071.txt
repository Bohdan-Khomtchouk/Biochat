TITLE
Treatment of CHRF288-11 Megakaryocytic Cells with Wnt compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHRF288-11 cells were treated with Wnt3a (150ng/ml) and/ot Wnt5a (1200ng/ml) and RNA was harvested after 8 hours of treatment Gene expression was analysed using Human WG6 V3 Illumina Beadarrays

DESIGN
There are four experimental groups (Wnt3a Treated, Wnt5a Treated, Wnt3a + Wnt5a treated and Untreated (control)), each with three biological replicates
