SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in lungs of C57BL/6J mice that develop chronic airway disease phenotypes after a single Sendai virus infection, compared with mice treated with UV-inactivated virus. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Whole lung RNA was analyzed from 3 mice per condition per time point 3 days post infection, Sendai virus versus UV-inactivated virus, C57BL/6J mouse strain.
