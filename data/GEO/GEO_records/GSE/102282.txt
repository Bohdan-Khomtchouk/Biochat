TITLE
Expression data from WT and AIMp1KO mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells are critical regulators of adaptive immune responses which can process and present antigens to effector cells. As a structural component of multi-enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex, AIMp1 (p43) is identified to promote type 1 T-cell responses by DCs and play important roles in both antitumor and antiviral immunity. We use high-throughput microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of WT vs. AIMp1KO bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) to study the mechanism by which DC-expressed AIMp1 promote type 1 T-cell immune responses.

DESIGN
WT or AIMp1KO BMDCs were loaded with antigens and matured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Cells were unloaded or loaded with OVA protein and SIINFEKL peptide (10ug/mL) for 3 hours in media containing 5% serum; then matured with cytokine cocktail (10ng/mL TNFa, 15ng/mL IL-6, 10ng/mL IL-1b, 1ug/mL PGE2) for 48hours prior to harvest.
