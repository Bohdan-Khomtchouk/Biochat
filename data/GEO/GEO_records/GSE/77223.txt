TITLE
Muscle regeneration in fish: A temporal expression profiling and comparison with muscle fibre hyperplasia signature.

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Using an Agilent-based microarray platform we undertook a time-course analysis of transcript expression in aged trout muscle before injury (time 0) and at the site of injury 1, 8, 16 and 30 days after lesion.

DESIGN
At each time points, four (time 0) or five (1, 8, 16, and 30 days post lesion) distinct individuals were sampled for histological analysis and gene expression profiling
