SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptome analysis of early interaction events in Scots pine root tissues following challenge with a pathogenic, saprophytic or symbiotic fungus. Seedlings of P. sylvestris (19 days post germination) were transferred to wet, sterile filter paper on Petri-plates. Thereafter, the roots of the seedlings were inoculated with the mycelial homogenate of either Heterobasidion annosum (FP5, P-type) a pathogenic root rot fungus which attacks Norway spruce, Scots pine and broad leaf trees or Laccaria bicolor, an obligate ectomycorrhizal symbiont or  Trichoderma aureoviride- an obligate saprotroph. Thereafter, incubated for 30 minutes, during which time some hyphae adhered to the roots. The inoculated seedlings (ten) were then transferred to another wet sterile filter paper placed on 1% water agar in Petri dishes. A second set of moist sterile filter paper was laid over the roots. The region of the Petri-dish containing the roots was covered with aluminium foil and the edges of the plate sealed with parafilm. The seedlings were then incubated for 24 hr  under a photoperiod of 16h light at 20 ºC. Control seedlings were ‘inoculated’ with sterile distilled water. Keywords: other
