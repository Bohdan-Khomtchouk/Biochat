TITLE
Adaptation of Geobacter sulfurreducens to Overcome the Loss of a Key Periplasmic c-Type Cytochrome

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens

SUMMARY
ppcA is a member of a family of small, periplamic c-type cytochromes in Geobact sulfurreducens.  The ppcA mutant displays displays a growth defect on ferric citrate medium, but the mutant has been adapted to grow to near wild-type levels on ferric citrate.  The aim of this study was to elucidate gene expression changes responsible for this adaptive growth. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were hybridized in duplicate on 12K Combimatrix sense-detecting arrays, the experiment (ppcA mutant) was labeled with Cy5, and the control (wildtype) was labeled with Cy3.

PLATFORM
GPL4897 Geobacter sulfurreducens sense-detecting 12K oligo array
