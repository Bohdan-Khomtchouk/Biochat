TITLE
Cross species differential gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces paradoxus NRRL Y-17217 ; Saccharomyces mikatae IFO 1815 ; Saccharomyces uvarum MCYC 623 ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
AB SOLID sequencing of ribosome-depleted RNA from S. Cerevisiae, S. Paradoxus, S. Mikatae, and S. Bayanus These four yeast species were grown in complete media and total RNA was sequenced.

DESIGN
Cross-Species Gene Expression using RNA-Seq Data was examined.  Eight samples examined: two biological replicates of each species
