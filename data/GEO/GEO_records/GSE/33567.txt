TITLE
Mouse C2C12 cells treated with/without hBMP2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate many aspects of skeletal development, including osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation, cartilage and bone formation, and cranial and limb development. Among them, BMP2, one of the most potent osteogenic signaling molecules, stimulates osteoblast differentiation, while it inhibits myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells.

DESIGN
We used cDNA microarrays to elucidate regulators of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation.
