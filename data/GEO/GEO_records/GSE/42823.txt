TITLE
Specific sequence determinants of miR-15/107 microRNA gene group targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using anti-Argonaute (anti-AGO) antibody co-immunoprecipitation, followed by microarray analyses and downstream bioinformatics, ‘RIP-Chip’ experiments enable direct analyses of miRNA targets. The analyses support four major findings: (i) RIP-Chip studies correlated with total input mRNA profiling provides more comprehensive information than using either RIP-Chip or total mRNA profiling alone after miRNA transfections; (ii) new data confirm that miR-107 paralogs target coding sequence (CDS) of mRNA; (iii) biochemical and computational studies indicate that the 3′ portion of miRNAs plays a role in guiding miR-103/7 to the CDS of targets; and (iv) there are major sequence-specific targeting differences between miRNAs in terms of CDS versus 3′-untranslated region targeting, and stable AGO association versus mRNA knockdown.

DESIGN
RIP-ChIP studies (and parallel assessments of total input mRNA) were performed in cultured H4 cells after transfection with miRNAs corresponding to the miR-15/107 gene group (miR-103, miR-107, miR-16 and miR-195), another physiological miRNA (miR-320), miR-15b*, and three non-physiological additional miRNA-like molecules (miR-107-mut1, mir-107-mut2, and negative control miRNA from Ambion).  For details on transfected miRNA sequences, see Nelson PT et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Oct;39(18):8163-72.   Three biological replicates were run for each condition with a total of 54 separate human Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array replicates.  See Wang WX et al, RNA (2010) 16:394-404 for detailed protocol of RIP-ChIP.
