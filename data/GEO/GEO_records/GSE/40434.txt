TITLE
Molecular alterations in prostate carcinomas that associate with in vivo exposure to chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer (tumor-node-metastasis ≥ T2b or prostate-specific antigen ≥ 15 ng/mL or Gleason glade ≥ 4+3) were enrolled into a phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and mitoxantrone followed by prostatectomy. Pretreatment prostate tissue was acquired by needle biopsy and posttreatment tissue was acquired by prostatectomy. Prostate epithelium was captured by microdissection, and transcript levels were quantitated by cDNA microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
To evaluate gene expression alterations after chemotherapy, neoplastic epithelium from pretreated biopsy and posttreated prostatectomy specimens were laser captured separately (∼3,000 cells per sample). cDNA synthesized from amplified total RNA of pre-treated biopsy samples and post-treatment surgical samples were hybridized head-to-head, alternating Cy3 and Cy5 to custom-made microarrays composed of 6,200 clones derived from the Prostate Expression Database.
