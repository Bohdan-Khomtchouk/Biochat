TITLE
MCF7 cells gene expression change by inducing CpG demethylation using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Promoter methylation is able to induce downregulation of gene expression. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine(Aza), methytransferase inhibitor, induce CpG demethylation. Here, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine(Aza) is treated in a human breast cancer cell, MCF7, for detection of gene expression change.
