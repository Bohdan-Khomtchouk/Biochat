TITLE
Transcriptomic regulation during meiosis (Clb5Delta-Clb6Delta mutant)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We studied the meiotic regulation of transcription in the mutant Clb5Delta-Clb6Delta (deficient for the meiotic replication), by comparing the mRNA level at time t=1h to t=8h after meiosis induction, to the mRNA level at time t=0h. Keywords: yeast meiotic time course, transcriptome

DESIGN
For each time point, we measured the level of mRNA extracted at the time point to a mRNA meiotic mix composed of mRNA extracted at each time point. We normalize this ratio to the ratio measured at time t=0h and transform into log2ratios.
