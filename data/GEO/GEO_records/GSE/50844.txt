TITLE
Characterization of Gene Expression in Rice Shoot and Root

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The rice OneArray® 60-mer, oligonucleotide microarray consists of a total of 21,179 probes covering 20,806 genes of japonica and 13,683 genes of indica. Through a validation study, total RNA isolated from rice shoots and roots were used for comparison of gene expression profiles via microarray examination. A list of significantly differentially expressed genes was generated; 438 shoot-specific genes were identified among 3,138 up-regulated genes, and 463 root-specific genes were found among 3,845 down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The Phalanx microarray platform is based upon the hybridization of a single labeled sample (derived from RNA), followed by one-channel detection. The intensity of the hybridization signal is used to determine target concentration. In order to validate the technical quality of each probe in our arrays, we carried out 10 independent hybridizations on samples representing two different rice tissues – root and shoot.  To examine the gene expression profiles between rice root and shoot development, total RNA extracted from rice root and shoot were processed on the rice OneArray® microarray following the standard protocol using five arrays for each tissue type. Raw expression data from 10 microarrays (e.g. 5 arrays × 2 tissues) were normalized and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for the data sets of hybridization signal intensities.
