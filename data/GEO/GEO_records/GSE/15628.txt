TITLE
RNA polymerase occupancy at embryonic stage and starved L1 stage in pha-4 transgenic worms

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We acquired RNA Polymerase II (POL II) binding profiles at embyonic and starved L1 stages in pha-4 transgenic worms. Transcription factor gene pha-4 was tagged with GFP and their expression examined throughout the C. elegans life cycle. The POL II occupancy were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-POL II antibodies followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
