TITLE
The transcription factor IRF4 is essential for T cell receptor affinity mediated metabolic programming and clonal expansion of T cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that transcription factor IRF4 is induced in a T cell receptor (TCR) affinity-dependent manner and functions as a dose-dependent regulator of the metabolic function of activated T cells. IRF4 regulates the expression of key molecules required for aerobic glycolysis of effector T cells, and is essential for clonal expansion and maintenance of effector function of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
