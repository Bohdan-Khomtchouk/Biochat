TITLE
Genome-wide identification of CCA1-bound genes in Arabidopsis by ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
LHY and CCA1 encode single MYB transcription factors, involved in circadian clock. However, direct target genes of LHY and CCA1 in a genomic scale were largely unknown. To reveal bound genes by CCA1, chimeric protein CCA1-FLAG was expressed under CCA1 promoter in cca1 lhy (CCA1pro:CCA1-FLAG/ cca1 lhy). ChIP was performed using anti-FLAG antibody (F3165; SIGMA), which was bound to Dynabeads Protein G (100-03D; Life Technologies), and ChIP DNA were analyzed by IonPGM or Illumina GAII.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed for CCA1-FLAG-expressing Arabidopsis. ChIP DNA was analyzed 2 types of deep sequencers (Illumina GAII and IonPGM).
