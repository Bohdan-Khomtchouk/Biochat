TITLE
Identification of mRNAs modulated by the HOXB7-MEK signaling cascade

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcripts upregulated or downregulated by HOXB7-MEK signaling  were identified for use on the microarray using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit in comparison with HOXB7-knockdown S2-013 cells that were transfected with rescue-HOXB7 plasmid and treated with MEK inhibitor, and HOXB7-knockdown S2-013 cells that were transfected with rescue-HOXB7 plasmid but not treated with MEK inhibitor.

DESIGN
We endeavored to identify factors and pathways regulated by HOXB7-MEK signaling and to obtain leads regarding the mechanism underpinning the observed phenotypic changes by performing cDNA microarray analysis.
