TITLE
Gene expression analysis of WT and Keap1–/– MEFs in vitro culture condition (2D) and in allograft condition (3D)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT TR MEFs and Keap1–/– TR MEFs were established according to the following method.  Keap1+/– mice were mated, and WT and Keap1–/– embryos were collected at embryonic day 13.5.  Primary MEFs were immortalized by expression of SV40 T antigen.  The immortalized MEFs were transformed by expression of HRAS G12V to generate WT TR MEFs and Keap1–/– TR MEFs.

DESIGN
Total RNA from WT-TR MEFs and Keap1–/–-TR MEFs was prepared for in vitro culture conditions (2D) and allograft conditions (3D).  To prepare the total RNA from the 3D conditions, 1 x 10^7 WT-TR MEFs and 3 x 10^6 Keap1–/–-TR MEFs were injected into nude mice, and the tumors were harvested for extraction of total RNA when their volumes reached 100-150 mm^3.
