TITLE
Angiotensin receptor blockade attenuates cigarette smoke-induced lung injury and rescues lung architecture in a murine model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGFÎ² inhibition attenuates chronic cigarette smoke induced lung injury and rescues lung architecture.

DESIGN
AKR/J mice were exposed to Cigarette Smoke (CS) for a period of two months.  Some animals received a treatment of Losartan (.6gr/L) orally while exposed (CS Los).  These two groups are to be compared to animals that remained in Room Air (RA) and Room Air plus Losartan(0.6g/L) (RA Los) for any changes.
