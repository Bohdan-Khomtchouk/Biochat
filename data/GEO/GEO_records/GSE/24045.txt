TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberulosis H37Rv strains: Control vs. Plumbagin

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strains comparing control DMSO treated strains with Plumbagin treated strains.  Goal was to determine the effects of Plumbagin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strains.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,control DMSO vs. Plumbagin. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 Plumbagin replicates. The file showing raw and normalized data (~4645 rows) extracted from Agilent Feature Extraction Software is linked below. Samples details are described in PDF file linked below (NOTE: The samples 'Plumbagin' and 'chelerythrine' represent the submissions to GEO).
