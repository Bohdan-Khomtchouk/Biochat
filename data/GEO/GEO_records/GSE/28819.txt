TITLE
Changes in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment Impact Anabolic Actions of PTH

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Irradiation induced bone marrow ablation ultimately enhanced PTH anabolic effects in bone. B6 mice at 10 days of age were sub-lethally irradiated and treated with PTH 24h later for 5 days.  24h post last-injection, bone marrow was flushed with Trizol and RNA isolated and purified.  Microarray analyses was performed to determine differential differences in PTH effects in non-irradiated vs. irradiated bone marrow.

DESIGN
Triplicates of 4 groups (total of 12 samples) which include:  Nonirradiated Vehicle, Nonirradiated PTH, Irradiated Vehicle and Irradiated PTH
