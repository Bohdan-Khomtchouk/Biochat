TITLE
Rhizobium etli CFN42 wild type transcriptional profiling was compared between free living and symbiosis conditions

ORGANISM
Rhizobium etli CFN 42

SUMMARY
Rhizobium etli is a bacteria that fix nitrogen in symbiotic activity with Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean plant. In order to accomplish this nitrogen reduction a especial environment is induced in nodules such that gene expression of bacteroid suffer a significant change with respect to its wild type life style. With the purpose to identify genetic alterations between these physiological states, replicates of microarray data were accomplished in similar conditions between bacteria cultivated in free-life (succinate-ammonia) and those carrying on nitrogen fixation inside nodule.

DESIGN
Three independent biological materials with one dyeswap were performed.
