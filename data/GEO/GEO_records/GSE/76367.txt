TITLE
METTL3 promotes translation in human cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we find METTL3 associates with polyribosomes and promotes translation. METTL3 depletion inhibits translation, and both wild-type and catalytically inactive METTL3 promote translation when tethered to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter mRNA. Mechanistically, METTL3 enhances mRNA translation through an interaction with the translation initiation machinery.

DESIGN
m6A seq in A549 and H1299 cells, RNA seq in METTL3 knockdown cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
