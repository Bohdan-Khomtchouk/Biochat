TITLE
Gene expression analysis of brain cortex of reserpine-treated rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Animal models represent a very useful tool for the study of depressive-like behaviour and for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants.   Nevertheless, gene expression patterns of these different animal models and whether genes classically associated to human major depression are present in these genetic profiles remain unknown. Gene expression was evaluated in an animal model of depression: acute treatment with reserpine. Gene expression analyses were carried out using the Affymetrix® GeneChip® technology. Keywords: Treatment vs control comparative genomics study

DESIGN
In total, 12 animals were studied, six treated samples and six control samples
