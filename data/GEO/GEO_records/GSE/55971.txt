TITLE
Evaluation of microRNA levels in recipient BMMSCs of MRL/lpr mice after cell therapy (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has been widely used to treat a variety of human diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying its success are not fully understood. Here we show that MSCT rescues recipient bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC) function in Fas-deficient-MRL/lpr systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mice via a miR-29b/Dnmt1/Notch epigenetic cascade. Using the microRNA microarray, we found that MSCT could rescue the high level of miR-29b in the recipient BMMSCs of MRL/lpr mice.

DESIGN
In the present study, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) was used to treat MRL/lpr mice. One week after the treatment, normal control MSCs from C3H/HeJ mice (C3H), recipient MSCs from untreated MRL/lpr mice (LPR) and recipient MSCs from MSCT-treated MRL/lpr mice (MSC) were used for total RNA extraction and microRNA microarray for analysis of microRNA expressions.
