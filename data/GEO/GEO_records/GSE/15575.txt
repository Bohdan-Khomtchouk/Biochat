TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) cultivated in high and low glucose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was performed to determine the effect of high and low glucose on gene expression. Microarrays were used to identify distinct classes of genes up-regulated in HEK293 cells during cultivation for 7 days in medium with physiological (low) glucose compared to high glucose.
