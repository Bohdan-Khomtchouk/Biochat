TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) cultivated in high and low glucose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was performed to determine the effect of high and low glucose on gene expression. Microarrays were used to identify distinct classes of genes up-regulated in HEK293 cells during cultivation for 7 days in medium with physiological (low) glucose compared to high glucose.

DESIGN
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultivated for 7 days in commercially available DMEM (supplemented with 10 % FCS) containing high glucose (450 mg/dl) or low glucose (100 mg/dl). Cells were harvested, total RNA was extracted and microarray gene expression profiling was performed to compare differential gene expression between low and high glucose conditions. Two biological replicates for each condition were made (high glucose: HEK-high-gluc-1 and HEK-high-gluc-2;  and low glucose: HEK-low-gluc-1 and HEK-low-gluc-2).
