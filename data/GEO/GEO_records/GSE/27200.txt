TITLE
Expression data from Sotos syndrome patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression studies were performed on dermal fibroblasts from Sotos syndrome patients with a confirmed NSD1 abnormality and compared with age-sex matched controls. We used microarrays to detect differentially expressed genes in Sotos syndrome patients and performed a global test with the aim to map NSD1 within a signaling transduction pathway.

DESIGN
Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from nine Sotos syndrome patients and nine controls. Since NSD1 is a co-factor of the retinoic acid receptor, cultures were performed both in the presence and absence of retinoic acid.
