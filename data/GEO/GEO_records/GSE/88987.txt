TITLE
Dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility in CD8+ T cells responding to viral infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In response to acute infection, naive CD8+ T cells expand, differentiate into effector cells and then contract to a long-lived pool of memory cells after pathogen clearance. During chronic infections or in tumors, CD8+ T cells acquire an “exhausted” phenotype. Here we present genome-wide comparisons of chromatin accessibility and gene expression from endogenous CD8+ T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infection using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. Acquisition of effector, memory or exhausted phenotypes was associated with stable changes in chromatin accessibility away from the naive T cell state. Regions differentially accessible between functional subsets in vivo were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors known to regulate these subsets, including E2A, BATF, IRF4, T-bet and TCF1. Exhaustion-specific accessible regions were enriched for consensus binding sites for NFAT and Nr4a family members, indicating that chronic stimulation confers a unique accessibility profile on exhausted cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin accessibility with ATAC-seq and gene expression with RNA-seq for CD8 T cell subsets after in vivo response to viral infection or after in vitro culture (total 44 samples)
