TITLE
Differential gene expression in nephron progenitors lacking miR-17~92

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to compare the differential expression of transcripts in control kidneys compared to kidneys lacking the miR-17~92 cluster in nephron progenitors and their derivatives by RNA-seq to identify potential miRNA targets in the mutant kidneys.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of control and mutant (=Six2-TGC; miR-17~92 flx/flx) embryonic day 16 kidneys were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
