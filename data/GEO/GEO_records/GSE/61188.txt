TITLE
Zic2, an enhancer-binding factor required for embryonic stem cell specification

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 2 (Zic2) is one of the vertebrate homologs of the  Drosophila pair-rule gene odd-paired (opa). Our molecular and biochemical studies have  demonstrated that Zic2 to preferentially bind to transcriptional enhancers and functions as  a cofactor that interacts with the NuRD complex in ES cells. Detailed genome-wide studies  demonstrate that Zic2 function with Mbd3/NuRD in regulating the chromatin state and  transcriptional output of genes linked to differentiation. Zic2 is dispensable for the selfrenewal  of ES cells but is required for proper differentiation, similar to what has been  previously reported for Mbd3/NuRD. Our study identifies Zic2 as a key factor in the  execution of the pluripotency program with Mbd3/NuRD in ES cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Zic2, Chd4, Mbd3 and Zic3 in mES cells. ChIP-seq of H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and PolII in mES cells after Zic2 shRNA and non-targeting shRNA. RNA-seq of mES cells after Zic2, Zic3, Mbd3 and Mta2 shRNA and non-targeting shRNA.
