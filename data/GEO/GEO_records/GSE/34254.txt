TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Egr2 transcription factor binding sites in NKT and anti TCRb injected thymocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for mapping the Egr2 transcriptional program in developing thymic NKT. We found that Egr2 controls the induction of genes required for NKT development.

DESIGN
Examination of developing NKT cells and thymocytes receiving a strong TCR signal in vivo by injecting 500ug anti-TCRb antibody.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
