TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of retinoblastoma (Rb) binding sites in prostate cancer cell lines VCaP and LNCaP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although well characterized as a transcriptional activator, androgen receptor (AR) can also function as a direct transcriptional repressor in prostate cancer cells.  The major targets of the AR repressive function are genes mediating DNA synthesis. In this study, we found that AR was recruited to the majority of these DNA synthesis genes and rapidly repressed their transcription. This direct AR mediated repression was enhanced in prostate cancer cells expressing higher levels of AR, and was mediated by recruitment of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb).

DESIGN
Examination of Rb binding in 4 hours DHT treated prostate cancer cell lines VCaP and LNCaP
