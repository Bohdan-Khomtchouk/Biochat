TITLE
Parasite gene expression differences between RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 of Toxoplasma gondii.

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Parasite gene expression differences have been reported previously between RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1. To independently confirm these gene expression differences, we examined the parasite gene expression profiles of RH-ERP, RH-JSR and GT1 through microarray.

DESIGN
Three type I strains of Toxoplasma gondii were compared with one array each, and these were used to verify data from previous studies.
