TITLE
Wild type 3 hour exposure to zymolyase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of Zymolyase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using strains BY4741 (wild type). Yeast cells exposed to Zymolyase in YPD growth medium show a significant induction of cell wall compensatory mechanism. Keywords: cell wall stress response
