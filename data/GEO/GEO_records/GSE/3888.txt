TITLE
Growth phase-dependent response of Helicobacter pylori to iron starvation.

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
This data set was used to determine genes that are regulated by iron availability and to access the growth phase dependence on that regulation.  Stationary (Stat Chelate and Stat.iron.survival)and exponential (Log Chelate and Log.iron.survival)were subjected to chelation using DPP.  Growth status of the cultures was confirmed by determing the correlation coefficient of the Stat chelate T=0/control and Log Chelate T=0/control vs data generated in the TC Motility series.  Arrays used for iron addback experiments are listed as FeAddBack-1-time or FeAddBack-2-time. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
