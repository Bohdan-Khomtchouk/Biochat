TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gefitinib short-term resistance gene expression in the NSCLC cell line PC9 in co-culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gefitinib short-term resistance at gene expression level. The hyposthesis tested in the present study was that short-term resistance towards gefitinib in NSCLC cells influences pathways that associates with resistance towards EGFR-TKI treatment. Results provide important information of the response of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to gefitinib and also to resistance towards gefitinib resistance, up-or down-regulated specific resistance pathways and cellular functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PC9 cell line (n=3), co-cultured PC9 (with MRC-5 cells)(n=3), gefitinib treated (0.5ÂµM) PC9 (n=3), and co-cultured (MRC-5) + gefitinib treated PC9 cells (n=3) for 48h after gefitinib treatment
