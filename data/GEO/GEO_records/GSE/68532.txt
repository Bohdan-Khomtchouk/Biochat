TITLE
Transcriptome of Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) using Laser capture microdissection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to characterize the whole genome transcriptome profiles of pure sample population of KCOT epithelial cells for examination of molecular pathways.

DESIGN
Twenty human KCOT samples were obtained. Both fresh frozen and FFPE samples were used and placed in solution for 1-4 weeks to allow decalcification by EDTA. The tissue was sectioned at -35C at a thickness of 7 microns. These sections were used for laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate the neoplastic epithelial portion of the tumors, using static image settings.  Total RNA was extracted from each sample and examined using the whole genome microarray against the Stratagene universal human reference RNA.
