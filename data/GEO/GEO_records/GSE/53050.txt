TITLE
Microarray analysis of thyrospheres from human THJ-11T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an Affymetrix Human Genome HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Array to analyze the differential expression of genes in thyrospheres and monolayer cells from the THJ-11T cells in an attempt to identify the molecular signature of thyroid cancer stem cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels in thyrospheres were compared with that of the parental monolayer cells on a total of six arrays, three arrays for each of the thyrospheres versus monolayer cells from three independent experiments.
