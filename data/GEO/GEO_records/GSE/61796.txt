TITLE
Transcriptional changes in dormant potato minitubers treated with 1-(alpha-ethylbenzy)-3-nitroquanidine

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
RNA was sequenced from commercially grown greenhouse minitubers treated with 10 ug of 1-(alpha-ethylbenzy)-3-nitroquanidine (NG) in DMSO and followed for four, and seven days post treatment. Control tubers were injected with DMSO alone. Sequence reads were mapped to the potato genome (PGSC_DM_v3_2.1.11) and transcript abundance was determined using Cuffdiff v 2.02.

DESIGN
Minitubers were injected with DMSO (control) or 10 ug of NG and then trancript changes were examined at on, four, and seven days after exposure.
