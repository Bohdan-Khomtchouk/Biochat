TITLE
Genomic-wide PU.1 binding in mouse developing pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the genomic PU.1 binding profile in mouse developing pro-B cells by using chromatin immunoprecipitation following high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Our goal was to determine the genes regulated by PU.1 specifically at the pro-B cell stage in B cell development.

DESIGN
A PU.1 doxycycline-inducible pro-B cell line (i660 BM) was used in these set of experiments. Description: PU.1 was induced for 24 hours using doxycycline at the concentration of 70ng/ml, followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol. Non-induced cells were used as controls. qPCRs were performed in order to validate the immunoprecipitations before high-throughput sequencing. Two PU.1 induced samples and one input DNA sample (non-immunoprecipitated chromatin) were submitted to sequencing.
