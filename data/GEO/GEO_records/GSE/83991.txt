TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mouse lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse lung epithelial subpopulations (alveolar type 2, basal and airway luminal cells) freshly dissociated from mouse lung and trachea were isolated by FACS. RNA-seq gene expression profiling was used to determine gene signature from each population.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from the small airway (SA) and large airway (LA) of 6 mouse lungs
