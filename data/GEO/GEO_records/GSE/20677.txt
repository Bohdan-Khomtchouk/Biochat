TITLE
Gene Expression in Gold Nanoparticle Oligonucleotide Complexes treated Primary Immune Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A transcriptome-wide functional analysis of gene expression implicated multiple signaling pathways specific for Au-NP oligonucleotide complexes. Exposure to Au-NP oligonucleotide complexes is also accompanied by marked activation of immune cells.

DESIGN
We investigated the effect of Au-NP antisense EGFP oligonucleotide complexes on the transcriptome by expression profiling of 293T cells under four conditions and PBMCs under six conditions with the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray
