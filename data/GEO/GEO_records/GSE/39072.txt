TITLE
CD99 suppresses osteosarcoma cell migration by favouring the oncosuppressor N-cadherin/ B-catenin signalling pathway in contrast to ezrin: the central role of ROCK2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the molecular basis for CD99 function in osteosarcoma, gene expression profile of U-2/CD99 wild-type(wt) expressing cell lines were compared with U-2 OS parental cells.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment, U-2/CD99 vs U-2OS cell lines. Biological replicates:3 control replicates, 3 transfected replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7264 Agilent-012097 Human 1A Microarray (V2) G4110B (Probe Name version)
