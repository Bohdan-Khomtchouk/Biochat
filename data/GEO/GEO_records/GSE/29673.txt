TITLE
Toxicogenomic Study of Pentamethylchromanol (PMCol)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms of PMCol-induced hapatotoxicity using microarray The study demonstrated that chronic exposure to high doses of PMCol induces liver damage and dysfunction, probably due to both inhibition of synthesis and depletion of liver glutathione as well as modification of other drug metabolism pathways.

DESIGN
PMCol was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats at at doses of 200 and 2000 mg/kg daily for 7 or 28 days
