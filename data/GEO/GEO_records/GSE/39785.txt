TITLE
Model-driven multi-omic data analysis elucidates metabolic immunomodulators of macrophage activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. We constructed a genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation are identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions.

DESIGN
Two condition (flagellin and LPS) time course exposure of RAW 264.7 cell line at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours. Two replicates for each condition and time point. All conditions compared to a pool of untreated cells at a 0 hour time point.
