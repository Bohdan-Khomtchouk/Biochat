TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in TGF-β1-knock down rhabdmyosarcoma cell lines vs controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TGF-β1-regulated miRNAs in the progression of RMS,we performed comprehensive miRMA microarray analysis on RNA derived from typical RMS cell lines and TGF-β1 knock-down cell lines. We identified a novel set of TGF-β1-related miRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from TGF-β1-knock down rhabdmyosarcoma cell lines and controls. Three-condition experiment: shRNA-TGF-β1/RD cells vs. shRNA-Control/RD cells, shRNA-TGF-β1/SMS-CTR cells vs. shRNA-Control/ SMS-CTR cells, and shRNA-TGF-β1/RH28 cells vs. shRNA-Control/RH28 cells. Biological replicates: 1 RD cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1SMS-CTR cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1RH28 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1RD cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1SMS-CTR cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, and 1RH28 cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
