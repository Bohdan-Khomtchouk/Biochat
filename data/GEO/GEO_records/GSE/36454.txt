TITLE
The CCR4-NOT Complex Is Implicated in the Viability of Aneuploid Yeasts

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
To identify the genes required to sustain aneuploid viability, we screened a deletion library of non-essential genes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which most types of aneuploidy are eventually lethal to the cell.  Aneuploids remain viable for a period time and can form colonies by reducing the extent of the aneuploidy.  We hypothesized that a reduction in colony formation efficiency could be used to screen for gene deletions that compromise aneuploid viability.  Deletion mutants were used to measure the effects on the viability of spores derived from triploid meiosis and from a chromosome instability mutant.  We found that the CCR4-NOT complex, an evolutionarily conserved general regulator of mRNA turnover, and other related factors, including poly(A)-specific nuclease for mRNA decay, are involved in aneuploid viability.  Defective mutations in CCR4-NOT complex components in the distantly related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affected the viability of spores produced from triploid cells, suggesting that this complex has a conserved role in aneuploids.  In addition, our findings suggest that the genes required for homologous recombination repair are important for aneuploid viability.
