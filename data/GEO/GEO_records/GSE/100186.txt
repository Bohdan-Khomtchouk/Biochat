TITLE
circRNA expression in renal cell carcinoma and mached non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the circRNA expression profile in CCRCC and matched non-tumor tissues, we uesed circRNA microArray analysis form Arraystar to examine the expression of circRNAs in CCRCC and matched non-tumor tissues.

DESIGN
renal celar cell carcinoma tissues from CCRCC surgery were distributed into two experimental groups: tumor tissue group and normal tissue group, then perform circRNAs chips by Arraystar Human circRNAs chip (Arraystar)

PLATFORM
GPL21825 074301 Arraystar Human CircRNA microarray V2
