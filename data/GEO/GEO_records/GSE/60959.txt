TITLE
miRNA profiling in the plasma of patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of miRNA profiling in the plasma of patients between ISR and non-ISR

DESIGN
Venous blood was collected in EDTA in the ward or the cardiac catheterization laboratory before the angiography procedure and heparin administration. Plasma was harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C until assayed. Identical volumes of plasma from the 6 patients with ISR and 4 patients with non-ISR were pooled to reach a final volume of 1500µL for each patient. Total RNA was extracted using miRVana isolation kit, dephosphorylated and labeled using miRNA Complete Labeling  kit. Scanning was achieved with the illumina iScan System. The result were acquired with the Genome Studio (GenomeStudioV2009.1).
