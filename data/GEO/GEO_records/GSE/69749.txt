TITLE
Sex-specific chromatin accessibility profiling in human PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ATAC-seq to profile the chromatin accessibility differences between sexes. We investigated the chromatin states of the PBMCs of twenty individuals, with an equal distribution of males and females, controlled for age (18-45 years old) and ethnicity (Caucasian).

DESIGN
We examined chromatin accesibility using ATAC-seq in the PBMCs of twenty individuals.
