TITLE
STAT5 paralog dose governs T cell effector and regulatory function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor STAT5 is fundamental to the mammalian immune system. However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remains controversial. We addressed this longstanding question in primary CD4+ 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that, although both influence regulatory (Treg) and effector T cell responses, and control many of the same genes, they are not functionally equivalent and, in fact, only the latter is required for immunological tolerance. Differences in genomic distribution and transcriptomic output support the conclusion that STAT5B is dominant and, surprisingly, point towards relative abundance (i.e. paralog dose), rather than unique functional capabilities, as the principal distinguishing feature. Collectively, our data provide a unifying model for the discrete and redundant activities of STAT5A and STAT5B, establishing that asymmetrical expression underlies paralog specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology.

DESIGN
This dataset includes 55 individual samples of transcriptome or STAT5 distibution data from cytokine treated CD4+T cells. Each culture condition includes at least 2 biological replicates per genotype.
