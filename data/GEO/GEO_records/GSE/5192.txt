TITLE
Electric current induced genes in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The control of cellular processes by direct electronic interface will facilitate the development of biosensors, synthetic biology, and nanobiotechnology by providing the means to pass information from synthetic to living elements of hybrid systems.  To investigate the potential of manipulating cellular gene expression by means of electric current, Escherichia coli cultures were screened for electric current inducible genes using global gene expression profiling.  Cells in stationary phase were subjected to a DC current density of 2.5 mA/cm2 for 2 min after which the cells were lysed and the total RNA extracted.   Of the 4290 expressed genes in E. coli , 432 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed at an effective alpha value of 5.8 X 10-6.    Of these, 333 genes were induced and 99 repressed.  Several genes were verified as differentially expressed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The set of differentially expressed genes were examined for the presence of regulatory factors, subsidiary regulon genes, and biological function, particularly redox functions.  Transcripts for the regulatory proteins fnr, sspB, soxS, oxyR,  creB and yeiL were found to be up-regulated, and crp was down regulated.  While soxS and oxyR were up-regulated, the downstream genes controlled by these regulatory proteins were not differentially expressed, suggesting that the oxidative stress level of low-current electric exposure is small.  Genes controlled by FNR and CRP, many of which have redox function, were found to be differentially expressed suggesting modulation by direct reduction that can only be partially explained as a  response to the reducing environment created by the electrolytic generation of H2 at the cathode. Genes associated with phosphate metabolism and membrane proteins were also differentially expressed. Keywords: electric current induced gene expression
