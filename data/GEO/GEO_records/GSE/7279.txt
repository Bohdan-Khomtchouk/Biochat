TITLE
profiling of Hypothalamus from arthritic C57Bl/6 mice s.c. vs. control C57Bl/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The main function of the nervous system is to maintain homeostasis by sensing and reacting to signals that reach a certain threshold. For example, the brain can sense immune peripheral events through soluble compounds or the vagus nerve and can react through activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in the modulation of an ongoing immune response. Using microarrays we studied the gene expression profile of the hypothalamus in C57Bl/6 mice strain that developed collagen induced-arthritis vs control mice. Keywords: gene expression profile of the hypothalamus in response to induction of arthritis.

DESIGN
We used two-color oligonucleotides in-house printed microarrays in a case-control direct design with two technical replicates in a dye swap design. We analyze changes in gene expression profile in the hypothalamus of arthritic vs control mice. We performed 3 samples (biological replicates)
