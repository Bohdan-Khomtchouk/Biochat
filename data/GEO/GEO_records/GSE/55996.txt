TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the gene expression profile of  in vivo induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression profile of a novel type of pluripotent stem cells (in vivo induced pluripotent stem cells, named i2PS cells) obtained by reprogramming BALB/c mice hepatocytes in vivo. The hypothesis tested in the present study is that in vivo induced pluripotent stem cells will have a similar gene expression profile to that of other pluripotent stem cells. Hence the embryonic stem cell line E14TG2A is used as a reference in this study. Results provide valuable information for the overall molecular characterisation of cells that have been reprogrammed to pluripotency in vivo, together with the confirmation of their pluripotent character at the gene expression level.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from i2PS and E14TG2A cells cultured under standard embryonic stem cells conditions (i.e. DMEM supplemented with LIF). Three biological replicates were included for each cell type. Data were analysed using the gene expression levels of E14TG2A cells as a reference.
