TITLE
Functional Genomic Analysis Of Barley(Hordeum vulgare L.) Grain Protein Accumulation

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Effect of high grain protein locus on barley grain protein accumulation. Gene expression levels were analysed in Karl, a low grain protein variety with its near-isogenic line 10_11(has high grain protein locus, chromosome 6)using Barley1 22k affymetrix chip.    ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Aravind Jukanti.
