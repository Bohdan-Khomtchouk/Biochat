TITLE
Functional Genomic Analysis Of Barley(Hordeum vulgare L.) Grain Protein Accumulation

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Effect of high grain protein locus on barley grain protein accumulation. Gene expression levels were analysed in Karl, a low grain protein variety with its near-isogenic line 10_11(has high grain protein locus, chromosome 6)using Barley1 22k affymetrix chip.    ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Aravind Jukanti.

DESIGN
developmental stage: 14 days past anthesis - genotype: Karl - tissue type: Leaves(3-replications);  developmental stage: 14 days past anthesis - genotype: Karl - tissue type: Kernels(3-replications);  developmental stage: 14 days past anthesis - genotype: 10-11 (NIL with high grain protein locus) - tissue type: Leaves(3-replications);  developmental stage: 14 days past anthesis - genotype: 10-11 (NIL with high grain protein locus) - tissue type: Kernels(3-replications);  developmental stage: 21 days past anthesis - genotype: Karl - tissue type: Leaves(3-replications);  developmental stage: 21 days past anthesis - genotype: Karl - tissue type: Kernels(3-replications);  developmental stage: 21 days past anthesis - genotype: 10-11 (NIL with high grain protein locus) - tissue type: Leaves(3-replications);  developmental stage: 21 days past anthesis - genotype: 10-11 (NIL with high grain protein locus) - tissue type: Kernels(3-replications)
