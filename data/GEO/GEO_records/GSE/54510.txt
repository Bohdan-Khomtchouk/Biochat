TITLE
Deciphering life history transcriptomics in different environments

ORGANISM
Drosophila mojavensis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome transcription expression level changes in Drosophila mojavensis wild-type populations (Las Bocas:LB and Punta Prieta:PP). The experiment was designed to investigate life history transcriptomics in different environments.

DESIGN
A total of  172 hybridizations were performed in this entire experiment. We used 135K 12-plex NimbleGen arrays. Total RNA was recovered from each sample listed below. The experimental design consisted a total of two populations (Las Bocas:LB; Punta Prieta:PP),  two host diets (Agria:AG and Organ pipe:OP) and fourteen life stages (6 hr egg:E6; 1st instar larvae:L1; 2nd instar larvae:L2; 3rd instar larvae:L3; Early pupal stage:EP; Late pupal stage:LP; 0 Day old adult:0D; 3 Day old adult:3D; 4 Day old adult: 4D; 6 Day old adult:6D; 10 Day old adult:10D; 14 Day old adult:14D; 18 Day old adult:18D & 24 Day old adult:24D). Each chip measures the expression level of 14528 transcripts. Two to 5 replicates were used for each type (R1, R2, R3 etc.). Fly source details are as follows: Las Bocas 2009: LB09; Punta Prieta 2008:PP08.
