TITLE
Quantitative analysis of miRNA changes in bone marrow stem cells under neural differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Normal SJL mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were used for the isolation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC). Bone marrow cells were obtained from the femurs and tibias of euthanized mice by flushing with PBS. Cells were subjected to negative magnetic sorting using the Lineage Cell Depletion Kit. Isolation of murine bone marrow Lin-Sca-1+ cells was performed using MACS Sca-1 MultiSort Kit (fBMSC).  The differentiation of neural stem cells was induced by removing the bFGF-containing medium and resuspending cells in fresh bFGF-free medium. Microarray analysis of miRNA expression profiles was performed comparing non differentiated bone marrow stem cells (fBMSC) to bone marrow stem cells differentiated for 4 or 7 days.

DESIGN
The data are from adult mouse stem cells isolated from bone marrow
