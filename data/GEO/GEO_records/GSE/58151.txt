TITLE
Human enteroendcrine cell responses to infection with Chlamydia trachomatis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to perform a microarray analysis of the response pattern of EEC from both large and small bowel to infection in vitro, using Chlamydia trachomatis infection as a model.

DESIGN
Two human EEC lines: LCC-18, derived from a neuroendocrine colonic tumour, and CNDT-2, derived from a small intestinal carcinoid, were infected with C. trachomatis serovar LGV II strain 434 (ATCC VR-902B). Penicillin G was used to induce persistent infection.  Gene expression levels in infected and persistently infected EEC cells were investigated by microarray analysis
