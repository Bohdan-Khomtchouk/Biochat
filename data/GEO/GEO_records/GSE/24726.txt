TITLE
Gene expression profile of mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) after the deletion of transcription factor E2-2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The interferon-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) share common progenitors with antigen-presenting classical dendritic cells (cDC), yet they possess distinct morphology and molecular features resembling those of lymphocytes. It is unclear whether the unique cell fate of PDC is actively maintained in the steady state. We report that the deletion of transcription factor E2-2 from mature peripheral PDC caused their spontaneous differentiation into cells with cDC properties. This included the loss of PDC markers, increase in MHC class II expression and T cell priming capacity, acquisition of dendritic morphology and induction of cDC signature genes. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed direct binding of E2-2 to key PDC-specific and lymphoid genes, as well as to certain genes enriched in cDC. Thus, E2-2 actively maintains the cell fate of mature PDC and opposes the “default” cDC fate, in part through direct regulation of lineage-specific gene expression programs.

DESIGN
Inducible deletion of E2-2 (Tcf4) has been performed by administering tamoxifen to conditional E2-2flox/flox Rosa26-CreER+ mice or to E2-2flox/flox Rosa26-CreER- control littermates. Four or six days later total splenocytes were isolated, pooled from 2-3 mice and PDC (CD11b- B220+ CD11clow Bst2+) were isolated by sorting. Global gene expression profiles of E2-2-deficient (null) and control (Ctrl) PDC were compared using Affymetrix microarrays (GPL1261).
