TITLE
RNA-seq study of major P.aeruginosa PA14 transcription factors

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Gene regulation via transcription factors influences the metabolic, adaptive and pathogenic capabilities of the organism. We report the transcriptomes of the mutants of six major P. aeruginosa PA14 trancription factors - RhlR, LasR, Anr, GacA, FleQ and CbrB.

DESIGN
The P. aeruginosa PA14 transposon mutants were analyzed by RNA-seq. All samples were cultivated in LB medium until reaching an OD600 of 2.0. For each biological replicate, three cultures were pooled for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing.
