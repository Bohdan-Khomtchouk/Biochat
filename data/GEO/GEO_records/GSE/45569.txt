TITLE
Spatial Regulation Dominates Gene Function in the Ganglia Chain

ORGANISM
Hirudo medicinalis

SUMMARY
Spatial regulation analysis across multiple condition comparisons revealed distinct patterns of gene expression. We combined these transcriptome data with spatial CNS data to produce the spatio-transcripto map of the ganglia chain. The Hirudo Medicinalis set of transcripts generated here provides a resource for gene discovery and gene regulation within the nervous system. In addition, the strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome data presented here may be helpful in other similar transcriptome studies.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different ganglia in 3 different leeches.

PLATFORM
GPL16891 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Hirudo medicinalis)
