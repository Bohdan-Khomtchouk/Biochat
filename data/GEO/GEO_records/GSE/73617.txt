TITLE
Modulation of reversibility by DNA Methyltransferases during hepatogenic differentiation in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold great promise in the field of liver regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms and reversibility of hepatogenic differentiation in MSCs are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that hepatogenic differentiation of MSCs is a reversible process and is modulated by the transforming growth factor beta 1- DNA methyltransferases (TGF-β1-Dnmts) axis. Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a differentially regulate hepatogenic differentiation and de-differentiation in response to the alternation of TGF-β1 concentration. Knockdown of Dnmt1 accelerates the hepatogenic differentiation in MSCs-derived hepatocyte-like cells (dHeps) whereas Knockdown of Dnmt3a represses hepatogenic differentiation. Conclusions: Our finding first demonstrates that epigenetic regulation by Dnmts in response to stimulation from the surrounding microenvironment controls the reversibility of hepatogenic differentiation in MSCs. Manipulation of Dnmts provides a rapid and efficient differentiation protocol to generate functional dHeps from MSCs that may provide clinical potential for regenerative medicine.
