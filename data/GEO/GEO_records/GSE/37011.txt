TITLE
HF liver: Control vs. Plin2-ASO treated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse liver comparing control, scrambled-oligonucleotides (Cont)-treated mice with Perilipin 2-antisense oligonucleotides (Plin2-ASO)-treated mice. C57BL/6 mice on a high-fat diet were treated with oligonucleotides in vivo. The goal was to determine the effects of Plin2 down-regulation in the liver on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control oligonucleotides vs. Plin2-antisense oligonucleotides. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 Plin2-ASO replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
