TITLE
Identification of genes affected by Wnt3a in primary mouse myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to gain insight into the molecular events operating downstream of canonical wnt-signaling in myoblasts, we compared by microarray analysis the transcriptome of myoblast cultured for 4 hours in the presence and absence of Wnt3a.

DESIGN
Primary myoblasts isolated from newborn mice were treated for 4 hours in DMEM 2% horse serum in presence or in absence of Wnt3a (100ng/ml)
