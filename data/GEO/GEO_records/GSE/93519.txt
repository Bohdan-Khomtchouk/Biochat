Integrated genomic analyses of de novo pathways underlying atypical meningiomas [miRNA-seq]

SUMMARY
Meningiomas are mostly benign brain tumors, with a potential for becoming atypical or malignant. Based on comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of meningiomas, we compared benign tumors to atypical ones. We show that the vast majority of primary (de novo atypical meningiomas display loss of NF2, which co-occurs either with genomic instability or recurrent mutations in SMARCB1. These tumors harbor increased H3K27me3 repressive signal and a hypermethylated phenotype, mainly occupying the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2 binding sites in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, thereby phenocopying a more primitive cellular state. Consistent with this observation, and based on differential gene expression analysis as well as correlation of mRNA:miRNA regulatory networks, atypical meningiomas exhibit up-regulation of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, well as the E2F2 and FOXM1 transcriptional networks that promote proliferation through activation of the cell cycle pathways. In addition, based on H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis, we show atypical tumors to display an activated super-enhancer near the meningeal identity transcription factor ZIC1, leading to its transcriptional upregulation. Importantly, these primary atypical meningiomas do not harbor activating TERT promoter mutations, which have been reported in atypical tumors that progressed from benign ones. Our results establish the genomic landscape of primary atypical meningiomas, differentiating their profile from benign and progressed tumors and establishing novel therapeutic targets.
