TITLE
HCMV infection of human neural precursor cells: Human neural precursor cell expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCMV -treated and control human adult neural precurso cells (NPC) were used to extract RNA for profiling on DNA arrays Primary adult hippocampus-derived neural precursor cells were used at passage # 2-4 for HCMV infection, followed by RNA extraction at indicated times

DESIGN
Primary adult neural precursor cells were infected with HCMV strains Towne and TR (O.1MOI) and RNA was extracted at 72 hrs postinfection for expression profiling on both HCMV and Affymetrix DNA arrays
