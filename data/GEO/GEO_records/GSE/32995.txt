TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium: Immobilized growth vs. Planktonic growth

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ST4/74

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of four growth phases S. Typhimurium comparing immobilised growth with planktonic growth.

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. Triplicate or quadruple arrays were carried out for each of the 8 conditions as well as the inoculum culture: inoculum, planktonic MEP, planktonic LEP, planktonic ESP, planktonic LSP, immobilised MEP, immobilised LEP, immobilised ESP and immobilised LSP
