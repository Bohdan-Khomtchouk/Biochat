TITLE
Chick myopia

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
One-day old white Leghorn chicks were housed in brooders with a 12 hr light:dark cycle, using General Electric chroma 50 fluorescent lighting with irradiance of approximately 50Î¼W/cm2 at chick eye level. They received Purina Chick Chow food and water ad libitum. At one week of age and at the onset of the light phase, the chicks were anesthetized with inhalation ether, and a unilateral translucent white plastic goggle was glued to the periorbital feathers to induce ipsilateral form-deprivation myopia, alternating between the left or right eye. After either 6 hrs (n=8) or 3 days (n=8) of goggle wear, the chicks were killed by decapitation. The enucleated eyes were opened at the equator, and the retina/RPE was dissected together from both the goggled and control eyes. The tissues were individually frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until processed Keywords: Gene expression

DESIGN
Six biological replicates used for each: 3 day control retina, 3 day experimental, 6 hour control retina, and 6 hour experimental.
