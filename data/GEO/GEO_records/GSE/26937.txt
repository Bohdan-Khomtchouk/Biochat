ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
PAX8 transcriptional profiling of rat PCCL3 cells comparing wild type cells with PAX8 silenced cells and scramble treated with PAX8 silenced cells

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Wild type vs. PAX silenced cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 4 dye-swap. AND scramble treated vs PAX8 silenced cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 4 dye-swap.
