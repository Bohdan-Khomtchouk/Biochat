TITLE
PAX8 transcriptional profiling in rat PCCL3 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
PAX8 transcriptional profiling of rat PCCL3 cells comparing wild type cells with PAX8 silenced cells and scramble treated with PAX8 silenced cells

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Wild type vs. PAX silenced cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 4 dye-swap. AND scramble treated vs PAX8 silenced cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 4 dye-swap.
