TITLE
Cooperativity, specificity and evolutionary stability of Polycomb targeting in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the evolutionary behaviour of Polycomb group proteins, their recruitment factors and their underlying sequences by performing ChIP-seq analysis in 4-5 different Drosophila species. We demonstrate an extremely high conservation of Polycomb repressive domains across Drosophila species We validate few cases of  PRE divergence that shows that cis-driven PRE evolution is a rare event. We further show that PHO recruitment to Polycomb domains is evolutionarily robust to motif changes and that PRC1 stabilizes binding of its key recruiter

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of histone marks and chromatin associated factors across 4-5 Drosophila species
