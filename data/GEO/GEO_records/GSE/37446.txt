TITLE
Sequential stage specific reporter line analysis (SSRLA) of 3 BAC transgenic mESC lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FACS purified cells from differentiation day 14-15  cells from 3 BAC transgenic mESC lines: Hes::GFP (early), Nurr1::GFP (mid), and Pitx3::YFP (late) DA neuron development reporter lines

DESIGN
All three lines were differentiated towards the midbrain dopamine phenotype, and FACS purification was performed at D14-15, and then subject to global transcriptome analysis
