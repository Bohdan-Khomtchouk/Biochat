TITLE
Expression data from SMMC-7721 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome wide transcription profile analysis to determine the expression alterations between control and the POH1 siRNAs transfected SMMC-7721 cells

DESIGN
The liver cancer cell line SMMC-7721  transfected with either the control or POH1 siRNAs were subjected to a genome wide transcription profile analysis through Human U133 Puls 2.0 (Affymetrix) microarray
