TITLE
Gene expression analysis of hemizygous or heterozygous KIT exon 11 deletions NIH3T3 infected cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Codelink® Whole Mouse Genome Bioarrays (GE/Amersham) of one sample of WT, D6, D54, WT/D6, WT/D54 and MIGR NIH3T3 cells, cultivated in the four different conditions (SCF+, SCF- and imatinib 1 or 5 µM), were used for the analysis of differential gene expression. Our aim was to choose the best candidate genes for low density array analysis. We first selected genes differentially expressed between WT and hemizygous samples grown in the SCF+ condition, whose fold change was superior or equal to 2 and whose expression for at least one of the sample was greater than 1.3 (commonly admitted threshold for low density arrays). We selected then 83 and 126 genes more that were differentially expressed between D6 and D54 cell lines (fold change ≥ 2; gene amplification > 1.3) in SCF+ or SCF- condition, respectively. Finally we obtained a list of 235 genes in which 94 were available for Taqman® low density array (Applied®).

DESIGN
We have 6 samples per group: NIH3T3 MIGR (empty vector), NIH3T3 KIT wild-type (WT), NIH3T3 KIT del557-558 (D6), NIH3T3 KIT del564-581 (D54), NIH3T3 KIT WT/ KIT D6 and NIH3T3 KIT WT/KIT D54. All these samples were included in each of the 4 groups: culture medium without Stem Cell Factor (SCF-), culture medium with SCF (SCF+), culture medium with SCF and imatinib 1µM (STI 1µM), and culture medium with SCF and imatinib 5µM (STI 5µM). We analyzed each sample in one array.
