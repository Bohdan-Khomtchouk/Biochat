TITLE
A strong anti-inflammatory signature revealed by liver transcription profiling of Tmprss6-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tmprss6 is the master inhibitor of hepcidin and its inactivation causes iron refractory iron deficiency anemia both in human and in mice. Mice with iron deficiency anemia (IDA)-low hepcidin show a pro-inflammatory response that is blunted in iron deficienct-high hepcidin Tmprss6 null mice. We investigated the transcriptional response associated with chronic hepcidin overexpression by comparing whole genome transcription profiling of the liver of Tmprss6 KO mice and IDA animals, irrespective of iron deficiency.

DESIGN
Total liver RNA obtained from Tmprss6 KO mice were compared to wild type (iron deficient) animals, under basal conditions and after LPS challenge
