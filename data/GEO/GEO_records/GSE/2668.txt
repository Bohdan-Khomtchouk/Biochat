TITLE
OCI/AML2 ATRA AND VPA GENE EXPRESSION

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with the retinoid, all trans retinoic acid (ATRA), along with standard chemotherapy has significantly improved survival compared to chemotherapy alone1. ATRA mediates its benefit in APL by overcoming the transcriptional block mediated by PML-RAR-alpha fusion oncoprotein, thereby, restoring expression of retinoid response genes2. The therapeutic benefits observed with ATRA treatment in APL have not been achieved in the other more common sub-types of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)3. This likely reflects the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes by other recurrent chromosomal translocations in AML cells4. In this experiment, we evaluated if treatment of the AML cell line, OCI/AML-2, with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), would alter the expression of sub-sets of genes by itself or in conjunction with ATRA that have been shown to be modulated by ATRA in APL2.
