TITLE
Tissue specific expression data from maturing wheat seeds (20-50 DAA) of two genotypes

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of the embryo and endosperm tissue of maturing wheat seeds of two geneotypes, namely AC Domain and RL4452, was performed We used Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array to detail transcriptional programs and regulatory networks underlying seed maturation/desiccation in wheat

DESIGN
Maturing seeds (20 to 50 DAA) of two wheat genotypes, AC Domain and RL4452, characterized by contrasting final seed size/weight and degree of tolerance to preharvest sprouting were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip.

PLATFORM
GPL3802 [wheat] Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array
