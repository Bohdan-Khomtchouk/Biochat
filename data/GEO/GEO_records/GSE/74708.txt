TITLE
Effects of a Closed Space Environment on Gene Expression in Hair Follicles of Astronauts in the International Space Station

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In recent times, long-term stay has become a common occurrence in the International Space Station (ISS). However, adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to the astronauts after their return. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, hair, an easy-to-obtain sample, was identified as the candidate. In order to investigate the genetic changes in human hair during space flight, the hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by DNA microarray and real time q-PCR analyses.

DESIGN
Space environment induced gene expression of hair follicles of astronaut was measured 6 differnent times included 2 in flight on orbit. Ten independent experiments were performed on differing astronauts. and the sampling day was differed for each astronaut because of their schedules.
