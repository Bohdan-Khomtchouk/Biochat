TITLE
Oocyte-expressed Yes-associated Protein (YAP) is a Key Activator of the Early Zygotic Genome in Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated maternal and paternal mouse models with Yap1-deletion, and elucidated the function of maternal YAP in zygotic genome activation.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing with 2 WT oocyte samples at GV stage, 2 YAP-/- oocyte samples at GV stage, 1 WT embryo samples at 4cell stage, 1 YAP-/- embryo samples at at 4-cell stage.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
