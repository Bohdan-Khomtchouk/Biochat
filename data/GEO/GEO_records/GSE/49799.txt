TITLE
DamID data for Comr binding in drosophila testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comr protein was found to be a major regulator of gene activity in drosophila spermatocytes. We obtained Comr binding profile to determine targets of Comr. Comr binding in drosophila male germ line cells was determined using DamID technique.

DESIGN
Comparison of Dam-Comr binding to Dam-alone signal in duplicate for each sample type.
