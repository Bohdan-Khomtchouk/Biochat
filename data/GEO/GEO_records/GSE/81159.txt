TITLE
The Tip60/NuA4 complex is required for proper cell cycle progression and the transition to a post-mitotic state in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To get a more global view of the gene expression changes caused by inhibition of Tip60, we performed RNAseq on dissected late L3 wings expressing Tip60WT or Tip60DN. Expression of Tip60WT or Tip60DN was restricted to 48 or 78h prior to RNA extraction. Tip60WT expression caused minimal changes in the transcriptome compared to control wings expressing Gal4/GFP alone, while Tip60DN expression for 48h and 78h led to a largely overlapping program of 860 genes that significantly changed expression > 1.4-fold compared to Tip60WT.

DESIGN
Transcriptome changes were determined by comparing levels of transcripts in L3 wings expressing a dominant negative Tip60 (Tip60DN) to Tip60WT expression for either 48h or 78h.
