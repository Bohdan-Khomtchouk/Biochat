TITLE
A molecular mechanism for compartmentalization and silencing of chromatin domains at the nuclear lamina [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A large fraction of the mammalian genome is organized into inactive chromosomal domains associated with the nuclear lamina. Using genomic repositioning assays we show that Lamina associated domains (LADs), spanning the developmentally regulated IgH and Cyp3a loci, contain transportable DNA regions that associate chromatin with the nuclear lamina and repress gene activity in fibroblasts.

DESIGN
We characterized DNA regions within LADs that are functionally capable of positioning chromatin domains at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) lamina.  We mapped and characterized the IgH and other LADs in murine fibroblasts.  We show that these murine LADs have a unique chromatin structure with discrete boundaries.  We demonstrate DNA regions within LADs that are capable of directing the association of chromatin domains with the INM-lamina as well as the silencing of a co-integrated reporter gene.
