TITLE
Expression data from alveolar type II epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The importance of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) in all aspects of the induction and regulation of respiratory immune responses has become increasing appreciated. We determined the genome-wide profile of gene expression in response to immune mediated airway inflammation. Overall, our results provide detailed description of specific AEC II gene expression under disease conditions. Differentially expressed genes of diverse molecular functions have been identified that may be critical for numerous physiologic activities, some of which may be currently unappreciated. Data obtained by such analysis will help to understand the function of these important immune cells in the respiratory system and may point out strategies for intervention in the progression of inflammatory diseases. We used microarrays to detail changes in the gene expression profile in alveolar type II epithelial cells during interstitial airway inflammation and identified a wide variety of differentially expressed genes during this process. Keywords: comparison healthy versus diseased

DESIGN
Alveolar type II epithelial cells from the lung of healthy SPC-HA and diseased SPC-HAxTCR-HA mice were isolated by enzymatic tissue desintegration followed by one step negative selection using a MoFlow cell sorter. RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed.
