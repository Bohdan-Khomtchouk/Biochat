TITLE
Gene Expression Regulation by Lung Cancer Oncogenes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize gene expression changes induced by oncogenes implicated in human lung adenocarcinoma, we analyzed the whole transcriptome of NIH3T3 cells expressing mutant EGFR (exon 19 deletion) or wild-type EGFR. Expression levels of several genes from this list were validated by quantitative RT-PCR using the same RNA samples.

DESIGN
Total RNA expression profiling was performed by MBL Co., Ltd. RNA was isolated and purified from WT-EGFR– and Mut-EGFR– expressing NIH3T3 cells using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Two independent experiments were performed in obtaining T7-cDNA for each sample.
