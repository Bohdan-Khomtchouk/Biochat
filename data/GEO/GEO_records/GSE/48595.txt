TITLE
Expression data analysis of murine pulmonary cryptococcosis induced by C. gattii

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous investigation indicated that high-virulence C. gattii (C. gattii TIMM 4097) tend to reside in the alveoli, whereas low-virulence C. gattii (C. gattii TIMM 4903) tend to be washed out from the alveoli and move into the central side of the respiratory system. To test this hypothesis, we performed microarray assay.

DESIGN
C. gattii TIMM 4097 and C. gattii TIMM 4903 were prepared for the study. The mice were anesthetized and the spore suspension was intratracheally injected into each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 15 days after the infection and then examined. Lung of the mice infected with C. gattii TIMM 4097 and C. gattii TIMM 4903 and normal controls were obtained (n=3, respectively. RNA targets preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using GeneChip(R) 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). One hundred nanograms of total RNA were converted into double-stranded cDNA template for transcription. In vitro transcription synthesized amplified RNA (aRNA) and incorporated a biotin-conjugated nucleotide. After purification and fragmentation of aRNA, 12.5 ug of them was hybridized to GeneChip(R) Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix).The Probe Array was scanned using a GeneChip(R) Scanner 3000 7G
