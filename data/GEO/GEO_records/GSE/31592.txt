TITLE
Expression data from EMRSA-15 treated with and without manuka honey

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit growth in EMRSA-15 by inhibiting cell division, the mode of actin is currently unclear. We used microarrays to detail the difference in global gene expresson following treatment of cells with honey. We identified distinct classes of up and down regulated genes

DESIGN
EMRSA-15 were harvested 4 hours after exposure to treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Control and honey treated cells were investigates, three biological replicates were used for each sample.

PLATFORM
