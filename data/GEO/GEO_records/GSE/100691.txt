TITLE
Expression data from GFP- or GFP Satellite alpha-transfected human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE19

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin is divided into euchromatin and heterochromatin based on differential compaction during interphase, with heterochromatin being highly condensed, existing in transcriptional inert conformation. Embedded within heterochromatin is a group of highly repetitive DNA sequences, referred to as satellite DNAs that give rise to non-coding satellite RNAs. Satellite DNA is thought to be maintained in a transcriptionally silenced state by the repressive H3K9me3 mark. However, aberrant satellite transcription can cause heterochromatin disorganization and genome instability, which have been linked to carcinogenesis. In order to study the function of heterochromatic satellite in retinal pigmental epithelia (RPE) cell, we systematically investigated transcriptome alterations in the presence of heterochromatin destabilization induced by satellite Î± overexpression in APRE19 cell line, a widely used human RPE cell line.

DESIGN
ARPE19 cells were transfected with GFP or GFP satellite alpha plasmid. Each transfection was performed in triplicates.GFP transfection was considered as control group.
