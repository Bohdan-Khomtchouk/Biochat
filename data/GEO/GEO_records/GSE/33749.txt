TITLE
Ypt1 IPs

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast strains expressing either GST-tagged or untagged Ypt1 were grown in either normal media or in media treated with 10mM DTT, to induce UPR A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments. GeneticModification: GST tagged/untagged YPT1 Media: DTT present/absent in media
