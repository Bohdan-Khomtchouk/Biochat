TITLE
RNA-seq of human fibroblasts during replicative senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Senescent human fibroblasts were compared to young proliferating fibroblasts. Five different cell lines were compared. Illumina sequencing (HiSeq2000) was applied to generate 50bp single-end reads.

DESIGN
48 samples: 3 biological replicates for each group: young proliferating and senescent BJ cells;  young proliferating and senescent Wi-38 cells;  young proliferating and senescent IMR-90 cells; 5 population doubling from young proliferating to senescent cell for HFF and MRC-5 cells
