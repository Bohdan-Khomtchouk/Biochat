TITLE
Identification of Eda targets during Meibomian gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eda signaling plays critical role for Meibomian gland dvelopment, however, the crosstalk of Eda with other signaling is largly unknown.  By comparing expreession profilings between wild-type and Eda mutant Tabby eyelids,  we identified Dkk4 and Lrp6 highly expressed during mouse Meibomian gland development.

DESIGN
Total RNAs isolated from microdissected wild-type and Tabby eyelids were profiled with Agilent 44K NIA mouse microarrays.
