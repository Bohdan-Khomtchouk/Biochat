TITLE
Clustered regulatory signals at nucleosome-depleted regions punctuate a constant nucleosomal landscape in Schizosaccharomyces pombe [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Mononucleosomal DNA analysis of atf1D and pcr1D mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and transcription analysis of exponential wild type 972 h-, atf1D, pcr1D and mitotic diploid pat1.114, and synchronous diploid pat1.114 at 0h, 3h and 5h into meiosis

DESIGN
Mononucleosomal DNA vs. genomic input DNA in wildtype 972 h-, atf1D and pcr1D mutants of S. pombe was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0FR tiling microarrays (GPL7715). Total RNA for genome-wide transcription analysis from exponential wild type 972 h-, atf1D, pcr1D and mitotic diploid pat1.114 cells, and from synchronous diploid pat1.114 at 0h, 3h and 5h into meiosis was hybridized to the same microarrays.
