TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the biological effects of AGO2 downregulation on the expression of miRNAs in human NSCLC cells. Using AGO2 siRNA as a positive control, we overexpressed miR-138 in H1299 cells to observe changes in the miRNA profile using an miRNA microarray assay.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from H1299 cells transfected with NC, AGO2 siRNA or miR-138  for 48h. Their microRNAs expression profiles were investigated using  LCSciences Human miRNA Array platform (LCSciences, Houston, TX; Sanger mirBase Release 19.0).
