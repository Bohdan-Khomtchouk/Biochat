TITLE
Artemisinic Acid Production Stress in Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have enginereed S. cerevisiae to produce high titers of Artemisinic acid, an anti-malarial drug precursor. Here we compare the gene expression profiles of the producer strain (EPY330) and a strain in which the last enzyme of the pathway (CYP71AV1, AMO) was inactivated by a point mutation (EPY338).
