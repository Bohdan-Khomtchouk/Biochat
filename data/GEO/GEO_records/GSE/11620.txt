TITLE
Artemisinic Acid Production Stress in Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have enginereed S. cerevisiae to produce high titers of Artemisinic acid, an anti-malarial drug precursor. Here we compare the gene expression profiles of the producer strain (EPY330) and a strain in which the last enzyme of the pathway (CYP71AV1, AMO) was inactivated by a point mutation (EPY338).

DESIGN
5 independent clones of each strain were precultured and inoculated in galactose-inducing medium for production. Each clone was harvested after 24, 48 and 72h of induction and total RNA was extracted. RNA from replicate clones was pooled in equal proportions and used for labeling and hybridization of 4 or 5 replicate slides for each time point.
