TITLE
SNP array data of breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide study of LOH and copy number changes associated with breast cancer, their subtypes and their clinical outcome including response to chemotherapy in women sufferred from breast cancinomas. Mapping chromosome 8q22 copy gain associated with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer and discovery of 8q22 genes relevant to specific drug resistance.

DESIGN
Affymetrix GenChip 10K SNP Xba131 arrays were used according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from breast cancer cells enriched by needle microdissection and from paired peripheral blood samples in 50 breast tumors of high grade. Copy number analysis using dChip software was performed to identify poor outcome-associated chromosomal amplification and to correlate with gene expression.
