TITLE
mRNA degradation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis under aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Transcription was arrested using 50 ug/ul of rifampin leaving RNA degradation as the sole vector responsible for mRNA abundance. mRNA half-lives were calculated from the decay of signal intensity from T0.

DESIGN
Four replicates were sampled after 0, 5 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes of mRNA decay for a total of 24 arrays.
