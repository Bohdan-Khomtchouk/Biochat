TITLE
Expression data of ahg2-1, ahg2-1abi1-1, ahg2-1sid2-2, and WT Arabidopsis plants grown under normal growth conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis ABA hpersensitive germination2-1 mutant shows an enhanced sensitivity to ABA. This mutant has higher levels of endogenous ABA. This mutant also exhibited SA hypersensitivity and dwarf phenotype. Regarding SA hypersensitivity, ahg2-1 exhibits higher endogenous SA level and an enhanced resistance to pathogenic bacteria. Since AHG2 encodes the Arabidopsis polyA specific ribonuclease that is involved in mRNA degradation, presumably abnormal accumulation of some mRNAs confers the unique phenotype. Transcriptome analyses are expected to offer information on the target of AHG2. In order to eliminate secondary effects of higher levels of ABA and SA, ahg2-1abi1-1 and ahg2-1sid2-2 double mutants were also examined. The transcriptome data revealed that; ahg2-1 confers unique gene expression profiles, ABA and SA affect the expression profiles of this mutant but many genes are independent of those plant hormone responses. Comparing with expression profiles of other mutants indicated that the ahg2-1 might affect mitochondrial function. Keywords: strain comparison, ABA, SA

DESIGN
To investigate the whole genome transcription profiles of an ABA and SA hypersensitive mutant ahg2-1, transcriptome analysis for wild type, ahg2-1, ahg2-1abi1-1, ahg2-1sid2-2 plants were conducted. The plants of those lines were grown on MS-pplante containing 0,2% sucrose for three weeks under normal conditions. Comparing the data among those four lines, the direct targets of the ahg2-1 mutation were analyzed using R. In addition, the deduced data were compared with transcriptome data of various mutants or stimuli deposited in public database.
