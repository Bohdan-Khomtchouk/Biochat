TITLE
Removable insulator facilitates higher-order chromatin remodeling and selective gene expression in the HOXA locus via the retinoic acid signaling [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin insulators partition the genome into the functional units to control gene expression especially in complex chromosomal regions. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an insulator-binding protein which functions for transcriptional regulation and higher-order chromatin formation. Here we report that a removable CTCF insulator is responsible for the retinoic acid (RA)-mediated higher-order chromatin remodeling and selective gene expression in the human HOXA gene locus. Our detailed chromatin analyses characterized multiple CTCF-enriched sites and RA-responsive enhancers in this locus. These regulatory elements and transcriptionally silent HOXA genes were closely positioned under the basal condition. Notably, upon the RA signaling, the transcription factor RAR/RXR induced the loss of an adjacent CTCF binding and changed the higher-order chromatin conformation of the overall locus, establishing transcriptionally active, poised and repressive domains that were separated by stably localizing CTCF insulators. This study uncovers that removable insulator spatiotemporally switches higher-order chromatin and multiple gene activities at the chromosomal domain levels, via the cooperation of CTCF and key transcription factors.
