TITLE
Nemaline myopathy mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms implicated in this mouse model of nemaline myopathy, and to further compare the molecular disease response in different skeletal muscles. For this purpose, snap frozen skeletla muscle specimens from wild type and transgenic for alpha tropomyosin slow mice were studied. Five different muscle types were used (diaphragm, plantaris, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemus). Mice were sacrificed between 7 and 10 months. RNA pools from 3-5 animals were created and each pool was hybridized to a U74Av2 Affymetrix GeneChip. Datasets from 36 GeneChips were included in this study. Keywords: disease mouse model analysis
