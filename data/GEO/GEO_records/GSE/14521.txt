TITLE
Late response to boron toxicity in barley leaves

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Barley1 GeneChip was used to investigate transcriptome changes associated with boron (B) toxicity in a sensitive barley cultivar (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Hamidiye). Eight day old aseptically grown seedlings were subjected to 5 or 10 mM boric acid (B(OH)3) treatments for 5 days and expression profiles were determined with DNA microarrays using total RNA from leaf tissues. Surface sterilized seeds were aseptically germinated and grown on half strength Hoagland’s solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950) (pH 5.8) solidified with Phytagel® for 8 days at 23±2ºC with 16 h light (400 µmol m–2 s–1) and 8 h dark photo-cycle with 70% relative humidity. Seedlings were transferred to sterile hydroponic cultures for B treatment, which was applied immediately after transfer as half strength Hoagland’s solution containing either 5 mM B(OH)3 (5B) or 10 mM B(OH)3 (10B) for another 5 days under the same physical conditions. Control (C) groups were transferred to half strength Hoagland’s solution without extra B(OH)3.   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Mehmet Tufan OZ.
