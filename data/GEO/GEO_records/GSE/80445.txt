TITLE
ChIP-seq-based analysis of differential K27me3 coverage in neuroblastoma cell lines treated with epigenetic drugs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The impact of drugs inhibiting DNA methylation (5-aza-2'-deoxycytodine, DAC) and EZH2 (EPZ-6438) on H3K27me3 coverage was analyzed in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Parallel analyses investigated associated changes in RNA expression and DNA methylation.

DESIGN
The neuroblastoma cell lines Be(2)-C and IMR5-75 were treated with a combination of DAC and EPZ-6438. Controls were treated with solvent (DMSO). H3K27me3 ChIP seq was done to investigate treatment-related changes of this mark. In addition, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP seq was done in DMSO treated samples to identify putative regulatory regions.
