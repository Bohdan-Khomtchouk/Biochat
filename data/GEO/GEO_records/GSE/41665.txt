TITLE
Effects of OVA challenge in mouse model of asthma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Challenge with ovalbumin antigen is a common model for asthma in mice. We sought to identify the gene expression differences in lung tissue in naïve and OVA-sensitized mice, in response to OVA challenge.

DESIGN
Naïve and OVA-sensitized animals were challenged with OVA antigen and sacrificed at 0h, 2h, 6h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h and 168h post-challenge time points. At each time point, 8 animals were sacrificed.
