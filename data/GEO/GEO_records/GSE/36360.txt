TITLE
The effect of over-expression of PRR5-VP in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PRR5 transcription factor acts in the circadian clock system. To elucidate regulated genes by PRR5, Chimeric protein PRR5-VP, which activates direct target genes of PRR5, was over-expressed in Col-0. Microarray analsysis was performed using these plants with Affymetrix ATH1 genechip.

DESIGN
PRR5-VP expressing plants and its parental plants (accession Col-0, described as Wild) were grown under 12 hr light / 12 hr dark conditions, and harvested at ZT6(6 hr after light on), ZT12, and ZT18
