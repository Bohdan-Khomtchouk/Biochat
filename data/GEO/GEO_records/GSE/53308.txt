TITLE
Whole genome transcript profiling upon 4 days of salt treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our study identified long term salt stress treatment to induce symptoms similar to developmental senescence. In order to identify possible crosstalk components shared between developmental and salt-triggered senescence. We first obtained the expression profile of Arabidopsis leaves under the condition of salt-induced senescence (4 days) and then compared it with the transcriptome of developmental leaf senescence.

DESIGN
Wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were grown hydroponically and treated with or without 150mM NaCl and harvested after 4 days of treatment.
