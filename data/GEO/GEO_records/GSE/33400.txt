TITLE
Mapping barley genes to chromosome arms by transcript profiling of wheat-barley ditelosomic chromosome addition lines

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
We utilized the Barley1 Affymetrix GeneChip for comparative transcript analysis of Betzes barley, Chinese Spring wheat, and Chinese Springâ€“Betzes ditelosomic chromosome addition lines to physically map barley genes to their respective chromosome arm locations.  We mapped barley genes to chromosome arms (1HS, 2HS, 2HL, 3HS, 3HL, 4HS, 4HL, 5HS, 5HL, 7HS, and 7HL) based on their transcript levels in the ditelosomic addition lines.     ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Hatice Bilgic.
