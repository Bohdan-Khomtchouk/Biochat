TITLE
Expression profiling of Atm deficient murine thymic lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find genes deregulated in the pathogenisis of T-cells in Atm deficient mice, we performed expression profiling of Atm deficient thymic lymphomas, wildtype thymi and Atm deficient thymi without macroscopic enlargement, representing an intermediate stage in the process of tumorigenisis. Keywords: genetic modification, disease state analysis
