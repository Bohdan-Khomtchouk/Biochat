TITLE
CD4 on human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the efffects of ligating CD4 expressed by primary human peripheral blood monocytes with soluble MHC Class II.

DESIGN
3 replicates are included. Fresh blood monocytes, obtained through negative selection via magnetic activted cell sorting (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA), from three separate individual donors were treated with RPMI-1640 medium alone or with medium containing sMHC II (1 Î¼g/ml) for three hours. Cells were harvested and RNA purified using the RNeasy procedure (Qiagen). RNA was then analyzed by the UCLA Clinical Microarray Core Laboratory using the Human U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affimetrix). Data was analyzed using Dchip software. Visual inspection did not find any potential outliers or suspect areas. Data across all groups were normalized using the PM/MM difference.
