TITLE
Gene expression in lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, and lethal interstitial lung disease. It is characterized by extracellular matrix deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and accumulation. Fibroblasts from normal or UIP histology were cultured and analyzed. Keywords: Fibroblasts from normal histology lung tissue or UIP histology lung tissue

DESIGN
Five samples of primary human lung fibroblasts were obtained from explanted lungs of patients with Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and three samples of primary normal human lung fibroblasts were acquired from normal histololgy lung tissues of organ donors. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Reviews Board (IRB). Total RNA was extracted and used as a template to generate double-stranded cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA, as recommended by the manufacturer of the arrays. Fragmented cRNA was hybridized to Codelink Uniset I slides. After hybridization, arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-AlexaFluor 647. The arrays were scanned using a Genepix 4000B microarray scanner. Images were analyzed using Codelink expression II analysis suite, and visually inspected for defects and quality control parameters as recommended by the manufacturer.
