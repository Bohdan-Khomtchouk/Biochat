TITLE
Expression data from leaf of plant overexpressing OsXa5 in japonica rice (cv. Ishikari-shiroge (I-S))

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A candidate gene was cloned and overexpressed to explore its potential function in bacterial blight (BB) resistance. Due to it was the susceptible allele of xa5 gene in rice, it was designated as OsXa5. We used microarrays to detail the global reprogram of gene expression in OsXa5-overexpressing plants.

DESIGN
To find out pathways and genes related to this candidate gene, microarray analysis were carried out with OsXa5-overexpressing plants. Three independent replicates were performed for overexpressing plants, and the wild type plants (japonica rice cv. Ishikari-shiroge) were used as control.
