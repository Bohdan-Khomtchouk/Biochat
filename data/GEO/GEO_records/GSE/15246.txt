TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Themis-deficient thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determine the biochemical cause of impaired development of Themis-deficient thymocytes.

DESIGN
We isolated three thymocyte populations (three populations: CD4+CD8+CD5loCD69lo, CD4+CD8+CD5+CD69+, and CD4+CD8-CD24hiH2Klo) from Themis-deficient and WT mice. 8 or 9 individual biological replicates were analyzed for each population. An aliquot of cDNA from each sample was pooled and used as a reference.
