TITLE
Transcript profiling of soybean msh1 RNAi transgenic lines

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The soybean msh1 RNAi transgenic line show various growth phenotype. We use microarray analysis to characterize gene expression pattern for two of the phenotypes - variegation and stunted growth.

DESIGN
Wild type and msh1 RNAi variegated and stunted tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.
