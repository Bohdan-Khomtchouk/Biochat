TITLE
Gene expression profile of VIN lesions in comparison to controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to understand the molecular mechanism behind Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN), we have analyzed the gene expression profile of VIN lesions in comparison to controls. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Nine VIN and 10 control samples were collected. RNA of each sample was isolated and analyzed using Affymetrix Human U133plus2 GeneChips.
