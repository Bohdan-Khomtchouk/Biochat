TITLE
Expression data from heart muscle of cardiac-specific caspase-3 and -7 knockout and wild type newborn and young mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Caspases, proteolytic enzymes involved in cell death could play a role independent of cell death in the developing heart in this datasheet we include the expression data obtained from dissected heart muscle (ventricle) of wild type mice and mice knockout for caspase-3,-7

DESIGN
24 samples. genotypes: wild type and cardiac-specific conditional caspase-3 and -7 KO. Age: 1-2-day-old; 30-day-old (aprox 3 male, 3 female/genotype and age).
