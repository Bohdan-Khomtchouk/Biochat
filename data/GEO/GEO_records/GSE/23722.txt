TITLE
Rapid SIV Env-specific mucosal and serum antibody induction augments cellular immunity in protecting immunized, elite-controller macaques against high dose heterologous SIV challenge

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Goal of this study was to assess the levels of protection and investigate cellular, humoral, and mucosal immune correlates on the functional and gene transcriptional levels in elite-controller macaques following high dose SIV challenge.

DESIGN
Three experimental, post SIV smE660 challenge macaque jejunal samples were individually compared to four pre SIV smE660 challenge baseline samples.
