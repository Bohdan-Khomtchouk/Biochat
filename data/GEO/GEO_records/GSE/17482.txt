TITLE
Gene expression profiles regulated by Stat5a/b vs. Stat3 in human prostate cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the molecular changes that promote viability and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells is critical for the development of improved therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer. Stat5a/b and Stat3 are both constitutively active in locally-confined and advanced prostate cancer, and both transcription factors have been reported to be critical for the viability and growth of prostate cancer cells. We used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles regulated by Stat5a/b vs. Stat3 in human prostate cancer cells.
