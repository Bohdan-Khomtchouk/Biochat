TITLE
Effects of gentamycin on gene expression of kidney in SD rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression profile of genamycin induced nephrotoxicity in a time-series aspect, SD rats were administrated once daily with saline, genamycin 80 mgkg for 28 consecutive days by intramuscular injection folled by 28 days recovery. Kidney samples were collected for microarray analysis and histological examination. There were 4360 and 4323 regulated genes for females and males, respectively, however, the overlapping expression genes coregluated at each time point were few, with 2 for females and 12 for males. By Principle Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster, the gene expression patterns were apparently associated with the disease stage of the nephrotoxicity,while GO Annotation showed the biological processes were specific to each course of this nephrotoxicity.Our studymapped the different gene expression patterns at the initiation, development and recovery stage of gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity

DESIGN
Gene expression in kidney from SD rats administrated once daily with saline or 80 mg/kg genamycin by intramuscular injection for 28 consecutive days follwed by 28 days recovery were measured using Aglient Rat Whole Genome 4*44 k array

PLATFORM
GPL7294 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Probe Name version)
