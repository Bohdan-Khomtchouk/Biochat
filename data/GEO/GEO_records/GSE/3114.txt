TITLE
ILS/ISS cerebellum baseline comparison

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inbred Long-Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short-Sleep (ISS) mice exhibit a large difference in a number of alcohol and drug related behaviors. This study examined the expression levels of transcripts in these strains in the cerebellum, which is a major target of ethanolâ€™s actions in the CNS, in order to find differentially expressed candidate genes for these phenotypes. Cerebellum was specifically chosen due to the fact that Purkinje cell sensitivity to ethanol in these strains is highly correlated to " sleep time " , the measure of ethanol sensitivity used with these strains. Naive mice were used because differences in sensitivity are observed upon initial exposure to ethanol. Keywords: cerebellum, naive, untreated, ethanol sensitivity

DESIGN
Expression was assayed with arrays manufactured using the NIA Mouse 15K clone set. Three independant RNA pools were used for hybridization.  Each pool contained total RNA from 5 ILS and 5 ISS mice.  No individuals were used in more than one pool.
