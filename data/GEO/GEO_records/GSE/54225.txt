TITLE
2',3,5-Trimethoxychalcone (MC-23)-induced gene expression in MiaPaCa2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
2',3,5-Trimethoxychalcone (MC-23) triggers apoptosis independently of p53 in MiaPaCa2 cells. To understand the mechanism of action of MC-23, we analysed the gene expression profiles in MiaPaCa2 cells treated with 10 μM MC-23 for 6, 12, or 24 h using the Agilent human 44K oligonucleotide V2 microarray. Out of the 34,127 genes in the array, MC-23 upregulated ~3% and downregulated. Notably, a large number of genes associated with apoptosis (such as BAX, BAK), chaperones (such as HSPA1/HSP70, HSPA5/GRP78/BiP), and the unfolded protein response (such as IRE1α, CHOP/DDIT3/GADD153, XBP1, ATF4, ATF6) were highly up-regulated by MC-23 treatment, suggesting that ER stress is associated with MC-23-induced apoptosis.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profile was measured at 6, 12, and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 10 μM MC-23 in MiaPaCa2 cells. Three independent experiments were performed at each time using different experiments.
