TITLE
Egr1 deficiency induces browning of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced strand-specific rRNA-depleted librairies performed from total RNAs isolated from subcutaneous inguinal fat pads of three 2-week-old wild-type female mice and three 2-week-old Egr1-deficient female mice.
