TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild barley (H. vulgare ssp spontaneum) after pathogen inoculation

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum, accession Shechem 12-32, was    submitted to 4 experimental treatments (C. sativus (spot blotch), P.    hordei (leaf rust), and water and oil controls) to examine gene    transcription differences triggered by biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic    pathogens.  Inoculated plants were arranged in a split plot design.     Samples were collected at 12, 24, 36, & 48 hours after inoculation. A    total of 48 samples (4 treatments x 4 time points x 3 replicates) were    subjected to GeneChip analysis.
