TITLE
Microarray expression in whole brain of Hfe-/-xTfr2mut (double mut) vs wildtype (wt) AKR mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes were studied in the brain of 13 week male AKR mice with disruption of two iron regulatory genes, hemochromatosis Hfe and transferrin receptor 2 (Tfr2) compared to age and gender matched wildtype controls. The characterization of these mice is developed by Delima et al. 2012 (Delima, R. D., A. C. G. Chua, J. E. E. Tirnitz-Parker, E. K. Gan, K. D. Croft, R. M. Graham, J. K. Olynyk and D. Trinder (2012). Disruption of hemochromatosis protein and transferrin receptor 2 causes iron-induced liver injury in mice. Hepatology 56(2): 585-593.)

DESIGN
Male mice (n=4 per group) were maintained ad libitum on a standard diet containing approximately 0.02% iron. To maximize iron status, Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mice were switched to an iron-supplemented diet containing 2% carbonyl iron  for three weeks prior to sacrifice at 13 weeks of age. Brain hemispheres were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.
