TITLE
Characterization of three Epithelial Ovarian Cancer cell lines resistant to cisplatin (microRNA).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents the gynecologic cancer with the highest mortality rate. Despite a high initial response to chemotherapy, the majority of patients with advanced EOC relapses and subsequently develops chemoresistance that results in treatment failure and death of the patient. AIM: we have generated an isogenic model of PT-resistance in a panel of 3 EOC cell lines. microRNA profiling was used to identify new molecular pathway that regulate chemoresistance.

DESIGN
microRNA experiments were performed in 3 Epithelian Ovarian Cancer cell lines Platinum-resistant vs their parental, with Agilent platform according to Agilent protocol for microRNA profile. Bioinformatics analyses were performed by Gene Springs

PLATFORM
GPL20157 Agilent-041686 Unrestricted Human miRNA Microarray (miRNA_ID version)
