TITLE
Time course of the mRNA expression in wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich medium (labeling:ENZO)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to observe altered expression profile of wild-type T. thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TT) medium at 70Â°C. we analyzed time-dependent mRNA expression profile of the total mRNA from the strain, which corresponds the logarithmic phase to the early stationary phase.
