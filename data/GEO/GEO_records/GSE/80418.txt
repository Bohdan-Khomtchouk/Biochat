TITLE
Abnormalities in hair follicles of Pla2g2e knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pla2g2e is dominantly expressed in hair follicles. Microarray gene profiling showed modest changes in the steady-state expression of a subset of skin genes.

DESIGN
Pla2g2e knockout mice and littermate controls (C57BL/6 background); 33-day old; skin; pooled from 4 mice for each genotype.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
