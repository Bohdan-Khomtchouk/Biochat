TITLE
The genes affected by Triptolide in activated  mouse primary T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Triptolide possesses immunosuppressive activity and its efficacy is commonly believed to be related to the suppression of T cells. However, the underlying mechanism is still not well documented and most of the previous study adopted tumor cell lines of immune system as model cells in mechanism research, these cellsâ€™ signal transduction pathway can not reflect the real situation of immune system. In this study, we investigated the immunosuppressive mechanism of triptolide on T cell activation and proliferation using mouse primary T lymphocytes. These effects were analyzed along with activation of the TCR and AP-1 pathway. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying stimulation and triptolide treatment.

DESIGN
Mouse primary T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies treated with triptolide or not treated with triptolide were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
