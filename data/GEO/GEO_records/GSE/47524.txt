TITLE
DNA damage responsive microRNAs misexpressed in human cancer regulate chemotherapy sensitivity (lung cancer cell lines)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA damage response (DDR) is a cellular process that protects the genetic information against DNA damage and inhibits malignant transformation.  Tumor cells are characterized by an aberrant DDR, which is exploited by genotoxic chemotherapy. However, cancer cells are able to develop drug resistance, for example by modulation of the DDR. Although the regulation of the DDR has been extensively studied, not much is known about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we describe an approach to specifically identify DDR miRNAs in human primary epithelial cells that also play a role in tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapy in corresponding cancer cells.

DESIGN
The miRNA expression profile was determined of 12 lung cancer cell lines.
