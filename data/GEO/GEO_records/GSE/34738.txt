TITLE
Characterization of exosomes from highly metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma line: ASML and a CD44v kd of ASML based on their miRNA content

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparing the miRNA profile of exosomes from ASML vs ASML CD44v kd pancreatic adenocarcinoma line revealed that the expression level of 33 from the 40 most abundant miRNA differed significantly between ASMLwt and ASML-CD44vkd exosomes

DESIGN
In this study tumor cell exosomes, deemed important for intercellular communication were analysed for their miRNA content. Exosomes from a highly metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, ASML and from a CD44v kd of ASML were used for RNA preparation using Trizol reagent, and the total RNA was sent to Genomics core facility,EMBL, Heidelberg for miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.11.0 - hsa, mmu & rno
