TITLE
Genome-wide identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human heart: gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In recent years genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous chromosomal loci associated with various electrocardiographic traits and cardiac arrhythmia predisposition. A considerable fraction of these loci lie within inter-genic regions. Trait-associated SNPs located in putative regulatory regions likely exert their effect by modulating gene expression. Hence, the key to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac traits is to interrogate variants for association with differential transcript abundance by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. In this study we conducted an eQTL analysis of human heart. To this end, left ventricular mycardium samples from non-diseased human donor hearts were hybridized to Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChips for genotyping (n = 129) and Illumina Human HT12 Version 4 BeadChips (n = 129) for transcription profiling.

DESIGN
To assess the gene expression levels of 129 human donor hearts from the study, genome-wide transcription profiling was carried out using Illumina Human HT12 Version 4 Beadchips interrogating over 47,000 unique transcripts (total of 47323 probes including controls).
