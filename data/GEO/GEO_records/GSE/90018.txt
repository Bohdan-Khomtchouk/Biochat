TITLE
Analysis of histone methylation in the neocortex of Phf8 KO mice [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf8 is a histone demethylase with links to human behavior. To gain insight into Phf8's function in the brain, we have performed ChIP-seq for the histone methylation marks H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me2 and H3K9me2.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed on neuronal chormatin isolated from the neocortex of WT and KO mice.
