TITLE
Chromatin remodeling during in vivo neural stem cells differentiating to neurons in early Drosophila embryos [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of affinity-purified nuclei of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons from the Drosophila embryos.

DESIGN
Expression profiles were generated from NSC and neuron nuclei, which isolated from 5–7h-old Sca-Gal4/cyo;UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap and 12–14h-old Elav-Gal4;UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap D. melanogaster embryos using the method INTACT (Steinner et al., 2012). We examined the changes in gene expression during Drosophila embryonic neuron differentiation.
