TITLE
RNA Sequencing of Pinometostat Sensitive and Resistant Paired Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MLL-r cell lines KOPN-8 and NOMO-1 were cultured with pinometostat to derive treatment emergent resistant pools. RNA sequencing was performed on the resistant pools to generate hypotheses around mechanisms of resistance

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of KOPN-8 and NOMO-1 cell lines treated long term (ie resistant) and short term (sensitive) with pinometostat, along with DMSO matched controls

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
