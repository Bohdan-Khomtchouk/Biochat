TITLE
Identification of differential signaling cues in insulin/IGF1 signaling pathways in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Temproral networks of (phospho)-proteins are constructed and analyzed to infer differential interactions under insulin and IGF1 stimulation.

DESIGN
In total, 134 antibodies are tested in 21 breast cancer cell lines. The experiments are done in triplicate. Three serum-free-condition time points (5min, 24hr, 48hr) and six stimulation time points (5min, 10min, 30min, 6hr, 24hr, and 48hr) are obtained with either 10 nM IGF1 or 10 nM insulin stimulation.
