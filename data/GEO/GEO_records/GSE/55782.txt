TITLE
Core promoter factor TAF9B controls neuronal gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Characterize the role of the coactivator subunit TAF9b during differentiation of embryonic stem cells into motor neurons as well in mouse newborn spinal column tissues.

DESIGN
RNA-seq comparing WT and TAF9B KO mouse ES cells differentiated into motor neurons. RNA-seq comparing WT and TAF9B KO mouse newborn spinal column tissues. ChIP-seq mapping TAF9b and RNA Pol II binding sites in in vitro differentiated motor neurons.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
