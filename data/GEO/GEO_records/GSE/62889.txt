TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile of the Tet-On HCT116 inducible cell line that express either the human HNF4α2 or HNF4α8 under control of Doxycycline (DOX) [RNAseq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Aim of the study is to identify functional differences between the P1 and P2-HNF4α isoforms. To do this, we generated Tet-On inducible lines that express either the human (P1) HNF4α2 or (P2) HNF4α8 under control of DOX in the HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Methods: HNF4α2 and Parental lines were induced with 0.3 μg/mL DOX, while HNF4α8 line was induced with either 0.1 or 0.3 μg/mL DOX for 24 hours. Samples were generated by deep sequencing, using the Illumina TruSeq RNA. Result: There were common and unique dysregulated genes identified in the HNF4α2 and HNF4α8 lines (+DOX); more upregulated genes than downregulated genes in both the lines. Conclusion: The functional difference between HNF4α2 and HNF4α8 is that the latter tends to upregulate genes involved in proliferation and anti-apoptosis while HNF4α2 upregulates genes involved in growth suppression and cell death.

DESIGN
Tet-On inducible HCT116 cell (Parental, HNF4α2, and HNF4α8) lines, treated with (0.0, 0.1, or 0.3 μg/mL) DOX for 24 hours, were 50bp pair-ended sequenced in triplicate using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep v2 Kit.
