TITLE
Gene expression profile of murine intestinal epithelial cells after RANKL treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RANKL (receptor acrivator of NFkB ligand) is a member of TNF superfamily cytokines. In the gastrointestinal tract, RANKL is expressed in the stromal cells of Peyer's patches, and involved in the development of the specialized intestinal epithelial cells, called M cells. To identify the genes involved in M-cell development, we treated BALB/c mice with recombinant GST-RANKL. After RANKL-treatment, epithelial cells were isolated from small intestine, and used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Total of 15 samples were analyzed. We generated the Excel sheet for comparing gene expression.
