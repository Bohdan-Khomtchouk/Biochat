TITLE
Expression profiles of barley chromosome addition lines of common wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Barley contains a much higher content of bioactive substances than wheat. In order to investigate the effect of genome interaction between barley and wheat on phytosterol content, we used a series of barley chromosome addition lines of common wheat. The wheat 38k-microarray was utilized for screening of genes with expression levels specifically increased by an additive effect or synergistic action between wheat and barley chromosomes. We determined the overall expression pattern of genes related to phytosterol biosynthesis in wheat and in each addition line. Together with determining the phytosterol levels of wheat, barley and each addition line, we assess the critical genes in the phytosterol pathway that can be expressed to promote phytosterol levels.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels of each barley chromosome addition line of common wheat were compared to that of common wheat. Total RNA samples were isolated from the 2-week-old seedling leaves. The experiments were replicated three times for each addition line using independent samples.
