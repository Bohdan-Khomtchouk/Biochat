TITLE
Epigenetic mechanisms underlying maternal diabetes-associated risk of congenital heart disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Maternal hyperglycemia increases the risk of CHD and is further sensitized by haploinsufficiency of Notch1 supporting a gene-environment interaction model. To gain insights into chromatin accessible status by which hyperglycemia affects molecular pathways regulating cardiac development, we performed ATAC-seq on embryonic AV cushion mesenchymal cells maintained in normal and high glucose.

DESIGN
ATAC sequencing of mouse embryonic atrioventricular mesenchymal cells in the setting of normoglycemia and hyperglycemia

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
