TITLE
Expression data of S. pombe wild-type and sgo2-deleted strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Gene expression is regulated by various mechanisms. One is gene silencing, which is caused by highly condensed chromatin structure. S. pombe Sgo2 is a protein involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint at centromere. In order to investigate the other functions of Sgo2, we analyzed the effect of Sgo2 deletion  in global gene expressions.

DESIGN
S. pombe cultures (wild-type and sgo2-deletion strains) at log phase were collected and global mRNAs were analyzed.
