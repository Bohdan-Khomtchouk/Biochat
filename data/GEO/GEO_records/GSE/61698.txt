TITLE
Expression data of S. pombe wild-type and sgo2-deleted strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Gene expression is regulated by various mechanisms. One is gene silencing, which is caused by highly condensed chromatin structure. S. pombe Sgo2 is a protein involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint at centromere. In order to investigate the other functions of Sgo2, we analyzed the effect of Sgo2 deletion  in global gene expressions.
