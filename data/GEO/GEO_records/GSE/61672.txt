TITLE
Blood gene expression profiles associated with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prospective epidemiological studies found that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can impair immune function and increase risk for cardiovascular disease or events. Mechanisms underlying the physiological reververations of anxiety, however, are still elusive. Hence, we aimed to investigate molecular processes mediating effects of anxiety on physical health using blood gene expression profiles of 546 community participants. Of these, 179 met the status of controls and 157 cases of anxiety.

DESIGN
We examined genome-wide differential gene expression in anxiety, as well as associations between nine major modules of co-regulated transcripts in blood gene expression and anxiety. There were a total of 546 subjects.
