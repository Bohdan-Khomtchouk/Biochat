TITLE
Expression data from footpad of AIRmax and AIRmin mice submitted to pristane arthritis induction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice selected for high and low acute inflammation were tested for pristane induced arthritis, showing to be susceptible and resistant, respectively. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying arthritis progression during induction and identified distinct classes of differentially expressed genes during this process in the footpad of these mice.

DESIGN
AIRmax (high inflammation) and AIRmin (low inflammation) mouse footpads were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared control and experimental footpads from male and female AIRmax and AIRmin mice on days 0 and 160, respectively. Please note that the AIRmax and AIRmin mice were obtained through bidirectional genetic selection, starting with a genetically heterogeneous founder population (F0) produced by intercrossing eight isogenic strains of mice of independent origins (A/J, DBA/2J, P/J, SWR/J, SJL/J, CBA/J, BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J).
