TITLE
Functional screening implicates miR-371-3p and peroxiredoxin 6 in reversible tolerance to cancer drugs [SPR1108]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acquired resistance to cancer drug therapies almost always occurs in advanced-stage patients even following a significant response to treatment. In addition to mutational mechanisms, various non-mutational resistance mechanisms have now been recognized. We previously described a chromatin-mediated subpopulation of reversibly drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) that is dynamically maintained within a wide variety of tumor cell populations. Here, we explored a potential role for microRNAs in such transient drug tolerance. Functional screening of 879 human microRNAs revealed miR-371-3p as a potent suppressor of drug tolerance. PRDX6 (peroxiredoxin 6) was identified as a key target of miR-371-3p in establishing drug tolerance by regulating PLA2/PKCÎ± activity and reactive oxygen species. PRDX6 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers of multiple tissue origins. These findings implicate miR-371-3p as a suppressor of PRDX6 and suggest that co-targeting of PRDX6 or modulating miR-371-3p expression together with targeted cancer therapies may delay or prevent acquired drug resistance.

DESIGN
PC9 stable cell lines expressing GFP vector or miR-371-3p were generated to study the effect of miR-371-3p in response to erlotinib treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Stable cell lines were treated with DMSO or erlotinib for 24hrs and RNA isolated for analyzing the effect of miR-371-3p on gene expression upon erlotinib treatment.
