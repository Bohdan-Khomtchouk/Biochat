TITLE
Epigenome analysis of DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in normal, abnormal, and globozoospermia sperm genomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine profiling of normal and abnormal, and globozoospermia sperm genomes.Two semen samples were collected from a healthy man and a globozoospermia patient who had consulted a physician at ShengJing Hospital of China Medical University. Other semen samples obtained from two volunteers who were good health generally. 5-hmC enriched genomic DNA libraries were generated following the Illumina protocol for “Preparing Samples for CHIP sequencing of DNA”. 100bp single end sequencing on Illumina Hiseq2000 to get 5-hmC-enriched DNA fragment sequence was performed.

DESIGN
Examination of 5hmC levels in normal, abnormal, and globozoospermia  sperm genomes

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
