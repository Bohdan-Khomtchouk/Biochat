TITLE
Transient expression of CHD5 in KELLY cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss of the tumor suppressor CHD5 frequently occurs during neuroblastoma progression. We used microarray analyses to identify genes that change expression following transient transfection of human CHD5 into KELLY cells

DESIGN
KELLY cells were transiently transfected with the human CHD5 cDNA or the empty vector.  RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
