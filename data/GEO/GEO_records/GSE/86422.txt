TITLE
Airway epithelial cells from smokers treated with myo-inositol or placebo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were obtained as part of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study to determine the effects of myo-inositol in smokers with bronchial dysplasia.  Smokers with greater than 1 site of dysplasia identified by autofluorescence bronchoscopy-directed biopsy were randomly assigned to receive oral placebo or myo-inositol, 9 g once/day for two weeks and then twice/day for 6 months.  Cytologically normal airway epithelial cells were obtained via bronchoscopy from the right or left mainstem bronchus at baseline and 6 months post-treatment with myo-inositol or placebo from 69 study participants (n=138 samples).  The RNA from these samples was isolated and used to prepare libraries for mRNA sequencing.  Subjects were classified by response according to their change in dysplasia rate after 6-months.  Among subjects with a complete response in the myo-inositol arm, there was a significant decrease in a gene expression signature reflective of PI3K activation.

DESIGN
Cytologically normal bronchial airway cells were profiled by mRNA-Seq from 69 phase IIb study participants with bronchial dysplasia before and after 6 months of treatment with oral placebo or myo-inositol.
