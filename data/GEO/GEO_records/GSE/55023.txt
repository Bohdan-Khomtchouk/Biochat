TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in marmosets

ORGANISM
Callithrix jacchus

SUMMARY
The absence of a robust disease model currently hinders the evaluation of countermeasures for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV that results in mild-to-moderate disease has been utilized to describe the pathogenesis of this virus and for the evaluation of therapeutics, the inability to produce uniform disease with substantial virus replication complicates analysis in countermeasure studies. In an attempt to identify a more robust disease model, DPP4 sequences of various non-human primates were aligned. Modeling of the interactions between the receptor binding domain of MERS-CoV and its cognate receptor DPP4 predicted a " good fit " with complete conservation of all of the critical residues. To determine the feasibility of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV disease model, common marmosets were inoculated with MERS-CoV via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes. Marmosets developed signs of moderate to severe illness with progressive serious to severe pneumonia. Progressive gross lesions were evident in animals necropsied at 3, 4 and 6 days post inoculation and two animals were euthanized during the study due to disease severity. This is the first description of a moderate-to-severe, with potentially lethality, disease model of MERS-CoV and as such will have utility for vaccine and other countermeasure efficacy evaluations in addition to further pathogenesis studies.

DESIGN
Lung tissue samples were isolated and sequenced at 3, 4 and 6 days post inoculation. Two animals were euthanized during the study due to disease severity.
