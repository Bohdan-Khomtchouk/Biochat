TITLE
Identification of Gene Networks and Pathways Associated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The underlying change of gene network expression of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) remains elusive. We sought to identify GBS-associated gene networks and signalling pathways by analyzing the transcriptional profile of leukocytes in the patients with GBS.

DESIGN
Quantitative global gene expression microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes was performed on 7 patients with GBS and 7 healthy controls.
