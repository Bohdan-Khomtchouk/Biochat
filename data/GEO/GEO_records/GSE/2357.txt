CFTR dependent response

SUMMARY
Wild-type and dF508 CFTR mutant human bronchial epithelial cells were uninfected or infected for 3 hours at an MOI of 30-50 with P.aeruginosa strain PAO1. Each cell line was tested in 4 replicates.  Each replicate consists of 4 data sets: 2 sets of duplicate spots on 2 arrays. The two arrays in each replicate were dye-swapped  pairs where the opposite dye was used for each sample in the second array. I have called replicates " Rep1, Rep2... " etc. I have indicated duplicates from the same slide as eg. " Slide1A and Slide1B " I have refered to the two arrays used in each replicate as " Slide1 " and " Slide 2 " . Keywords: other
