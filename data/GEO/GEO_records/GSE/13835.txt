TITLE
Smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis-prone and resistant regions of the aorta of C57Bl/6 mice at age of 4 months

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study compared gene expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerosis-prone and atherosclerosis-resistant regions of the aorta of C57Bl/6 mice. In a parallel experiment, both regions were compared in young, plaque-free apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression ( > 2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3). The other 18 genes were all involved in different processes. Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10). These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs of the C57Bl/6 aorta at an atherosclerosis-prone location. This is in agreement with findings in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis-prone regions. It could be due to biomechanical differences, for instance in wall tension or shear stress, or the different embryological origin of SMCs in AA and TA.
