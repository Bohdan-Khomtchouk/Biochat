TITLE
B cell response to IFNa in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed thetranscriptional response to IFNa in activated B cells in vitro. We found robust induction of ISGs as early as 2hrs.

DESIGN
Splenic B cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were activated with LPS(10ug/ml) for 48hrs and thereafter cultured with IFNa (100U/ml) for 2hrs or 8hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
