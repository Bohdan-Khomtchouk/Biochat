TITLE
Cell-autonomous function of Runx1 transcriptionally regulates megakaryocytic maturation in mice (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RUNX1 transcription factor (TF) is a key regulator of megakaryocytic development and when mutated is associated with familial platelet disorder and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD-AML). We used mice lacking Runx1 specifically in megakaryocytes (MKs) to characterize the Runx1-mediated transcriptional program during advanced stages of MK differentiation. Gene expression and chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) of Runx1 and p300 identified functional Runx1-bound MK enhancers. Runx1/p300 co-bound regions showed significant enrichment in genes important for MK and platelet homeostasis. Runx1-bound regions were highly enriched in RUNX and ETS motifs and to a lesser extent in GATA motif. The data provides the first example of genome-wide Runx1/p300 occupancy in maturating FL-MK, unravels the Runx1-regulated program controlling MK maturation in vivo and identifies its bona fide regulated genes. It advances our understanding of the molecular events that upon mutations in RUNX1 lead to the predisposition to familial platelet disorders and FPD-AML.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of mature megakaryocytes taken from fetal livers of megakaryocyte-specific Runx1 knockout mice, using Runx1F/F/Pf4-Cre mice versus control (WT) mice.
