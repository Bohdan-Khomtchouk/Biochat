TITLE
Expression analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hst3hst4 mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The hst3hst4 strain (FY background) has the HST3 and HST4 genes, encoding putative NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate histone 3 K56 acetylation, deleted. Expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays was used to assess the change in the gene expression in this strain in comparison to wild-type under normal growth conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from two independent cultures of the hst3hst4 strain and the wt strain, and was hybridized to microarrays. Gene expression levels of each mutant culture was compared to each wt culture.
