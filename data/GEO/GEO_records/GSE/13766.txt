TITLE
Expression analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hst3hst4 mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The hst3hst4 strain (FY background) has the HST3 and HST4 genes, encoding putative NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate histone 3 K56 acetylation, deleted. Expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays was used to assess the change in the gene expression in this strain in comparison to wild-type under normal growth conditions.
