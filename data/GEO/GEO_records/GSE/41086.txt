TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Nodal versus Activin-derived endoderm from mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular basis of functional differences observed between Nodal versus Activin-derived endoderm, we compared their respective gene expression profiles. Sox17-GFP mouse ES cells were differentiated in the presence of Nodal or Activin for 7 days, after which GFP(+) cells were purified by FACs. Undifferentiated ES cells were also included for comparison as a control. Results indicate that the two endoderm populations are nearly identical at the level of global transcription.  Subtle differences suggest a difference in the degree of endoderm progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from SOX17-GFP (+) mouse ES cells, Sox17-GFP treated with Nodal, Sox17-GFP treated with Activin. Two replicates for each sample;  Sample data table contains average values of two replicates. The non_normalized.txt file contains individual signal values for each replicate.
