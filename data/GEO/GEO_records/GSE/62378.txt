TITLE
Regulatory RNA Apela Is a Component of a Negative Feedback Loop Regulating p53-Mediated Apoptosis in Embryonic Stem Cells (III)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify RNAs that bind to Hnrnpl (hnRNP L) using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay.

DESIGN
p53+/+ mES cells and p53-/- mES cells were untreated or treated with 0.5 uM Adriamycin for 8 hours. RNA immunoprecipitation was performed using Hnrnpl antibody (Bethyl, Cat#: A311-423A). Total RNA was extracted and subject to RNAseq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
