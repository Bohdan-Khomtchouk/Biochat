TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Chronically Inflamed FFPE Placental Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore gene expression changes in chronically inflammed placental tissue

DESIGN
This study compared FFPE tissue with and without chronic placental inflammation, manifested as overlapping chronic chorioamnionitis, chronic villitis of unknown etiology, and chronic deciduitis. RNA expression profiling was conducted on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded placental tissue using Illumina microarrays. To further explore and validate gene expression findings, we conducted immunohistochemical assessment of protein level expression.
