TITLE
CEA SGF:E00013#yap1 aft W303a HU response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of the response to hydroxyurea in a yeast aft1 mutant strain compared to wild-type strain (BY4741 or BY4742 backgrounds). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium containong 200 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 2 hours. Analysis of the response to hydroxyurea in a yeast aft1aft2 mutant strain (Y18aft2d) compared to wild-type strain (CM3260). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium containing 200 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 2 hours. Gene expression changes due to the aft1 mutation were also analysed in absence of HU (BY4741 background). Analysis of mid-term response to hydroxyurea in a yeast wild-type strain (W303a). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium containing 200 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 2 hours. Gene expression changes were analysed compared to the same strain grown in the same medium without HU. Keywords: repeat sample
