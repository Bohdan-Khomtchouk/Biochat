TITLE
Single-cell copy number varation detection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detection of genomic rearrangements from a single cell instead of a population of cells is an emerging research technique with important applications in the study of human fertility, constitutional chromosomal disorders, and tumor progression. Here, we develop a method to improve the detection of single-cell genome-wide copy number variation.

DESIGN
At this study,  7 amplified single cell DNA samples derived from EBV-line [47,XY,+21],   [46,XY,der(20),t(18;20)(p11.21;p13)],  [46,XX,del(18)(p11.21- > pter)],  [46,X,der(X),t(X;14)(q21.1;q12.2)] were analyzed by Agilent 244K array CGH.  For these single cell Agilent 244K array CGH analyses: non-amplified genomic DNA extracted from the blood of a Klinefelter patient (XXY) was used as a reference sample. As a validation, the corresponding non-amplified genomic DNA samples were analyzed by 250K Nsp I SNP arrays (platform GPL3718). Non-amplified genomic DNA extracted from the blood of a Klinefelter patient (XXY) was used as a reference sample for BAC array CGH
