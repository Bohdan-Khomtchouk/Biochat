TITLE
Disruption of Drp1 in the liver protects mice against diet-induced obesity through induction of fibroblast growth factor 21

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) physically interact by close structural juxtaposition, via the mitochondrial-associated ER membrane. Recently, great advances have been made in the understanding of inter-organelle communication between the ER and mitochondria. To clarify the role of mitochondrial dynamics in this communication, we generated mice lacking the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in the liver (Drp1LiKO). While intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in histological changes characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis and fibrosis, reminiscent of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, Drp1LiKO mice showed decreased fat mass and were protected from HFD-induced obesity. Analysis of liver gene expression profiles demonstrated marked elevation of ER stress markers. In addition, we observed increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) through induction of activating transcription factor 4 and X-box binding protein 1, master regulators of the integrated stress response.

DESIGN
Mice were fasted for 17 hours  and then sacrificed. Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified using a SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 platform that contains 39,430 probes (Agilent Technologies).
