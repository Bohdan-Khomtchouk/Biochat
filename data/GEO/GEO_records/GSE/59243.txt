TITLE
Effects of SUV39H1 depletion on gene expression in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were transiently transfected with siRNA against SUV39H1, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase. Several genes were significantly up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transiently transfected with siRNA against SUV39H1 or negative control siRNA. Then total RNA was extracted.
