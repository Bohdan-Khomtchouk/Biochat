TITLE
Response of an alga-associated marine flavobacteria to polysaccharide degradation

ORGANISM
Zobellia galactanivorans

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Zobellia galactanivorans DsijT growing on algal polysaccharides or glucose as a sole carbon source.

DESIGN
A total of 21 samples were analyzed, for 7 growth conditions in independent triplicates. Z. galactanivorans DsijT cells were grown in a marine minimum medium containing either alginate, laminarin, agar, porphyran, kappa-carrageenan or iota-carrageenan as a sole carbon source. Cultures with glucose as a sole carbon source were used as a reference.
