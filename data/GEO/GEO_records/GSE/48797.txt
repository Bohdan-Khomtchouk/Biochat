TITLE
Expression data of mouse developmental T cells (CD4CD8DP, CD4SP and CD8SP) derived from Brd1 deficient thymocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional knock out of Brd1(bromodomain containing 1) in muse developmental T cells (CD4CD8DP, CD4SP and CD8SP) by intercrossing with Tie2-Cre Conditional knock out of Brd1(bromodomain containing 1) in muse MHC class l restricted T cells (CD8SP) by intercrossing with Tie2-Cre and OT-l

DESIGN
Developmental T cells (defined by surface markers: CD4, CD8 and TCRÎ²) derived from control (Tie2-Cre) or Brd1 conditional knock out (Brd1flox/flox, Tie2-Cre) thymocytes were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected to a microarray analysis. CD8SP T cells were also isolated from control (Tie2-Cre, OT-l) or Brd1 conditional knock out (Brd1flox/flox, Tie2-Cre, OT-l) thymocytes intercrossed with OT-l.
