TITLE
Cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells recapitulates embryonic cardiac development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem cells can differentiate in vitro into spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes. The main objective of this study was to investigate cardiogenesis in cultures of differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to determine how closely it mimics in vivo cardiac development. We identified and isolated a population of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) through the use of a reporter DNA construct that allowed the expression of a selectable marker under the control of the Nkx2.5 enhancer. We proceeded to characterize these CPCs by examining their capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and to proliferate. We then performed a large-scale temporal microarray expression analysis in order to identify genes that are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in the CPC population. We determined that the transcriptional profile of the mESC derived CPCs was consistent with pathways known to be active during embryonic cardiac development. We conclude that in vitro differentiation of mESCs recapitulates the early steps of mouse cardiac development. Keywords: embryonic stem cell, differentiation, cardiac progenitor, cardiogenesis
