TITLE
Gene expression profiles of distinct mesenchymal cell populations in Peyer's patches

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to characterize Peyer's patch-resident distinct mesenchymal stromal cells, including marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and M cell-inducer (MCi) cells.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal cells were sorted from Peyer's patches of wild-type mice using flow cytometry (n=5).
