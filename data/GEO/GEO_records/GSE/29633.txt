TITLE
Expression data of sweet orange in response to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection at advanced stage

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB, or greening) is one of the most severe diseases of citrus. Plant disease symptom development is considered to be the consequence of a number of molecular, cellular and physiological changes, and may also be associated with host defense responses. Understanding citrus host response to HLB may contribute to the development of new strategies to control this destructive disease. We performed microarray analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes in sweet orange in response to HLB infection using the Affymetrix GeneChip® citrus genome array.

DESIGN
Two-year-old seedlings of ‘Madam Vinous’ sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) were inoculated by grafting with bud sticks from HLB-diseased, PCR positive sweet orange plants. For mock-inoculated controls, the same types of plants were grafted with bud sticks from HLB-free, PCR negative sweet orange. At 7 months after inoculation, mature leaves were sampled from 3 individual HLB-diseased plants, and healthy leaves from 3 mock-inoculated plants as control. Total RNA was extracted from leaf samples and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
