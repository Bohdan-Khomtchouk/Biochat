TITLE
Expression data from postnatal Plk3 WT and KO animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data investigate the transcriptomic differences in the whole retinas of mice resulting from loss of Polo-like Kinase 3 (Plk3) over various stages of development, including adulthood, postnatal day (P)7, and P0.

DESIGN
To determine transcriptomic differences resulting from Plk3 deficiency, microarrays were performed on retinas isolated from Plk3-KO mice and their WT littermates over various developmental timepoints
