TITLE
Modulation of gene expression by ZNF143, THAP11 and NOTCH1 via overlapping binding sites in mammalian cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the genome wide DNA binding profile of ZNF143 and ICN1 in human and murine cells. We also analyzed the expression profile in human cells after overexpression or knockdown of ZNF143.

DESIGN
To identify ZNF143 targets we performed ChIP-seq on 4 human cells lines and 3 murine cell types. We also identified, by ChIP-seq, ICN1 binding sites in HPB-ALL cells. To identify directly regulated genes by ZNF143, we analyzed, by RNA-seq, the expression profile after knockdown and overexpression of the transcription factor.
