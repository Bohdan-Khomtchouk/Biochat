TITLE
Ncb2 ChIP-chip on Gu4 (azole susceptible, AS) and Gu5 (azole resistant, AR) cells of Candida albicans using polyclonal antibody

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of genome wide binding profile of Ncb2 in azole sensitive (AS, Gu4) and azole resistant (AR, Gu5) clinical isolates of Candida albicans. The goal was to study the role of Ncb2 in acquisition of drug resistance by comparing the binding profiles of Ncb2 in both the isolates.

DESIGN
Agilent two-color ChIP on chip  experiment, Organism: Candida Albicans , Agilent Candida Albicans COC_4X180K chip on ChIP AMADID: 038045 designed by Genotypic Technology Private Limited.

PLATFORM
GPL21335 Agilent-038045 Candida albicans 4X180K array (Probe name version)
