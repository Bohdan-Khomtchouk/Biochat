TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between the CD110+ tumor initiating cells from primary colorectal tumors and their liver metastases.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We  established an in vivo model of organ-specific colorectal cancer metastasis and demonstrated that the CD110+ tumor initiating cells contribute for colorectal liver metastasis. To gain a deeper understanding of its metastatic capacity, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis on the CD110+ tumor cells derived from primary colon xenografts and their matched liver metastases. Results provide important information of the responses of the CD110+ cells during the process of liver colonization.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the CD110+ cells sorted from primary colorectal tumors (CRC102-PT and CRC108-PT) compared to those from the corresponding liver metastases (CRC102-LM and CRC108-LM).
