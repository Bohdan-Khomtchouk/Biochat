TITLE
Characterization of distinct states of mouse naïve and primed pluriopotency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotency of mammalian stem cells is stabilized at different status depending upon the extracellular stimuli of their environment. Now, there is a consensus that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and iPSCs (miPSCs) represent undifferentiated status very close to ground-state of mammalian development when cultured in optimal condition. Since they have not been activated to commit into any lineages, they are stated as “naïve-state stem cells”. In contrast, human ESCs (hESCs), hiPSCs, and mEpiSCs are considered to possess partially differentiated characteristics compared with mESCs and miPSCs. Thus, they are stated as “primed-state stem cells”. Investigation of the prerequisites for establishment of the naïve-state is significantly important to fully understand mammalian development and to extrapolate the technologies developed with mouse ES/iPS cells for human. We used expression data to understand the gene expression profile and identified distinct characteristics on pluripotent state.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic stem cell and epiblast stem cell were traditionally maintained in naïve and primed-state. And also, we obtained converted naïve-state pluripotent stem cell. Characteristics analysis was perfomed to investigate and compare the gene expression profile in three samples.
