TITLE
Gene expression of p53 null vs. p53 wild-type mouse kidneys at embryonic day 15.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray analysis was performed on E15.5 p53+/+ and p53-/- litter-matched kidneys. We have previously shown that p53 is expressed in both UB and MM lineages in the kidney, and that p53-null embryos on C57B6L background exhibit a range of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract such as duplicated ureters, reduced nephron numbers, and compromised nephron progenitor renewal and differentiation. Here our goal was to reveal the p53 transcriptome in mouse embryonic kidneys at E15.5.

DESIGN
This is a two-condition experiment comparing gene expression between p53 null vs. p53 wild-type mouse kidneys at embyronic day 15.5. Three biological replicates (rep1-3) and their dye-swapped experimental replicates are included, in which rep1 has a duplicate and a duplicate dye-swap experiments.
