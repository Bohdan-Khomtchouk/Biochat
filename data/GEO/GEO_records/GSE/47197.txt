SUMMARY
transcriptionnal profiling comparing tumoral and non tumoral part of human liver infected by hepatitis B virus

DESIGN
Expression profiling of induced hepatitis B virus tumor from human liver and expression profiling of hepatitis B virus infected non tumoral part of the liver from french patients Please note that there are 62 raw files (i.e.'AFE_raw_files.tar' linked to the Series records) for 124 samples since two samples were on the same array, one in Cy3 and  one in Cy5. The corresponding raw data file for each sample is indicated in the Sample description field.
