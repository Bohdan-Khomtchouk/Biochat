TITLE
Cooperativity and Equilibrium with FOXA1 Define Androgen Receptor Transcriptional Program [array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies have shown that FOXA1 defines prostatic AR binding events, the underlying mechanisms of which, however, are incompletely understood.

DESIGN
To test whether ectopic AR and FOXA1 can activate AR target genes, we performed adenoviral  of LacZ, AR, FOXA1 or AR+FOXA1 proteins in DU145 cells, followed by microarray analysis of these cells.
