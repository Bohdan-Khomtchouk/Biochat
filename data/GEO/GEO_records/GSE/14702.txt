TITLE
Functional analysis of HSFB transcription factors [22Â°C]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Biological and molecular function of Arabidopsis HSFB transcription factors was studied.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were taken to compare the transcriptome between 35S:HSFB1 plant and wild-type plant. Plants were grown on normal condition in MS agar medium and RNA was extracted from root of 22d-old seedlings. Same experiment was done for 35S:mutHSFB1 plant. Four biological replicates were taken to compare the transcriptome between hsfb1 hsfb2b double knockout plant and wild-type plant. Plants were grown on normal condition in MS agar medium and RNA was extracted from 7d-old whole seedlings.
