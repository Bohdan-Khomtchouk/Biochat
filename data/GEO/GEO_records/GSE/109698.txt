TITLE
Expression of genes in the aortic wall of ApoE–/– and ApoE–/–CKIP-1–/– mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The fold-changes for each gene of ApoE–/– CKIP-1–/– with respect to ApoE–/– mice on a 12-week Western diet  were assessed by using three independent Capital Bio mRNA Array.

DESIGN
Capital Bio Mouse Genome Oligo Array from Capital Corporation was used for the examination of the expression pattern of genes involved in atherosclerosis. By using different arrays, the fold-change for aortic gene of ApoE–/–CKIP-1–/– mice with respect to ApoE–/– mice on a 12-week Western diet was calculated.

PLATFORM
