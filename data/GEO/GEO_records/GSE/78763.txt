TITLE
Fluidigm Biomark 96.96 nanofluidic arrays for qRT-PCR of 93 miRNAs: salivary extracellular vesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Crude extracellular vesicles (EVs) from eight healthy volunteers were separated into 6 fractions based on their densities by using the iodixanol-based density gradient centrifugation method. To determine the distribution of miRNAs among these fractions, quantities of 93 miRNAs were quantified by the TaqMan real time PCR method using the BioMark HD system (Fluidigm) equipped with 96.96 dynamic array (Fluidigm).

DESIGN
Six samples were fractionated from a crude EVs by density gradient centrifugation. Total of 48 samples were prepared from 8 healthy volunteers. Technical replicate of 4 gave 8 x 6 x 4 x 93 = 17,856 data. As control Tris-HCl EDTA buffer (TE) was used.
