TITLE
CDK inhibitor PHA-793887 profiling on A2780

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of the CDK inhibitor PHA-793887 on the A2780 human adenocarcinoma ovary cell line were analysed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
The A2780 cell line was treated with PHA-793887 (CDK-887) for 6 hours at a dose equal to 5 time the IC50. Untreated A2780 cells were used as a control. Two replicates per treatment.
