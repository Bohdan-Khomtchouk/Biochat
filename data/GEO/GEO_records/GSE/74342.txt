TITLE
Genome-wide distribution of H2A-S40Gc in mouse trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide distribution of O-GlcNAcylated H2A at serine 40 (H2A-S40Gc) in mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). We found that H2A-S40Gc was mainly located at genic area, positively correlated with the gene expression, and varied the localization during their differentiation. This study using ChIP-seq analysis provides genomic distribution of newly O-GlcNAc histone modification.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of H2A-S40Gc in TSCs and differentiated TSCs (dTSCs).
