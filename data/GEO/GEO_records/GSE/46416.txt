TITLE
State- and trait-specific gene expression in euthymia and mania

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of bipolar disorder (BD) patients were assessed during both a manic and a euthymic phase and compared both intra-individually, and with the gene expression profiles of controls.

DESIGN
11 BD patients were assessed in their manic as well as in their euthymic phase. Comparison of gene expression BD euthymic vs. controls, BD manic vs. controls, and intra-patient comparison BD euthymic vs. BD manic.
