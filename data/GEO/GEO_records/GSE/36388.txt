TITLE
Genome-wide maps of O-GlcNAc-Oct4 binding regions in ZHBTc4 F-Oct4 mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Oct4 is modified by O-GlcNAc in stem cells. To find O-GlcNAc-Oct4 target genes, we ChIPed Oct4 with Flag(Oct4) antibody and then O-GlcNAc modified proteins are enriched by sWGA beads (succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA), which specifically binds O-GlcNAc). Results show that several genes implicated in pluripotency regulation are bound by O-GlcNAc-Oct4 in their gene region.

DESIGN
2 samples examined: Control (ChIP with anti-Flag(Oct4) and then reChIP with IgG), O-GlcNAc-Oct4 (ChIP with anti-Flag (Oct4) and then reChIP with sWGA)

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
