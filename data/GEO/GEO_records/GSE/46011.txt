TITLE
Expression analysis of Edwardsiella ictaluri 93-146 wild type and mutant strains during catfish serum exposure.

ORGANISM
Edwardsiella ictaluri 93-146

SUMMARY
Edwardsiella ictaluri is the causitive agent of enteric septicemia of catfish, one of the most important diseases impacting US catfish industry. The overall objective of this study is to identify E. ictaluri genes required for serum resistance.

DESIGN
4-plex array study using total RNA obtained from wild type and mutant Edwardsiella ictaluri exposed to heat-inactivated catfish serum and normal serum. Each treatment had four biological replica and each plex had two probe sets.

PLATFORM
GPL17011 NimbleGen Edwardsiella ictaluri 4x72K array
