TITLE
A. lyrata transcriptomic responses against salt stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata

SUMMARY
Using A. lyratamicroarray platform the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at two different time points- 3h and 27h after 250mM and 500mM of NaCl treatments.

DESIGN
Six weeks old, soil grown Arabidopsis lyrata, ssp. lyrata plants were treated either with 250 or 500 mM NaCl solution by flush flooding, while the control group was watered.

PLATFORM
GPL21706 Agilent-030951 A. lyrata 8X60 {Probe Name version]
