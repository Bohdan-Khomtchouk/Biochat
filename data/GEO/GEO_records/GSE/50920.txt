TITLE
Gene expression timecourse in clock rescue strains

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine whether global circadian gene expression oscillation depends strictly on the presence of rpaA, even when the KaiABC post-translational oscillator is oscillating with a circadian period.  Strains deleted for rpaA lack functional KaiABC post-translational oscillators because their reduced kaiBC expression level leads to a non-permissive Kai protein stoichiometry.  We restored KaiABC post-translational oscillator function in a ΔrpaA ΔkaiBC strain by ectopic expression of kaiBC from the Ptrc promoter and used microarrays to measure the timecourse of gene expression globally.  As a control, we used microarrays to measure the gene expression timecourse in a ΔkaiBC Ptrc::kaiBC strain, in which gene expression was expected to be rhythmic (Y Murayama et al, J. Bac. 198, 2008), as it is in the pure wild-type strain.

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in a flasks bubbled with 1% CO2 in air, initially in the absence of IPTG.  Cultures were treated with two consecutive light/dark cycles and released into continuous light at time T = 0, at which time IPTG was added to a final concentration of 6 µM.  Cultures were samples every 4 hours for 44 h between T = 24 h and T = 68 h, inclusive.  Gene expression at each timepoint was compared to the time-averaged gene expression (determined using a pool of equal mass quantities of RNA from all timepoints) using a two-color Agilent microarray.
