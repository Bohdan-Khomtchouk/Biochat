TITLE
RiboTag analysis of actively translated mRNAs in Sertoli and Leydig cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Sertoli and Leydig cell “translatome” utilizing an in vivo ribosome tagging strategy (RiboTag) that allows a detailed and physiologically relevant characterization of the polysome-associated mRNAs in vivo.  Although progress has been made in the identification of specific  transcripts that are translated in Sertoli and Leydig cells and their response to hormones, efforts  to expand these studies have been restricted by technical hurdles.  Our analysis identified all previously characterized Leydig and Sertoli cell-specific markers and identified in a comprehensive manner novel markers of Leydig and Sertoli cells; the translational response of these two cell types to gonadotropins or testosterone was also investigated.

DESIGN
Leydig cell-specific (Cyp17iCre: RiboTag) and Sertoli cell-specific (AMH-Cre: RiboTag)  RiboTag mice were obtained by crossing RiboTag homozygous mice with Cyp17iCre  or AMH-Cre mice.  For in vivo LH treatment experiments, mice were  injected with the GnRH antagonist acyline for 4 days before a single injection of purified  human LH.  After treatment, testes were homogenized and polysomes were immunoprecipitated by utilizing an anti-HA antibody.  RNA was extracted, labelled, and hybridized to Mouse Gene ST 1.0 arrays.
