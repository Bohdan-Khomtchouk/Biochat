TITLE
Whole genome transcription profiling of the L5 spinal nerve transection model of neuropathic pain in the rat, at different sequencing depths (Affymetrix transcript-level)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RNA derived from the L5 DRG 7 days following L5-SNT and from naïve L5-DRG tissue was subjected to microarray analysis and expression was determined at the exon and gene level

DESIGN
6 biological replicates (3 case – SNT subjected L5-DRG tissue, 3 control – naïve L5-DRG tissue). Each sample was made from pooling 4 distinct animals. Sample preparation and hybridization were performed by UCL genomics, following Affymetrix instructions. The 6 replicates were also used for RNA-seq, see GSE53762.

PLATFORM
GPL6543 [RaEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
