TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3R2me2s in pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of H3R2me2s in mouse pro-B cells. We find that H3R2 symmetric dimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation colocalized throughout the genome of mouse pro-B cells.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in mouse pro-B cells

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
