TITLE
Time-course transcriptome of wild-type Arabidopsis leaf

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
During the senescence stage, leaves undergo degeneration and relocate nutrients accumulated during the growth stage to sink parts such as seeds, critically contributing to plantsâ€™ productivity and fitness. Here, we asked how leaf transcriptome is regulated during the senescence stage by performing directional sequencing of total and small RNAs for the entire lifespan of Arabidopsis leaves.

DESIGN
The total RNA and small RNA profiles of the Arabidopsis leaf along lifespan (14 and 7 time points, respectively) were generated by next-generation sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2000. Two independent biological replicates were used for each experiment.
