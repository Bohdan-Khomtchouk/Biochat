TITLE
Gene expression before HAART initiation predicts HIV-infected individuals at risk of poor CD4+ T cell recovery.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from 24 HIV-infected male participants before the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Results identify biomarkers for the identification of HIV-infected participants that progress to good versus poor CD4+ T cell recovery after 48 weeks of HAART.

DESIGN
This retrospective study evaluated PBMC gene expression in cells taken within 2 weeks before intitiation of HAART from 24 recently HIV-infected individuals to identify genes whose expression is predictive of CD4+ T cell recovery after 48 weeks of HAART.
