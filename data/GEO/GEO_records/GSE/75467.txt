TITLE
Establishment of Afatinib-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Derived from Tumor Xenograft Model [Afatinib treatment]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed to indentify signifcant expression genes in afatinib-resistant HCC827 cell lines under different treatment conditions. All the expression profiles of BR16-1 and BR16-2 cells were comapared to parental HCC827 cells.

DESIGN
When cell lines isolated from tumors grew at 70% confluence, these cells were treated with afatinib at 0, 10 ,100, and 1000 nM. After 48hr, total RNA was isolated by using Qiagen RNEasy mini kit. The RNA integrity and QC reports were carried based on manufacturer's manual. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 Beadchips v4. Data were analysed by GeneSpring GX software (Agilent Techologies).
