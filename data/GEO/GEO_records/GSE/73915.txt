TITLE
Diatom phytochromes reveal the existence of far-red light based sensing in the ocean

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
The absorption of visible light in aquatic environments has led to the common assumption that aquatic organisms sense and adapt to penetrative blue/green light wavelengths, but show little or no response to the more attenuated red/far-red wavelengths. Here we show that two marine diatom species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, possess a bona fide red/far-red light sensing phytochrome (DPH) that uses biliverdin as a chromophore and displays accentuated red-shifted absorbance peaks compared to other characterized plant and algal phytochromes. Exposure to both red and far-red light causes changes in gene expression in P. tricornutum and the responses to far-red light disappear in DPH knockout cells, demonstrating that P. tricornutum DPH mediates far-red light signaling. The identification of DPH genes in diverse diatom species widely distributed along the water column further emphasizes the ecological significance of far-red light sensing, raising questions about the sources of far-red light. Our analyses indicate that, although far-red wavelengths from sunlight are only detectable at the ocean surface, chlorophyll fluorescence and Raman scattering can generate red/far-red photons in deeper layers. This study opens up novel perspectives on phytochrome-mediated far-red light signaling in the ocean and on the light sensing and adaptive capabilities of marine phototrophs.

DESIGN
Phaeodactylum tricornutum cultures growing in 12L/12D cycles were exposed, at the end of the 12 h dark period, to 30 minutes of low fluence of red or far-red light and harvested immediately after the light treatment. Cells were also collected before the light treatment as reference point and, culture kept in dark for 30 minutes represented the control condition. Two biological replicates were sampled for each condition.
