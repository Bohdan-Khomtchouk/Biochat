TITLE
CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from HIV infected patients with HIV-RNA viremia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD8+  and CD4+  T cells from HIV infected patients with HIV-RNA viremia of > 50 copies/ml and CD8+  and CD4+  T cells from healthy controls were isolated by negative selection (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Cell sorting of the CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets were performed based on surface staining of CD3+CD8+ or CD3+CD4+ and na ve CD45RA+CD27+CD127highHLA-DRlow, and CD3+CD8+ or CD3+CD4+ and memory CD45RA-CD27+CD127highHLA-DRlow. Sorted cell populations were spun down and stored as dry pellets at -80Â°C. Samples analyzed by transcript levels of genes related to cytokine signaling were determined by the JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway microarray.
