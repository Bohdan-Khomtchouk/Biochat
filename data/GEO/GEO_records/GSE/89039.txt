TITLE
Gene expression profiling in 8 lung cancer in Xuanwei samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to screen potential novel 'driver genes' in lung cancer in Xuanwei (LCXW), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected on 8 paired LCXW and non-cancerous lung (NCL) tissues by gene expression microarrays. Statistically significantly expressed genes were identified using the mixed model analysis of variance with a false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg test) adjusted p value of ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold-change values ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5. A total of 5,129 genes were detected to be DEGs. Of these DEGs, 3,248 genes were upregulated, while another 1,881 genes were downregulated.

DESIGN
8 paired LCXW and NCL tissues were tested.
