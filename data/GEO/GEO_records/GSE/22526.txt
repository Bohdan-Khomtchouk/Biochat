TITLE
Gene expression profiling of placenta from women with early- and late-onset preeclampsia reveals differences in angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious pregnancy associated disorder. Recently, it has been proposed that the role of the placenta differ between the two sub-groups early- and late-onset PE. To further elucidate differences between the two sub-groups, we conducted transcriptional profiling of human placenta comparing early- with late-onset PE. The analysis showed differences in angiogenesis associated genes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, early-onset PE (n=8) vs. late-onset PE (n=7).
