TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Ox40-cre/ROSA-YFP CD4+ T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An Ox40-cre allele was used for lineage marking of CD4 T cells.  Naive T cells that had previously expressed OX40 demonstrated a partially activated phenotype that was distinct from that of the majority of naive T cells.  These results are consistent with a minor subpopulation of naive T cells being dependent on strong signaling responses to thymic self ligands. Keywords: T cell population comparison.  Characterization of a novel subpopulation of naive T cells.

DESIGN
Four types of T cells were sorted from mice (naive, CD44lo, CD44hi and Treg).
