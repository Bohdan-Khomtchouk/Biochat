TITLE
DNA methylation and expression profiling study for bladder cancer [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA methylation patterns associated with the development and progression of cancer. The aim of the present study was to identify novel methylation markers that can discriminate between normal and Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), and between good and poor prognosis using microarray analysis of DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns in NMIBC patients. From the 24 matched microarray-based DNA methylation and gene expression profiling data set, tumor specific hypermethylated genes were selected and clinical relevance of these genes were verified by quantitative PQS analyses. Methylation statues of several genes were significantly associated with decreased gene expression levels and aggressive clinicopathological characteristics. In multivariate regression analyses, hypermethylation of these genes were the independent predictors of recurrence and progression.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted by standard methods using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, NY) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Methylation patterns were assayed using the genome-wide Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Methylation assays were carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Fluorescence signals corresponding to C or T nucleotides were measured and the data were used to assign a quantitative measure of methylation level (β value). The β value is a quantitative measure of DNA methylation levels of specific CpGs and ranges from 0 for completely unmethylated to 1 for completely methylated.
