TITLE
Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The host innate immune response is the first line of defense against pathogens and is orchestrated   by the concerted expression of genes induced by microbial stimuli. Deregulated expression of   these genes is linked to the initiation and progression of numerous diseases associated with   exacerbated inflammation. Here, we identify Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) as a critical positive   regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional activity at pathogen-induced genes.   Notably, depletion or chemical inhibition of Top1 suppresses the host response against   replicating Influenza and Ebola viruses as well as bacterial products. As a result, therapeutic   pharmacological inhibition of Top1 protects mice from death in experimental models of   chemical- and pathogen-induced lethal inflammation. Our results indicate that Top1 inhibition   could be used as therapy against life threatening infections characterized by an acutely   exacerbated immune response.
