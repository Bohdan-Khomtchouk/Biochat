TITLE
Gene expression profiles of CD34+ cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome CAA or AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identifying candidate genes which may assist in furthering our knowledge of the mechanisms of the development and progression of MDS AML or CAA. Or finding biomarkers in the future, facilitating the diagnosis of MDS, AML or CAA. Gene expression profiles in the hematopoietic cells of MDS patients have been studied using microarray

DESIGN
CD34+ cell samples isolated for microarray analysis from eight patients [comprising two cases of RA, one RAS, two RAEB, two AML, and one case of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA)] , and one healthy individual, were subjected to microarray hybridization for gene expression profiling.

PLATFORM
