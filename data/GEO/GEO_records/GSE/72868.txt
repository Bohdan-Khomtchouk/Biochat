TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Primary duck hepatocyte with differential susceptibility

ORGANISM
Anas platyrhynchos

SUMMARY
Our aim was to classify and quantify transcripts in primary duck hepatocytes cultured in medium with 5% FBS or 1.5% DMSO for 8 days. Methods: The transcriptome of PDHs under different conditions was analyzed by the pair-end sequencing on the Illumina Solexa platform. High-quality reads were mapped to the Anas platyrhynchos genome with TopHat v2.0.12 software. TopHat allows multiple alignments per read and default parameters were used. Cufflinks v2.2.1 software was later used for analyses that included transcript assembly and FPKM value calculations to quantify gene expression; this program was also run with default parameters.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of PDHs under different culture conditions were analyzed by the paired-end sequencing on the Illumina Solexa platform.
