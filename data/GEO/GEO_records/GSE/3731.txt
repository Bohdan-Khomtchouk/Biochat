TITLE
Replicative senescence in post-selection HMECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional abundance in each of senescent populations from two post-selection HMEC lines (48R and 184) is compared with abundance in isogenic early passage proliferating cells and also with abundance in early passage quiescent cells. A strain or line experiment design type assays differences between multiple strains, cultivars, serovars, isolates, lines from organisms of a single species. Keywords: strain_or_line_design
