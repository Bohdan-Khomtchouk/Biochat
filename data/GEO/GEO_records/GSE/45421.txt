TITLE
Revealing the genetic basis of natural bacterial phenotypic divergence

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Application of a genome-wide linkage method to identify genotype-phenotype relationships between distantly related strains of E. coli. Each hybridization compares transposon footprinting results from a linkage library under a selective condition with those under a nonselective condition.

DESIGN
For each of three conditions, we compare transposon footprinting for a library selected under that condition with those under a reference condition (glucose minimal media). Each experiment was performed in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL16859 Agilent-024568 Escherichia coli whole-genome tiling array (2 x 105K) [Probe name version]
