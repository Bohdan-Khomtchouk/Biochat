TITLE
Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E-BP Protien Family: Sentinels at a Translational Checkpoint in Lung Tumor Defense

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The usurping  of translational control by sustained activation of translation initiation factors is oncogenic. Here we show that the primary negative regulators of these oncogenic initiation factors - the 4E-BP protein family - operate as guardians of a translational control checkpoint in tumor defense. When challenged with the tobacco carcinogen NNK, 4ebp1-/-/4ebp2-/- mice showed increased sensitivity to tumorigenesis compared to their wild type counterparts. The 4E-BP deficient state per se creates pro-oncogenic, genome-wide skewing of the molecular landscape - with translational activation of genes governing angiogenesis, growth and proliferation; and translational activation of the precise cytochrome p450 enzyme isoform (CYP2A5) that bioactivates NNK into mutagenic metabolites. Our study provides in vivo proof for a translational control checkpoint in tumor defense.
