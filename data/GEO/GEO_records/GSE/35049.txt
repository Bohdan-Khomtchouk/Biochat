TITLE
Analysis of ethanologenic E.coli strain GLBRCE1 during fermentation of alkaline-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
The physiology of ethanologenic Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in alkaline-pretreated plant hydrolysates is not well studied. To gain insight into how E. coli responds to such hydrolysates, we studied an E. coli K-12 ethanologen fermenting a hydrolysate prepared from corn stover pre-treated by ammonia fiber expansion. Despite the high sugar content (~6% glucose, 3% xylose) and relatively low toxicity of this hydrolysate, E. coli ceased growth long before glucose was depleted. Nevertheless, the cells remained metabolically active and continued conversion of glucose to ethanol until all glucose was consumed. Gene expression profiling revealed complex and changing patterns of metabolic physiology and cellular stress responses throughout the different stages of growth. During the exponential and transition phases of growth, high cell maintenance and stress response costs were mitigated, in part, by free amino acids available in the hydrolysate media. However, after the majority of amino acids were depleted from the media cells entered stationary phase and ATP derived from glucose fermentation was consumed entirely by the demands of cell maintenance in the hydrolysate. Comparative gene expression profiling and metabolic modeling of the ethanologen suggested that the high energetic cost of mitigating osmotic, lignotoxin and ethanol stress collectively limits growth, sugar utilization rates and ethanol yields in alkaline-pretreated lignocellulosic hydrolysates.
