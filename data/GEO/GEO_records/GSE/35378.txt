TITLE
adipose tissue Glut4 overexpression or knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to determine the effects of adipose-specific Glut4 overexpression or knockout on changes in adipose tissue global gene expression

DESIGN
Three mice from each of four genotypes were studied using a total of 12 microarray chips: aP2-Cre transgenic mice (controls for adipose-Glut4-/- mice), adipose-Glut4-/- mice; FVB mice (littermate controls for adipose-GLUT4-Tg mice) and adipose-GLUT4-Tg mice with Glut4 transgenically overexpressed under the control of the aP2 promoter. Total RNA from perigonadal adipose tissue was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen. Affymetrix gene chip hybridization and analysis were performed at the Genomics Core Facility of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
