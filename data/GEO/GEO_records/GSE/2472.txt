TITLE
Expression profiling of rpb1-11

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Two independent RNA preparations were used to hybridise to two microarrays one on which wildtype was labelled with Cy5 and rpb-11 with Cy3 and the other on which dyes were swapped. The data were normalized using 'Lowess' (per chip per spot normalizations and checked against luciferase spiking controls). Using a 1.5 fold cutoff value for changes in expression levels 33 genes showed reproducible up or down regulation, none of which are known to be involved in RNAidependent transcriptional gene silencing. The methodology and arrays were as previously described by Xue et al (2004). Keywords: parallel sample
