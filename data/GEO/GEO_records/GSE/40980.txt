TITLE
Gene expression profile of the developing human retinal pigment epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray technique was used to investigate gene expression level changes in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) microdissected from fetal eyes (13 and 16 weeks of gestation) and adult eyes (40-60 years old). The gene expression analysis of human fetal RPE during development were performed and compared to human native RPE. Of the 45,033 probe sets on the microarray, 30,736 were detected. 3498 differentially expressed genes could be clustered into 8 patterns of expression that were statistically significant. Analyzing expression pattern of genes coding for key functions (pigment synthesis, visual cycle, phagocytosis, adherens and tight junction, transcellular transport) indicates human RPE achieved a high degree of maturity at early pregnancy. Compare to 154 signature genes of RPE, 148 candidate genes were identified in this studies including 53 down-regulated genes and 5 up-regulated genes. qRT2-PCR results showed similar expression trends with the microarray at three time points.These Ô¨Åndings indicate human RPE has different expression pattern compared to other animals.

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA pooled equally from three 13-week fetal eyes, two 16-week fetal eyes and two adult eyes for three time points (13, 16 week gestation and mature adult eye). Experiment was repeated in another group samples. This is a six chip study totally.
