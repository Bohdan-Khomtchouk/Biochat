TITLE
Gene expression profile of LAPC4 stimulated by 5α-Abi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LAPC4 cells were starved for 2 days and stimulated with 1µM 5α-Abi or 0.1nM DHT. Gene expression profiles are detected to determine the effect of 5a-Abi on prostate cancer cell line.

DESIGN
LAPC4 cells were starved for 2 days with phenol red-free and serum free-medium  and stimulated with 1µM 5α-Abi or 0.1nM DHT for 48h. Gene expression profiles are detected to determine the effect of 5a-Abi on prostate cancer cell line.
