TITLE
Whole heart response to stable HIF-1alpha overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An oxygen stable form of HIF-1alpha was overexpressed in the hearts of mice, under tet-off control.

DESIGN
Bi-allelic transgenic mice were created by crossing alpha-MHC promoter/tet transactivating protein expressing mice with tet responsive element promter/stable HIF-1alpha protein expressing mice.  Mice were either, maintained on Doxycycline (inhibiting the expression of the HIF-1alpha transgene) or removed from doxycycline (inducing expression) for one or three days.
