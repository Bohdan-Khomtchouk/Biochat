TITLE
Expression Profiling of Adult Male Germ Cell Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a panel of 101 adult male germ cell tumors and 5 normal testis specimens was performed on Affymetrix U133A and U133B microarrays. This data has been used to: 1) generate a gene classifier that predicts histology (see PMID 15870693). 2) identify candidate target genes on 12p, a region that is gained in almost 100% of germ cell tumors (see PMID 16424014) 3) identify pluripotency associated genes through comparison of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma vs. undifferentiated seminoma. ONGOING: 4) Identification of genes associated with patient outcome and cisplatin resistance. Keywords: germ cell tumor, histologic subtypes
