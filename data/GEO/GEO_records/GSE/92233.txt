TITLE
The microbial taxonomic and functional compositions in three broadleaved forests in temperate and subtropical zones

ORGANISM
soil metagenome

SUMMARY
Global warming has shifted climate zones poleward or upward. However, understanding the responses and mechanism of microbial community structure and functions relevant to natural climate zone succession is challenged by the high complexity of microbial communities. Here, we examined soil microbial community in three broadleaved forests located in the Wulu Mountain (WLM, temperate climate), Funiu Mountain (FNM, at the border of temperate and subtropical climate zones), or Shennongjia Mountain (SNJ, subtropical climate).Soils were characterized for geochemistry, Illumina sequencing was used to determine microbial taxonomic communities and GeoChips 5.0 were used to determine microbial  functional genes.

DESIGN
Thirty samples were collected from three mountains in temperate and subtropical zones, with 10 replicates in every site

PLATFORM
GPL20235 GeoChip 5.0 [Central South University]
