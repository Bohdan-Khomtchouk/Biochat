TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of YFV-17D specific and total naive CD8 T cells in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These 14 samples originate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from donors at different times after they were vaccinated with the YF-17D vaccine.

DESIGN
10,000 to 100,000 tetramer+ CD8 T cells specific for the NS4B-214 epitope in YFV-17D were purified by flow cytometry based sorting, from 8 vaccinees. Total Naive (CD45RA+ CD8+) CD8 t cells were also sorted from these donors.  Subsets were defined based on the time after vaccination. The subsets (cell types) include: Naive CD8 T cells (n=6); YFV-specific Effector CD8 T cells (day 14 after vaccination, n =3) and YFV-specific long term memory CD8 T cells (4 to 12 years after vaccination, n=5).
