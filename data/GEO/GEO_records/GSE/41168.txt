TITLE
Resveratrol supplementation does not improve metabolic function in non-obese women with normal glucose tolerance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Resveratrol has been reported to improve metabolic function in metabolically-abnormal rodents and humans, but has not been studied in non-obese people with normal glucose tolerance.  We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the metabolic effects of 12 weeks of resveratrol supplementation (75 mg/day) in non-obese, postmenopausal women with normal glucose tolerance.  Although resveratrol supplementation was well-tolerated and increased plasma resveratrol concentration without adverse effects, it did not change body composition, resting metabolic rate, plasma lipids, or inflammatory markers.  A two-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, in conjunction with stable isotopically-labeled tracer infusions, demonstrated that resveratrol did not increase liver, skeletal muscle, or adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.  Consistent with the absence of in vivo metabolic effects, resveratrol did not affect its putative molecular targets, including AMPK, Sirt1, Nampt, and Pgc-1Î±, in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue.  These findings demonstrate that resveratrol supplementation does not have metabolic effects in non-obese women.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profile in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) biopsy samples obtained from non-obese people before and after 1) placebo (PLC), 2) resveratrol (RES), and 3) calorie restriction (CR) intervention.
