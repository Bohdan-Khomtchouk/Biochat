TITLE
Transcriptional Modulation of Genes by Gut Microbiota in Germfree and Conventional Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the effect of microbiota on global gene expression in the distal small intestine during postnatal gut development we employed mouse models with experimental colonization by intestinal microbiota. Using microarray analysis to assess global gene expression in ileal mucosa at the critical stage of intestinal development /maturation associated with weaning, and asking how expression is affected by microbial colonization

DESIGN
In the study presented here, preweaned and postweaned GF, SPF mouse small intestinal total RNAs were used. Also, 3-week-old gnotobiotic mouse as well as GF mouse small intestinal RNAs were used.
