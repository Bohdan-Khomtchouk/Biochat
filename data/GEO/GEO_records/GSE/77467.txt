TITLE
The IDA-LIKE peptides IDL6 and IDL7 are negative modulators of stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We present a functional characterisation of two members of the IDA-LIKE (IDL) peptide family in Arabidopsis thaliana, IDL6 and IDL7. They are processed both C- and N-terminally to produce active peptides. Structure analyses of synthesized IDL6 and IDL7 peptides indicate that they lack secondary structure elements. Localisation studies suggest that the peptides require a signal peptide and C-terminally processing to be correctly transported out of the cell. Treatment of plants with synthetic IDL6 and IDL7 peptides resulted in down-regulation of a broad range of stress-responsive genes, including early stress-responsive transcripts, dominated by a large group of ZINC FINGER PROTEINS (ZFPs), WRKYs and genes encoding calcium-dependent proteins. idl6 and idl7 mutants were more tolerant to salt, whereas the respective overexpression lines displayed increased sensitivity to both salt and oxidative stress. Taken together, our results suggest that the putative peptide ligands IDL6 and IDL7 act as suppressors of abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Two weeks old seedlings were treated either with 100 nM IDL6 or IDL7 peptide (treated) or 100 nM mock peptide (control) and whole rosettes were harvested 2 hours after treatment. 4 biological replicaes per treatment. Two color microarray. Biological replicas are dye-swapped between slides.
