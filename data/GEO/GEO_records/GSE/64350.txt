TITLE
GLI1-regulated genes in human mammary epithelial cells and human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify transcriptional target genes of GLI1 in human mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells, primary culture cells of human mammary epithelium HMEC and breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were lentivirally transduced by either GLI1 or its control LacZ. Their RNA samples were served for expression analysis using AGILENT human 8x60K cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
Array analysis of HMEC and MCF-7 expressing either GLI1 or LacZ. 1 color method was employed.
