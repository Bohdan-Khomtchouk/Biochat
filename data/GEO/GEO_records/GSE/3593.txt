TITLE
Genomic approach to refine prognosis for adjuvant therapy in early stage non-small cell lung carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract from paper - Potti A, et al Keywords: Outcome, recurrence, adjuvant therapy, Early stage Non-small cell Lung Cancer, Lung Metgene Predictor

DESIGN
Retrospective analysis of approximately 200 samples obtained from Duke, ACOSOG and CALGB to develop a Lung metagene predictor that would then be used to assess risk of recurrence and thus identify high risk patients with stage Ia non-small cell carcinoma who would be candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy
