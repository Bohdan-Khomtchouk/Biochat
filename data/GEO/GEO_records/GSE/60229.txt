TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Culex cells after West Nile virus infection

ORGANISM
Culex quinquefasciatus

SUMMARY
High throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex mosquitoes after West Nile virus infection.

DESIGN
Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito cell line (Hsu) was infected with West Nile virus for 48 hours, paired-end sequencing was performed on the transcriptome. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Sequence reads were mapped to Culex quin transcripts in Vectorbase by using Tophat2 and abundaces of specific transcripts were compared between control and West Nile virus infected samples using Cufflinks.
