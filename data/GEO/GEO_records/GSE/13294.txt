TITLE
Expression data from primary colorectal cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 155 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 arrays. Our MSI/MSS classifier was applied to these samples. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
mRNA from one-hundred-fifty-five primary colorectal tumour samples were extracted and hybridized to HG-U133Plus 2.0 expression arrays. The MAS5.0 procedure was used to make calls of expression. Data from each sample were quantile normalized and log-2 transformed.
