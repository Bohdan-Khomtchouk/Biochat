TITLE
Effect of sigH in the growth phase transition of Clostridium difficile

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
This study is based on two microarray datasets, in one hand a phase transition comparison using the expression profiles of 630E strain after 4h and 10h of growth. In other hand a comparison at 10h of growth between a mutant of the sigH gene and the WT strains. This experimental procedure was designed to investigate the effect of sigH in the growth phase transition of Clostridium difficile. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
