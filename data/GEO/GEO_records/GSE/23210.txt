TITLE
Expression data in single and double knockouts of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We generated single and double knockouts of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in order to invesigate possible functions in Arabidopsis. nhx5/nhx6 exhibited severe growth retardation related to cell size and proliferation, as well as endosomal trafficking perutrbations. The results implicate endosomal NHX antiporters in novel cellular functions. In order to investigate further the possible functions of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6, we compared the transcrptional profiles of single and double AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 knockouts. We looked for changes in gene expression might help us to elucidate the molecular events associated with the apparent requirement of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 for normal growth and development.

DESIGN
Rosette leaves from 4 weeks old plants grown on soil under normal conditons and 8h L / 16 D were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chips.
