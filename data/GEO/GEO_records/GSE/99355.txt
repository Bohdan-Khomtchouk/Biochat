TITLE
NanoString DNA data for CNV Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quantification of DNA obtained from prostate cancer tissues and matched blood normals using the NanoString Cancer CN Panel Assay

DESIGN
A total of 96 genes/genomic regions from the NanoString Cancer CN Panel were profiled from 65 DNA samples using nCounter. Tumour (35 + 6 replicates) and matched blood normal (n = 12 + 12 replicates) samples were obtained from radical prostatectomy-treated, intermediate-risk (NCCN definition) prostate cancer patients. Tumour tissues are either fresh frozen (n = 30) or FFPE-preserved (n = 5) and were evaluated for Gleason Score (3+3 or 3+4 or 4+3) and cellularity ( > = 70%). Prior to nCounter processing, each sample underwent DNA fragmentation by one of two methods: sonication or AluI digestion.
