TITLE
Expression data from skeletal muscle biopsies of healthy adults

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Healthy adults with serum insulin like growth factor -1 (IGF-I) levels at the lowest quartile of normal ranges have increased fat metabolism and reduced glucose utlisation compared with those in the highest quartile during fasting We used gene expression in skeletal muscle to explore metabolism during fasting

DESIGN
We selected healthy males from a bioresource based on extremes of circulating IGF-I levels on stored sera and evaluated during a 24 hour fasting
