TITLE
Epigenome analysis of U937, U937 treated with 5mM azacytidine for 24 and 72 hours and its azacytidine-resistant derivative

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of U937 and its azacytidine-resistant derivative R-U937.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the samples were hybridised to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
