TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between human DFAT cells and ADSCs derived from the same donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells, established in vitro from mature adipocytes, exhibit certain properties of multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), such as the ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages. Although DFAT cells exhibit properties of proliferative progeny, at present there is only limited knowledge about their MSC-specific characteristics because those cells are considered to be potential artifacts of cell culture. To elucidate the identity of DFAT cells, we compared gene expression profiles of human DFAT cells and adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ADSCs) established using adipose tissue from the same donors. Microarray analysis showed that global mRNA expression profiles of human DFAT cells were very similar to those of ADSCs, a representative MSC, despite being committed adipocyte progenitors.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissues that were obtained during surgical operation for non-malignant disease were donated by 3 patients after obtaining informed consent. Three sets of DFAT cells and ADSCs, each derived from adipose tissue from the same donor were used for RNA extraction and subsequent microarray analysis.
