TITLE
Expression data from human Ea.hy926 cells in response to epoxomicin and in dependency of TCF11 presence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Coordinated regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is crucial for the cell to adjust its protein degradation capacity to changing proteolytic requirements. The transcription factor TCF11 has been identified as a  regulator for 26S-proteasome formation in human cells to compensate for reduced proteolytic activity. To expand the current knowledge of other UPS-related TCF11 target genes in response to epoxomicin, we performed microarray analyses of cells exposed to epoxomicin and with or without depletion of TCF11. Keywords: siRNA depletion

DESIGN
Human Ea.hy926 cells were harvested 24 hours following treatment with 10nM epoxomicin or DMSO as a solvent control and with transfection of control siRNA or TCF11-specific siRNA for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
