TITLE
SRF Overexpression Leads to Altered Expression of MicroRNAs and Contributes to Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of SRF in the regulation of microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis in cardiac hypertrophy has not been well established. In this report, we employed a distinct transgenic mouse model to study the impact of SRF on cardiac microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis. Cardiac-specific overexpression of SRF (SRF-Tg) led to altered expression of a number of microRNAs.

DESIGN
To study the effect of SRF level on cardiac gene expression and function in the mouse heart, we employed the cardiac-specific transgenic approach to increase the SRF protein level in one mouse model. The ventricular tissue samples used for the microRNA array analysis were obtained from 6-month-old wild-type mice and age-matched SRF-Tg mice. The RNA sample isolation and microRNA array were performed in triplets for both wild-type and transgenic mice.
