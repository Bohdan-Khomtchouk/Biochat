TITLE
Time-course RNA-seq reveals comprehensive transcriptome landscape of Mycobacterium smegmatis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
By analyzing the time-course transcriptome data and experimentally confirming, we comprehensively interrogated the expression profiles and transcriptional structure of M. smegmatis. We mainly unraveled the following results: 1) An extensive 2139 primary transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were identified in the genome-wide scale; 2) Many (2233) independent mono-cistron or poly-cistronic mRNAs were found in the genome; 3) At least 47.50% (1016/2139) genes were transcribed into leaderless mRNAs, and strikingly, for more than 41.28% (883/2139) of the genes, their TSSs were found to overlap with the first nucleotide of the annotated start codon, giving rise to leaderless transcripts lacking 5’-untranslated region as well as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence; 4) 150 genes were found to be inaccurately annotated by algorithms-based software; moreover, 82.67% (124/150) of them were found to be translated at the TSSs as identified by RNA-seq; 5) Nine highly active promoters were identified and their activities were determined in M. smegmatis mc2155 by β-galactosidase assays.

DESIGN
Mid-exponential (16 h), stationary (26 h) and mid-stationary growth phase (39 h) samples were sequenced, each with two repetitions.

PLATFORM
