TITLE
Expression data of LoVo cells treated by 10μM asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) for 96h in serum starvation medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ADMA is an endogenous metabolite, which is elevated in cancer patients. Previously, we observed that ADMA treatment attenuated serum starvation-induced apoptosis in LoVo cells. However, the biological functions of ADMA in tumor cells are largely unknown. In current study, we used microarray and untargeted metabolic profiling to investigate the global impacts of ADMA on LoVo cells.

DESIGN
Human derived LoVo cells were cultured in normal, serum free and serum free medium plus ADMA (10μM) for 96h, then cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.The samples were grouped as CON, SF96,A96, respectively.
