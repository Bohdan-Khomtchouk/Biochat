TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of dominant-negative Brd4 mutants identifies Brd4-specific target genes of BET inhibitor JQ1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed anti-proliferative dominant-negative Brd4 mutants that compete with the function of distinct Brd4 domains. We used these Brd4 mutants to compare the Brd4-specific transcriptome with the transcriptome of JQ1 treated cells.

DESIGN
We performed polyA RNA-seq of Raji cells expressing Brd4 constructs f3 and f9 (dnBrd4_f3/f9) and Raji cell expressing the luciferase control vector treated with JQ1 (luc_JQ1) or DMSO as control (luc_DMSO).
