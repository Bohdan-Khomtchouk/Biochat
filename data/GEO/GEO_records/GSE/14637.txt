TITLE
Expression data of tomato fruit responses to Botrytis cinerea

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Tomato fruit ripening is associated with a dramatic increase in susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold. Mature green fruit, prior to ripening, are largely resistant to B. cinerea, whereas red fruit, at the end of ripening, are susceptible to B. cinerea infection. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression changes that are induced by B. cinerea when tomato fruit at unripe and ripe stages are infected. Keywords: plant responses to pathogens

DESIGN
Tomato fruit at mature green and red ripe stages were wound inoculated with a water suspension of B. cinerea conidia. Twenty four hours post inoculation fruit pericarp and epicarp tissue around and including the inoculation sites was collected and the total RNA extracted. Total RNA was also collected from healthy and mock inoculated fruit.
