TITLE
Elucidating mechanisms by which regulated expression of proteoglycans and glycosylation-related genes in the striatum contribute to Huntington disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders Our goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which regulated expression of proteoglycans and glycosylation-related genes contribute to neurodegenerative diseases involving the striatum. A number of studies have demonstrated that neural proteoglycans are involved structural organization of the striatum and formation of dopaminergic connections to and from the striatum. Several proteoglycans are also associated with neuronal regeneration and some have been shown to be components of filamentous inclusions found in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, the localization and proper function of dopamine receptors, which are predominantly expressed in the striatum, are governed by N-linked glycosylation events. Huntington√≠s Disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results in selective degeneration of the striatum. This is caused by a mutation in the protein, huntingtin, however, the mechanisms responsible for neuronal degeneration remain unknown. Similar to the brains of HD patients, HD transgenic mice exhibit huntingtin protein aggregation and nuclear inclusions, selective degeneration of dopamine neurons in the striatum and dopamine receptor dysfunction.

DESIGN
In this study, the gene expression patterns of HD transgenic mice were analyzed. Four groups, pre-symptomatic HD mice (6 weeks old), WT control (6 weeks), post symptomatic HD (16 weeks), and WT control (16 weeks), were hybridized and analyzed using the GLYCOv2 array. Each group was hybridized in triplicate.
