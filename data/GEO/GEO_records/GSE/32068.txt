TITLE
HDAC6 functions as a tumor suppressor by activating caspase-independent autophagic cell death in hepatocarcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the specific roles of HDAC6 in the development of liver cancer, we employed large-scale gene expression analysis to identify the molecular signature that may affect enabling characteristics of cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed on the Hep3B cells transfected with empty mock or pcDNA_HDAC6, and recapitulated molecular signatures that related to hallmarks of cancer.

DESIGN
To characterize the biological effects of HDAC6 on liver cancer, large-scale gene expression analysis to identify molecular signature was performed on the Hep3B cells.
