TITLE
Cell division cycle in a human cancer cell line (HeLa)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment set contains the complete set of raw data for Whitfield et al. (2002)Mol.Biol.Cell.  HeLa S3 cells were synchronized by three different methods (double thymidine block, thymidine-nocodazole block or mitotic shake-off)in five independent time courses.  mRNA from the first and second double thymidine block experiments were converted to cDNA by standard methods using an oligo-dT/random hexamer mix and hybridized to 24K arrays; mRNA from the third double thymidine and thymidine-nocodazole block experiments were converted to cDNA using olido-dT alone and hybridized to 43K arrays; total RNA from the mitotic shake-off experiment was first amplified using a modified eberwine protocol, aRNA converted to cDNA by reverse transcription with random hexamer and hybridized to 43K arrays. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
