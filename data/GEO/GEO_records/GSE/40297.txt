TITLE
Gene expression profiling of processing glycosidase inhibitors: defining a common gene set produced by processing glycosidase inhibition in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study is to investigate the role of processing glycosidase inhibition induced by processing glycosidase inhibitors, namely castanospermin as the processing glucosidases inhibitor, deoxymannojirimycin as the processing mannosidases inhibitor, and deoxyfuconojirimycin as the fucosidase inhibitor. Comparative gene expression analysis was performed in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, with non-inhibitor-treated cells as the negative control. Gene expression was analyzed using 3D-Gene® Human 25k oligonucleotide microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools.

DESIGN
Inhibition of processing glycosidases (glucosidases, mannosidases, and fucosidase) in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells was performed by treating with a small molecule inhibitor and then culturing at 37°C. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed using 3D-Gene® Human 25k oligonucleotide microarrays. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer's instructions.
