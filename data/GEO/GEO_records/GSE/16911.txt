TITLE
Yeast W303 SSD1-V cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
SSD1 is a polymorphic locus in budding yeast with many pleiotropic effects. Our lab had previously done transcript microarray of W303a in an ssd1-d background, and here we have carried out another transcript microarray across the cell cycle in an isogenic SSD1-V background.  We find that a large fraction of budding yeast transcripts is differentially expressed in these cells.  Ssd1 has recently been shown to bind mRNAs in vivo, but very few of these mRNAs show significant changes in levels in the SSD1-V versus ssd1-d comparison.  About 20% of cell cycle-regulated transcripts are affected by SSD1-V and most of these transcripts show sharper amplitudes of oscillation in SSD1-V cells. Many transcripts whose gene products influence longevity are also affected, the largest class of which are involved in translation.  Ribosomal protein mRNAs are globally down-regulated by SSD1-V.

DESIGN
Cells were synchronized with alpha factor and sampled every 10 min across 2 cell cycles. A total of 13 samples were analyzed. No replicates were included. cDNA of the cell cycle samples were labelled with Cy5. For Cy3 labelling, asynchronous yeast population was used.
