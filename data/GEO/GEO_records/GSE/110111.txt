TITLE
Gene expression profile of SoNar-high and SoNar-low B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To dissect the metabolic state of B-ALL cells, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor (SoNar) for tracking cytosolic NADH and NAD+ redox states and constructed the transgenic mouse. Based on the NADH/NAD+ ratio, we have sorted SoNar-high and SoNar-low B-ALL cells to employ whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to regulate the metabolism of B-ALL cells.

DESIGN
SoNar-high and SoNar-low two population B-ALL cells from bone marrow were sorted to measure gene expression.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
