TITLE
High concordance between SNPs identified by the porcine 60K BeadChip genotyping array (Illumina) and the assembly-versus-assembly method

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine 60K BeadChip genotyping arrays (Illumina)  are increasingly being applied in pig genomics to validate SNPs identified by re-sequencing or assembly-versus-assembly method. Here we report that more than 98% SNPs identified from the porcine 60K BeadChip genotyping array (Illumina) were consistent with the SNPs identified from the assembly-based method. This result demonstrates that whole-genome de novo assembly is a reliable approach to deriving accurate maps of SNPs.

DESIGN
To compare SNPs identified by genotyping arrays and de novo assembly method, we genotyped 10 pig breeds by porcine 60K BeadChip genotyping array (Illumina), including 1 berkshire pig, 1 hampshire pig, 1 landrace pig, 1 large white pig,1 pi√©train pig, 1 bamei pig,1 jinhua pig, 1 meishan pig, 1  rongchang pig and 1 Tibetan wild boar.
