TITLE
Brachyury ChIP-chip on Ciona intestinalis embryo (early-mid gastrula)

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A genomic overview of in vivo binding of a transcription factor Brachyury in the ascidian gastrula embryo. Brachyury is known to be essential and sufficient for differentiation of the notochord. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Fertilized eggs were electroporated with a construct encoding GFP-tagged Brachyury. After fixation, Chromatin was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average of size of 1kb. The DNA fragments were enriched by immunoprecipitation with an polyclonal antibody specific for GFP (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated and WCE DNA were amplified by LM-PCR for the Chip analysis. Two independent experiments were performed to reduce experimental errors.
