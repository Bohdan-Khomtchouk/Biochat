TITLE
The downstream molecules of Notch signaling in vascular endothelial cell senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further investigate the mechanism how the decline in Notch signaling induces premature senescence in endothelial cells, we performed microarray analysis and identified Id1 nd DUSP1 as the downstream molecules of Notch pathway. In quantitative PCR and western blot analyses, the expression level of Id1 and DUSP1 increased in Notch1 over-expressing endothelial cells and decreased in knockdown similar to the result of microarray.

DESIGN
The gene expression of human unbilical endothelial vein cells (HUVEC) infected with retroviral vectors encoding Jagged1, Jagged1-shRNA, or Notch1-shRNA. HUVEC infected with empty vector was used as a control. In each genotypes, three independent lines at passage 8 were performed.
