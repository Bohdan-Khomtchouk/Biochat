TITLE
Macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages after 10 ug/ml lipopolysaccharide stimulation. C57BL6, C3H/ARC, BalbC and C3H/HeJ mouse strains analyzed. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Each time point stimulated with 10ug/ml LPS from Salmonella minnesota for the time indicated. The RNA from each BMM stimulated time point was labeled with Cy3 and compared with a common reference (total RNA from C57BL6/J 17.5 embryo) labeled with Cy5.
