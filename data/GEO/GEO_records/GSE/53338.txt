TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in TGF-β1-knock down human colorectal cancer cell lines vs controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TGF-β1-regulated miRNAs in the progression of colorectal cancer,we performed comprehensive miRMA microarray analysis on RNA derived from typical human colorectal cancer cell lines and TGF-β1 knock-down  human colorectal cancer cell lines. We identified a novel set of TGF-β1-related miRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from TGF-β1-knock down colorecatl cancer cell lines and controls.Three-condition experiment: shRNA-TGF-β1/Lovo cells vs. shRNA-Control/Lovo cells, shRNA-TGF-β1/SW620 cells vs. shRNA-Control/ SW620 cells, and shRNA-TGF-β1/HT29 cells vs. shRNA-Control/HT29 cells. Biological replicates: 1 Lovo cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1SW620 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1HT29 cells stably transfected with shRNA-TGF-β1- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1Love cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, 1SW620 cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, and 1HT29 cells stably transfected with shRNA-Control- pSUPER gfp-neo, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
