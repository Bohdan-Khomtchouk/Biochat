TITLE
Ubb Knockout Mouse Testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ubb knockout mouse testes at 7, 4, 21, and 28 dpp.  Ubiquitin (Ub) is an essential protein found in all eukaryotic cells and plays important roles in a variety of cellular functions including germ cell development.  Targeted disruption of the polyubiquitin gene Ubb results in male and female infertility in mice with germ cells arrested at meiotic prophase I.

DESIGN
Whole testes from wild-type (WT) and Ubb−/− (KO) mice were harvested at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postpartum.  Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.
