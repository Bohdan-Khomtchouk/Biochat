SUMMARY
Analysis of Ubb knockout mouse testes at 7, 4, 21, and 28 dpp.  Ubiquitin (Ub) is an essential protein found in all eukaryotic cells and plays important roles in a variety of cellular functions including germ cell development.  Targeted disruption of the polyubiquitin gene Ubb results in male and female infertility in mice with germ cells arrested at meiotic prophase I.
