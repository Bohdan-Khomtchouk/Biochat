TITLE
Expression data from mouse colon tissue response  to T cell transfer at week 0, 2, 4 and 6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal geneome profiling of T cell transfer colitis model T cells critically regulate clinical inflammatory bowel diseases and T cell dependent experimental colitis models have gained prominent favor as useful models to identify potential pathogenic mechanisms. The na√Øve CD4+CD45Rbhigh cell transfer model into recombinase activating gene-1 deficient (RAG-/-) mice induces both colitis and small bowel inflammation reflecting Crohn's disease with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Given the pathological similarities between the T cell transfer model of colitis and clinical disease, we sought to identify changes in whole genome expression profiles over time during the delelopment of colitis.

DESIGN
Male RAG-1-/- C57BL/6 mice were injected with a half million CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells from healthy wild type C57BL/6 male mice. The colon tissue from individual cohorts were collected at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. Total RNA were extracted from the colon tissue and detected by Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
