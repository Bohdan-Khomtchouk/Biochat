TITLE
Persistence of effector memory Th1 cells is regulated by the homeobox only protein Group1 Hopx-/-, Group2 Hopx+/-, Group3 Hopx+/+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hopx appears to be needed for persistence of Th1 effector memory cells. IFN-gamma-producing Th cells are significantly reduced in Hopx-deficient mice compared to Hopx-expressing littermates and Hopx-deficient Th1 cells show a defective persistence upon adoptive transfer. Moreover, Hopx protects Th1 cells from Fas-mediated cell death in vitro. To further dissect the role of Hopx and to identify target genes of Hopx, we have performed transcriptome analysis to compare gene expression in Hopx-deficient versus Hopx-competent Th1 cells. In agreement with the role of Hopx in supporting survival of Th1 effector memory cells, anti-apoptotic cells were up-regulated and pro-apoptotic genes were down-regulated in Hopx-competent compared to Hopx-deficient Th1 cells.
