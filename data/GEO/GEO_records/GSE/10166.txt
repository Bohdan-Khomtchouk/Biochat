TITLE
Role of AhR in thymocyte emigration in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over-activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by TCDD in mice leads among other phenotypes to a severe thymic atrophy accompanied by immunosuppression. TCDD causes a block in thymocyte maturation and a preferential emigration of immature CD4-CD8- DN thymocytes (recent thymic emigrants) into the periphery. As part of this study gene expression profiles from DN thymocytes and thymic emigrants were generated from TCDD and solvent control mice Keywords: Affymetrix, TCDD, CD4-CD8- thymocytes, Thymus involution, thymic emigration, Ahr

DESIGN
Female, 6-8 week old C57BL6 mice were i.p. injected with 10 Âµg/kg TCDD. After 5 days mice were anesthezised and FITC injected into their thymi. after 24h mice were sacrificed and CD4-CD8-FITC+ cells isolated from thymus (thymocytes) and spleen (recent thymus emigrants).
