TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of early response of rat brain orthotopic tumors after synchrotron microbeam irradiation (MRT)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify the transcriptomic response 6 hours after the MRT irradiation, in normal brain tissue (11 samples) and in glioma tissue (11 samples), in rat.

DESIGN
The orthotopic tumor-bearing rats were either treated with MRT radiation (six MRT-tumors), or untreated (five No irradiated tumors). The contralateral half hemisphere without tumor received the MRT treatment for six rats (6 MRT-Contralateral samples) and no irradiation for five rats (5 Untreated contralateral samples). Six hours after treatment, the tumors and their controlateral regions were resected and analysed for transcriptomic response.
