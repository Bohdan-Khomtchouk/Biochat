TITLE
Gene expression in cell cycle of Cyanidioschyzon merolae_1

ORGANISM
Cyanidioschyzon merolae

SUMMARY
To analyze mitotic cycle and organelle proliferation cycle, we investigated C.merolae cells across two cell cycles synchronized by light and dark cycles. C.merolae has one nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplast (Kuroiwa et al,1993. Protoplasma). Their division are strictly regulated by cell cycle and can be synchronized by light/dark cycle (Misumi et al,2005. Plant Physiol). These characteristics enable microarray system to analyze the proliferation cycle of not only the nucleus but also organelle. Keywords: Time course in cell cycle

DESIGN
Analysis of C.merolae cells across two cell cycles, a length of 50 hours after onset of synchronizied culture by light/dark cycles. Gene expression examined at 2-hours intervals.
