TITLE
Transcriptomic effects of estradiol treatment on cultured human uterine smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The myometrium is an important reproductive tissue composed primarily of smooth muscle cells. Contractility of the myometrial smooth muscle cells during the estrous cycle and pregnancy is modulated by estrogen. Despite much research, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which estrogen regulates myometrial contractility. This study investigates global gene expression profile of cultured human uterine smooth muscle cells (hUtSMCs) following 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment using cDNA microarray technology. In response to E2 treatment 540 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed. Gene ontology analysis identified several significant biological processes for these genes including muscle contraction, gland development, cell migration, cell adhesion, apoptosis, response to external stimulus and phosphorylation. In this study evidence is presented that in human smooth muscle cells 17β-estradiol, contrary to expectations, altered expression of several genes that may favor myometrial relaxation. Genes related to focal adhesion function were downregulated suggesting a loosening of SMC connections to the ECM while upregulation of MMP9 is also associated with weakened ECM interactions. The hUtSMC system is an additional useful model to investigate steroid effects on smooth muscle cells in isolation from other myometrial cell types.

DESIGN
In this study human myometrial smooth muscle cells (hUtSMC) purchased from Lonza were cultured and treated with 17beta estradiol. RNA was isolated after 6h, 24h and 72h from both treated and untreated control cells. The experiment was repeated at least 3 times.
