TITLE
Assessing the genome-wide occupancy of MORC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing HeLa cells expressing V5 epitope-tagged MORC2 constructs, the goal of the experiment was to determine the genome-wide localisation of MORC2 in the presence or absence of the HUSH complex and upon inactivation of the CW domain. The occupancy of V5-MORC2 was also compared to that of endogenous TASOR.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of endogenous TASOR and IgG control in wild-type HeLa cells. ChIP-seq analysis of V5 epitope-tagged wild-type MORC2 and the CW domain mutant W505A expressed in MORC2 knockout HeLa cells generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. In parallel, ChIP-seq analysis of V5 epitope-tagged MORC2 in HUSH tirple knockout cells was also carried out.
