TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of hematopoietic lineages from BAP1 WT and KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BAP1 has been studied as a tumor suppressor. Our aim was to characterize genes that were altered in various hematopoietic cell types upon deletion of BAP1.

DESIGN
BAP1 WT versus KO cells.
