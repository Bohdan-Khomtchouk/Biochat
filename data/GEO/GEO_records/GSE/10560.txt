TITLE
U937 cells: differentiating vs. undifferentiated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene-expression changes in U937 cells undergoing monocytic differentiation with TPA treatment Keywords: differentiation treatment

DESIGN
The promonocytic U937 cell line was maintained at 37C in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetalclone (HyClone) under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. U937 cells were differentiated by the addition to the growth medium 100 nM 12-O-tetradeconoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma).Three condition experiment, treated with TPA for two different time points (27 and 96 hrs) vs. untreated. Biological replicates: independently grown, treated and harvested
