TITLE
Macgoren-Abnornal karyotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently, several reports described chromosomal abnormalities in cultured human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines may be prone to specific genetic changes involving addition of the whole or parts of chromosome 12, 17, or X. However, why these chromosomes seem to be involved more often in genetic aberrations is not yet fully clear. In this study, it is of interest that the specific chromosome 12 and X change observed. Keywords: Human embryonic stem cell, trisomy, chromosome abnormality
