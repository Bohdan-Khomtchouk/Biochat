TITLE
Macgoren-Abnornal karyotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently, several reports described chromosomal abnormalities in cultured human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines may be prone to specific genetic changes involving addition of the whole or parts of chromosome 12, 17, or X. However, why these chromosomes seem to be involved more often in genetic aberrations is not yet fully clear. In this study, it is of interest that the specific chromosome 12 and X change observed. Keywords: Human embryonic stem cell, trisomy, chromosome abnormality

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression profiling in two normal (SNUhES3: S3 and SNUhES4: S4), two variants of SNUhES3 (trisomy 12: S3v12 and XXY: S3vX), and variant of SNUhES4 (trisomy 12: S4v12). Gene expression pattern was profiled using the Illumina HumanRef-6 BeadChip, which included 48,095 probe sets. From these analyses, 55 up-regulated genes and 28 down-regulated genes were identified in S3v12 versus S3. In S3vX, 98 up-regulated genes and 75 down-regulated genes were identified. In S4v12, 87 up-regulated genes and 61 down-regulated genes were identified.
