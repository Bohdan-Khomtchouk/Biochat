TITLE
Postnatal Development is Associated with Genome-scale Changes in DNA methylation in Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation marks are thought to be set up during early development and to remain static thereafter in healthy tissues. Here, we characterize the liver DNA methylation patterns of mice before birth, during early postnatal development (from birth until weaning) and in adulthood. Our analyses show extensive epigenetic reprogramming in the liver occurring during postnatal development. 118,877 of 261,317 CpGs analyzed throughout the genome significantly changed their methylation level by more than 5% from birth to nine weeks of age, with some changing by up to 86%. Interestingly, changes in DNA methylation occur primarily in intergenic enhancer regions while gene promoters seem little affected. Analysis of 166 CpGs at multiple time points by locus-specific bisulfite sequencing reveals that this reprogramming primarily occurs between postnatal day 1 and day 20. This time period coincides with two major cellular changes in the liver: the differentiation of hepatocytes and extensive cell division. While cell multiplication leaves a distinct footprint on the DNA methylation patterns, we show that the extensive epigenetic reprogramming likely results from differentiation of hepatoblasts into hepatocytes. Overall, our data suggest that epigenetic remodeling is an important aspect of normal liver maturation and involves a large number of gene enhancers.

DESIGN
Methylation was measured across three ages by RRBS in 21 samples, and by locus specific bisulfite sequencing across eight ages in 31 samples, RRBS samples from another study (9wk old animals(GSM1262175, GSM1262176, GSM1262177, GSM1262187, GSM1262166, GSM1262167, GSM1262202)) were used to compare to P1 samples
