TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of LincRNA TUNA Knockdown in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Globel gene expression was analyzed by RNA-seq to study the role of lincRNA TUNA in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of CCE mES cells with shRNA-mediated depletion of lincRNA TUNA on days 2, 4, and 6, compared to a control shRNA.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
