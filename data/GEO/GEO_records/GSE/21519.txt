TITLE
Caco-2 cells:  cycling vs 21-days differentiated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of 21-days differentiated Caco-2 cells compared to Caco-2 cycling cells. Goal was to demonstrate the ability of Caco-2 cells to express most of the markers typical of differentiated enterocytes. A novel protocol of line maintenance was used.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: cycling Caco-2 cells and 21-days differentiated Caco-2 cells. Two biological replicates of each condition in dye-swap configuration

PLATFORM
GPL6848 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Probe Name version)
