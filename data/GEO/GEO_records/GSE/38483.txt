TITLE
Global DNA methylation study of trisomy 8 AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing to trisomy 8 AML. Through a global study and quantifying the methylation signals, we demonstrated a characteristic DNA methylation distribution for trisomy 8 indicating the impact of the hypermethylation of the extrachromosome 8 on suppressing the signals on the rest of the chromosomes.

DESIGN
Examination of  3 relapse trisomy 8 AML patients

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
