TITLE
High resolution aCGH of the FGFR3-TACC3 locus in glioblastoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeted high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of the 4p16.3 locus in seven glioblastoma patients

DESIGN
A custom Agilent CGH microarray based on the 105A backbone was designed with high probe coverage for 4p16.3. Tumor tissue from four FGFR3-TACC3 positive patients and three negative patients was hybridized onto the microarray for the purposes of identifying a tandem duplication causing the fusion gene.
