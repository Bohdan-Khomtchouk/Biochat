TITLE
High-resolution Sp1 DNA-binding Site Mapping by ChIP-exo in STHdh Q7/Q7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mapping ultra-high resolution of Sp1:DNA interaction would provide us with valuable new mechanistic insights into Sp1-mediated gene regulatory network in Huntington Disease cell culture model.

DESIGN
STHdh Q7/Q7 cells were directly fixed and used for the ChIP-exo experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
