TITLE
Expression study of human embryonic stem cells, dental pulp cells (DPCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) obtained from DPC for characterization of iPSC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
iPSC were obtained from DPC from TRPC6-mut patient, a idiopathic autistic patient and a control. Original DPC and iPSC obtained were submited to expression analysis in order to check if the expression pattern obtained for the iPSC cells were closer related to embyonic cells than to the original DPC

DESIGN
DPCs were grown until reach 80-90% of confluency in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, TX), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids and maintained under standard conditions (37Â°C, 5% CO2). RNA samples were extracted from cells in passage 5 to 7. iPSC were grown until reaches 70% of confluency in mTSER medium (Stem Cells Technologies). RNA samples were extracted from cells in passage 12 to 15.
