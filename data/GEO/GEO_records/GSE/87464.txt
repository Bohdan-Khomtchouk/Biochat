TITLE
RNA sequencing of LSK cells from mice with JAK2 mutation and HMGA2 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Either loss of EZH2 or redcuction of let-7 induces  expression of HMGA2 and provokes severe myelofibrosis in mice carrying JAK2V617F. Therefore we compared gene expression profiles of LSK cells among WT mice,  Hmga2-Tg mice, JAK2V617F-Tg mice, JAK2V617F/Hmga2 double-Tg mice, and JAK2V617F-Tg/EZH2 conditional KO mice.

DESIGN
LSK cells sorted from 4-5 mice in each type.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
