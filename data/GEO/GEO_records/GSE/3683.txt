TITLE
Oxidative Stress 30-min interval

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Determine if yeast cell in stationary-phase cultures respond to oxidative stress Keywords: time-course

DESIGN
Yeast cells in stationary-phase cultures were exposed to oxidative stress with samples harvested every 30-minutes over 8 hours.  All experimental samples are over an common reference.  There are two replicates for each time point and six replicates of T0.
