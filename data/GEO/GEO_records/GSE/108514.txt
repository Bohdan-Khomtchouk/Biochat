TITLE
ChIP-Seq_PETAL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test Pbodies (anibodies screened from PETAL) for more applications, we performed ChIP-seq with selected Pbodies. ChIP-seq assays in HepG2 for Pbodies against SMRC1, SATB1 and NFIC were carried out.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq assays in HepG2 for Pbodies against three transcript factors (SMRC1, SATB1 and NFIC) were carried out. The results were compared with published data using commercial ChIP-seq antibodies.
