TITLE
M. tuberculosis transcriptional profile of delta pepD strain vs wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
pepD is regulated by a 2CS, MprAB, and impacts upon the regulation of sigE, an important M.tb sigma factor.  Here we examine the global impact of gene regulation in a delta pepD mutant strain.

DESIGN
Analysis compares total RNA from early log growth cultures of both wild-type and a delta pepD strain.

PLATFORM
GPL5774 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium tuberculosis 22K v4 array designed primarily based on strain H37Rv
