TITLE
Genomic Run-On (GRO) experiment for the YPD to YPGal time course

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Timecourse analyses (0 to 850 min) of exponentially growing BQS252 yeast after shift from YPD to YPGal galactose medium. Total RNA in vivo labeled by run-on, or cDNA labelling using random decamers included. Genomic DNA also examined. Keywords: other

DESIGN
This study focus on the transcriptional activity of RNA pol II in yeast genes. S. cerevisiae cells grown in YPD to middle exponential phase and transferred to YPGal were subjected to Genomic Run On. Data were normalized by the ArrayStat software. Home-made macroarrays containing 6035 ORF were used.

PLATFORM
GPL772 Valencia yeast v2
