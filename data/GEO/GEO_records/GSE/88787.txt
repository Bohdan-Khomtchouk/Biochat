TITLE
PRRUB FACS cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed to uncover the genome-wide alternation in gene expression resulting from the removal of PRR from the population ureteric bud and collecting duct  and successive changes to the series of events in kidney development.

DESIGN
Two Wild type pooled samples and two KO pulled samples are performed for the microarray to compare the gene changes.
