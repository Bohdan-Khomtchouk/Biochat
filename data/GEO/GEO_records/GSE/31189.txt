TITLE
Molecular Biomarker Signature for Bladder Cancer Detection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we applied differential gene expression analysis to exfoliated human urothelia obtained from patients of known bladder disease status. Selected targets from the microarray data were validated in an independent set of samples using a quantitative PCR approach.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 52 samples of human urothelial cancer cells (C) and from 40 samples of human non-cancer (NC) urothelial cells. Fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
