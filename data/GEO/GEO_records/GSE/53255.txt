TITLE
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Indian Isolate) wild type and complented strains vs rpfF mutant grown under iron starved condition

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of DSF regulon under iron starvation in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc; BXOR1) using wild type, rpfF mutant and rpfF mutant with complementing plasmid pSC9. Cell-cell signalling mediated by quorum sensing molecule known as Diffusible signalling factor (DSF) is required for the virulence of Xanthomonas group of plant pathogens. The transcriptional profiling in this study is to elucidate the role of DSF in iron acquisition under the iron limitting environment which would lead to successful colonization and pathogenesis inside host.
