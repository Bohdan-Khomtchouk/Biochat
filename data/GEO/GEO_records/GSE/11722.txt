TITLE
Irinotecan-induced gene expression changes in the rat intestine

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The regional specificity and timing of gene activation following chemotherapy, and how this relates to subsequent mucositis development is currently unknown.  The aim of the study was therefore to determine the early time course of gene expression changes along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the DA rat following irinotecan treatment, so as to provide an insight into the genetic component of mucositis. We have found that changes in gene expression following irinotecan occur by 1 hour, and persist for at least 72 h after treatment.  Overall changes in gene expression are similar along the GIT, however there is temporal variability between regions. Keywords: Time course and tissue comparison
