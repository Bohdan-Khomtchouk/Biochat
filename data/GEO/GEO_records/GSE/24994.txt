TITLE
delta-uvrY versus wild-type

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
The BarA/UvrY two-component system is well conserved in numerous species of the γ-proteobacteria. However, the regulatory output of this system differs significantly between the species. In this study, we characterized the BarA/UvrY two-component system in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Sensor kinase BarA and the cognate response regulator UvrY were identified by bioinformatic analysis and subsequent in vivo interaction and phosphotransfer studies. The expression of two putative small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), CsrB1 and CsrB2, was demonstrated to be dependent on UvrY. In contrast, a third predicted sRNA, CsrC, was expressed independently of UvrY. Transcriptomic analysis by microarrays revealed that UvrY is a global regulator and affects transcription of key enzymes of carbon metabolism such as ackA, aceAB, and pflAB. Subsequent growth experiments demonstrated that mutants lacking UvrY have a significant growth advantage over the wild type during aerobic growth on N-acetylglucosamine while under under anaerobic conditions the mutant grew more slowly. This effect was absent during growth with lactate as carbon source or in complex medium. Based on these results, we conclude that, in S.oneidensis MR-1, the global BarA/UvrY regulatory system is involved in central carbon metabolism processes.

DESIGN
In the study presented, expression profiles of  three independent replicates of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 ∆uvrY were compared to three independent replicates of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 wild type cells. All samples were obtained from exponentially aerobically grown cells in LB  to stationary phase  (OD600nm=4.0)
