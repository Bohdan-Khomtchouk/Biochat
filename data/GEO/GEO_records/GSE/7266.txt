TITLE
Gene expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on reverse osmosis membranes

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of P. aeruginosa PA01 biofilm cells was compared to the associated suspended culture, upon growth on reverse osmosis membrane coupon under limited nutrient conditions. Keywords: growth in reverse osmosis unit and on reverse osmosis membrane

DESIGN
Cells were collected from the RO unit and from the membrane coupon after 20 hours of growth and biofouling of the membrane. A defined media was used, resembeling secondary wastewaters.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
