TITLE
Effect of germline ablation in the nematode P. pacificus

ORGANISM
Pristionchus pacificus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of germline-ablated P. pacificus worms versus un-ablated wild-type controls. Food source E. coli OP50 for both conditions. The goal was to identify genes that regulate the enhanced longevity observed in germline-deficient animals.

DESIGN
One-condition experiments. Germline ablated P. pacificus versus un-ablated wild-type P. pacificus. Developmental stage = Young adults. Food source = E. coli OP50 for both conditions. 3 biological replicates for each condition, including 2 dye-swaps.
