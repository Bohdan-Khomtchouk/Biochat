TITLE
Gene expression profile of miniature pig as animal model for toxicity evaluation by using mRNA expression profiling.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Miniature pig is a useful animal model to clarify the vital reaction and the molecular mechanisms. However, physiclogical response of pig model to sodium azide (AZIDE) stress is not reveal. To establishment of large animal model for evaluate toxic stress, whole blood of miniature pig were assessed with genomics.

DESIGN
7 month old clawn miniature pigs were fed AZIDE feeding. AZIDE dose of 300µg/kg, one hundredth of LD50 was given orally to the miniature pigs. Whole blood gene expression was measured at 0h, 6h and 24h after feeding.

PLATFORM
GPL10162 Agilent-020109 Porcine Gene Expression Microarray (44K) (Probe Name version)
