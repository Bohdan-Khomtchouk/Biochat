TITLE
Gene expression in human germinal center light zone and dark zone B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays of gene expression in human germinal center light zone and dark zone B cells sorted according to the expression of cell surface molecules CD83 and CXCR4 We used microarray data to identify genes differentially expressed by B cells in the light and dark zones of germinal centers from human tonsil specimens.

DESIGN
Germinal center B cells (CD19+CD38+IgD-) were sorted from pediatric tonsil discard specimens into light zone (CXCR4hi/CD83lo) and dark zone (CXCR4lo/CD83hi) populations, from which RNA was extracted
