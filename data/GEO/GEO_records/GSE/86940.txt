TITLE
Histone modification and RNA changes in macrophages exposed to Beta-glucan and Fumarate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Innate immune memory is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to microbial components such as Beta glucan. We apply an epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in fumarate or BG induced trained innate immunity. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data were generated. This analysis identified epigenetic programs in trained macrophages, with fumarate exposure inducing a small subset of BG-induced histone acetylation and methylation changes.

DESIGN
Primary human monocytes were exposed to BG or fumarate for 24 hours in culture. The stimulus was then removed and cells were allowed to differentiate to macrophages for an additional 5 days. Macrophages were collected at day 6.
