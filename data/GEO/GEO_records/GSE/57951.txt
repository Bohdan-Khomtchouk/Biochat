TITLE
Gene expression regionalization in the outflow tract of the mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the inferior and superior wall of the distal midgestation arterial domain (outflow tract) of the wild type CD1 mouse embryonic heart

DESIGN
Total RNA was recovered from dissections of the inferior and superior OFT subdomains of Mus musculus littermate embryonic hearts at day 10.5 of development (E10.5). Dissections were performed in Rnase free DEPC treated cold PBS. Seven dissected samples of each domain were pooled for total RNA extraction with RNeasy kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Qiagen). For a quality control measure, total RNA was checked using the Agilent BioAnalyzer System (Agilent Technologies). RNA from each source was amplified and labeled with biotin. The labeled samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0
