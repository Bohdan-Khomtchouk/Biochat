TITLE
Field systems biology of grapevine red blotch reveals the impact of viral infections on the transcriptional and hormonal regulation of berry ripening

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Red blotch disease causes major reprogramming of grape berry metabolism and development leading to the inhibition of ripening pathways and stress responses

DESIGN
Red-skinned grape berries naturally infected with the Grapevine Red Blotch associated Virus and healthy controls at four stages of ripening (pre-veraison, veraison, post-veraison and harvest) and collected from two independent vineyards (Healdsburg and Oakville)
