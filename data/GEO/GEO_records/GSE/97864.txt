TITLE
Effects of β-catenin knockdown on microRNAome in highly metastatic ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microRNA microarray to investigate the role of β-catenin in regulating microRNAs during ovarian cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
Highly metastatic (HM) ovarian cancer cells derived form HEYA8 cell line were transiently transfected with non-specific (NS) or β-catenin-specific siRNA, followed by RNA extraction and analyses with the Affymetric miRNA 4.0 microarry.
