TITLE
miRNAs are required for post-induction stage sweat gland development [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs modulate processes in development, aging and cancer formation. However, miRNA function in sweat gland development has not been previously studied. By generating skin specific Dicer knockout mice, we show that miRNAs are required for post-induction stage sweat gland development.

DESIGN
Wide Type vs Dicer cKO embryonic mouse footpads
