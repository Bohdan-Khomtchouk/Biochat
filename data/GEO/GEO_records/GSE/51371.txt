TITLE
Sensitivity to proteasome inhibition and in vivo growth properties of MCL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCL cells resistant to bortezomib show distinct tumor growth in vivo when compared to their bortezomib-sensitive counterpart We used microarrays to detail the factors underlying the increased tumorigenicity of bortezomib-resistant cells in vivo

DESIGN
Global RNA expression in tumors harvested from SCID mice and derived from either bortezomib-sensitive or bortezomib-resistant MCL cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL13667 [HG-U219] Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array
