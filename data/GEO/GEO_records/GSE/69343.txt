TITLE
Thermomirs a novel class of temperature-responsive microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microRNA expression at 37 and 40 degrees shows a novel class of microRNAs that regulate fever. Arrays of gene expression at 37 and 40 of THP-1 derived macrophages as well as a thermomiR knockdown experiment.
