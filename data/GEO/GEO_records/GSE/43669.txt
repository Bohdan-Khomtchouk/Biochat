TITLE
Identification and Analysis of Red Sea Mangrove (Avicennia marina) microRNAs by High-Throughput Sequencing and their Association with Stress Responses

ORGANISM
Avicennia marina

SUMMARY
we used high-throughput Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) technology to sequence the small RNA transcriptomes of the mangrove species, Avicennia marina. Based on sequence similarity or the secondary structure of precursors, we have identified 193 conserved miRNAs and 26 novel miRNAs in the small RNA transcriptome of Avicennia marina.
