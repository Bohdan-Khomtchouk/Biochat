TITLE
Intra- and inter-individual genetic differences in gene expression (C57BL/6J vs DBA/2J)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic variation is known to influence the amount of mRNA produced by a gene, but the effects in different tissues is unclear. We studied gene expression levels in whole brain, kidney or liver, comparing 8 week old, male C57BL/6J to DBA/2J mice. Genes differentially expressed due to genetic background in one tissue were not differentially expressed in other tissues, suggesting that genetic variation of gene expression is tissue specific in inbred mice. Data used in a comparison to the BXD panel of mice in GSE8355, GSE8356, GSE6621 and to SJL/J in GSE8358.

DESIGN
Each sample is a single hybridisation from a common pool of C57BL/6J or DBA/2J. Two-colour glass arrays were used. No dye swaps were employed. Data from whole brain, kidney or liver.
