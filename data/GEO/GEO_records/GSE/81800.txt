TITLE
Effects of blocking IL-17A on lung gene expression after ozone exposure in obese (db/db) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obese mice have an augmented response to Ozone exposure (2 ppm for 3 hours and studied 24 hours later), including increase airway hyperresponsiveness and BAL inflammation when compared to WT ozone exposed mice. When IL-17A is block with systemic injected of IL-17A antibodies there is a decrease of response in the obese mice.  To determine the mechanism of action, RNA was extracted from the lungs of  IL-17A and Isotype injected ozone exposed obese mice and microarray analysis of gene expression was performed.

DESIGN
Lungs were harvested from db/db mice exposed to air and ozone and injected with anti-IL-17A and isotype.
