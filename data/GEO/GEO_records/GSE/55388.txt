TITLE
Pseudomonas fluorescens transcriptome in flowback water

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to examine the influence of flowback water exposure on bacterial survival and biocide tolerance. The transcriptome of P. fluorescens was analyzed using RNA-seq to determine the gene rxpression profile changes occuring upon flowback water exposure. The results indicate that that P. fluorescens induces a well-coordinated genetic response that aids in its survival in flowback water as well as imparts enhanced tolerance against typically used slow acting biocides such as gluteraldehyde but increased susceptibity towards sodium hypochlorite. RNA-seq data demonstrated significant induction of genes involved in osmotic stress, energy production and conversion, membrane integrity, protein transport among others.

DESIGN
Examination of P. fluorescens transcriptome exposed to flowback water for one hour and compare with PBS exposed cells.
