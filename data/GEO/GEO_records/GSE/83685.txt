TITLE
Expression data from Lck-Dlx5 lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lck-Dlx5 induces T-cell lymphoma but the mechanism is unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Dlx5-induced T-cell lymphoma

DESIGN
T-cells were isolated from Lck-Dlx5 mice, Lck-MyrAkt2 mice and Wild type littermates for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
