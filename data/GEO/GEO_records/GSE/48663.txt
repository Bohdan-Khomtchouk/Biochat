TITLE
In vivo T-box Transcription Factor Profiling Reveals Joint Regulation of Embryonic Neuro-mesodermal Bipotency

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Brachyury (Xbra/Xbra3) knock-down embryos of the frog Xenopus tropicalis were profiled to quantify neuro-mesodermal cell fate switches at a transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of Xbra/Xbra3 double morphants at early tadpole stage (RNA-Seq) in biological triplicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15472 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis)
