TITLE
Aberrant expression of lncRNAs in autistic brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess for the potential contribution of dysregulated long non-coding RNA expression in autism pathogenesis, we profiled lncRNAs and mRNAs from post mortem brain tissue from autism patients and age/sex matched controls

DESIGN
4 brain tissue samples from autism patients (2 patients, 1 prefrontal cortex and cerebellum sample from each) were compared to 4 brain tissue samples from non-affected controls (2 patients, 1 prefrontal cortex and cerebellum sample from each)
