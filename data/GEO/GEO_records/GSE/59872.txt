TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Lgr5-creERT2/PIK3CA H1047R and K8-creERT2/PIK3CA H1047R-evoked mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined the gene expression profile of mammary tumors derived from Lgr5- and K8-positive cell-of-origins

DESIGN
Mammary tumors and reference mammary glands from control mice were collected, cryo-homogenized, total RNA was isolated and analyzed by microarray (total 25 samples).

PLATFORM
