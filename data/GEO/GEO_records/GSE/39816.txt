TITLE
Linking genomic lesions with minimal residual disease improves prognostic stratification in children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GEP class prediction in association with CI-FISH (42 candidate genes) and patient MRD stratification

DESIGN
Combined Interphase FISH (CI-FISH) for 42 candidate genes and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays were applied in a series of 51 T-ALL patients enrolled in Italy into the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 protocol and stratified by Minimal Residual Disease (MRD). In 40 cases gene expression profiles (GEP) (Affymetrix HU-133 Plus 2.0 arrays) were available. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study
