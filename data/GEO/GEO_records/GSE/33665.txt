TITLE
Correlation of global micro RNA expression with basal cell carcinoma subtype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancers in the US.  Histologic appearance distinguishes several subtypes, each of which can have a different biologic behavior.  In this study global miRNA expression was quantified by high throughput sequencing in nodular BCCs, a subtype that is slow growing, and infiltrative BCCs, aggressive tumors that extend through the dermis and invade structures such as cutaneous nerves.  Principal components analysis correctly classified seven out of eight infiltrative tumors on the basis of miRNA expression.  The remaining tumor, on pathology review, contained a mixture of nodular and infiltrative elements.  Nodular tumors did not cluster tightly, likely reflecting broader histopathologic diversity in this class, but trended toward forming a group separate from infiltrative BCCs.  qPCR assays were developed for six of the miRNAs that showed significant differences between the BCC subtypes, and five of these six were validated in a replication set of four infiltrative and three nodular tumors.  The expression level of miR-183, a miRNA that inhibits invasion and metastasis in several types of malignancies, was consistently lower in infiltrative than nodular tumors and could be one element underlying the difference in invasiveness.  These results represent the first miRNA profiling study in BCCs and demonstrate that miRNA gene expression may be involved in tumor pathogenesis and particularly in determining the aggressiveness of these malignancies.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from eight nodular and eight infiltrative basal cell carcinomas. miRNA was then processed into libraries using the Illumina Small RNA Ver 1.5 protocol. Samples were then sequenced on the Illumina GAII system
