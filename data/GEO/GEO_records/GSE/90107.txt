TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Nrdc-binding sites by ChIP-seq in mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nardilysin (Nrdc) is a metallopeptidase of M16 family, which has been recently identified as a transcriptional coregulator. Here, we characterize the role of Nrdc in transcriptional regulation by genome-wide analysis using ChIP-seq and transcriptome.

DESIGN
Nrdc-binding sites and histone modifications were examined by ChIP-seq in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). MEFs generated from wild-type (+/+) and Nrdc-deficient (-/-) mice were used. MEF-/- cells, in which Nrdc was reintroduced by lenti-virus vector, were also used as control.
