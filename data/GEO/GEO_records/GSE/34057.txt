TITLE
miRNA expression during liver regeneration in the chronic ethanol-fed rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was profiled before and during liver regeneration following 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx) in chronic ethanol-fed (EtOH) and pair-fed carbohydrate control (CHO) rats.  Prior to PHx, EtOH animals were fed a liquid diet containing 36% of the calories from ethanol for 5 weeks.  Left lateral and medial (LLM) lobes were removed at time of PHx and used as t = 0 biological controls.  Remnant liver tissue (PHx) was harvested 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after PHx.  RNA from 4 biological replicates was pooled for profiling miRNA expression on Agilent Rat miRNA Microarrays v1.0.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was profiled in the chronic ethanol-fed (EtOH) and carbohydrate control pair-fed (CHO) liver prior to (LLM) and 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after partial hepatectomy (PHx).
