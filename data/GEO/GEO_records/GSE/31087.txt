TITLE
Liver hyperplasia; Gadd45beta-null mouse (C57Bl/6 background)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Four experimental groups each for wild-type and Gadd45beta-null (5 - 7 months old); (1) Untreated mice, and (2 - 4) treatment with TCPOBOP for 3, 6, or 12 hr 2 - 4 replicates for each experimental group;

DESIGN
Two color arrays; RNA from treated livers, red; pooled normal liver RNA, green. Each experimental condition was studied with 2 - 4 replicates, each from separate mice. The experimental RNA was cohybridized with RNA pooled from several normal livers. Data are the ratios of treated to normal hybridization.
