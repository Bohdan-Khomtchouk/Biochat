TITLE
microRNA-135b promotes cancer progression acting as a downstream effector of oncogenic pathways in colon cancer (Human cell line)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA deregulation is frequent in human colorectal cancers (CRCs) but little is known to whether it represents a bystander event or actually drives tumor progression in vivo. We show that miR-135b over-expression is triggered in mouse and humans by APC loss, PTEN/PI3K pathway deregulation and by SRC over-expression and promotes tumor transformation and progression. We show that miR-135b up-regulation is common to sporadic and inflammatory bowel disease-associated human CRCs and correlates with tumor stage and poor clinical outcome. Inhibition of miR-135b in CRC mouse models reduces tumor growth controlling genes involved in proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. We identify miR-135b as a key down-steam effector of oncogenic pathways and a potential novel target for CRC patientâ€™s treatment.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted using trizol from normal human colon cell lines comparing scrambled with miR-135b oligos transfected cells
