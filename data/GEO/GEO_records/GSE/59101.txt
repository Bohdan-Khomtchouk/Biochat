TITLE
Small RNA expression pattern in multiple inbred lines and their hybrids of maize embryo

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To investigate whether small RNAs (sRNAs) participate in the regulation of heterosis, we profiled the sRNA expression patterns in the germ seeds of five inbred lines and theirs three F1 hybrids using high-throughput sequencing technology.

DESIGN
In this study, three hybrid varieties of maize, which were elite hybrids and widely cultivated in China that exhibited high heterosis for grain yield, and theirs five parental inbred lines were utilized.  The relationship of these varieties is as followed: Chang 7-2 (Paternal, P), Zheng 58 (Maternal, M), and Zhengdan 958 (Hybrid, H); Chang 7-2 (P), 9058 (M), and Lingdan 20 (H); 87-1 (P), Zong 3 (M), and Yuyu22 (H). Small RNA profile of eight maize varieties are generated by deep sequencing.
