TITLE
Gene expression of mouse brain and mouse microglia in NRROS WT and NRROS KO animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice deficient in NRROS exhibit neurological phenotype similar to ALS. Our previous work showed that in phagocytes, NRROS regulates the degradation of Nox2, the enzymatic component of the NADPH oxidase that generates reactive oxygen species. NRROS is expressed in phagocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils and microglia but not neurons. Keywords: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

DESIGN
To help understand the mechanism of the neurological phenotype caused by loss of NRROS, we looked at NRROS WT (n=5) vs. NRROS KO (n=5) in brains, and NRROS WT (n=5) vs. NRROS KO (n=5) in microglia tissue. Samples were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System.
