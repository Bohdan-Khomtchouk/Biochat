TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of IRF4 -/- vs IRF4 +/- T-cells under Th17 polarizing conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of T-cells isolated from spleen of IRF4 -/- mice and cultured under Th17 polarizing conditions for 42 hrs compared to cells similarly isolated and cultured from spleen of IRF4 +/- mice. The aim of the study was to identify global misexpression of genes in IRF4 -/- cells and hence identify key pathways regulated by IRF4 during Th17 differentiation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, IRF4 -/- vs IRF4 +/- Th17 cells at 42hrs. Biological replicates: 3 for each condition

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
