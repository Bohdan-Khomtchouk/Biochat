TITLE
Identification of long non-protein coding RNAs in chicken skeletal muscle by Solexa sequencing

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing as a high-throughput technology has been widely used in the transcriptome profiling in mammals. In the present study, we aimed to identify chicken lncRNAs ranging from 300-1600 nt long. Total RNAs from chicken skeletal muscle at the embryonic stage were fractionated by 6% urea PAGE. Selected RNA fractions (300-1600 nt) were sequenced by Solexa technology.

DESIGN
Chicken eggs (White Leghorn) were incubated at 37.5°C for 10 days (E10), 12 days (E12), 14 days (E14), 18 days (E18). Skeletal muscles (pectoralis) were collected from chicken embryo incubated at above four stages. All muscle samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation. All embryonic manipulations were conducted in accordance with the protocols of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking Union Medical College. The single 'Chicken_muscle' Sample represents muscle pooled from all four stages.
