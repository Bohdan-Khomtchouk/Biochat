TITLE
the analysis of piRNA shows the function of Slicer activity of AGO3 in piRNA biogenesis.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in animal germ cells. In Drosophila, the reciprocal “Ping-Pong” cycle of piRNA-directed RNA cleavage, catalyzed by the PIWI proteins Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute3 (AGO3) through their Slicer activity, is believed to expand the population of antisense piRNAs in response to transposon expression. Whether and how the Slicer activity of AGO3/Aub promotes the process of the secondary piRNA amplification remain unclear. Here we generated transgenic flies that could express AGO3 Slicer mutant forms to ellucidate the Slicer activity of AGO3.

DESIGN
small-RNA libraries from 3 samples of D. mel. Ovaries.
