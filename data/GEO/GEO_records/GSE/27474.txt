TITLE
Reduction of dietary glycemic load modifies expression of several miRNAs associated with energy balance and cancer pathways in premenopausal women

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We assessed the effect of dietary glycemic load on miRNA expression in a sample of healthy, premenopausal women participating in a 12 month intervention designed to lower dietary glycemic load.

DESIGN
Comparing post-intervention to baseline miRNA expression data of 14 participants receiving the active intervention.
