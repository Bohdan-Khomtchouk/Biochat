TITLE
Immunoenhancing effects of Montanide adjuvant on recombinant coccidia antigen vaccination against Eimeria spp. and comparative microarray analysis of intestinal lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study utilized comparative global gene expression microarray analysis to evaluate the effects of two different Montanide adjuvants, ISA70 and ISA71, in promoting chicken protective immunity following vaccination with profilin, an actin-regulatory protein that is expressed by multiple Eimeria species.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment with reference hybridization design, 1) ISA70 plus profilin immunized chickens vs. profilin alone and 2) ISA71 plus profilin vs. profilin alone, 2 biological replicates with dye-switching, total 4 replicates for each adjuvants
