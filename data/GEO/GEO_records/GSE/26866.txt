TITLE
Combined Use of Laser Capture Microdissection and Microarray Analysis Identifies Locally Expressed Disease-Related Genes in Focal Regions of Psoriasis Vulgaris Skin Lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we sought to establish the usefulness of LCM on cDNA microarray analysis. We reported that LCM samples improved the sensitivity of detection of differentially expressed genes over conventional bulk tissue analysis. We also provided the new information of chemokine and its receptor interaction within psoriatic lesional skin.

DESIGN
For the comparison of gene expression patterns between single and double amplification techniques, total RNA was extracted from blocks of paired lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin biopsies from four patients. For LCM experiment, total RNA was extracted from sliced tissue sections of paired lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin biopsies from three patients.
