TITLE
Modulation of gene transcription and epigenetics of colon carcinoma cells by bacterial membrane vesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the genomic and epigenetic consequences of co-culturing colorectal carcinoma cells with membrane vesicles from pathogenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae and non-pathogenic commensal bacteria Escherichia coli. Our study has revealed that membrane vesicles from pathogenic and commensal bacteria have a global impact on the gene expression of coloncarcinoma cells. The changes in gene expression correlated positively with both epigenetic changes and chromatin accessibility of promoters at transcription start sites of genes induced by both types of membrane vesicles. Moreover, we have demonstrated that membrane vesicles obtained only from V. cholerae induced the expression of genes associated with tumour differentiation. Altogether, our study suggests that the observed genomic changes in host cells might be due to specific components of membrane vesicles and does not require communication by direct contact with the bacteria.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA profiles of three samples: untreated HCT8 cells (control), treated with membrane vesicles from V. cholerae, treated with membrane vesicle from E. coli (in triplicates), generated by RNAsequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
