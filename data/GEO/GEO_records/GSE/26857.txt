TITLE
Gene Regulation by the Human Glucocorticoid Receptor Dimerization Domain Mutant dim4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A mutation in the dimerization domain of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dim1, has recently been shown to bind DNA and regulate gene expression.  To expand these studies we created a stable osteosarcoma (U-2 OS) cell line expressing four mutations in the dimerization domain of the human GR, dim4 (N454D, A458T, R460D, D462C), and used whole human genome microarray analysis to compare differences in gene regulation between vehicle treated (CON) and those treated with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (DEX) at 100nM concentration for 6 hours.

DESIGN
Gene expression in U-2 OS hGRdim4 cells was measured after a 6 hour treatment with 100nM dexamethasone or vehicle (control) and the dexamethsone (dex) treated cells were compared to vehicle treated cells. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
