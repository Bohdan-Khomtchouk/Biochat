SUMMARY
We elucidate the transcriptome effects of optogenetics on developing neural stem cells population. The application of optogenetics in neural stem cell (NSC), allow photo-modulation of NSC in an activity-dependent manner. This provided spatio-temporal tool for studying activity dependent neurogenesis, including the potential of regulating the differentiation and maturation process of transplanted NSC. Currently, this is mainly driven by virally transfected of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene, which also requires high irradiance and complex in vitro stimulation systems. Additionally, despite the extensive application of optogenetics in neuroscience, the question of what transcriptome changes does optogenetic stimulation induced in developing NSCs have not been elucidated yet. To address these questions, we established a NSC line, expressing high light-sensitivity step-function opsin (SFO) variant of the chimeric channelrhodopsin, ChRFR(C167A) (~40x higher than ChR2), via the non-viral piggyBac transposon system. We set up a simple low-irradiance optogenetics stimulation-incubation system, which sufficiently induced depolarization in differentiating NSCs. We significantly enhance neurogenesis with low power optogenetic stimulation by 3 folds. Through microarray analysis, we have identified the genes and signaling pathways in axonal remodeling, synaptic plasticity and microenvironment modulation from optogenetic stimulation. Our results elucidate the transcriptome effects of optogenetics and the ability to drive neurogenesis with low irradiance optogenetics.

DESIGN
Two groups were compared between each other, control (non-stimulated) and stimulated group. Each group contains three replicates.
