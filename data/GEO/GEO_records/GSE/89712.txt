TITLE
Differential gene expressions in the hypertensive heart using Angiotensin II infusion model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expressions were constructed through expression profiling of a total of 22,556 genes in the hypertensive heart during the early and lately phase of Angiotensin II infusion, then 1019 or 647 significant differential genes were filtered based on the criteria (p < 0.05 and fold change > 2 or 1.5), respectively.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the mice were infused Angiotensin II for 0, 7, 28 days (n=2). The hearts were collected and performed transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing. Compared to control, 1019 or 537 significant differentially expressed genes (filtering criteria p < 0.05, fold change > 2.0 for 7 days; fold change > 1.5 for 28 days) were identified 7-days or 28 days post-Ang II infusion.
