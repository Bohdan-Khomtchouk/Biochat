TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 to 0.125mg/L erythromycin treatment

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Erythromycin is the drug of choice to treat campylobacteriosis, but resistance to this antibiotic is rising. The adaptive mechanisms employed by Campylobacter jejuni to erythromycin treatment remain unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the molecular basis underlying Campylobacterâ€™s immediate response to Ery treatment.

DESIGN
The design utilized an available two color microarray slide for the entire transcriptome of Campylobacter jejuni wild type strain NCTC 11168. One hybridizations were performed: sham-treated NCTC 11168 v.s. sub-lethal dose erythromycin treated NCTC 11168. Samples were  independently grown and harvested.  There were three biological replicates of each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL10622 JCVI PFGRC Campylobacter jejuni 16K v4 array designed primarily based on strain NCTC_11168
