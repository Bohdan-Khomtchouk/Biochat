TITLE
Study of the differentially-expressed genes induced by the expession of two viral glycoproteins in muscle cells of adult zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
A genomic approach was used to indentify the differences in the gene expression profiles of adult zebrafish injected with different viral glycoproteins. This study intended to study the mechanisms of immunogenicity of each glycoprotein (gpG of VHSV and SVCV)

DESIGN
Fish were injected with plasmids encoding the different glycoproteins and muscle samples at the site of injection were compared to control samples at three days post-immunisation.
