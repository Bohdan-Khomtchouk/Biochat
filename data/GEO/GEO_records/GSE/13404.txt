SUMMARY
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a gram negative enteric bacterial pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic colitis and heamolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans and is the cause of bloody diarrhoea and acute renal failure in children. We have studied the transcriptional response of a colon cell line (CaCo2) to infection by EHEC and compared its profile to infection by EHEC shocked in acid at pH 2.5. We carried out microarray analysis on CaCo2 infected with EHEC O157H:7 EDL933 and EHEC shocked at pH 2.5 at 4 hours post infection.
