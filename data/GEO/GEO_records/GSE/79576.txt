TITLE
Arabidopsis SAURs Are Critical for Differential Light Regulation of the Development of Various Organs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
During de-etiolation of Arabidopsis seedlings, light promotes the expansion of cotyledons but inhibits the elongation of hypocotyls. The mechanism of this differential regulation of cell enlargement is unclear. Our organ-specific transcriptomic analysis identified 32 Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) genes whose transcripts were light-induced in cotyledons and/or repressed in hypocotyls. We therefore named these SAURs as lirSAURs. Both overexpression and mutation analyses demonstrated that lirSAURs could promote cotyledon expansion and opening and enhance hypocotyl elongation, possibly by inhibiting phosphatase activity of PP2C-Ds. Light reduced auxin levels to down-regulate the expression of lirSAURs in hypocotyls. Further, phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) were shown

DESIGN
