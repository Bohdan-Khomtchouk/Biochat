Polarity gene alterations in pure invasive micropapillary carcinomas of the breast

SUMMARY
In this study we  have  identified  a  new  morphological  pattern  in  IMPC  defined  by  the presence of numerous bi-nucleated cells, related to abnormal expression of genes involved in regulation of mitosis. We also demonstrated that IMPC presented tight and adherens junctions proteins expression modifications that could participate to their clinical behavior. We showed that  IMPC  was  associated  with  a  specific  genomic  profile  compared  to  ER+ grade-matched IDC consisting of gains of 17q, high rates of 17q23 and 17q12 ERBB2 amplifications, losses of  heterozygosity  of  6q.  The  putative  role  of  the  genes  located  in  this  6q  LOH  should  be further investigated in order to determine if they could play a role in the presence of numerous bi-nucleated cells and inverted polarity of IMPC cells. In addition, we identified two genomic IMPC subsets: the first characterized by numerous amplicons with frequently near-tetraploid cells  and  the  second,  associated  with  different  complex  gains  and  losses  in  addition  to  8q gains and 16q losses, and predominantly composed of near-diplo√Ød cells. The observation of two genomic subsets within the IMPC entity suggests the existence of two possible oncogenic mechanisms leading to the development of a single disease.

DESIGN
Phenotypical analysis was combined with copy number, genotyping (SNP6.0 Affymetrix) and transcriptomic analyses in a series of 39 pure IMPC. The results were compared to those of 27 ER and grade-matched invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC).
