TITLE
Suz12 ChIP-chip using Avi-6k-hu

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The polycomb group (PcG) protein, EZH2, possesses oncogenic properties for which the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this set of experiments, we sought to identify a robust set of Suz12-occupied gene promoters in prostate cancer cell lines. Genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip) of SUZ12 was performed in both the PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines using an IgG ChIP-chip as a control. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
There are total 3 hybridizations, including IgG ChIP-chip of PC3 cells, Suz12 ChIP-chip of PC3 and LNCaP cells.
