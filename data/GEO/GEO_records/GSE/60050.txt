TITLE
Gene expression alteration in Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant double mutant HSPCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed global gene expression changes in Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant HSPCs in comparison with the megarkaryocyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) and Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitor(GMP) of Dnmt3a knockout, Idh2 mutant, WT genotypes.

DESIGN
Mouse HSPC mRNA profiles of megarkaryocyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) and Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitor(GMP) of Dnmt3a knockout, Idh2 mutant, WT and Dnmt3aKO-Idh2 mutant HSPC were obtained by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
