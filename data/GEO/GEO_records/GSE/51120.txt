TITLE
A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors network mediates the brassinosteroid signal [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate the genome-wide occupancies of  INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION1 (ILI1)-BINDING bHLH-1 (IBH1) (At2g43060), IBH1 ChIP analysis followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-Seq) on the p35S::IBH1-GFP (IBH1OE) line and a control line p35S::GFP (GFP OE) were conducted. Antibodies against GFP in the GFP-tagged IBH1 were utilized for immunoprecipitation of the endogenous protein-DNA complex, and the obtained DNA was subjected to next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
Observation of genome-wide occupancies of atypical bHLH, INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION1 (ILI1)-BINDING bHLH-1 (IBH1) (At2g43060)
