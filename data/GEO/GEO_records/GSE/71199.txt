TITLE
cis-Regulatory analysis of Ptch1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ptch1 is the primary receptor for Hedgehog ligands and functions as a negative regulator of the pathway. Ptch1 is upregulated in response to pathway activation and is a direct target of the Gli family of transcription factors that act as the downstream effectors of the pathwat. The goal of this study was to identify tissue specific Gli2 inputs to Ptch1 during development. Additionally, we assessed the prevalence of the repressive chromatin mark (H3K27me3) during directed differentiated of embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors.

DESIGN
Embryonic tissues were microdissected and pooled prior to formaldehyde fixation. ES cell derived neural progenitors were generated using embryoid body differentiation according to standard protocols.
