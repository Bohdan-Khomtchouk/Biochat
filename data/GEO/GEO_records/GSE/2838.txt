TITLE
Comparative SAGE Analysis of the Response to Hypoxia in Human Pulmonary and Aortic Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cultures of human aortic (HAEC) and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were exposured to short-term chronic hypoxia (1% O2) for either 0h, 8h or 24h Keywords: Time course, cell-type comparison

DESIGN
The response of each cell type (HAEC and HPAEC) to short-term chronic hypoxia was determined by a single SAGE library for each of three time points (0h, 8h and 24h)
