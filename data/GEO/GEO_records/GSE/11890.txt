TITLE
PKGI WT vs KO BAT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro from preadipocytes of PKGI-/- mice vs. WT were compared on a whole genome DNA array

DESIGN
Two dual-channel chip hybridization experiments were performed, one comparing BAT tissue from a PKGI-/- mouse with BAT tissue from a wild type littermate, and the other comparing brown adipocytes derived from preadipocytes of a PKGI-/- and a WT littermate mouse. Biological replicates were included in the experiments but were not hybridized on a chip. Instead, chip results were verified by quantitative Real-Time PCR in all biological replicates.
