TITLE
Effects of POTEF-AS1 knockdown in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified POTEF-AS1 is an androgen-regulated non-coding RNA gene. In order to investigate the POTEF-AS1 function in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines after siPOTEF-AS1 treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyzed the effects of POTEF-AS1 on AR function.

DESIGN
Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatment with siRNAs targeting POTEF-AS1 wiith microarray.
