TITLE
Biocompatibility and Discovery of the Potential Applications of Magnetite (Fe3O4) Nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A Transcriptomics Approach to Study the Biocompatibility and Finding out the Potential Applications of Magnetite (Fe3O4) Nanoparticles Here in this study, we examine the molecular effects of uptake of Fe3O4 nanoparticles using a whole genome microarray study in human epithelial cancer cell line. 38 genes (55%) out of 69 downregulated genes were found to be associated with TGF-beta or BMP signaling including six genes, Id1, Id2, Id3, Caspase-9, Smad6 and SMAD7, important negative regulators of these signaling pathways involved in development and tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MNP treated HeLa cells compared to untreated controls.

PLATFORM
GPL6102 Illumina human-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
