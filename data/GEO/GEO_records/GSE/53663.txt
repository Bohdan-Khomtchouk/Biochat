TITLE
Identification of Death-promoting transcription factor Btf down stream targets by microarray.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Death-promoting transcription factor Btf has been reportedly implicated in the apoptotic signal triggered by ionizing radiation, DNA damage-inducing agents, and cyclic stretch. However, mechanisms for the regulation of Btf-mediated apoptosis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling from Btf-depleted Hela cells and identified SMAD3 as a potential downstream target of Btf. Btf interacted with the SMAD3 promoter and this interaction was associated with the activation of SMAD3 gene transcription. Furthermore, we provided evidence that SMAD3 is involved in the induction of apoptosis, and that the disruption of Btf-mediated SMAD3 expression leads to resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis

DESIGN
Twelve samples are analysed.Three replicates are included. Hela cells are transfected with scrambled siRNA or Btf siRNA, and then left either untreated or treated with ADR for 8 hours.
