TITLE
Expression data from active rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy control.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease and its underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Previously a CD4 T-cell microarray study has only focused arthritis patients. We aimed to compare the molecular profiles of active RA versus healthy control in CD4 T cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in active RA and healthy control.

DESIGN
The highly purified peripheral blood CD4 T cells were isolated from 13 RA patients with active disease and from 9 healthy individuals for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
