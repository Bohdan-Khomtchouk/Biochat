Sarcoma RNAseq

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ewing sarcomas (ES) are aggressive bone and soft tissue cancers associated with aberrant activation of the EWS-FLI1 oncogene. Paradoxically, EWS-FLI1 does not induce ES in mice, thus the absence of a genetically defined model has hindered greater understanding of tumor pathogenesis. Here, we report PCG2, a novel mouse in which human GLI2A, an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, induces fast-growing, soft tissue tumors. Comprehensive analysis revealed remarkable similarity between PCG2 and ES at the pathology, immuno-phenotype, ultra-structure, and transcriptome levels. Moreover, we show that PCG2 tumors originate in bi-potent mesenchymal progenitors, providing insight into the elusive ES cellular origin. The striking PCG2 phenotype, which was strongly dependent on Gli1 dosage, suggests a greater role for oncogenic Hh signaling in ES etiology than previously recognized.

DESIGN
Six samples in total are included. Three TA muscle RNAs were sequenced and used for comparison with RNA from three primary tumors.
