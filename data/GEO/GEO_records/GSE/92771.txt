TITLE
Expression profiling in hiPSC-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have established culture systems to generate liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from hiPSCs. To characterize gene expression profiling in hiPSC-derived LSECs and HSCs, transcriptome analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were generated from human iPS cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) were used as controls.
