TITLE
Expression data of myeloma CD138+ and CD138- populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles between CD138+ and CD138- populations from human myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226 and NCI-H929. We used Affymetrix human gene 1.0ST array and analyzed with GeneSpring GX.

DESIGN
CD138+ and CD138- subsets of cells were separated using FACS and clonogenecity of both population were compared. The RNA was extracted and hybridized with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST array.
