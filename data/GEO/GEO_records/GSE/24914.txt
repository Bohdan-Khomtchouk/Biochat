TITLE
Escherichia coli biofilms vs planktonic culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Transcription profile of Escherichia coli cells in biofilms under static batch culture was compared to that of E. coli cells in planktonic cultures. Both E. coli biofilm and planktonic cultures were cultivated for 18 h in 10% Luria-Bertani broth at room temperature (20 degree Celsius). Biofilms were grown in static batch culture in petri dishes. Both planktonic culture and biofilms were homogenized and run through a separated protocol.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments: E. coli biofilm vs E. coli planktonic cultures. Two biological replicates with independently grown and harvested biofilms or planktonic cultures. Each biological replicate has two technical replicates of hybridization on microarray slides. Each slide has three built-in replicates for each probe.

PLATFORM
GPL11108 University of Alberta Escherichia coli 19K v2.0
