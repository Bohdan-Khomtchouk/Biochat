TITLE
Escherichia coli biofilms vs planktonic culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcription profile of Escherichia coli cells in biofilms under static batch culture was compared to that of E. coli cells in planktonic cultures. Both E. coli biofilm and planktonic cultures were cultivated for 18 h in 10% Luria-Bertani broth at room temperature (20 degree Celsius). Biofilms were grown in static batch culture in petri dishes. Both planktonic culture and biofilms were homogenized and run through a separated protocol.
