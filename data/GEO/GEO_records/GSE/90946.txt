TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the wild type compared to the deletion and overexpression mutants of the global regulator of secondary metabolism Lae1 in Fusarium fujikuroi

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide transcriptome analyses of the Fusarium fujikuroi wild type compared to the ∆lae1 and OE:lae1 mutants under nitrogen limiting and nitrogen sufficient conditions Lae1 was shown to be a master regulator of secondary metabolite gene clusters in F. fujikuroi. Deletion of the gene resulted in down-regulation, while overexpression resulted in up-regulation of several gene clusters, partially even under otherwise repressing conditions.

DESIGN
3 strains (WT; ∆lae1; OE:lae1) were analysed, each with 2 biological replicates
