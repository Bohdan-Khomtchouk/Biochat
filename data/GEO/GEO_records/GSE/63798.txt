TITLE
Expression data from individual MEF2A isoform knockdown in C2C12 myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of muscle tissue is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors. The MEF2 family of transcription factors are important players in muscle development and differentiation. We knocked down expression of MEF2 isoforms in a cell culture model of skeletal muscle differentiation and assessed global expression pattern changes between MEF2 knockdowns, and with a negative control.

DESIGN
C2C12 myoblasts were transduced with shRNA viral vectors to knockdown expression of individual MEF2 proteins. Cells were then induced to differentiate and were harvested 3 days post-differentiation for Affymetrix global gene expression analysis. Each array was pooled RNA from two separate transductions, and each treatment group was analyzed in triplicate.
