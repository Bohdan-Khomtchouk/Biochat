TITLE
Gene expression profiling  in Human mammary epithelial cell (MCF10A) by repression of KRT81 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate new health functions of hair keratin KRT81 in MCF10A, we compare altered of the genes expression.

DESIGN
The expression of KRT81 was blocked by transient transfection with KRT81 siRNA in MCF10A cells.
