Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPA) Somatic p53 Mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Mutations in TP53 induce autoantibody immune responses in a subset of cancer patients, which have been proposed as biomarkers for early detection. Here, we investigate the association of p53 specific autoantibodies with multiple tumor subtypes and determine the association with p53 mutation status and epitope specificity. Experimental Design: IgG p53 autoantibodies (p53-AAb), were quantified in 412 serum saples using a programmable ELISA assay from patients with serous ovarian, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer. To determine if patients generated mutation specific autoantibodies we designed a panel of the most relevant 51 p53 point mutant proteins, to be displayed on custom programmable protein microarrays. To determine the epitope specificity we displayed 12 overlapping tiling fragments and 38 N- and C-terminal deletions spanning the length of the wild-type p53 proteins. Results: We detected p53-AAb with sensitivities of 58.8% (ovarian), 22% (pancreatic), 32% (triple negative breast cancer), and 10.2% (HER2+ breast cancer) at 94% specificity. Sera with p53-AAb contained broadly-reactive autoantibodies to 51 displayed p53 mutant proteins, demonstrating a polyclonal response to common epitopes. All p53-AAb displayed broad polyclonal immune response to both continuous and discontinuous epitopes at the N- and C-terminus as well as the DNA binding domain. Conclusion and clinical relevance: In this comprehensive analysis, mutations in tumor p53 induce strong, polyclonal autoantibodies with broadly reactive epitope specificity.

DESIGN
The immunoreactivity was compared between 60 pancreactic ductal adenocarcinoma cases and 63 benign pancreatic disease controls against 52 unique mutant p53 and 379 human proteins that were printed on microscope slides. [Contributor] Arizona State University
