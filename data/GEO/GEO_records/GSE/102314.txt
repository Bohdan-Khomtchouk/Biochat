TITLE
Differential Expression of MicroRNAs in Leprosy Skin Lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, a comprehensive assessment of human miRNA was performed on leprosy skin lesions using DNA chip microarrays, which included the entire spectrum of the disease along with its reactional states. Sixty-eight samples from leprotic lesions (10TT, 10BT, 10BB, 10BL, 4LL, 14R1, and 10R2) and nine skin biopsies from healthy individuals were used as controls (CC) (ages ranged from 06 to 83 years, 48 were male and 29 female). The evaluation identified differentially expressed miRNAs [Fold Change (FC)≥2.0, p < 0.05] in disease lesions versus healthy controls or between them. Some of these miRNAs were validated by RT-PCR.

DESIGN
The sequence of events for this study followed the order below. Patients who were treated for leprosy were examined by leprologists and submitted to two biopsy procedures. One biopsy was processed for histopathological analysis and bacilloscopy, the other was immediately stored in RNAlater® solution (Ambion) for further RNA extraction. Sixty-eight samples from leprotic lesions (10TT, 10BT, 10BB, 10BL, 4LL, 14R1, and 10R2) were selected for analysis. In addition, nine skin biopsies from healthy individuals were usedas controls (CC). Differentially expressed miRNAs identified in the cDNA microarray assay were validated by quantitative RT-PCR.
