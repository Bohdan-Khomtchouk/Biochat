TITLE
Analysis of gene expression across developmental stages of Agaricus bisporus

ORGANISM
Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus H97

SUMMARY
Utilising a whole genome array, we have investigated the differential expression of genes across different developmental stages in the life cycle of Agaricus bisporus.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of each developmental stage (culture, casing, compost, fruiting body) were analysed.
