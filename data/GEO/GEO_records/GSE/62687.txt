CAV-2 vector-transduced human neurospheres transcriptome profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brain gene transfer using viral vectors will likely become a therapeutic option for several disorders. Helper-dependent (HD) canine adenovirus type 2 vectors (CAV-2) are well suited for this goal. Indeed, these vectors are poorly immunogenic, efficiently transduce neurons, are retrogradely transported to afferent structures in the brain, and lead to long-term transgene expression. CAV-2 vectors have been exploited to unravel behavior, cognition, neural networks, axonal transport and therapy for orphan diseases. Here we describe the HD-CAV-2 vector induced transcriptional response of human dopaminergic neurospheres derived from midbrain progenitors. In  this 3D model system, brain cell functions and dynamics mimic several aspects the dynamic nature of human brain. With the goal of better understanding and characterizing HD CAV-2 for brain therapy, we analyzed the transcriptomic modulation induced by HD-CAV-2 in this brain model system. We found that dopaminergic neurospheres are readily transduced by HD-CAV-2, and that transduction generates two main responses: a DNA damage response, and alteration of centromeric and microtubule probes. We suggest that the first effect is linked to viral DNA, while the second would be related to the interaction of the HD-CAV-2 fibre with CAR. â€ƒ

DESIGN
Total RNAs extracted from 3D cultures of transduced hmNPCs cells at 2 h and 5 days post-infection with HD-CAV-2 vector were hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays and pair wise comparisons were performed between the mock and vector transduced hmNPCs cells. Each condition was tested in three replicates.
