TITLE
Downstream targets of Nm23-H1: Gene expression profiling of CAL 27 cells using DNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human nm23-H1 was discovered as a tumor metastasis suppressor based on its reduced expression in melanoma cell lines with low versus high metastatic potential. It encodes for one of two subunits of the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. Besides its role in the maintenance of the cells NTP pool, nm23 plays a key role in different cellular processes. The role of nm23-H1 in these processes still has to be elucidated. Our goal was to identify Nm23-H1 downstream targets by subjecting Nm23-H1 overexpressing CAL 27 cells oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSSC) to microarray analysis. The genes with changed expression patterns could be clustered into several groups: transforming growth factor  (TGF) signaling pathway, cell adhesion, invasion and motility, proteasome machinery, cell-cycle, epithelial structural and related molecules and others. Based on the expression patterns observed we presume that nm23-H1 might have a role in OSSCs, which should be confirmed by future experiments. Keywords: disease state analysis
