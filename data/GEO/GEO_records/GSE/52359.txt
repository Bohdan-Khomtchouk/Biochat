TITLE
Single-cell measurements of osteolineage cells within the bone marrow cell niche

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report an approach biased only by the anatomic proximity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) to a putative niche cell as the criterion for molecular analysis. Comparative RNA-Seq profiling of single mesenchymal cells immediately proximal to transplanted HSPCs and those located further away revealed that HSPC-proximal cells have a distinct genome-wide transcriptional signature, highly enriched for genes previously implicated in HSPC niche function.

DESIGN
RNA-seq samples.

PLATFORM
