TITLE
Transcriptomic responses to emamectin benzoate in Pacific and Atlantic Canada salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis with differing levels of drug resistance

ORGANISM
Lepeophtheirus salmonis

SUMMARY
This study investigates the baseline or inducible differences in between populations of Atlantic salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis with differing levels of resistance to the parasiticidal drug emamectin benzoate (EMB), as well as the induced effects of EMB exposure to Pacific salmon lice.  F1 generation lice were exposed in bioassays to a dilution series of emamectin benzoate.

DESIGN
Two separate experiments were conducted, one for Atlantic and one for Pacific salmon lice (to be analyzed separately). Atlantic pre-adult salmon lice, separated into male and female, and sensitive or resistant to EMB populations, and exposed to a dilution series: 0 (control), 0.1, 25, 300, and 1000 parts per billion EMB. For each combination four biological replicates were included, except male resistant 25 (n = 3) and female resistant 300 (n = 2). Pacific pre-adult lice of both sexes were exposed to a dilution series: 0 (control), 25, 50 parts per billion EMB.
