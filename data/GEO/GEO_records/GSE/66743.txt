TITLE
Gene expression in malignant peripheral nerve sheat tumours and benign neurofibromas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
No consensus treatment regime exists beyond surgery for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST), and the purpose of the present study was to find new approaches to stratify patients with good and poor prognosis and to better guide therapeutic intervention for this aggressive soft tissue cancer.

DESIGN
Genome-wide RNA expression was analysed for 30 MPNSTs and eight neurofibromas from Scandinavian patients, and the overall gene expression in these two groups were compared in order to identify prognostic markers.
