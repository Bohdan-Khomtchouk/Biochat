TITLE
Expression data in double knockout of HsfA1d and HsfA1e Arabidopsis mutants (KO-HsfA1d/A1e) at 30 min under high-light stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcript levels of 560 genes were decreased (less than two-fold), while those of 312 genes were increased (more than two-fold) in the KO-HsfA1d/A1e plants compared with the wild-type plants.  The transcript levels of  HsfA2, HsfA7a, HsfA7b, HsfB1, and HsfB2a were down-regulated in the KO-HsfA1d/A1e

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants were grown (16 h light, 25°C/8 h dark, 22°C) on MS medium under a light intensity of 100 µE m-2 sec-1.  Two-week-old seedlings were subjected to high-light stress (400 µE m-2 sec-1, 25°C).
