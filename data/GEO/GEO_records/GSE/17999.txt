TITLE
ZBTB32 Is an Early Repressor of the CIITA MHC Class II Gene Expression during B Cell Differentiation to Plasma Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary murine B cells were stimulated with IL2, IL5, LPS to induce B cell differentiation for 24 hours. RNA was extracted from control and differentiated B cell to compare gene expression.

DESIGN
Murine B cells (CD43-) were purfied from 5 weeks old mice splenocytes. And purified B cells were stimulated with IL2, IL5, LPS for 24 hours.
