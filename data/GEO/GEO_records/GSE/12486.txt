TITLE
Changes in cardiac transcription profiles following on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate changes in cardiac transcription profiles caused by on-pump cardiac surgery, we collected myocardial samples, prior and after grafting, from patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest. The transcriptional profile of the mRNA in these samples was measured with gene array technology. Changes in transcriptional profiles can be correlated with the stress response of heart to surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest. Keywords: human, cardiac, CABG coronary surgery, gene expression, cardiopulmonary bypass.

DESIGN
Myocardial samples were collected, prior and after grafting, from patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest.
