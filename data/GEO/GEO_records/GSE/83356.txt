TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells [NonTreated_JM]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined transcripts that are enriched in neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells at postnatal day 1 and postnatal day 6. Supporting cells were purified by FACS sorting for GFP fluorescence from the cochleas of transgenic mice in which a BAC including the LFng locus drives the expression of GFP. Two replicates of GFP+ supporting cells were compared with all other cochlear cell types that were GFP-. We performed this experiment at two different ages, postnatal day 1 and postnatal day 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of supporting cells (GFP+) and all other cochlear cell types (GFP-), two replicates each, at P1 and P6 mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumna TruSeq.
