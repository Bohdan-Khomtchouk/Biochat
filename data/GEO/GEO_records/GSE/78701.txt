TITLE
Estrogen and mTORC1 dependent genes in the uterus of uterine-specific Tsc2-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To uncover genes regulated by mTORC1 and estradiol in uterine Tsc2-null LAM like cells, we performed RNAseq on uteri from 12-week old wild-type (WT) and uterine-specific Tsc2-null (KO) mice that were either untreated (intact), oopherectomized (ovx) or oopherectomized + treated with 17Î²-estradiol pellets (E2) for 8 weeks. We identified genes that were both estradiol- and TSC2-mediated.

DESIGN
Uterine mRNA profiles of 12 week old wild type (WT) and uterine-specific Tsc2-null (KO) mice in the presence or absence of estradiol were generated using Illumina HiSeq2500
