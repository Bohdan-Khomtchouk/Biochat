TITLE
RNA-Seq of regenerating DRG neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify isoform differential expression underlying peripheral nerve regeneration we performed RNA-Sequencing on DRG neurons after axotomy.

DESIGN
RNA was sequenced from peripheral Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) neurons from adult male mice 7 days after a conditioning lesion at the level of the sciatic nerve (Crushed samples) or after a sham surgery (Controls surgery).
