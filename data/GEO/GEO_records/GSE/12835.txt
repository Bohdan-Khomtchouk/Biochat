TITLE
Comparison of antigen stimulation response in Mycobacterium bovis-infected vs. control cattle using BOTL-5 microarray

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis continues to cause substantial losses to global agriculture and has significant repercussions for human health. The advent of high throughput genomics has facilitated large scale gene expression analyses that present a novel opportunity for revealing the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic mycobacterial infection. Using this approach, we have previously shown that innate immune genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BTB-infected animals are repressed in vivo in the absence of exogenous stimulation. In the present study, functional genomics methods were used to examine the immune response of PBMC from BTB-infected (n = 6) and healthy control (n = 6) cattle to stimulation with bovine purified protein derivative (PPDb) in vitro. PBMC were harvested before, and at 3h and 12h post in vitro stimulation with PPDb. Gene expression changes were catalogued within each group using a reference hybridization design and a targeted immunospecific cDNA microarray platform (BOTL-5) with 4,800 spot features representing 1,391 genes
