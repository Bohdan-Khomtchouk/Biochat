TITLE
IKKe coordinates invasion and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IKKe was identified previously as a breast cancer oncogene and was associated with poor clinical outcome in ovarian cancer. In order to elucidate functional roles of IKKe, we used microarray analysis to identify genes changed upon IKKe shRNA knockdown and compared with genes affected in ovarian cancers

DESIGN
IKKe was knockdowned by 2 different IKKe shRNAs in Ovcar5 in 6 replicates and candidate downstream targets were selected if changed by both shRNAs
