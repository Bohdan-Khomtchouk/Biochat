TITLE
Expression of mRNAs in 230-238 B-cell line infected with a plasmid encoding the GFP protein or a plasmid encoding both the GFP and FOG1 proteins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overexpression of Friend Of GATA1 (FOG1) in early B-cell stages may promote the proliferation of B-cells by changing the expression level of a certain number of key genes involved in cell cycle control.

DESIGN
The 230-238 cell line was either infected with a plasmid encoding the GFP protein or a plasmid encoding both the GFP and FOG1 proteins. After infection, cells were put in culture in RPMI1640 medium for 3 days before to be sorted for being GFP+. They were put back again in culture for 4 days more after the sort. Then, RNA isolation was performed using the following QIAGEN kit: RNeasy micro without DNase treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
