TITLE
Gene expression analysis in adoptive T cell immunotherapy (ACT)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the global effector immune responses in the tumor induced by ACT, we performed a gene chip analysis using B16 melanoma-pmel-1 TCR transgenic T cells model.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in the tumor from untreated or ACT mice on day 1, 3, 5 and 7. Gene expression was also measured in the tumor on day 3, 5 and 7 from ACT mice with anti-IFNg or control Rat IgG antibodies treatment.
