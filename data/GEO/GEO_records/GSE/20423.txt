TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the submandibular gland, stomach, and duodenum of CAVI-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to explore the functions of carbonic anhydrase VI (CAVI) more fully, we examined the transcriptomic responses to CAVI deficiency in the submandibular gland, stomach, and duodenum of Car6-/- mice by cDNA microarray. 94, 56, and 127 genes were up- or down-regulated in the above-mentioned tissues of Car6-/- mice, respectively. The functional clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed a number of altered biological processes. In the duodenum, the significantly affected biological pathways included immune system process and retinol metabolic process. Response to oxidative stress and brown fat cell differentiation changed remarkably in the submandibular gland. Notably, the submandibular gland, stomach, and duodenum shared one prominent transcriptional susceptibility pathway-catabolic process.

DESIGN
Submandibular gland, stomach, and duodenum samples were collected from three wild-type and three Car6-/- female mice, respectively, at the age of two months. Total RNAs were purified and used for cDNA microarray.
