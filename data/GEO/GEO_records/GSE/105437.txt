SUMMARY
Angiogenesis inhibitors are important for cancer therapy, but clinically approved anti-angiogenic agents have shown only modest efficacy and can compromise wound healing. This necessitates development of novel  anti-angiogenesis therapies. we show significantly increased genes expression in tumor- versus wound or normal endothelial cells. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo studies with orthotopic and genetically engineered mouse models, we demonstrate the mechanisms by which it stimulates tumor angiogenesis. In contrast to its antagonistic effects on tumor angiogenesis, target blockage did not affect normal wound healing. These findings have significant implications for development of anti-angiogenesis therapies.

DESIGN
Fresh tissue samples were obtained from paitents. Total RNA from purified endothelial cells was subjected to microarray analysis by using the Affymetrix Human U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip platform.
