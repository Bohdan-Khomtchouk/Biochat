TITLE
Characterization of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae Iron and Fur Regulatory Network

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
In this study wild-type, fur mutant, and complemented fur mutant strains of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae F62 were grown under high (100 uM iron) or low (100 uM desferal) iron conditions to identify genes whose expression was regulated by iron and/or Fur

DESIGN
Examination of each of three strains under two conditions by RNA-seq
