TITLE
KMT2D regulates p63 target enhancers to coordinate epithelial homeostasis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KMT2D plays a critical role in the control of epithelial enhancers and p63 target gene expression, including the re-quirement of KMT2D for the maintenance of epithelial progenitor gene expression and the coordination of proper terminal differentiation.

DESIGN
Characterization of KMT2D, p63 and several histone modifications' occupancy by ChIP-Seq in shRNA KO cell cultures.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
