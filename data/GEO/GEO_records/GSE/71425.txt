TITLE
Gene expression of rat cerebellum in a new animal model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identify differentially expressed genes related to the neurodegenerative process in a new animal model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The animal model consists on the simulation of several bouts of HE in PCA rats, being the precipitant factors of the episodes ammonia (NH3) and/or lipopolisaccharide (LPS) or saline.

DESIGN
Regular administration (one every two weeks up to 10 infussion) of NH3 (20 Î¼l/min along 3h) and/or LPS (5mg/kg) or in PCA rats. Sham rats were used as a surgery control.
