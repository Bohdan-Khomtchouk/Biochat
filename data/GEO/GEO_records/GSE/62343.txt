TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of KSHV virions produced from BCBL1 and BAC36 in 293L cells

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the viral transcripts packaged into the virion particles produced from BCBL1 cells as well as virions from 293L cells containing BAC36 BACs

DESIGN
RNA from virions were extracted and analyzed by RNA sequencing
