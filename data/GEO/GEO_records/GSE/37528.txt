TITLE
ChIP-on-chip data from human ES cells-derived CD34+CD43+CD45low cells (hemogenic endothelium-like cells) overexpressing 3xFLAG-Sox17-ERT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of transcription factor Sox17 in human ES cells-derived endothelial cells enhances expansion of hemogenic endothelium-like cells.

DESIGN
Human ES cells were differentiated for 6 days in EBs, then CD34+CD43-CD45- endothelial cells were isolated, plated onto OP9 cells, and transduced with the 4OH-tamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible 3Ã—FLAG-tagged Sox17-ERT retrovirus. The cells were seeded on OP9 stromal cells and cultured in the presence of 4OH-tamoxifen. At day 27 of  the co-culture with OP9 cells, CD34+CD43+CD45low hemogenic endothelium-like cells overexpressing Sox17-ERT were collected by CD34 magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and subjected to a ChIP-chip analysis.
