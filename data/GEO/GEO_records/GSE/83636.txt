TITLE
miR-17-92 cluster regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, anxiety and depression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Emerging evidence has shown that noncoding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), contribute to the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders, although the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show altered levels of miR-17-92 in adult hippocampal neural progenitors have a significant impact in neurogenesis and anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in mice. miR-17-92 deletion in adult neural progenitors causes a decrease, while its overexpression an increase of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, through regulating genes in the glucocorticoid pathway, especially serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase-1 (Sgk1). miR-17-92 knockout mice show anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, whereas miR-17-92 overexpressing mice exhibit anxiolytic and antidepression-like behaviors. Furthermore, we show that miR-17-92 expression in the adult mouse hippocampus responds to chronic stress, and miR-17-92 rescues proliferation defects, induced by corticosterone, in hippocampal neural progenitors. Our study uncovers a crucial role for miR-17-92 in adult neural progenitors to regulate neurogenesis and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.

DESIGN
Hippocampal mRNA profiles of 13-week old wildtype and miR-17-92 knockout mice were generated by whole RNA-sequencing, using IlluminaHiSeq1000.
