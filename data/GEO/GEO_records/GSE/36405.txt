TITLE
Isw1 and Chd1 maintain chromatin organization during transcription [K56ac data]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip assays to determine the occupancy of acetylated histone H3 K56 in wildtype, isw1, chd1, isw1 chd1 and ISW1[K227R] yeast.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. ChIP/Input. K56ac data normalized to histone H3 and plotted as mutant over wildtype. Biological replicates=3. Please note that H3 data for YMS123-125 & YMS127 is part of the AcH4 file.
