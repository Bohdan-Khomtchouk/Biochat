TITLE
shRNA mediated knockdown of TRA2B and SRSF3 in HEK293 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have independently knocked down TRA2B and SRSF3 in HEK293 cells to identify the sum of alternative splicing changes that results from depletion of each factor.  Each was compared to a control transfection of the hairpin vector alone.

DESIGN
In this set, 9 total samples were analyzed.  There were three biological replicates for each of three conditions: knockdown control, TRA2B knockdown and SRSF3 knockdown.  Arrays were analyzed for gene expression using GeneBase and for alternative splicing using MADS+ and OmniViewer software.
