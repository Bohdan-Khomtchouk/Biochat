TITLE
Functional analyses of miR-210 involvement in the aggressive phenotype of high grade breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As miR-210 expression is correlated to poor prognosis both in estrogen-positive and in estrogen-negative breast cancer (BC) patients, we aimed to investigate the biological processes regulated by miR-210 and which may elucidate its function in the aggressive phenotype of high grade breast cancer. We performed in silico functional analyses of the genes deregulated upon miR-210 overexpression in MCF7 BC cell line and upon miR-210 repression in MDA-MB-231 BC cell line using lentiviral transduction. Gene expression profiling analysis of these cells revealed the deregulation of genes involved in several biological pathways including cell adhesion, extracellular structure organization, epithelial cell proliferation, cell division, cell cycle and immune response.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells overexpressing miR-210 (or control) and MDA-MB-231 cells in which miR-210 (or control) is repressed were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
