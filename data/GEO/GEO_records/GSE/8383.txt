TITLE
Profiling of MCF-7 cells treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and either dexamethasone or 17b-estradiol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of proteasome inhibition on glucocorticoid and estrogen receptor regulated gene expression. Keywords: Transcriptional profiling, Proteasome inhibitors, gene expression, steroid receptor

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (MG132), dexamethasone, 17b-estradiol or MG132 plus dexamethasone or MG132 plus 7b-estardiol.  Control cells were not treated.  RNA was collected from 2 biological experiments.
