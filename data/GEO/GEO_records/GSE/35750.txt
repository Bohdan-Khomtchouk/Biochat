TITLE
Expression analysis of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 TA100 upon exposure to C60

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 TA100 upon exposure to C60, compared to unexposed controls.  The mutations engineered into this strain make it susceptile to mutagenic compounds. The Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain used in this study is further described in Pedersen P, Thomsen E, Stern RM. 1983. Detection by Replica Plating of False Revertant Colonies Induced in the Salmonella Mammalian Microsome Assay by Hexavalent Chromium. Environmental health perspectives 51: 227-230.

DESIGN
A 4 x 72K array study using total RNA recovered from triplicate cultures of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 TA100 exposed to C60 and triplicate cultures of controls that were not exposed to C60.  Each 72K array measures the expression level of 4,504 genes from Salmonella typhimurium LT2 with seven 45 to 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
