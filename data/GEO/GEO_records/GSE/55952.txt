TITLE
Streptococcus mutans UA159 grown in the presence of glucose or maltose pH7 and pH5

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the effects of sugar source in S. mutans

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 4 replicate samples of S. mutans UA159, UA159 grown in glucose or maltose in continuous culture to steady-state pH values of 7 or 5.  RNA was labeled with Cy3.  For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cultures grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
GPL15711 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 13K v3 array designed primarily based on strain UA159 [ORF version]
