TITLE
Bacillus subtilis SigA ChIP-chip (BsubT2 array)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Identification of the specific SigA binding regions on the B. subtilis chromosome during exponential, transition and stationary growth phases. The data served to help the analysis of the repertoire of B. subtilis promoters established from transcriptome profiles.

DESIGN
3 growth phases (exponential, transition, stationary) x 2 biological replicates were analysed on the BsubT2 tiling array.
