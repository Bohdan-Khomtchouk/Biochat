TITLE
MUT-14 and SMUT-1 DEAD box RNA helicases have overlapping roles in germline RNAi and endogenous siRNA formation in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This data series contains small RNA high-throughput sequencing data for each of the mutator class genes. Samples are from stage-matched adult C. elegans grown at 20ËšC.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were isolated from synchronized wild type and mutant C. elegans and subjected to Illumina HiSeq sequencing. The series contains fastq and tab-separated files for 19 libraries.

PLATFORM
