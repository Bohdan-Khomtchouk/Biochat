TITLE
miRNA profiling of 29 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
29 cases of RCHOP treated DLBCL were profiled for miRNA expression. Different integrated annalysis were performed, including mirNA differential expression between cases classified according to the COO signature (see later) and correlation tests between gene and miRNA expression.

DESIGN
Cases classified according to the cell of origin classsifer (Wright G, Tan B, Rosenwald A, Hurt EH, Wiestner A, Staudt LM. A gene expression-based method to diagnose clinically distinct subgroups of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2003;100:9991-6.) based on gene expression were subjected to miRNA expression profiling.
