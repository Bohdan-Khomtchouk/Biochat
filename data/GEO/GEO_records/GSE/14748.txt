TITLE
Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to deoxynivalenol

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The assessment of toxicity about deoxynivalenol (DON) using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. Two yeast strains, parental BY4743 and PTC1 mutant, were used for this study. SDS was used to raise the penetration of the yeast cell membrane. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Four conditions are compared with three replicates each. Each of the two strains was grown in either 0.01% SDS-containing YPD media or  0.01% SDS-containing YPD media with 25 ppm of deoxynivalenol.
