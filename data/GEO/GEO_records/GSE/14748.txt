TITLE
Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to deoxynivalenol

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The assessment of toxicity about deoxynivalenol (DON) using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. Two yeast strains, parental BY4743 and PTC1 mutant, were used for this study. SDS was used to raise the penetration of the yeast cell membrane. Keywords: stress response
