TITLE
Genome-wide detection of STAT6 binding sites in IL-4 treated naive human CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT6 is a major transcription factor driving the polarization of Th2 cells in response to IL-4. STAT6 is phosphorylated by Jak1 and Jak3 kinases at the IL-4 receptor, after which phosphorylated STAT6 forms a homodimer and translocates into the nucleus. There STAT6 binds to specific DNA sequences, regulating the transcription of its target genes. Here we have analyzed on a genome wide level the STAT6 binding sites, after 1h and 4h of IL-4 induction, in naive human CD4+ T cells. Keywords: SRA

DESIGN
Altogether 5 samples from 1 biological replicate were analyzed. Activated and IL-4 treated samples were compared to only activated or untreated samples to identify unique STAT6 binding sites after IL-4 induction.
