TITLE
Transcriptional profile of human white adipocytes (hMADS cells) after white-to-brown conversion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed at determining the transcriptional changes associated with the white-to-brown conversion of human mesenchymal adipose-derived stem cells firstly differentiated into white adipocytes (in the presence of rosiglitazone from day 2 to day 9). White differentiation was completed within 14 days, and PPARg (rosiglitazone) or PPARa (GW7647) agonists were added to the medium for 4 additional days to induce the brown phenotype. Cells were harvested at day 18 and processed for microarray experiments (Agilent).

DESIGN
All samples were co-hybridized with a reference pool of RNA from hMADS cells at D9 of differentiation. Four samples of each condition (control, rosiglitazone- and GW7647-treated cells) obtained in 4 independent experiments were used.
