TITLE
Expression data of E. histolytica trophozoites treated with 5AzaC

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of treatment of E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS trophozoites with 5-Aza cytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase Keywords: drug treatment

DESIGN
HM1 trophozoites were treated for 3 or 7 days with 23 micromolar 5-Aza cytidine, and RNA extracted and analyzed on a custom  Affymetrix array. Data from these two arrays is to be compared to expression data from HM1 trophozoites grown without drug exposure.

PLATFORM
