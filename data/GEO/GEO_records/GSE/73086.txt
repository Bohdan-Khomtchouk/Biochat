TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of ∆scnAB in Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10

ORGANISM
Streptomyces chattanoogensis

SUMMARY
scnA (GenBank: ADX66464.1) and scnB (GenBank: ADX66465.1) are ABC transporters located in the biosysnthesis gene cluster of natamycin in Streptomyces chattanoogensis. The two genes are presumbly involved in natamycin efflux. Our goal of this expriment was to investigate the effect of scnA and scnB inactivation on the gene expression in the whole genome. In ∆scnAB  there were a total of 219 genes displaying at least a two-fold change (P < 0.05), including 89 genes with lower and 130 genes with higher expressions

DESIGN
In this study, RNA isolated from ∆scnAB or wild type Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10, was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8,117 protein-coding genes in S. chattanoogensis L10, leading to the successful construction of different expression profiles between scnA and scnB deletion mutant and wild type S. chattanoogensis L10.
