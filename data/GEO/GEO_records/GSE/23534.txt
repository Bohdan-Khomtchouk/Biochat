TITLE
Effect of hIAPP aggregation on gene expression by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages after 12 hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine changes in gene expression by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with synthetic human vs. rodent islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Synthetic human IAPP at 15 uM aggregates to form fibrils in vitro, whereas rodent IAPP is non-amyloidogenic. We hypothesized that interaction of macrophages with human IAPP aggregates can activate pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in macrophages, as described for other amyloidogenic peptides.

DESIGN
This array includes eight samples from one experiment, with two groups of four replicates each. Each replicate represents BMDMs from one well of a 24-well plate. The control group was treated with 15 uM rat IAPP for 12 hours prior to total RNA extraction; the experimental group was treated with 15 uM human IAPP.
