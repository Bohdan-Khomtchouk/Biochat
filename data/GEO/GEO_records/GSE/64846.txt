TITLE
Gene expression data from control and REPTOR (=CG13624) KO male adults

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify genes whose transcription is induced or repressed by REPTOR (=CG13624) KO in Drosophila melanogaster male adults. Data are part of the manuscript REPTOR and REPTOR-BP regulate organismal metabolism and transcription downstream of mTORC1

DESIGN
2 biological replicates from 2 conditions: Control adult males / REPTOR KO adult males ; 4 samples

PLATFORM
GPL16820 Agilent-021791 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K v. 2 (Probe Name version)
