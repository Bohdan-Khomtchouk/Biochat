TITLE
A translatable predictor of human radiation injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of a biodosimetric assay based on the combined gene expression analysis of ex vivo-irradiated human peripheral blood (PB) and humans treated with total body irradiation has been developed.  Gene expression profile signature of human radiation injury into a rapid and high-throughput chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (CLPA) has been shown to discriminate 6 radiation dose levels in human PB.  Candidate gene lists were first developed assaying human ex vivo and human TBI samples on the Affymetrix platform.

DESIGN
For the Ex Vivo samples, healthy consented adult donor was randomly assigned to a radiation group and labeled with the target dose of 0 cGy, 150 cGy, 300 cGy, or 600 cGy.  In addition to the radiation exposures, the samples were also treated with either no treatment, GCSF, or LPS at time points 6 hours and 24 hours.  Radiation expire times from the Cs137 irradiator were calculated to achieve target doses specific for tubes filled with blood and inserted in the roaring test tube holder.  The dose rate was 480 cGy/min for the duration of the study. The healthy donors were enrolled to participate in this study following a protocol to collect PB samples that was previously approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board. For the TBI samples, adult patients, ages 21 to 66, were evaluated at the Duke University Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Program enrolled in a Duke IRB-approved protocol to collect PB prior to and post TBI conditioning.  With approval from the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB), between 5-12 mL of peripheral blood was collected from consented patients prior to and 6 hours following TBI with 150-200 cGy as part of their pre-transplantation conditioning.  All patients receiving non-myeloablative conditioning were treated with 200 cGy of TBI from a linear accelerator at a dose rate of 20 cGy/min. All patients who underwent TBI-based myeloablative allogeneic or autologous stem-cell transplantation received radiation fractionated at 150 cGy per fraction at 20 cGy/min. All patients had PB collected (50 ml) prior to and 6 hours following exposure to either 200 cGy or 150 cGy radiation treatment.  The dose exposure for TBI patients used in this study were 0 cGy, 150 cGy, 450 cGy and 1050 cGy at 0, 6, 30 and 78 hours post irradiation.   Total RNA was extracted and assayed on the Affymetrix platform.
