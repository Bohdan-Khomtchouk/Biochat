TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mesothelioma induced by intraperitoneal injections of ferric saccharate in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Iron plays an important role in oxidative tissue damage and subsequent carcinogenesis. Iron deposition in the peritoneum causes neoplastic changes. Here we used gene expression microarrays to find common genetic alterations in a rat model by repeated intraperitoneal injections of ferric saccharate. Gene expression microarray revealed the expression of uromodulin (Umod) is increased in mesothelioma approximately 250-fold.

DESIGN
Carcinogenesis protocol was performed using specific pathogen-free male and female F1 hybrid rats between Fischer344 and Brown-Norway strains. A total of 12 microarrays (Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarrary) were used for the screening purpose; The scraped pleural mesothelial cells of 8 week male rat untreated or peri-testicular tissue as control; Induced mesothelioma of epithelioid and sarcomatoid types.
