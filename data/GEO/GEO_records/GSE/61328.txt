TITLE
Next generation sequencing of miRNAs in folic acid-induced kidney damage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used small RNA sequencing to measure the expression of all miRNAs present in the kidneys during the development of folic acid-induced kidney injury and fibrosis. From this miRNA expression profile, we identified miRNAs associated with different stages and aspects of kidney damage.

DESIGN
BALB/c mice were injected with 250mg/kg of folic acid and kidneys were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Total RNA was prepared for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit, and analyzed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.
