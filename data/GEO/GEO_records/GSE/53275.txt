TITLE
Development of FGF2-dependent pluripotent stem cells showing naïve state characteristics from murine preimplantation inner cell mass

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A unique embryonic stem cells showing naïve state was established from primplantation mouse blastocyst but maintaind their self renew under FGF2 stimulus condition We used microarray to compare gene expression patterns of our pluripotent stem cell line (named FGF-ESC) with ESCs or EpiSCs in addition to inner cell mass from E3.5 preimplantation blastocyst as in vivo control.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from FGF-ESC, ESC, EpiSC and  inner cell mass from E3.5 preimplantation blastocyst, and served for microarray analysis using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 Array
