TITLE
Transcriptional response to stress in serum deprived mouse fibroblasts in the presence of MSK1/2 inhibitor.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed gene expression profiling in order to identify targets of transcriptional response to stress in resting mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, either untreated (control) or treated with anisomycin for 3 or 6 hours to induce the p38/MAP kinase pathway.Â In order determine transcriptional effects dependent on MSK1/2 kinase activity, H89 inhibitor was used in the study.

DESIGN
Serum starved (72 h 0.2% FCS) mouse 3T3 cells were treated with anisomycin (188.5 nM) for 3 h or 6h (in duplicates) either with or without 15-min pre-treatment with MSK1/2 inhibitor H89 (10 uM). Untreated, serum-starved cells were used as a control. RNA was collected and gene expression profiling using strand-specific RNA-seq was performed.
