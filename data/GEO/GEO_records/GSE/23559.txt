TITLE
The role of dietary leucine and dairy protein on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarray to determine the differences in hepatic gene expression for diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats consuming different dietary proteins.  Proteins of interest included skim milk powder (dairy), casein, and the branched-chain amino acid, leucine. The primary aims of this study were: (i) to compare the effects of diets with protein derived from casein, casein supplemented with leucine, and complete dairy on body composition and insulin sensitivity; and (ii) to determine if there is a synergistic effect of dietary Ca and protein source on body composition and insulin sensitivity.  Secondarily, we used microarray analysis to examine the effect of casein, leucine, or complete dairy containing diets on the expression of hepatic genes related to lipid and glucose metabolism.
