TITLE
Transcriptome data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving fingolimod therapy [HTA-2_0, CD19+ cells, gene level]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the gene expression patterns of different blood cell types before and during fingolimod treatment in a group of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Arrays (HTA) 2.0 were used to obtain gene expression profiles of immune cell populations from 10 RRMS patients within the first 3 months of fingolimod treatment. This GEO entry provides the Affymetrix HTA 2.0 microarray data of peripheral blood CD19+ cells, preprocessed according to the gene level workflow.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first and second fingolimod administration as well as after 3 months of therapy. Total RNA of CD19+ cells positively selected from each blood sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to high-density Affymetrix HTA 2.0 microarrays to quantify the transcript levels.
