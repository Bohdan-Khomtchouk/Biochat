TITLE
Genome-wide detection by array CGH of copy number variations among diverse horse breeds

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Investigating genome-wide characteristics of CNVs in 6 horses representing 6 distinct breeds by using the aCGH method and performed GO and KEGG analysis for the CNVs genes.This result is an important complement to the mapping of horse whole-genome CNVs and helpful to study plateau horses’ adaption to the plateau’s environment.

DESIGN
Comparison Mongolia horse , Abaga horse, Hequ horse, Kazakh horse, Debao pony, Thoroughbred with Thoroughbred

PLATFORM
