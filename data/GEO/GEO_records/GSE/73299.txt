TITLE
Global hepatic gene expression data from PPARa liver KO, PPARa liver WT, PPARaKO and WT male mice fed ad libitum, fasted for 24 hours and re-fed

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
If the function of the nuclear receptor PPARa is well-known during a prolongated fasting, its hepatic biological function during feeding and refeeding conditions still needs to be investigated. Moreover, in vivo data collected so far on PPARa function during fasting were obtained using the total Ppara KO transgenic mouse model. To identify genes whose expression is under the strict dependence of hepatic PPARa activity, we generated a new mouse strain of PPARa-specific deletion in hepatocyte (albumin-Cre+/- Pparaflox/flox or LKO) and we compared them to total Ppara KO (KO), wild-type (WT) and liver WT (albumin-Cre-/- Pparaflox/flox or LWT) mice under three nutritional challenges. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver of Ppara LKO, LWT, Ppara KO and WT male mice fed ad libitum, fasted for 24 hours and refed.

DESIGN
There are 52 liver samples, each from an individual mouse. The samples are from Ppara liver KO (LKO), Ppara KO (KO), wild-type (WT) and liver WT (LWT) male mice of 8 week-old from the same genetic background (C57Bl/6J) fed ad libitum, fasted for 24 hours, fasted for 24 hours and then refed 24 hours more with glucose added in water (200g/l). In fed condition (Fed), n= 3 mice for LKO, LWT genotypes, n= 5 for KO and n= 4 fot WT; in fasting condition (Fas), n=5 for LKO, LWT and WT genotypes and n= 3 for KO; in refeeding condition (Ref), n= 5 for LKO, KO and WT genotypes and n= 4 for LWT. All mice were sacrified at ZT14.
