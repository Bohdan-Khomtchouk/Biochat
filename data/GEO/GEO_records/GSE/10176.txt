TITLE
Inducible repositioning of genes to the inner nuclear membrane

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nuclear compartmentalization appears to play an important role in regulating metazoan genes. While studies on immunoglobulin (Ig) and other loci have correlated positioning at the nuclear lamina with gene repression, the functional consequences of this compartmentalization remain untested. We devised an approach for inducible tethering of genes to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and demonstrate with 3D DNA-ImmunoFISH, repositioning of chromosomal regions to the nuclear lamina. Relocalization requires mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown and reformation. Tethering leads to the accumulation of lamin and INM proteins but not to association with pericentromeric heterochromatin or nuclear pore complexes. Recruitment of genes to the INM can result in their transcriptional repression. Using DamID we show that as is the case for our model system, inactive Ig loci at the nuclear periphery are contacted by INM and lamina components. We propose that such molecular interactions are used to compartmentalize and limit the accessibility of Ig loci. Keywords: Inducible

DESIGN
We used microarray to analyze the transcription status of genomic regions are inducibly tethered to the INM
