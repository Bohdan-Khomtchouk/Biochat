TITLE
Gene expression data of mRNA from skeletal muscle sample of pig DL and Pi breed

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The skeletal muscle development in swine begins at embryogenesis. Simultaneously, 24,123 probe-sets were screened, analysed for differential expression between different breeds (german landrace and pietrain) at different stages of development (35, 63, 91 dpc and adult stage).

DESIGN
RNAs of skeletal muscle from german landrace and pietrain at 35, 63, 91 dpc and adult stages were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome Array.
