TITLE
An RNAi screen probing signaling control of human embryonic stem cells establishes the cell cycle-regulated restriction of the exit from pluripotency (CCNB1 overexpression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of Cyclin B1 overexpression on differentiating hESCs at the gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Cyclin B1 overexpression prevents the exit from pluripotency in hESCs. Results provide important information on the effect of Cyclin B1 on hESCs, such as changes in expression of TGFb-related genes and pluripotency markers, as well as mesodermic and neuroectodermic genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CCNB1 overexpressing hESCs incubated in medium without bFGF and TGF-beta for 0, 48 and 96 hours.
