SUMMARY
Cotton ovule development, mutant vs wild type, Comparisons of DP16 0 dpa ovule Keywords: WildType vs Mutant

DESIGN
7 comparisons and one 0 dpa control. The 1A/DP16 & 4A/DP16 comparisons have 8 slides each, 4 Biological replicates, each biological replicate having 2 technical replicates. Dyes were swapped between technical replicates. The SL1-7-1/DP16 comparison has 6 slides, 3 Biological replicates, each biological replicate having 2 technical replicates. Dyes were swapped between technical replicates. The 5B/DP16, fl/Xu-142, OI/II+N & 53/DP16 comparisons have 4 slides each, 2 Biological replicates, each biological replicate having 2 technical replicates. Dyes were swapped between technical replicates. The 0 dpa control experiment has 3 slides , 3 Biological replicates, no technical replicates and no dye swapping.
