TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (pRDNA7) butyrate stress (0.6%)

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
An intergenic region found to be enriched from a genomic library under butyrate stress was overexpressed and challenged with butyrate (0.6%). The overexpression strain was compared to the plasmid control to determine the transcriptional changes due to overexpression and butyrate stress.

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from both the overexpression strain (pRDNA7) and the plasmid control strain (pSOS95del) at 0, 15, 40, 120, 240, and 360 min post a 0.6% butyrate (pH 6.7) stress. Two slides per timepoint were hybridized on a dye swap configuration.
