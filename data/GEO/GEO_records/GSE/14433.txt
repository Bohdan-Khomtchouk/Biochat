TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (pRDNA7) butyrate stress (0.6%)

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824

SUMMARY
An intergenic region found to be enriched from a genomic library under butyrate stress was overexpressed and challenged with butyrate (0.6%). The overexpression strain was compared to the plasmid control to determine the transcriptional changes due to overexpression and butyrate stress.
