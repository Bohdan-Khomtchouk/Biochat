TITLE
Comparative profiling of Tcl1 gene disruptants and Tcl1 stable transformants.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tcl1 is one of embryonic stem cell specific transcripts identified by digital differential display analysis. Tcl1 is highly expressed during early embryogenesis and to some extent in embryonic stem cells. Its expression in adult tissues is restricted to testis and ovary, and is found to decline if Oct-3/4 expression is suppressed in embryonic stem cells. It is reported that the female knockout mice exhibit reduced fertility. It was first identified in human T-cell tumors and the tumorigenic property was proved by a series of transgenic studies. We have used DNA microarray to identify potential Tcl1 targets in embryonic stem cells and the influence of Tcl1 on stemness. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
We analyzed two arrays, each comparing expression profiles of a Tcl1 gene disruptant and a Tcl1 stable transformant. We used different clones with their dyes swapped.(biological replication)
