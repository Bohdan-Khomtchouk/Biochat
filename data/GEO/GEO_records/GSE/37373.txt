TITLE
Expression data of rhabdoid tumor cell line A204 treated with HDAC-inhibitor SAHA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rhabdoid tumors are a highly aggressive pediatric tumor entity affecting infants and very young children. These tumors do not respond to conventional type chemotherapy. In recent approaches epigenetic compounds has been effective to inhibit cell growth of these tumors. Using microarray analysis we detect mechanism which are responsible for cell death induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors.

DESIGN
A204 rhaboid tumor cell lines were treated for 12h with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA
