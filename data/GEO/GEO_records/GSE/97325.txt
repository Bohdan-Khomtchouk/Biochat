TITLE
RocA regulates gene expression in serotype M1 group A Strep (GAS, aka S. pyogenes)

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to assess whether the rocA gene regulates gene expression in M1 GAS

DESIGN
Parental M1 isolate MGAS2221, rocA mutant derivative 2221ΔrocA, and the complemented mutant derivative 2221ΔrocA + pRocA-M1 were compared following THY growth by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL19982 Illumina MiSeq (Streptococcus pyogenes)
