TITLE
Gene expression profiles of retinoblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the gene targets of frequently altered chromosomal regions in retinoblastoma, a meta-analysis of genome-wide copy number alterations studies on primary retinoblastoma tissue and retinoblastoma cell lines was performed. Published studies were complemented by copy number and gene expression analysis on primary and cell line samples of retinoblastoma. This dataset includes the gene expression data of the retinoblastoma cell lines

DESIGN
This data set contains the gene expression (Affymetrix human genome u133 plus 2.0 PM) results for 7 unique retinoblastoma cell lines. For one of the 7 unique cell lines, 3 RNA isolations were performed and were profiled on seperate arrays, adding up to 9 unique array files. Copy number data for primary retinoblastoma (tumor and blood DNA) and retinoblastoma cell lines are available (controlled-access) at the European Genomics Archive. Gene expression data of primary retinoblastoma is available under GSE59983. The GSE59983 records represent the primary tissue gene expression data and the CN data will be deposited into a controlled-access database, probably EGA.
