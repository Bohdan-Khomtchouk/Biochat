TITLE
ATAC-seq data in mouse and zebrafish limbs

ORGANISM
Danio rerio ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assay for Transposable Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) reveals a genome wide view of areas of open chromatin at very high resolution, which are often associated with regulatory activity.

DESIGN
The ATAC-seq technology uses a Tn5 transposase loaded with nex-generation sequencing primers in order to simultaneously fragment areas of open chromatin and ligate adapters.

PLATFORM
