TITLE
The genetic basis for differential macrophage activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential macrophage activation mediate genetic differences to a variety of inflammatory pathologies. We wanted to elucidate the transcriptional and regulatory programs regulating differential macrophage activation in genetically diverse mouse strains.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from AJ and C57BL/6j mice were left unstimulated, stimulated with IFN/TNF, or IL-4, or CpG, or LPS or  IFN/TNF and infected with a type II (Pru A7) strain of Toxoplasma gondii, or infected with Pru A7 and gene expression analyzed 18 hrs later.
