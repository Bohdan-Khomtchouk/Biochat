TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type(WT) and Gdf9-Cre;Kat8 fl/fl(Kat8 Gdf9 cKO)  Oocyte Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to compare oocyte transcriptome profiling in WT and Kat8 Gdf9 cKO mice Methods: Oocyte mRNA profiles of 2 weeks old WT and Kat8 Gdf9 cKO mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 54-63 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm10) and identified 18,468 transcripts in the oocytes of WT and Kat8 Gdf9 cKO mice. Approximately 5% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Kat8 Gdf9 cKO oocyte, with a fold change â‰¥1.5 and p value < 0.05. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of oocyte transcriptomes after kat8 deletion, which is generated by RNA-seq technology.Our results show that Kat8 affects numerous gene expression in mouse oocytes.
