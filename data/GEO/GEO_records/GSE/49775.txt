SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5014 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Kevin White. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: The White Lab is aiming to map the association of all the Transcription Factors (TF) on the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. One technique that we use for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) utilizing an Illumina next generation sequencing platform. The data generated by ChIP-seq experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested TF.
