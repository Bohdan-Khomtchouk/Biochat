TITLE
Gene expression profiling of IR-/-, IGF-1R-/- (dKO) newborn epidermis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of newborn mouse epidermis lacking the expression of Insulin receptor (IR) and Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Results show that IR/IGF-1R signalling control epidermal morphogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from newborn mouse epidermis.Gene expression profiling was on on Affymetrix 430-2.0 platform.
