TITLE
Effect of over-expression of AR-V7 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of transient transfection of a construct designed to over-express the androgen receptor (AR) variant AR-V7 on gene expression in MDA-MB-453 cells was assessed using Affymetrix Gene 2.0 ST arrays. Transfection of an AR-expressing construct or an empty construct served as controls.

DESIGN
AR-V7, AR or empty vector was transfected into MDA-MB-453 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle control or DHT.

PLATFORM
