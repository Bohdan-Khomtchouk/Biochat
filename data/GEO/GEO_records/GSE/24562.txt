TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by XOct-25 overexpression in Xenopus ectoderm

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The Xenopus POU class V transcription factor XOct-25 has been shown to inhibit BMP-dependent epidermal differentiation and promote neural induction in the ectoderm during early embryogenesis.  In order to identify genes that act downstream of XOct-25, transcriptional profile of Xenopus ectodermal cells overexpressing XOct-25 was compared with control cells by using a DNA microarray method.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments.  Each experiment contains ectodermal cells overexpressing XOct-25 and corresponding control cells.  Xenopus embryos were injected at the 8-cell stage with mRNA encoding GR-XOct-25, a hormone-inducible version of XOct-25.  Explants from stage 9 embryos were treated with or without dexamethazone (DEX) until the sibling embryos reached stage 10.5, when they were used for RNA extraction.  The explants cultured without DEX was used as a control sample. biological replicates: Sample name XOct-exp 1, Sample name XOct-exp 2
