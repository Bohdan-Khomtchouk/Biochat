TITLE
Cry2 and Fbxl3 promote circadian destruction of c-Myc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of gene expression changes caused by genetic deletion of Cry2 in MEFs with samples collected over a 24 hour time course after circadian synchronization

DESIGN
Primary wildtype and Cry2-/- MEFs derived from littermate embryos were treated with dexamethasone to synchronize circadian rhythms. Samples were collected in quadruplicate every four hours for 24 hours.
