TITLE
Identification of maternal imprinting control regions (ICRs) in the post-implantation mouse embryo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomewide DNA methylation profiles, generated by MeDIP-seq, for 8.5dpc wildtype and Dnmt3l-/+ mouse embryos were compared to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that depend on the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferase cofactor Dnmt3l in the oocyte. These DMRs were further characterised by their methylation state in mature mouse sperm and in the livers of inter-subspecies newborn mice. Maternal ICRs were identified by hypomethylation in Dnmt3l-/+ embryos as well as sperm, and maternal allele-specific methylation in liver.

DESIGN
MeDIP-seq for two pools of wildtype and two pools of Dnmt3l-/+ mouse 8.5dpc embryos, the sperm of three sires, and 12 pools of three different embryonic livers each. Sliding window read count comparison between wildtype and Dnmt3l-/+ embryos, and between wildtype embryos and sperm samples. Read count comparison between the parental alleles at known SNP sites in inter-subspecies liver data.
