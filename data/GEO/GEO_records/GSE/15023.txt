TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of peracetic acid on Mycobacterium bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Mycobacterium bovis BCG GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Mycobacterium bovis BCG to Peracetic acid, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Peracetic acid. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three Peracetic acid-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 10 and 20 min exposures.
