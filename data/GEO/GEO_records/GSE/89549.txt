TITLE
RNA-Seq Analysis of the Transcriptomes of Tomato+ and Tomato- HNSCC cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of this study is to compare the global gene expression profiles between Bmi1+ Cancer stem cells and Bmi1- cancer cells

DESIGN
Oral cancer from Bmi1CreER;tdTomato mouse treated with 4NQO for 26 weeks were havested 24 hr after tamoxifen injection. Tumor tissues were dissociated into single cell suspension and FACS-sorted based on the tomato expression. mRNA were isolated from sorted cells and RNAseq were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL21493 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Mus musculus)
