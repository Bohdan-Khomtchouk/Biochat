TITLE
Microarray-based gene expression profiles of silkworm brains

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Molecular genetic studies of Bombyx mori have led to profound advances in understanding the regulation of development. Bombyx mori brain, as a main endocrine organ, plays important regulatory roles in various biological processes. The microarray technology will allow the genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in silkworm brains. We reported microarray-based gene expression profiles in silkworm brains at four stages including V7, P1, P2 and P3. A total of 4,550 genes were transcribed in at least one selected stage. Of these, clustering algorithms separated the expressed genes into stable expressed genes and variable expressed genes. The results of the gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of stable expressed genes showed that the ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were principal pathways. Secondly, four clusters of genes with significantly different expression patterns were observed in the 1,175 variable expressed genes. Thirdly, thirty-two neuropeptide hormones genes, nine neuropeptide-like precursor genes, and 117 cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected developmental stages. The present study deÔ¨Åned major characteristics of the transcriptional profiles in the brains of Bombyx mori at the specific development stages. Our data will provide abundant information that will be useful in future research.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling experiments, 4 developmental stages (samples) were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with test samples labeled by Cy5 and common reference samples labeled by Cy3. Common reference sample was used for data normalization. One Biological replicate. No dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
