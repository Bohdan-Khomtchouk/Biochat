TITLE
Genome wide analysis of genes expressed in early G1 phase of the cell cycle in PMCA4 wild type and PMCA4 knockout primary vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Husain lab cell proliferation in vitro experimental data showed a G1 arrest in PMCA4 knockout primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This microarray documents the different gene expression profiles of PMCA4 wild type and knockout cells at the early G1 stage in serum synchronized cell populations (n=4 populations for each genotype).

DESIGN
Serum synchronized cell populations were Hoechst labeled and flow sorted for early G1 sub-populations (PMCA4 WT n=4; PMCA4 KO n=4) and total RNA from sorted cells was used for microarray analysis.
