TITLE
Th2 responses are primed by skin dendritic cells with distinct transcriptional profiles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cell subsets purified from skin-draining lymph nodes of C57BL/6J mice following intradermal injection of  non-viable Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) or topical application of Dibutyl Phthalate-FITC. Results provide insight into the genetic programme induced in DC exposed to Th2 stimuli.

DESIGN
CD11b+, TN and CD103+ (Nb only) migratory DC subsets were flow sorted from skin-draining lymph nodes following treatment with Th2 stimuli or respective controls. Three independent replicates were generated for each DC population from pooled lymph nodes in three independent flow cytometry sorting experiments.
