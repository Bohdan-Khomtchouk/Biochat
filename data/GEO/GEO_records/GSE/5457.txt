Retinoic Acids Exposure Alters TGFbeta1 -Induced Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition via Wnt5b expression.

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a refractory and lethal interstitial lung disease; EBV has previously been localised to alveolar epithelial cells of IPF patients. The molecular process of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in IPF remains still unknown. Using an oligonucleotide array analysis, we observed dysregulated expression of members of non-canonical Wnt family in EBV infected A549 after TGF?1 exposure. TGF?1 exposure induced EMT increasing ?-Smooth Muscle Actin (ACTC) and Wnt5b gene expression, but decreasing E-cadherin and DKK1. When data were analyzed as a function of Wnt5b in EMT, significance differences in ACTC and E-cadherin gene expression, active TGF?1 protein levels and collagen deposition could be detected. Treatment with 9-cis Retinoic Acid (9-cisRA) significantly inhibited Wnt5b expression in both EBV infected and non-infected A549, followed by decreased collagen deposition and active TGF?1 protein level. Specific non-canonical Wnt-signalling genes are dysregulated in EBV infected cells and A549 treated with TGF?1; while, 9-cisRA treatment appears to attenuate EMT process in vitro. Keywords: EBV infection, EMT and non-canonical Wnt pathway in A549 detected by oligonucleotide array
