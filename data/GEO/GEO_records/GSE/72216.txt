TITLE
Spatial-temporal order of regulation in tomato early fruit development

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Early fruit development is crucial for crop production in tomato. After fertilization, the ovary undergoes a cell division and a cell expansion stages before maturation. Although the roles of regulatory signals such as hormone and carbohydrate during early fruit development have been studied, the spatial distribution and the sequential initiation of these regulatory signals is still poorly understood. Using the cultivated tomato “Moneymaker” as materials, we analyzed the transcriptome of the ovule and the ovary wall dissected from the different stages of the early developing fruits. These datasets provide us the whole picture about the spatial and temporal signal distribution of fruit formation which has not been studied in such a detailed manner. Our results suggest that the hormone signal was initiated in both ovule and ovary wall after fertilization. After that, the different signals were activated in ovule and ovary wall due to their distinct developmental processes. By analyzing the global expression profiling of hormone related genes, we found that the auxin might be synthesized in both ovule and ovary wall after fertilization. The expression pattern of sugar related genes revealed the different carbohydrate metabolism events occurred in ovule and ovary wall. At last, we identified a gene showed tissue and stage specific expression pattern and localized in previously reported fruit weight locus which might be selected during tomato breeding.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of ovule and ovary wall/pericarp tissues in four stages of tomato early developing fruits
