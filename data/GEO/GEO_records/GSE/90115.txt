TITLE
Gene expression data in Huh-7 cell line transfected with HBeAg-expression vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of HBeAg has been linked to an increased risk of HBV-realted HCC. However, the biological role of HBeAg in modulating host gene expression is poorly understood. Therefore, we performed a cDNA microarray in response to presence of HBeAg in Huh-7 cells. We used human primeview gene expression microarray chips to assess the host cellular mRNA expression profile in response to HBeAg in Huh7 cells

DESIGN
The total RNA from Huh-7 cells transfected with control and HBeAg-expression vector was harvested 48 hours post transfection and mRNA profiling was done human primeview gene chips.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
