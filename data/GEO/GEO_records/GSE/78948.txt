TITLE
Sox2 is the determining oncogenic switch in promoting lung squamous cell carcinoma from different cells-of-origin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of lung is a devastating malignancy with no effective  treatments, due to its complex genomic profile. Therefore, pre-clinical models  mimicking its salient features are urgently needed. Here we describe mouse models  bearing various combinations of genetic lesions predominantly found in human SCC.  We show that Sox2 but not Fgfr1 overexpression in tracheobronchial basal cells  combined with Cdkn2ab and Pten loss results in SCC closely resembling the human  counterpart. Interestingly, Sox2;Pten;Cdkn2ab mice develop SCC with a more  peripheral location when Club or Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are targeted. Our model  highlights the essential role of Sox2 in promoting a squamous cell fate from different  cells-of-origin and represents an invaluable tool for the developing better intervention  strategies.

DESIGN
After RNA extraction and Bioanalyzer analysis, we processed samples with high quality RNA profiles using Illumina Hiseq2500.
