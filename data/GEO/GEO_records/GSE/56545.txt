TITLE
mRNA profiling  of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did mRNA profiling and  showed that an interferon-inducible gene's deletion and under-expression is significantly associated with shorter time to tumor recurrence, shorter progression-free survival, and shorter overall survival in  HCC patients.

DESIGN
We got the samples from HCC patients' matched primary and recurrent tumors (n=10) and primary tumors from non-recurrent patients (n=15), we conducted the RNAseq of those samples, and did the comparison.
