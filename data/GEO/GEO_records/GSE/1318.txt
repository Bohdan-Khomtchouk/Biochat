TITLE
Myb specificity determinants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recombinant adenovirus vectors were used to express wild type or domain swap mutants of A-Myb and c-Myb transcription factors in MCF-7 cells or pimary lung epithelial cells or fibroblasts. The results show that Myb proteins have extreme context specificity and identify sub-domains responsible for the activation of specific sets of target genes. Keywords = Myb proteins Keywords = oncogenes Keywords = transcription Keywords = gene activation Keywords: ordered
