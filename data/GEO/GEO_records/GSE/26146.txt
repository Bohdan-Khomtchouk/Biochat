TITLE
Expression data from cultured human lung tissue-derived fibroblasts and human vascular adventitial fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to find the difference between human lung tissue-derived fibroblasts and human vascular adventitial fibroblasts for enhancing tumor formation ablity of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, we found that human vascular adventitial fibroblasts enhance A549 tumor formation in vivo compared to human lung tissue-derived fibroblasts.  To find the responsible genes for this phenomena, we used microarray analysis to find the expression difference between lung tissue-derived fibroblasts and vascular adventitial fibroblas

DESIGN
Cultured human lung tissue-derived fibroblasts and human vascular adventitial fibroblasts were analyzed in replicates.
