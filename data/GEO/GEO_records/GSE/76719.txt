TITLE
Gene expression data from lung of mice infected with H5N1 or H1N1 virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find the different host response during H5N1 and H1N1 infection, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes differentially expressed in mouse lungs infected by H5N1 and H1N1 virus. BALB/c mice were infected with live H5N1 virus , live H1N1 virus, or inactivated H5N1 virus or allantoic fluid (AF) for 24 h.

DESIGN
Mice were  intra-tracheally  inoculated with 106 TCID50 of live H5N1 virus or an identical volume of inactivated H5N1 virus , 106 TCID50 of live H1N1 virus, or allantoic fluid (AF). After 24 hours, lungs were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.H5N1 and H1N1 virus induced gene expression in mouse was measured. This experiment was performed with 3 mice in each group.
