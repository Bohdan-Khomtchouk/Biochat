TITLE
Cell-specific gene expression in Anabaena variabilis grown phototrophically, mixotrophically, and heterotrophically

ORGANISM
Trichormus variabilis ATCC 29413

SUMMARY
For the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis to grow without combined nitrogen, certain cells differentiate into heterocysts that fix N2, while vegetative cells perform photosynthesis. Much remains unknown on how heterocysts differ from vegetative cells in terms of carbon and energy metabolisms. Microarrays were used to investigate gene transcription patterns in vegetative cells, heterocysts, and filaments of N2-fixing phototrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic cultures.

DESIGN
Hybridizations used NimbleGen expression array chips (Product no. A4385-00-01, platform accession no GPL15883) designed against the 5,657 ORFs encoded in the A. variabilis genome (GenBank accession no. CP000117). Each ORF was represented by seventeen 60-mer oligonucleotides. Each oligonucleotide was present in four internal replicates. The twenty-seven microarray data files were normalized against each other. Expression array data were analyzed using ArrayStar 3.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI).
