TITLE
SRA of transcriptome of Hevea brasiliensis

ORGANISM
Hevea brasiliensis

SUMMARY
We first report the use of next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies and de novo transcriptome assembly to gain insight into the wide range of transcriptome of Hevea brasiliensis. The output of sequenced data showed that more than 12 million sequence reads with average length of 90nt were generated. Totally 48,768 unigenes (mean size = 488 bp) were assembled through transcriptome de novo assembly, which represent more than 3-fold of all the sequences of Hevea brasiliensis deposited in the GenBank. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology and clusters of orthologous group terms. Total 37,373 unigenes were successfully annotated and more than 10% of unigenes were aligned to known proteins of Euphorbiaceae. The unigenes contain nearly complete collection of known rubber-synthesis-related genes. Our data provides the most comprehensive sequence resource available for study rubber tree and demonstrates the availability of Illumina sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly in a species lacking genome information.
