TITLE
Expression data of HUVEC cells after statin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, are known to exert endothelial athero-protective effects through the induction of specific transcriptional factors and their downstream target genes besides lowering LDL-cholesterol.  However its critical mechanism has not still been elucidated.  Here we report the comprehensive change of transcripts induced by pitavastatin. We used repeated microarray analysis of HUVECs treated with pitavastatin for 4-hours, we identified a group of consistently up - or down - regulated genes.

DESIGN
HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.  For studies, HUVECs were cultivated in medium EGM2MV containing pitavastatin at a concentration of 1 Î¼M, and same concentration of DMSO was used as a control sample.
