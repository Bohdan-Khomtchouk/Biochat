TITLE
Expression profiling by array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate the global program of gene expression in human differentiating monocytes in the presence of the bio-active from of vitamin D.

DESIGN
Human CD14+ monocytes were isolated from PBMCs of healhty donors and cultured in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8M) or ethanol for 4h or 24h. Total RNA was then isolated and analyzed by microarray. Four monocytic preparations from different healthy donors were used.
