TITLE
GSK3 activates telomerase by regulating dynamic behaviour of multiple transcription factors converging on the hTERT gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Telomerase controls cell immortality and is a promising cancer target. Understanding transcriptional regulation of the catalytic subunit hTERT is critical to realise effective telomerase therapeutics. GSK3 inhibition suppresses hTERT expression.
