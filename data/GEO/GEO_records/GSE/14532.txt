TITLE
GSK3 activates telomerase by regulating dynamic behaviour of multiple transcription factors converging on the hTERT gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Telomerase controls cell immortality and is a promising cancer target. Understanding transcriptional regulation of the catalytic subunit hTERT is critical to realise effective telomerase therapeutics. GSK3 inhibition suppresses hTERT expression.

DESIGN
A2780 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells were cultured continuously for 21 days in the presence of DMSO or 2.5mM GSK3 inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-3â€™-oxime (BIO) with replenishment weekly on days 1 and 4. Cells were subcultured, counted, and RNA samples taken.

PLATFORM
