TITLE
Mutations in the SHANK2 synaptic scaffolding gene in autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and mental retardation (MR) represent clinically distinct neurodevelopmental disorders with a complex genetic etiology. Using microarrays we identified de novo copy number variations in the SHANK2 synaptic scaffolding gene in two unrelated ASD and MR patients; DNA sequencing of SHANK2 revealed additional variants including a de novo nonsense mutation and 7 rare inherited changes. Our findings further link common genes between ASD and intellectual disability.

DESIGN
We analyzed a patients with autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation (with their related parents) using whole genome SNP arrays.
