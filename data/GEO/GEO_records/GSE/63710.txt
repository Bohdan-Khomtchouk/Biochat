TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human embryonic stem cells, human neural stem cells and human foreskin fibroblast.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To address the question of whether v-myc modifies the stemness and potency of hNSCs, we first studied the expression of 90 genes related to stemness, self-renewal and differentiation in several v-myc immortalized cell lines (hNS1, hVM1, hCTX), non-immortalized neurospheres (hNPC derived from 9.5 and 10 weeks-old fetuses), hESCs (H9 and HS181) and human foreskin fibroblasts (hFF-1).

DESIGN
A hierarchical clustering was performed to group the cell lines under study in accordance with their gene expression profiles. The gene expression data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to verify gene expression differences and generate discrete groups among the studied cell lines, according to the genes that contributed most to each separation (component).
