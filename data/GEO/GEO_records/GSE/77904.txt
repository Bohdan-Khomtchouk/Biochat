TITLE
A network of paralogous stress response transcription factors in the human pathogen Candida glabrata

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
We conducted a network-based analysis of the seven transcription factors belonging to the Yap (Yeast AP1) family in Candida glabrata.

DESIGN
We performed ChIPseq experiments using myc-tagged versions of each factor. For CgYap1, CgYap2, CgYap3, CgYap4/6 and CgYap5, we submitted the corresponding tagged strains to stress conditions known to induce full activity of their S. cerevisiae orthologues, i.e. oxidative stress cause by metalloide for Yap1, cadmium for Yap2, salt excess for Yap4/6 and iron excess for Yap5.
