TITLE
Small RNA analysis of Piwi-induced permanently silent transgenic strains

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Small RNA libraries from total RNA isolated from  adult animals

DESIGN
Small RNA libraries were derived from genetically identical strains carrying a 21Usensor transgene in single copy. In one strain the transgene has become permanently silent and is not reactivated by RNAi against prg-1 (RNAe). In the other the transgene reactivates upon RNAi against prg-1.
