TITLE
Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [MeRIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many transcriptional and epigenetic networks must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming.  Here, we explore the role of Zfp217 as a key transcriptional factor in maintaining ES cell self-renewal by performing meRIP analysis in control and Zfp217-depleted mouse stem cells.

DESIGN
Examination of m6A levels from total RNA in control and Zfp217 shRNA infected mouse stem cells
