TITLE
Transcriptional signature of Drosophila wing disc regeneration

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Research on the ability of certain organisms to reconstruct missing structures of their bodies is still in its infancy, despite numerous efforts performed in multiple species. Using expression profile analyses on different timepoints that cover wound healing and regeneration processes (0, 24 and 72 hours post injury), we studied the regenerative behaviour of fragmented wing imaginal discs of D. melanogaster implanted into adult flies. First, through the comparison between cut and intact discs, we identified the effect of implantation on the regeneration process. Filtering this information, we then constructed the specific early regeneration gene signature of wing discs in which multiple transcription factors, immune response genes and members of the JNK, Notch and WNT signaling pathways seem to play an important role. We next compared the transcriptomes of discs 24 and 72 hours after fragmentation to characterize the regenerative machinery and observed a temporal decrease in the cellular metabolic processes, RNA processing and gene expression machinery, suggesting the discs normal activity was stopped on this first interval of time in response to injury and implantation offences. Based on the expression patterns, we elaborated a catalogue of genes involved in wing disc regeneration divided into four classes (wound healing, regeneration, quick response, constant response).
