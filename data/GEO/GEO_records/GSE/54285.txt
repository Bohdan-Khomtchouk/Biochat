TITLE
Analysis of impact of Toxoplasma effector MAF1 during Type II infection in WT MEFs and during Type I  infection in WT and MAVS KO MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of the microarray experiment were to determine the role of MAF1, the Toxoplasma gondii mediator of host mitochondrial association, on host cell gene expression by comparing infection of WT cells with Type II and Type II:MAF1 parasites. We also explored the role of MAF1 on host cell gene expression by comparing profiles of WT and MAVS KO MEFs infected with Type I and Type Imaf1KO parasites. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
WT MEFs were infected with Type II and Type II:MAF1 parasites at an MOI of 5. At 8 hpi RNA was harvested using TriZol. The Affymetrix IVT (16h) express kit was used for cDNA synthesis and labeling.
