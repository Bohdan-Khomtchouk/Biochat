TITLE
Expression data of WT and Attim17-1 Arabidopsis seeds during stratification and germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The translocase of the inner membrane 17-1 (Tim17-1) plays a defined role in germination in Arabidopsis thaliana A transcriptomic analysis of Attim17-1 during seed germination

DESIGN
Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of  WT Arabidopsis seeds and  Attim17-1 seeds at 4 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points selected were:seeds following 15 days of ripening (0 h), 48 h of stratification (48 h S), followed by seed collected 6 hours into the light (6 h SL) and 24 hours into the light (24 h SL).
