TITLE
Trancriptional changes upon JMJD3 and PI3K inhibition in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examines the effects of GSK-J4, GDC0941 and MK2206 on transcriptional changes of MCF-7 cells. The hypothesis tested was that genes that are co-downregulated by each inhibitor might be required for the induction of combination therapy-induced apoptosis. Results provided important information of the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors and revealed potential biomarkers to monitor drug response and development of drug resistance.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated with 5µM GSK-J4 in combination with 1µM GDC0941 or 2µM MK2206 for 3 days. Total RNA was isolated and quantified before being amplified for microarray analysis.
