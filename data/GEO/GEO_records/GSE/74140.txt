TITLE
Gene expression of MYB wild type and MYB knockdown myeloproliferative K11bL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Low levels of MYB promote the development of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). The cell type identified that can transplant the MPN phenotype has been identified as expressing KIT, CD11b and low levels of lineage markers (K11bL). We sought to identify changes in gene expression between wild type and MYB knockdown K11bL cells to identify potential targets of MYB that play a role in the establishment of MPN.

DESIGN
4 week old male wild type and MYB knockdown mice (three mice per group) were sacrificed and Kit+CD11b+Lin-Low (K11bL) cells were sorted by FACS from their bone marrow. RNA was extracted and hybridised on Affymetrix microarrays.
