TITLE
The effects of LH ablation/replacement versus steroid ablation/replacement on gene expression in primate corpora lutea

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This study was designed to provide a genome-wide analysis of the effects of luteinizing hormone (LH) ablation/replacement versus steroid ablation/replacement on gene expression in the developed corpus luteum (CL) in primates during the menstrual cycle. Naturally cycling, female rhesus monkeys were left untreated (Control; n = 4) or received one of the following treatments for three days beginning on Day 9 of the luteal phase: daily injection of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (Antide; n = 5), Antide + recombinant human LH (A+LH; n = 4), Antide + LH + the 3b-HSD antagonist Trilostane (A+LH+TRL; n = 4), and Antide + LH + TRL + progesterone replacement with a synthetic progestin R5020 (A+LH+TRL+ R5020; n = 5). On Day 12 of the luteal phase, CL were removed and samples of RNA from individual CL were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to Affymetrixâ„¢ rhesus macaque total genome microarrays. The greatest number of altered transcripts was associated with the ablation/replacement of LH, while ablation/replacement of progestin affected fewer transcripts. Replacement of LH during Antide treatment restored expression of most transcripts to control levels. Real-time PCR validation of a subset of transcripts revealed that most expression patterns were similar between microarray and real-time PCR. Analysis of protein levels were subsequently determined for 2 of the transcripts differentially expressed by real-time PCR. This is the first genome-wide analysis of LH and steroid regulation of gene transcription in the developed primate CL. Further analysis of novel transcripts identified in this data set can clarify the relative role for LH and steroids in CL maintenance and luteolysis.
