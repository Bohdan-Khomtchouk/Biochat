TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of indica rice cultivar FR13A under salt stress condition.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A submergence tolerant indica rice cultivar FR13A, was also reported to withstand salt stress and proven in our experiments. The mechanism of tolerance is yet to be studied by forward genetics approach. However, it is known that salt stress tolerance is governed by several QTLs and not by a single gene. To understand the mechanism of such a complex mechanism of salt tolerance we selected, two indica rice genotypes namely, I) FR13A, a tolerant indica variety and ii) IR24, a susceptible genotype for this study. We used the 22K rice Oligoarray from Agilent technologies to study the transcript profile in the leaves of the two contrasting rice genotypes under constitutive and salt stress conditions at seedling stage.
