TITLE
Expression data of Medicago truncatula Jemalong A17 roots treated with auxin transport inhibitors

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Rhizobium and allied bacteria form symbiotic nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots. Plant hormones appear to play a role in nodule formation. We treated Medicago truncatula roots with auxin transport inhibitors (ATIs) N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid (NPA) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) to induce the formation of pseudonodules. We compared the transcriptional responses of M. truncatula roots treated with ATIs to roots inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti. The transcriptional response of M. truncatula roots 1 and 7 days after ATI treatment were opposite to roots treated with S. meliloti.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates were performed at each time point (1 and 7 days after treatment) for each treatment (buffer and ATI).
