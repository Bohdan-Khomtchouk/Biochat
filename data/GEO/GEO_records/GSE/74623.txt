TITLE
Transcriptional effects of forced KLF15 over-expression in mouse muscle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Excessive or sustained glucocorticoid (GC) exposure causes muscle wasting. Paradoxically, moderate or transient GC exposure elicits ergogenic effects, evidenced by their widespread use as doping agents by endurance athletes and poorly understood efficacy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic muscle wasting disease. While mechanisms underlying GC-mediated muscle wasting are well defined, the molecular basis for the latter remains unknown. In this arm of our studies, we compare expression profiles in quadriceps tissue from KLF15 transgenic (MTg) and non-Tg mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the quadriceps of KLF15 non-Tg and MTg mice and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse430A 2.0 arrays to determine transcriptional responses to forced, 5-6-fold overexpression of KLF15.
