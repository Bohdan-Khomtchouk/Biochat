TITLE
Expression analysis of leafy spurge crown buds during dormancy transitions and release.

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
This submission contains the RNAseq data from one (just the study on paradormancy release) of several studies used to assemble the leafy spurge tranacriptome. These assembled transcrptome was built from 1) A study of leafy spurge crown buds through a time course for paradormancy release induced by excision of the aerial portion of the shoot (this study). 2) A study of leafy spurge crown buds through a seasonal dormancy time course where buds transitioned from paradoprmancy to endodormancy and then to ecodormancy (Series GSE71321). 3) A study identical to #2 above but where leafy spurge plants were first treated with glyphosate (Series GSE71406). 4) A previously submitted study (Series GSE56509) of leafy spurge shoots following treament with glyphosate was also used to assemble the transcriptome.

DESIGN
The paradormancy study (#1) contained 4 time points (0hr, 6h, 1d, 3d) with 3 biological replicates at 0hr and 4 biological replicates at each of the other time points.
