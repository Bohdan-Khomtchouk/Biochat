TITLE
Expression data from human primary skeletal muscle myotubes treated with aldosterone, spironolactone, or vehicle.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test for a function effect of mineralocorticoid receptor modulation in skeletal muscle, global gene expression analysis was conducted on human myltubes treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist or antagonist.

DESIGN
9 total samples were analyzed. 3 biological replicates for each of the following treatment groups were included: 1) aldosterone; 2) spironolactone; 3) vehicle (ethanol). Pairwise comparison between groups were carried out and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
