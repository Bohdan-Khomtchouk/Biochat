TITLE
MicroRNA-mediated responses to long-term magnesium-deficiency in Citrus sinensis roots revealed by Illumina sequencing

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Background: Magnesium (Mg)-deficiency occurs most frequently in strongly acidic, sandy soils. Citrus are grown mainly on acidic and strong acidic soils. Mg-deficiency causes poor fruit quality and low fruit yield in some Citrus orchards. For the first time, we investigated Mg-deficiency-responsive miRNAs in ‘Xuegan’ (Citrus sinensis) roots using Illumina sequencing in order to obtain some miRNAs presumably responsible for Citrus Mg-deficiency tolerance. Results: We obtained 101 (69) miRNAs with increased (decreased) expression from Mg-starved roots. Our results suggested that the adaptation of Citrus roots to Mg-deficiency was related to the several aspects: (a) inhibiting root respiration and related gene expression via inducing miR158 and miR2919; (b) enhancing antioxidant system by down-regulating related miRNAs (miR780, miR6190, miR1044, miR5261 and miR1151) and the adaptation to low-phosphorus (miR6190); (c) activating transport-related genes by altering the expression of miR6190, miR6485, miR1044, miR5029 and miR3437; (d) elevating protein ubiquitination due to decreased expression levels of miR1044, miR5261, miR1151 and miR5029; (e) maintaining root growth by regulating miR5261, miR6485 and miR158 expression; and (f) triggering DNA repair (transcription regulation) by regulating miR5176 and miR6485 (miR6028, miR6190, miR6485, miR5621, miR160 and miR7708) expression. Mg-deficiency-responsive miRNAs involved in root signal transduction also had functions in Citrus Mg-deficiency tolerance. Conclusions: We obtained several novel Mg-deficiency-responsive miRNAs (i.e., miR5261, miR158, miR6190, miR6485, miR1151 and miR1044) possibly contributing to Mg-deficiency tolerance. These results revealed some novel clues on the miRNA-mediated adaptation to nutrient deficiencies in higher plants.

DESIGN
Two libraries were constructed from Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck roots subjected to 0(0 mM MgSO4，Mg-deficient，RD) or 1(Mg-sufficient,control, RS) mM MgSO4   for 16 weeks, and sequenced by Illumina sequencing. Size fractionated small RNAs (16-30 bp) from total RNA extracts was ligated to 5' and 3' adapters, and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa sequencing. The clean tags were used for further analysis.
