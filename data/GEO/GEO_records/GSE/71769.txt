TITLE
Alteration in global transcriptome after Notch inhibition with gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK003 in Glioblastoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to compare RNA transcript expression from various glioma neurospheres after treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK003.

DESIGN
Four glioma cell lines grown as neurospheres (GBM1, GBM2, GBM10 and GBM14) were treated two concentrations of with gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK003 (High and low dose, 0.4µM and 2.0µM respectively) and compared to vehicle (DMSO) control. Whole human genome gene expression was performed at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Microarray Core using 44k microarray technology (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s description including labeling, hybridization and detection. Gene annotation and expression analyses were performed using software packages available from the R/Bioconductor platform for statistical computing. In this series we provide raw expression data along with MIAME (Minimal Information about a Microarray Experiment).
