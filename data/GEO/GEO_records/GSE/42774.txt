TITLE
A genome-wide methylation study on essential hypertension in young African American Males

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome wide methylation scan using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip on DNAs extracted from the leukocytes of 8 hypertensive cases and 8 normotensive age-matched controls. All subjects were African American males aged 14-23 years.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 16 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
