TITLE
Macrophages heterogeneity in human atherosclerotic plaques

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to characterize the transcriptional profile of Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced macrophages (GM-MØ) and M-CSF macrophages (M-MØ) and to investigate in situ a subset of genes and their products specific to each phenotype in human atherosclerosis plaques

DESIGN
18 RNG/MRC two-colour oligonucleotide microarrays (Le Brigand et al. 2006) were used to generate global mRNA expression profiles for GM-CSF-induced, M-CSF-induced, and peritoneal macrophages. The microarray experiments were conducted either as a common reference (peritoneal-like macrophages) design or using a direct design by hybridizing Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced human monocyte-derived macrophage (GM-MØ) and CSF-induced human monocyte-derived macrophages(M-MØ) on the same arrays
