TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of GATA4,6 double depleted hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression following hepatocyte specific deletion of GATA4 and GATA6 in adult mice.  Results showed that the subset of differentially expressed genes had liver specific ontologies.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from hepatocytes of AAV8-Tbg-Cre injected GATA4,6 fl/fl mice was compared to total RNA isolated from AAV-Tbg-GFP injected GATA4,6 fl/fl mice.
