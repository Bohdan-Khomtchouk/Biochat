TITLE
Expression analysis of Dickeya dadantii 3937 infecting an aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum clone LL01) host

ORGANISM
Dickeya dadantii 3937

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in the phytopathogenic Dickeya dadantii wild-type strain 3937 during an acute per os  infection of an aphid body, in comparison with a colony grown in standard LB medium. The pathosystem described in this study has been analysed and first published in Grenier et al.  2006, and further detailed in Costechareyre et al. 2011

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate (aphid-, or in vitro-grown) samples

PLATFORM
GPL16335 UCBL-CNRS_MAP_UMR5240_Dickeya_dadantii_4.3k array [080627_Erwinia _chrysanthemi_expr]
