TITLE
RNA mapping of Drosha deficient cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show the microRNA genes can been very large and displaying many summarizing structural characteristics

DESIGN
MicroRNA biogenesis was ablated in CD4+ and CD8+ by deleted Rnasen gene (encoding Drosha). Poly A RNAs were extracted and analyzed by ultra high throughput sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
