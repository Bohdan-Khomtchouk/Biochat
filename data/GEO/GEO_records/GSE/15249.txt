TITLE
Expression profiling of the genes responding to zearalenone and its analogues using estrogen-responsive genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing the expression profiles of the genes in response to estrogen or 17b-estradiol (E2) and a mycotoxin, zearalenone (ZEA), and its analogues. Keywords: Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, E2- or ZEA-treated vs. control cells. 2 to 3 biological replicates, independently grown and harvested. Two to three replicates per array.
