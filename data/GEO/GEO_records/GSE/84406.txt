TITLE
miRNAs array analysis of HepG2 cells under oxidative stress

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Some latest studies have cast new light on the complicated interplay network between inflammation, oxidative stress, cancer and microRNAs. Although publications in the past decade have described the involvement of miRNAs in almost all kinds of physiological and pathological processes, little is known about the specific mechanisms of the interaction between oxidative stress and miRNAs. We examined the changes of the miRNAs expression profiles in HepG2 cells upon treatment with different concentrations of H2O2.
