TITLE
miRNAs array analysis of HepG2 cells under oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Some latest studies have cast new light on the complicated interplay network between inflammation, oxidative stress, cancer and microRNAs. Although publications in the past decade have described the involvement of miRNAs in almost all kinds of physiological and pathological processes, little is known about the specific mechanisms of the interaction between oxidative stress and miRNAs. We examined the changes of the miRNAs expression profiles in HepG2 cells upon treatment with different concentrations of H2O2.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and cultured as usual until they reached 80% confluence. To verify whether miRNAs could be modulated by oxidative stress, we stimulated HepG2 cells with H2O2 to develop a cell model of oxidative stress. Specifically, we chose 30 and 600 Î¼M of H2O2 as low and high concentration for miRNAs profiling, respectively. After stimulating HepG2 cells for 24 h, H2O2-induced changes in the miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed by the Affymetrix microRNA 4.0 Array.
