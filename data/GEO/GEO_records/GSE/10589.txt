TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between the thyroid of mice lacking Slc26a4 and heterzygous controls.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of differential expression of genes in the thyroid of pendrin (Slc26a4) heterozygous and knockout mice at a time point corresponding to maximal thyroid gland activity, postnatal day 15 (P15). Keywords: Differential expression under disease state

DESIGN
A total of Six samples of thyroid RNA obtained from P15 mice were analyzed. Triplicates from pendrin (Slc26a4) heterozygous and knockout mice were run and analyzed.
