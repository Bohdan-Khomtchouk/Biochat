TITLE
Effect of PGF receptor FP on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We purposed to examine the effect of PGF receptor FP in development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.  We performed gene expression analysis in the lung of WT and FP-KO mice on Days 0, 7 and 14. We found out that fibrosis-related genes such as various isoforms of collagen, which were induced on Day 7 and continued to increase or remained unchanged on Day 14, were induced to less extent in FP-KO mice. In contrast, expression of inflammation-related genes peaked on Day 7 similarly in WT and FP-KO mice. These results suggest that FP functions in fibrosis-phase, not in peak inflammation phase, and facilitates fibrogenesis by enhancing expression of fibrosis-related genes.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from the lung of WT and FP-KO mice on Day 0, 7 and 14 (n=4-5 for each group at each time point) after bleomycin instillation, and used for hybridization with Affymetrics mouse 430 2.0 microarrays. Time-dependent changes in expression of genes in FP-KO mice were compared with those in WT mice.
