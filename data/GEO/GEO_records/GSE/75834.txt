TITLE
Gene expression profile comparison of DC subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate gene expression profiles on different dendritic cell subsets isolated from spleens of mice We used whole genome microarrays to identify genes specific to pDCs and not other DC subsets in the absence of disease

DESIGN
pDCs, CD11b+ cDCs, and CD8+ cDCs were FACS-purified from spleens of healthy C57bl/6 mice
