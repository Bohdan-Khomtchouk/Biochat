TITLE
Murine C2C12 cells: GTP-stimulated cells vs. Control in SM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define the signalling of extracellular GTP as enhancer of myogenesis, we investigated if the gene expression profile of differentiated C2C12 cells (4 and 24 hours in SM) was affected by extracellular GTP.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GTP-treated C2C12 cells vs Control C2C12 cells at 4 h and 24 h of differentiation. Biological replicates: 1 control, 1 GTP-treated cells, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL525 MWG Mouse 10K A Array
