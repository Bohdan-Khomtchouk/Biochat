TITLE
mRNA sequencing analysis of zebrafish embryos, Dcp2 inhibition

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
we determined the contribution of the decapping enzyme Dcp2 to maternal mRNA clearance in zebrafish embryos by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of Dcp2.

DESIGN
zebrafish embryonic mRNA profile at 6 hpf in mock-inejcted or Dcp2-DN expressing embryos. Experiments are performed as triplicates.

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
