TITLE
SRC1 gene regulation in endocrine resistant breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapy results from an increase in cellular plasticity leading to the development of a steroid independent tumour.  The p160 steroid coactivator protein SRC-1, through interactions with developmental proteins and other non-steroidal transcription factors drives this tumour adaptability.  Here, using discovery studies we identify ADAM22, a non-protease member of the ADAMs family, as a direct target of SRC-1, independent of estrogen receptor(ER). Molecular, cellular, in vivo and clinical studies confirmed SRC-1 as a regulator of ADAM22 and established a role for ADAM22 in endocrine resistant tumour progression.  ADAM22 has the potential to act as a therapeutic drug target and a companion predictive biomarker in the treatment of endocrine resistant breast cancer.

DESIGN
14 samples representing 4 conditions were analysed. Samples were transfected with either a siRNA targetting SRC1 or a control scrambled siRNA. Samples were subject to tamoxifen treatment or untreated.
