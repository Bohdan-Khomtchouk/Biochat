TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on young adult Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to MWCNT

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) on the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
We used synchronized C. elegans populations exposed to MWCNT for 4 and 24h, and whole genome microarrays to screen for global changes in C. elegans transcription profiles. Young adults of C.elegans were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
