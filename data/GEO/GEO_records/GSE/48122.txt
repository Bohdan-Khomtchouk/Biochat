TITLE
RESTâ€“Mediated Recruitment of Polycomb Repressor Complexes in Mammalian Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of REST and Polycomb binding in Rest-/- and Eed-/- mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells showed that Rest was required for PRC1 recruitment to a subset of Polycomb regulated neuronal genes. Furthermore, we found that PRC1 can be recruited to Rest binding sites independently of CpG islands and the H3K27Me3 mark., and that PRC2 was frequently increased around Rest binding sites located in CpG-rich regions in the Rest2/2 mES cells.
