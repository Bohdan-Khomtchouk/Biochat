TITLE
Comparative gene expression analyses identify luminal and basal subtypes of canine invasive urothelial carcinoma that mimic patterns in human invasive bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to assay the gene expression profile of canine normal bladder from non-tumor bearing dogs and compared to that of bladder tumor in dogs.

DESIGN
Work was conducted to compare gene expression array results between tissue samples from iUC and normal bladder in dogs. Affymetrix canine 2.0 chips were used to conduct the experiment.
