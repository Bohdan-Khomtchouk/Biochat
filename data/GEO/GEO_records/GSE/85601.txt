TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications in Jurkat cells upon ELF-MF exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To address whether ELF-MF influences the epigenetic landscape in the T cell lymphoma cell line Jurkat , we exposed Jurkat cells in the exponential growth phase to ELF MF or a sham control for 72 h, applying intermittently (5’ on/10’ off) a 50 Hz sine ELF-MF at a flux density of 1 mT. Additionally, cells were treated with the histone deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) at a subtoxic dose of 10 nM.  Genome-wide profiling of active and repressive histone modifications did not reveal significant alterations. However, ELF-MF exposure has an influence on the robustness of the epigenetic landscape in leukaemic cells. Our data suggests that ELF-MF has a stochastic effect on the epigenetic landscape of individual cells.

DESIGN
H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 profiles from Jurkat cells before the exposure experiment (t0), ELF-MF and sham exposed for 72 h, and cells treated with the histone deacetylate inhibitor trichostatin A (10 nM TSA) analyzed by deep sequencing in douplicates of pools of three biological replicates each.
