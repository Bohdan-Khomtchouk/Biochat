TITLE
Chronic growth factor signaling in Acute Myeloid Leukemia is connected to a specific chromatin signature [Methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide DNaseI hypersensitive site in FLT3-ITD and WT patient samples. We report corresponding gene expression, promoter methylation patterns of differential DHSs as well as differentially occupied TF binding motifs using surrounding DNAseI cut profiles. We examined association patterns of FLT3 ITD and WT AMLs and found that FLT3-ITD signaling is associated with common gene expression and chromatin signature.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation patterns in  FLT3 ITD and WT AML via microarray study.
