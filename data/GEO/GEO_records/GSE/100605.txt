TITLE
Transcriptional profile comparing liver tissue in the absence/presence of LKB1 expression

ORGANISM
Mus

SUMMARY
The aim of this project is to determine the differential expression of genes between liver in the absence or presence of LKB1, leading to mitosis defects observed in absence of LKB1

DESIGN
Liver tissues were obtained (+/- LKB1 expression) 48 hours after partial hepatectomy

PLATFORM
GPL17791 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [mogene20st_Mm_ENTREZG_17.1.0]
