TITLE
Maize plants (Zea may) : WT (Alice) vs. Yellow stripe mutants (ys1 or ys3)

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Yellow stripe 1 (ys1) and ys3 mutants. ys1 and ys3 are recessive mutants of maize (Zea mays L.) that result in symptoms typical of Fe deficiency, i.e., interveinal chlorosis of the leaves. The objective of the present work was to identify the genes involved in the ys1 and ys3 phenotypes, so as to extend our understanding of Fe homeostasis in maize.

DESIGN
Root or shoot of WT vs. ys1 or ys3 mutants under Fe sufficient or Fe deficient conditions respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL16089 Agilent-016047 Maize Gene Expression Microarray 4x44K (Probe name version)
