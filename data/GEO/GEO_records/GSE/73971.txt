TITLE
Expression data from human iPSC-derived corneal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We successfully induced corneal epithelial cells from human iPSCs. Then, we perfomed global expression analysis using microarray to compare the character of hiPSC-derived corneal epithelial cells with that of the other kinds of cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from human iPSCs (hiPSCs), human iPSC-derived corneal epithelial cells (hiCECs), human corneal limbal epithelial cells (HCECs), human oral keratinocytes (HOKs), human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and six weeks-differentiated hiPSCs (hiPSC-derived ocular surface ectoderm, OSE) using the QIAZol reagent. A microarray analysis using Sure Print G3 human 8x60K slides (Agilent technologies) was performed at Takara Bio (Shiga, Japan).
