TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mDC transcriptional response to cyclic glucan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional profiles in mDC sorted from apheresed PBMC and stimulated for 6 hours with cyclic glucan or LPS. The hypothesis tested is that cyclic glucan induces maturation and T cell-activation transcripts in human mDC.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from mDC sorted from apheresed PBMC and activated for 6 hours with cyclic glucan or LPS.
