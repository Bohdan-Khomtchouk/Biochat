TITLE
Genome analysis of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from different regions of the same pig

ORGANISM
Campylobacter coli ; Campylobacter jejuni ; Campylobacter jejuni RM1221

SUMMARY
C. coli is the predominant Campylobacter strain that is found in pigs while C. jejuni if present will be 10- 100 folds less. Natural transformation can occur if there is a coexistence of both the strains in the intestine of pigs. Genome analyses were performed on a C. jejuni strain U101 isolated from the upper intestine and two C. coli strains, C101 and L101 isolated from caecum and lower intestine.

DESIGN
Five independent DNA preps of C. jejuni RM1221 were labelled with Cy 5 independently and they were mixed well which was used as the control. C101, U101 and L101 were labelled with Cy 3 independently and equal concentration of the control and sample DNA were used for hybridisation. Three biological replicates were done for each slide. The supplementary file (linked at the foot of this record) represents a summary of the C101, L101, and U101 replicate data (3 replicates/strain) that have been averaged.
