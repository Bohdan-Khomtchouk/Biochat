TITLE
Transcriptome comparisons of

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptomes of murine " expandable hemangioblasts " (eHBs) and their blood and endothelial progeny, comparing them to the transcriptomes of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, primary murine endothelial cells isolated from E11.5 yolk sacs or embryos, and E14.5 fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were purified from lysates of cultured or primary cells, reverse transcribed, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
