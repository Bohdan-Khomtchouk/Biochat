TITLE
MicroRNA deregulation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Cancer of the larynx is the second most common upper-aerodigestive cancer, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the major histological form. However, the molecular mechanism within LSCC progression remains poorly understood. MicroRNA-based target therapy is a promising approach in cancer therapy and offers multiple advantages as compared with the conventional treatment modalities. Hence, there is a need to identify the key microRNA involved in the progression of LSCC. We used GeneChip miRNA 2.0 array to profile the global microRNA deregulation in LSCC.
