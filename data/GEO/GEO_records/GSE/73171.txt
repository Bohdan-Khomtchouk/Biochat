TITLE
MicroRNA deregulation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer of the larynx is the second most common upper-aerodigestive cancer, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the major histological form. However, the molecular mechanism within LSCC progression remains poorly understood. MicroRNA-based target therapy is a promising approach in cancer therapy and offers multiple advantages as compared with the conventional treatment modalities. Hence, there is a need to identify the key microRNA involved in the progression of LSCC. We used GeneChip miRNA 2.0 array to profile the global microRNA deregulation in LSCC.

DESIGN
LSCC cell lines (SNU46, SNU899 and SNU1076) and human normal epithelial cultures (HOK1, HOK2 and HTEpiC) derived from head and neck region were selected for RNA extraction. RNA quality was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. RNA sample with a RIN value over 8 was selected for hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA geneChip 2.0 arrays. MicroRNA with P < 0.05 and 1.5-fold difference were considered as differentiated microRNA in LSCC.
