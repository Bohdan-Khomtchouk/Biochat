TITLE
Wdr5 mediates self-renewal and reprogramming via the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The embryonic stem (ES) cell transcriptional and epigenetic networks are critical for the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal. However, it remains unclear whether components of these networks functionally interact and if so, what factors mediate such interactions. Here we show that WD-repeat protein-5 (Wdr5), a core member of the mammalian Trithorax (trxG) complex, positively correlates with the undifferentiated state and is a novel regulator of ES cell self-renewal. We demonstrate that Wdr5, an ‘effector’ of H3K4 methylation, interacts with the pluripotency transcription factor Oct4. In concordance, genome-wide ChIP-Seq and transcriptome analyses demonstrate overlapping gene regulatory functions between Oct4 and Wdr5. We show that the Oct4-Sox2-Nanog circuitry cooperates with trxG for transcriptional activation of key self-renewal regulators. Furthermore, Wdr5 expression is required for the efficient formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Collectively, these findings implicate an integrated model of transcriptional and epigenetic control, mediated by select trxG members, for the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming.
