TITLE
Micrococcal nuclease sequencing analysis for nucleosome localization of mouse fetal liver erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nucleosomal DNA was prepared using Simple ChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, Nuclei were isolated from purified Ter119 negative or in vitro cultured erythroblasts. Cross-linked native chromatin was then digested with MNase into mononucleosomal DNA. Sequencing libraries were generated from nucleosomal DNA, and sequencing was carried out using the Illumina system according to the manufacturer’s specification.

DESIGN
In this study, we purified chromatin from in vitro cultured mouse fetal liver erythroblasts on day 0, day 1, and day 2. The chromatins were digested by micrococcal nuclease to make mononucleosomal products, which were further analyzed by next generation sequencing analysis. We aim to determine the dynamic changes of nucleosome during terminal erythropoiesis.

PLATFORM
