TITLE
Peripheral blood gene expression profiles in metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in peripheral blood is shown sufficient to differentiate patients with metabolic disorders from control. The signatures of metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes also have significant overlap.

DESIGN
Microarrays were performed on 35 subjects in the following groups: control (n=9), rheumatoid arthritis (n=6), metabolic syndrome (n= 6), coronary artery disease (n=6) and type 2 diabetes (n=8). Intensity values for each array were normalized to a sum of 10,000.
