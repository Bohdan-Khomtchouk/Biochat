TITLE
Peripheral blood gene expression profiles in metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in peripheral blood is shown sufficient to differentiate patients with metabolic disorders from control. The signatures of metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes also have significant overlap.
