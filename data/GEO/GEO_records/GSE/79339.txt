TITLE
Hobit and Blimp1 instruct a universal transcriptional program of tissue-residency in lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) permanently localize to portals of pathogen entry, where they provide immediate protection against re-infection. To enforce tissue retention, Trm upregulate CD69 and downregulate molecules associated with tissue egress including CCR7 and S1PR1. Although suppression of the transcription factor KLF2 in Trm prevents S1PR1-driven migration, a Trm-specific transcriptional regulator has not been identified. Here, we show that the transcription factor Hobit is specifically upregulated in Trm and together with related Blimp1, mediates the development of Trm in skin, gut, liver and kidney. Importantly, the Hobit/Blimp1 transcriptional module is also required for other populations of tissue-resident lymphocytes including NKT cells and liver-resident NK cells, all of which share a common transcriptional program that includes repression of Ccr7, S1pr1, and Klf2. Our results identify Hobit and Blimp1 as central regulators of this universal program that instructs tissue retention in diverse tissue-resident lymphocyte populations.
