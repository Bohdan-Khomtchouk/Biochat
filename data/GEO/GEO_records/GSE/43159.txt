TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Mash1 from mouse spinal cord

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq on a complex developing tissue (the spinal cord) at mouse embryonic day 12.5. Genome-wide binding sites of Mash1 were generated.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Mash1/Ascl1 in a heterogeneous tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
