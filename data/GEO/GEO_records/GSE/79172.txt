TITLE
Primary human dendritic cell transcriptome response to a wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in primary human dendritic cells infected with wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS).

DESIGN
Human primary dendritic cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell.  Infected samples were collected in triplet; time-matched mocks were collected in triplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 3, 7, 12, and 24 h post-infection. MERSCOV001.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure used to infect the human DC.
