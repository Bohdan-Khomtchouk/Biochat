TITLE
Altered DNA Methylation Patterns in Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the DNA methylation changes during OSCC carcinogenesis,  we utilized cytosine conversion and next generation sequencing based technique- enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) - to assess DNA methylation in  cultured, human TERT-immortalized, non-tumorigenic OKF6-TERT1R and OSCC SCC-9 cells.

DESIGN
OKF6-TERT1R cells and SCC-9 cells were plated in 10 cm2 tissue culture plates at the density of 2 Ã— 106 cells/plate. Total genomic DNA was extracted from OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9 cells using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), including an RNAse treatment step.
