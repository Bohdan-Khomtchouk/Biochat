TITLE
Modulation of mitochondrial DNA copy number to induce hepatocytic differentiation of human Amniotic Epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human amniotic epithelial cells were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cellsfor 28 days and gene expression evaluated. Human amniotic epiethelial cells were encapsulated in barium alginate microcapsules and differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells to create 3D environment for differentiation and gene expression evaluated. The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in gene expression during hepatic diffrentiation and effects of encapsulation on differentiation.

DESIGN
Four human epithelial cells samples were used as controls (HAEC 1-4) and same cells were also differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (HLC 1-4) and encapsulated followed by differentiation (Enc. HLC 1-4)
