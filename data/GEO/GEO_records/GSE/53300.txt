TITLE
Gene expression profiling of breast cancer cells with knockdown of PTEN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of the PI3K pathway in estrogen receptor Î± (ER)-positive (+) breast cancer is associated with reduced ER expression and activity, luminal B subtype, and poor outcome.  PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway typically lost in ER-negative (-) breast cancer.  To clarify the effect of PTEN down-regulation on the response of ER+/HER2- breast cancer to endocrine therapy, we established reduced PTEN cell models using inducible knockdown.  We found that only moderate PTEN reduction is sufficient to enhance PI3K signaling, generate a gene signature associated with luminal B subtype, and cause endocrine resistance.  Combining endocrine therapy with mTOR, AKT, or MEK inhibitors improves antitumor activity, but the efficacy varies by type of endocrine therapy and the specific inhibitor.  Fulvestrant plus an AKT inhibitor is the most potent combination when PTEN is reduced, inducing apoptosis and tumor regression.  This combination deserves further study in patients with PI3K pathway activation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (by RNA-seq) were taken of a cell model with or without reduced PTEN (using inducible knockdown).
