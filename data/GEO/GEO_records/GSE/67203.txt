TITLE
Long-term consequences of chronic fluoxetine exposure on the expression of myelination-related genes in the rat hippocampus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To more concretely elucidate the long-term effects of chronic SSRI exposure during adulthood,  the long-term consequences of chronic fluoxetine (12 mg/kg) versus vehicle treatment during adulthood (postnatal day (PND) 67-88) on gene expression in the hippocampus were investigated. The study showed that adult chronic fluoxetine exposure causes on the long-term changes in the expression of genes related to, amongst others, myelination

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in hippocampus tissue of fluoxetine and methylcellulose-exposed rats  (postnatal day 128). 2 rats pooled per sample, 2 samples per treatment group
