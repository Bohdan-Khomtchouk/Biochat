TITLE
Bovine  cumulus cells transcriptome in relation with oocyte chromatin configuration of the germinal vesicle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis in cc from COCs with different chromatin configuration (GV0-3)

DESIGN
Bovine cumulus cells (4 biological replicates) were collected and grouped according to the oocyte different chromatin configuration of the germinal vesicle described by Lodde et al. 2007. Four GV stages corresponding to the state of chromatin condensation were used (GV0; GV1; GV2 and GV3). Multiple microarray comparisons were performed. First a reference design (GV0 as a reference) was used for a total of three comparisons (GV0 vs GV1; GV0 vs GV2 and GV0 vs GV3) .
