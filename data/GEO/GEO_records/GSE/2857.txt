TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in FGFR1 heterozygous and null E12.5 murine telencephalons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analysed changes in gene expression in the dorsal telencephalon of forebrain-specific FGFR1 mutant mice. Keywords: mutant analysis

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between the dorsal telencephalons of single E12.5 embryos of two genotypes: FGFR1 heterozygous (HET1,3,8) and homozygous mutants (HOM2,4,7) that were both heterozygous for the FoxG1 transcription factor, as Cre recombinase expression is driven off the endogenous FoxG1 locus in these animals (Hebert, J. M., Lin, M., Partanen, J., Rossant, J. and McConnell, S. K. (2003b). FGF signaling through FGFR1 is required for olfactory bulb morphogenesis. Development 130, 1101-11. & Hebert, J. M. and McConnell, S. K. (2000). Targeting of cre to the Foxg1 (BF-1) locus mediates loxP recombination in the telencephalon and other developing head structures. Dev Biol 222, 296-306.
