TITLE
HeLa cell polyA- RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Coilin iCLIP data revealed 42 novel human snoRNAs of intronic origin. To validate their expression and estimate abundance  of novel and annotated snoRNAs, we performed RNA-seq on polyA- and rRNA-depleted RNA isolated from HeLa cells. Results show that expression of novel snoRNAs is comparable to the previously annotated snoRNAs.

DESIGN
1 replicate of RNA depleted of polyA and ribosomal RNA.
