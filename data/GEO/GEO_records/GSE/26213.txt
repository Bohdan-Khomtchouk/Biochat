TITLE
Gene Expression in Three Early Human Hypertrophic Scar Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to obtain expression data from the deep cones in early human hypertrophic scars to be used to confirm expression data obtained in a porcine model.

DESIGN
Three samples of early human hypertrophic scar were obtained and processed with the Affymetrix Human GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 plus 2.0. Sample demographics were Black 2, White 1; upper extremity 2, neck 1; times since injury 6.7 months and 10.8 months; and patient ages were 19 and 54.

PLATFORM
