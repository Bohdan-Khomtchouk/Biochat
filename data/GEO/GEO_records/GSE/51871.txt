TITLE
Androgen and Glucocorticoid stimulation of LREX' cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The treatment of advanced prostate cancer has been transformed by novel antiandrogen therapies such as enzalutamide.  Using the LnCaP/AR xenograft model, we identified induction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression as a common feature of drug resistant tumors.  From a resistant xenograft tumor, we derived a GR expressing resistant subline called LREX.  In this model, activation of GR and AR activate a similar but distinguishable set of target genes.

DESIGN
LREX' cells were cultured in steroid depleted media and then treated for 8 hours with the indicated drugs in biological triplicates.
