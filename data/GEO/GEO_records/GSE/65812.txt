KLF4 Dependent Phenotypic Modulation of SMCs Plays a Key Role in Regulating Plaque Pathogenesis

SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries and there is compelling evidence that the majority of these fatalities are secondary to rupture of unstable atherosclerotic plaques. However, the mechanisms that control plaque stability are poorly understood, although it is widely believed that plaques having a decreased ratio of cells positive for smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers such as ACTA2 relative to macrophage markers are more likely to rupture. Herein we employMyh11-CreERT2 ROSA floxed STOP eYFP Apoe-/- mice to trace SMC lineage and show that traditional methods for detecting SMCs based on immunostaining for SMC markers like ACTA2 are unable to detect 82% of SMC-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, we show that these SMC-derived cells within advanced lesions exhibit multiple phenotypes including activation of multiple markers of macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and myofibroblasts (MF). Importantly, we show that SMC-derived macrophage like cells are phagocytic based on electron microscope YFP immunolabeling. In addition, results of single cell epigenetic assays developed in our lab shows that nearly 20% of macrophage-like cells within human lesions are of SMC not myeloid origin. These phenotypic transitions appear to be critical in lesion pathogenesis, in that we show that SMC-specific conditional knockout (KO) of the pluripotency factor, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulted in marked reductions in lesion size, increases in multiple indices of plaque stability, and reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC- and macrophage-like cells. Finally, we show that cholesterol loading of cultured SMC is associated with activation of multiple markers of macrophages and MSC, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased phagocytosis, all of which are Klf4 dependent. Taken together, results indicate that the contribution of SMCs within atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated, and that loss of Klf4 within SMC result in major changes in SMC phenotype and function that play a major role in lesion pathogenesis.
