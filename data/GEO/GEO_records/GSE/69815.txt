TITLE
Expression array of glucosamine-fed Drosophila heart/nephrocyte complexes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Examined the expression effects of supplementing Drosophila food on heart and nephrocyte complexes 30 female flies fed standard diet supplemented with 0.1 M glucosamine were dissected in cold ADH, and heart/nephrocyte complexes were harvested and analyzed.

DESIGN
Animals were pre-fed glucosamine or sucrose, and heart/nephrocyte complexes were assessed for differences in gene expression.
