TITLE
Whole-transcriptome maps of HepG2 cells after exposure to cationic liposomes and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cationic liposomes (CLs) are non-viral vectors that play a major role in DNA transfer and gene therapy. The cellular toxicity of CLs has been validated in HepG2 cells. To address the basis of the CLs toxicity, we performed RNA-seq analysis on untreated HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells following exposure to IC50 concentration (120Î¼M) CLs for 24h.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression level in CLs treated HepG2 cells and untreated cells

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
