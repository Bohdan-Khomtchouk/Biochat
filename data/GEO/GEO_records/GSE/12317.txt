TITLE
Small RNAs from 4-week old seedling of Oryza sativa

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to identify new miRNAs, NAT-siRNAs and possibly abiotic-stress regulated small RNAs in rice, three small RNA libraries were constructed from control rice seedlings and seedlings exposed to drought or salt stress, and then subjected to pyrosequencing.
