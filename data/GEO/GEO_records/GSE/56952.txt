SUMMARY
Analysis of purified murine hematopoietic samples

DESIGN
122 Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 arrays generated from purified steady-state murine hematopoietic cell types were re-normalized together using gcRMA in R. Their GSE Series numbers are as follows: GSE34723, GSE11982, GSE7302, GSE8407,GSE9717, GSE10627, GSE10246, GSE12581, GSE6506, GSE11110, GSE12001, GSE9810, GSE4142, GSE7764, GSE9810, GSE6875, GSE6681
