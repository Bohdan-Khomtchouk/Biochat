TITLE
Molecular profiling of myeloid leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines.  The myeloid cell lines CMK, HEL, HL-60, K-562, KASUMI-1, KG-1, LAMA-84, M-07e, MONO-MAC-1, MV4-11, NB-4, OCI-AML2, OCI-AML5, SIG-M5, THP-1, and UT-7 were obtained from the DSMZ in Braunschweig, Germany ( http://www.dsmz.de ). The cell line ME-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Ikuya Sakai, Ehime University, Japan. Cell lines were cultured under standard conditions in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For subsequent DNA and RNA isolation 1x107 cells of the respective cell lines were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored as cell pellets at 800C. Gene expression profiling.  Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed essentially as described using the previously described cDNA microarray platform (Bullinger et al., N Engl J Med 2004;350:1605-1616). A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design

DESIGN
Using regression correlation
