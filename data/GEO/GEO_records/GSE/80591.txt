TITLE
Messenger RNA expression after MK2206/DMSO treatment of T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq in T47D cells after 24 hour treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 or DMSO. We show that a group of transcripts is differentailly expressed after AKT inhibition.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA levels using RNA-seq after AKT inhibition vs vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
