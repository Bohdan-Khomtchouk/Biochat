TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of the porcine developing cortex and cerebellum

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling using microRNA microarrays was performed on the porcine developing brain. Two tissues, cortex and cerebellum, were sampled at each of three different developmental stages: gestation day 50 (F50), gestation day 100 (F100) and three months old (named adult), respectively. The aim was to find developmental stage-, as well as tissue-specific, microRNA candidates and validate them with qPCR.

DESIGN
RNA samples containing the small RNA fraction were subjected to microarray analysis. Three replicates per developmental stage/tissue.
