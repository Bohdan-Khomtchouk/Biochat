SUMMARY
This series represents the human leukocyte SAGE library collection. Keywords: Human Leukocytes, Blood, SAGE

DESIGN
Leukocytes are classified as myelocytic or lymphocytic, and each class of leukocytes consists of several types of cells that have different phenotypes and different roles. To define the gene expression in these cells, we have performed SAGE using human leukocytes and have provided the gene database for these cells not only at the resting stage but also at the activated stage.
