TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs in H2AX knockdown cells undergoing apoptosis

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
H2AX has been characterized as a novel tumor suppressor protein. Difficiency of H2AX will result in apoptotic inhibition of cancer cells. However, how H2AX epigenetically regulates apoptosis of cancer cells is still unclear To reveal the miRNA expression regulated by H2AX and involved in apoptosis, the microarray profiling analysis was employed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in H2AX knockdown lung cancer cells and control ones after apoptotic induction. H2AX was knockdown by miRNA interfering system in human lung cancer originated cell A549 and the stable cell line named P1, while the control stable cell line named C. Genes with greater than 1.5-fold change and P-value ï¼œ0.05 were identified as differentially expressed genes between C and P1 cells both with apoptosis induction.
