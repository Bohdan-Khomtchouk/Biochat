TITLE
Comparative analyses of super-enhancers reveal conserved elements in vertebrate genomes

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Super-enhancers (SEs) are key transcriptional drivers of cellular, developmental and disease states in mammals, yet the conservational and regulatory features of these enhancer elements in non-mammalian vertebrates are unknown. To define SEs in zebrafish and enable sequence and functional comparisons to mouse and human SEs, we used genome-wide histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) occupancy as a primary SE delineator. Our study determined the set of SEs in pluripotent state cells and adult zebrafish tissues and revealed both similarities and differences between zebrafish and mammalian SEs. Although the total number of SEs was proportional to the genome size, the genomic distribution of zebrafish SEs differed from that of the mammalian SEs. Despite the evolutionary distance separating zebrafish and mammals and the low overall SE sequence conservation, ~42% of zebrafish SEs from all cells and tissues analyzed were associated with orthologs that also were associated with SEs in mouse and human. Compared to their non-associated counterparts, higher sequence conservation was revealed for those SEs that have maintained orthologous vertebrate gene associations. Functional dissection of two of these SEs identified conserved sequence elements and tissue-specific expression patterns, while chromatin accessibility analyses predicted transcription factors governing the function of pluripotent state zebrafish SEs. Our zebrafish enhancer characterizations and comparative studies show the extent of SE usage and their conservation across vertebrates, permitting future gene regulatory studies in several tissues.
