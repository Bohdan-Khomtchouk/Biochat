TITLE
Oncostatin M Regulation of Gene Expression in Breast Tumour Cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oncostatin m (OSM) induces potent growth inhibitory and morphogenic responses in several different tumour cell types but the genetic events are not well understood. OSM can signal through two separate heterodimeric receptor complexes, gp130/LIFRα and gp130/OSMRβ. In this investigation we utilised cytokines, oncostatin M, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor antagonist, LIF-05, to help identify patterns of gene expression elicited by the different IL-6 receptor complexes in breast tumour cell line, T47D . We have tried to identify an OSM gene signature common to multiple breast tumour-derived cell lines (T47D, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and identified OSM-gene regulation at time-points which coincide with the onset of OSM-induced biological effects. These findings identify a core transcriptional mechanism specific to the OSMRβ in breast tumour cells. Keywords: Comparative, timecourse, cell line-specific
