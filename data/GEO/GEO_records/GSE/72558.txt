TITLE
Comparison of gene expression by sheep and human blood stimulated with the TLR4 agonists lipopolysaccharide and monophosphoryl lipid A [sheep]

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
11,431 and 4,992 genes were determined in whole blood of healthy human volunteers and normal sheep, respectively following MPLA and LPS exposure Following the exposure 1,029 human and 175 sheep genes were differentially expressed. Of those 175 sheep genes, 54 had a known human ortolog. The major inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1-6-8, TNFa, NFkB, ETS2, PTGS2, PTX3, CXCL18, KYNU, and CLEC4E were similarly ( > 2-fold) upregulated in both human and sheep blood.

DESIGN
Six healthy human volunteers and six normal sheep blood was incubated with LPS or MPLA for 90 minutes, then the blood was transferred to the Paxgene blood RNA tubes and the gene expression microarrays were scanned with G2556 Microaaray Scanner
