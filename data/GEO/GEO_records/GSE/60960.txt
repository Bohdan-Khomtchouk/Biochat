TITLE
Expression data for aox1a mutants, rpoTmp  mutants and aox1a:rpoTmp double mutants in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Common and distinct transcriptomic responses to moderate light and drought stress in the different mutants. We used microarrays to analyse the response untreated and moderate light and drought stress in aox1a mutants, rpoTmp  mutants and aox1a:rpoTmp double mutants. This was analysed in paralell with WT (Col0) plants in order to identify the responses to stress.

DESIGN
WT(Col0), aox1a mutants, rpoTmp mutants and aox1a:rpoTmp double mutants were collected under untreated conditions and after moderate light and drought stress.
