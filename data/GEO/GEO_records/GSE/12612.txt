TITLE
Engineering of Penicillium chrysogenum for fermentative production of a novel carbamoylated cephem antibiotic precursor

ORGANISM
Penicillium chrysogenum

SUMMARY
Penicillium chrysogenum was successfully engineered to produce a novel carbamoylated cephalosporin that can be used as a synthon for semi-synthetic cephalosporins. To this end, structural genes for Acremonium chrysogenum expandase/hydroxylase and Streptomyces clavuligerus carbamoyltransferase were expressed in a penicillinG high-producing strain of P. chrysogenum. Growth of the engineered strain in the presence of the side-chain precursor adipic acid resulted in production of adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (ad7-ACCCA) and of several adipoylated pathway intermediates. A combinatorial chemostat-based transcriptome study, in which the ad7-ACCCA- producing strain and a strain lacking key genes in β-lactam synthesis were grown in the presence and absence of adipic acid, enabled the dissection of transcriptional responses to adipic acid per se and to ad7-ACCCA production. In chemostat cultures of both strains, adipic acid served as an additional carbon source. Transcriptome analysis supported an earlier proposal, based on 13C-labelling studies, that adipic acid catabolism in P. chrysogenum occurs via β-oxidation and enabled the identification of putative genes for enzymes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation pathways. Several of the genes that showed a specifically altered transcript level in ad7-ACCCA-producing cultures were previously implicated in oxidative stress responses. As strain improvement programmes lead to increased specific productivity and yields, a deeper understanding of these stress responses is likely to be important to also achieve high ad7-ACCCA titers with engineered strains of P. chrysogenum.
