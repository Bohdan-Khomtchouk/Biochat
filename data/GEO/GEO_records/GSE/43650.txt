TITLE
Cell cycle dependence of neuroprogenitor fate determination regulated by Trrap-mediated histone acetylation

SUMMARY
Epigenetic control of neural stem/progenitor cell fate is fundamental to achieve a fully brain architecture. Two intrinsic programs regulate neurogenesis, one by epigenetic-mediated gene transcription and another by cell cycle control. Whether and how these two are coordinated to determine temporally and spatially neural development remains unknown. Here we show that deletion of Trrap (Transcription translation associated protein), an essential cofactor for HAT (histone acetyltransferase), leads to severe brain atrophy due to a combination of cell death and a blockade of neuron production. Specifically, Trrap deletion forces differentiation of apical progenitor (AP) fate into basal progenitors (BP) and neurons thereby limiting the total neurogenic production. Despite Trrapâ€™s general role in transcriptional regulation, a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of neuroprogenitors identified the cell cycle regulators that are specifically affected by Trrap deletion. Furthermore, E2F-dependent recruitment of HAT and transcription factors to the promoter of cell cycle regulators is impaired in Trrap-deleted neuroprogenitors. Consistent with these molecular changes, Trrap deletion lengthens particularly G1 and S phases in APs in vivo. Therefore, our study reveals an essential and a distinct function of Trrap-HAT in regulation of cell cycle progression that is required for proper determination of neuroprogenitor fate.
