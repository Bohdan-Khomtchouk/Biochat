TITLE
Identification of genes involved in CEACAM1-4S mediated lumen formation in a 3D model of mammary morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes involved in lumen formation: gene chip analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from both wild type and T457A,S459A mutated CEACAM1-4S transfected MCF7 cells grown in Matrigel

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of RNA isolated from MCF7 cells transfected with CEACAM1-S wild-type (SW) or CEACAM1-S double-A mutant T457A,S459A (DA) grown in Matrigel for 4 days

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
