TITLE
miR-34a is downregulated in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum treated sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma patients with poor prognosis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the purpose of analyzing mechanisms related to the cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (head and neck SCC), we employed a nasal squamous cell carcinoma (nasal SCC) cell line RPMI2650 and its CDDP resistant substrain RPMI2650CR previously described. The identification of the resistance-related microRNA (miR) clusters was conducted between RPMI2650CR and RPMI2650 using microRNA microarray.

DESIGN
microRNA expression of parental and CDDP resistant was measured with or without CDDP treatment in duplicate.
