TITLE
Protein phosphorylations, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-32g and IL-17A/F

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global kinase activity induced by cytokines IL-32g and IL-17A/F were determined using peptide arrays representing phophorylation targets The objective of this study was to identify common and unique phosphorylation targets of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-32 and IL-17. These cytokines are associated with the pathogenesis and severity of chronic inflammatory disorders, therefore signaling intermediates of these cytokines could be beneficial as alternate theraputic targets that may likely influence different inflammatory pathways.

DESIGN
Phosphorylation of proteins is a critical mechanism in the regulation of cellular processes. This process is meticulously regulated by enzymes known as kinases, which are increasingly being identified as drug targets for a variety of diseases. In this study we interrogated kinase activities (kinome) induced in the presence of the human recombinant cytokines IL-32g and IL-17A/F employing peptide arrays representing 300 peptides, printed in triplicate, representing select phosphorylation events. Human macrophage-like THP-1 cells were used for this comparative kinome analysis. Macrophage-like THP-1 cells were stimulated with either IL-32g  (20 ng/ml) or IL-17A/F (20 ng/ml) for 15 min, and the peptide arrays were used to comprehensively analyze protein phosphorylation profiles in the presence of these cytokines. Two independet biological experiments were performed and the kinoem analysis was done in triplicates for each. The phosphorylations of the peptides on the array were quantified in the cytokine-treated cells relative to the un-stimulated control cells. Differentially phosphorylated targets were defined as greater than 1.5 fold increase or decrease (p < 0.06) in phosphorylation compared to un-stimulated control cells.
