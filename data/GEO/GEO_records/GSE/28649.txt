TITLE
Protein phosphorylations, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-32g and IL-17A/F

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Global kinase activity induced by cytokines IL-32g and IL-17A/F were determined using peptide arrays representing phophorylation targets The objective of this study was to identify common and unique phosphorylation targets of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-32 and IL-17. These cytokines are associated with the pathogenesis and severity of chronic inflammatory disorders, therefore signaling intermediates of these cytokines could be beneficial as alternate theraputic targets that may likely influence different inflammatory pathways.
