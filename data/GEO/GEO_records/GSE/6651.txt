Whole Genome array hippocampus_cocaine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the hypothesis that maternal cocaine exposure could alter the fetal epigenetic machinery sufficiently to cause lasting neurochemical and functional changes in the offspring. These data were used as preliminary results for paper: Maternal cocaine administration in mice alters DNA methylation and gene expression in hippocampal neurons of neonatal and prepubertal offspring.

DESIGN
Pregnant CD1 mice were administered either saline or 20 mg/kg cocaine twice daily on gestational days 8-19. Male pups from each of ten litters of the cocaine and control groups were analyzed at 3 (P3) day postnatum. Pyramidal layer tissue from the right hemisphere of one of these brains (On every section, the pyramidal layer, encompassing the C1, C2 and C3 hippocampal regions, was carefully cut out)was used for analyzing gene expression. Laser microdissection was performed on a Leica ASLMD laser capture microdissection system (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
