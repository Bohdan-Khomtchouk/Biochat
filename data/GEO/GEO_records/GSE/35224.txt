TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Hodgkin Lymphoma cell line following REL-B depletion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression array data will be merged with Rel-B ChIP-Seq data in HL cell lines. This will show REL-B direct and indirect controlled downstream target genes

DESIGN
HL cells were infected with a retrovirus that delivers a specific shRNA sequence to knock down the expression of REL-B
