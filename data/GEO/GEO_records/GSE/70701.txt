TITLE
Broiler responses to virulent and avirulent Clostridium perfringens

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Analyze gene expression during C. perfringens colonization in the chicken Transcriptomic profile of mRNA  from C. perfrinegns from in vivo and in vitro conditions were determined in biological duplicates by RNA-Seq using Illumina HiSeq 2500

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression through RNA sequencing of necrotic enteritis C. perfrinegns  type A of in vivo (chicken loops) and in vitro (lab culture)
