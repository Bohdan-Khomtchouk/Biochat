TITLE
Differential expression of human parthenogenic stem cells, neural stem cells and DA progenitors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neural stem cells (NSC) derived from human parthenogenic stem cells (hpSC) have been observed to show stronger positive functional effects than hpSC-derived dopaminergic neuron precursors (DAP) in treatment of induced Parkinson Disease in animal models. RNAseq of the two types of cells were normalized and analyzed to compare gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
cDNA library of hpsC, NSC and DAP triplicates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads were mapped to hg19 reference genome and hits that passed quality filters were analyzed for differential expression.
