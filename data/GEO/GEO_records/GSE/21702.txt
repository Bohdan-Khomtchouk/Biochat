TITLE
A role for the atopy-associated gene PHF11 in T-cell activation and viability.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression in normally proliferating Jurkat T-cells that over-express a myc-tagged recombinant PHF11 relative to Jurkat T-cells transfected with an empty vector only.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from paired samples.
