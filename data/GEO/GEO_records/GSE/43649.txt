TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing analysis of swamp eel

ORGANISM
Monopterus albus

SUMMARY
The swamp eel or rice field eel (Monopterus albus) taxonomically belongs to the family Synbranchidae of the order Synbranchiformes (Neoteleostei, Teleostei, Vertebrata). It is not only an economically important freshwater fish in aquacultural production, but also an increasingly known model species for biological studies. Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying sex change is a major area of interest. The swamp eel thus offers a powerful system for studying sexual development and adaptive evolution in vertebrates.The whole genome sequencing provides valuable resources for sex control in fish production, species protection through manipulating sex reversal genes, and potentially enabling effective population control and promoting reproduction health in human.

DESIGN
High throughput sequencing was employed for three samples,three kind s of sex gonad from swamp eel, testis,ovotestis and ovary, no replicates.
