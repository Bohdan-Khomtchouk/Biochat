TITLE
Gene expression analysis of two elite breeding barley lines with distinct tolerance to abiotic stress

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
To investigate the differences in gene expression during germination time course of two elite breeding barley lines (LP104 and LP106), an Agilent oligo microarray was applied. A total of 5320 and 4271 genes were found to be significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in LP104 compared to LP106. The highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified after 24h of germination (2260); stages 0h, 2h, 48h, 96h, 120h and 144h were of a lesser magnitude ranging from 929 to 1169 DEGs, and at 72h only 826 DEGs were identified. Analysis of DEGs according to their biological functions revealed that major enriched functional categories among DEGs included RNA, protein, stress, transport and development.

DESIGN
Gene expression in germinating grains of two barley lines was measured at 0-144 hours after imbibition. Three biological replications, eight  germination stages.
