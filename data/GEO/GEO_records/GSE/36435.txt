TITLE
Expression data from Flt3L-derived bone marrow dendritic cells from WT or Clec9agfp/gfp mice treated or not with dead cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNGR-1 (CLEC9A) is expressed in CD8-like dendritic cells (DCs) and detects a ligand exposed on necrotic cells. We have characterized the transcripts that are induced in cultures of Flt3L-derived bone-marrow-derived WT or DNGR1-deficient DCs upon incubation with dead cells. Microarray analysis of the transcriptome of DNGR-1-deficient and WT DCs cultured with dead cells failed to reveal any DNGR-1-dependence in the transcriptional response to dead cells.

DESIGN
Flt3L-BMDC from WT or DNGR-1-deficient (Clec9a gfp/gfp) mice were left untreated or were cultured for 5 hours with UV-treated dead cells at a 1:2 ratio. CD24hi CD11blow B220- CD8Î±+-like DC were purified by cell sorting and RNA was extracted. There were 3 replicates for each of the four experimental conditions.
