TITLE
Functional genomics study of endogenous free fatty acid overproduction in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of changes in gene and protein expression and fatty acid profiles between Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 ΔfadD ΔaraBAD expressing an acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (BTE) or a non-functional mutant thioesterase (BTE-H204A) to determine the functional basis for losses in cell viability, membrane integrity, or other stresses and metabolic perturbations that may be present. New hypotheses obtained from the study will assist in metabolic engineering efforts of improved strains exhibiting higher fatty acid yields and productivities.
