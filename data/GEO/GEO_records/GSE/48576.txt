TITLE
microRNA Expression based, Effects of Chronic Intermittent Ethanol paradigm on mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed cerebral cortices (CTX) and midbrains (MB) from male C57BL/6J mice subjected to a CIE, 2BC paradigm, which induces heavy drinking and represents one of the best available animal models for alcohol dependence and relapse drinking.

DESIGN
Samples from CTX and MB of 21 mice: 7 Na√Øve, 7 Air-2BC, and 7 CIE-2BC. One channel was used for the actual sample, the second channel was used fot Internal QC Reference.
