TITLE
Leukocyte gene expression in rhesus macaques reared under different conditions

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA samples collected from 4 mo old rhesus macaques subject to maternal rearing, peer rearing, or surrogate peer rearing.  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs as a function of early rearing conditions.
