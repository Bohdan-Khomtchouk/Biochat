TITLE
ChIP-chip of LeuO, H-NS and RNA Polymerase (RNAP) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
The LysR family transcription factor LeuO is believed to antagonize the global repressor H-NS. ChIP-on-chip analysis of LeuO, H-NS and RNAP binding to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosome demonstrated a high degree of overlap between LeuO and H-NS regulated genes. Furthermore LeuO binding was associated with RNA polymerase recruitment, indicating a role for LeuO in activating transcription.
