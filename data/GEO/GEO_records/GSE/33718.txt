TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Fcγ receptor ligation on dendritic cells from wild-type, FcγRIIb KO or FcR γ chain KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression after incubation of dendritic cells with immune complexes or medium. Since the dendritic cells are derived from three different mouse strains, either wild type, Fcγ receptor IIb KO (expresses only activating Fcγ receptors) or Fc receptor γ chain KO (expresses only inhibitory Fcγ receptor), the analysis gives important insight into the roles of the activating versus inhibiting Fcγ receptors on dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells of the three mouse genotypes (see above) were incubated for 4 hours with medium (unstimulated) or OVA-anti OVA immune complexes (IC, stimulated) and changes in gene expression after stimulation with IC were compared between unstimulated vs stimulated with IC and across the three genotypes.
