TITLE
IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Drosophila TDF/Apt  regulated genes in embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila tdf, another name apontic (apt), encodes a bZIP transcription factor that is required for the development of trachea, heart, head and neural system. However, little is known about the target of TDF/Apt. To identify theTDF/ Apt regulated genes, we compared expression profiles of mRNA purified from wild-type and tdf mutant embryos. Summary  file is emtdf-yw.CHP.

DESIGN
yw and tdf mutant embryos were selected at later stage of  development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We identified tdf mutant embryos using CyOact-GFP balancer chromosome.
