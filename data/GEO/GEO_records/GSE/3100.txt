TITLE
Cystic Fibrosis Mouse Lung Profiles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling with microarrays was used to identify genes differentially expressed in the lungs of B6 and BALB CF mice compared to non-CF littermates Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (male and female) were examined in CF-/- and CF+/+ genotypes. 3 arrays of each combination of strain sex and CF status were analyzed (except for B6 male CF, which only had two replicates)
