TITLE
Expression data from Magnaporthe oryzae (M. grisea) in response to darkness

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
The dark-phase in light/dark cycle plays an important role in successful disease development in M. oryzae-Oryza sativa. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to light-to-dark transition. We identified different groups of genes (based on GO categories) that are up- or down-regulated in response to light-to-dark transition. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
We performed a microarray experiment using microarray chips manufactured by Agilent Technologies Inc.  This chip contains more than 13,000 M. oryzae probes and 7,000 rice probes.  Our mycelial samples were grown in liquid media under constant white-light and then moved to constant darkness for 0.5, 2, 12, or 24 hours.  Three biological samples per data point were collected in two separate experiments.  Total RNA was extracted from the mycelial samples and labeled with Cy-3 dye.  For normalization between slides we used a control RNA, which was prepared by pooling RNA samples from all of the time points.  The control RNA was labeled with Cy-5.  Hybridization and all the subsequent procedures were performed following the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.
