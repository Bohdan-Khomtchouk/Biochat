TITLE
Differentiation of NUT midline carcinoma by epigenomic reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of the oncogene, BRD4-NUT, in a rare cancer, termed NUTmidline carcinoma (NMC), results in morphologic features consistent with squamous differentiation.  Treatment with the HDAC-inhibitor, TSA, appears to cause the same phenotype.  Here, we use gene expression profiling to compare the changes in gene expression following BRD4-NUT knockdown and TSA treatment.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from two BRD4-NUT-expressing NMC cell lines, PER-403 and TC-797, 24h following siRNA knockdown versus control in duplicate. RNA was extracted from two BRD4-NUT-expressing NMC cell lines, PER-403 and TC-797,  24h following treatment with TSA versus etoh control in triplicate
