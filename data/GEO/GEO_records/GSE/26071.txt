TITLE
Examine gene expression in maize pulvini in gravitropsim

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
A gradient cell elongation with maximum in the lower  side of pulvini and minimum in the upper side of pulvini pushes a maize stem upwards from a horizontal to a vertical position during gravitropsim. A differentiated gene expression between lower and upper pulvini was examined at 1 h, 6 and 24 h.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels were compared in control (not bending), lower and upper (bending) pulvini. The samples were harvested at 1 h, 6 h and 24 h gravitropsim and total RNA were extracted using for microarray experiment.
