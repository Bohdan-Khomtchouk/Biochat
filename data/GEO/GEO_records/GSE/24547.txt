TITLE
Transcriptional pathway signatures for the Aurora inhibitor Danusertib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment with Aurora inhibitors has been shown to induce diverse biological responses in different tumor cell lines, in part depending on their p53 status. To characterize at the transcriptional level the effects of Danusertib we analyzed by microarray different tumor cell lines, with WT or mutant p53 status, that showed differential cell cycle response upon drug treatment.
