TITLE
Effect of Fasting on Hepatic Gene Expression in Postpubertal Holstein Dairy Heifers

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
102 postpubertal Holstein dairy heifers were randomly assigned to a fed or fasted treatment. Liver biopsies were performed to obtain tissue from which mRNA was extracted and used for microarray analysis.  Transcriptional profiling revealed adaptive mechanisms in response to negative energy balance.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment; fed and fasted.  Common reference design employed; reference sample consisting of RNA derived from bovine liver, spleen and placental tissue. Biological replicates of 51 Fed (as control) and 51 Fasted (as treatment). One replicate per array.  Dye swaps performed on 7 of the 51 fasted treatment group samples, and on 5 of the 51 fed treatment group samples.
