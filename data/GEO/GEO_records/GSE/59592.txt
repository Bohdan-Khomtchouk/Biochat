TITLE
DNA methylome analysis in infants from The Gambia / Aflatoxin / Seasonality study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling in infant's blood from a mother/child cohort in The Gambia. The main variables of the analyses were the intra-uterine exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the season of conception. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450k Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in whole peripheral blood obtained at 3-6 months of age. A total of 124 samples were analysed, including 3 technical replicates.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 124 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450k Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
