TITLE
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Indian Isolate): Wild type vs. rpfF mutant

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of the DSF regulon in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) using wild type and the rpfF mutant. Cell-cell signaling mediated by the quorum sensing molecule known as Diffusible Signaling factor (DSF) is required for virulence of Xanthomonas group of plant pathogens. DSF in different Xanthomonas and the closely related plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa regulates diverse traits in a strain specific manner. The transcriptional profiling performed in this study is to elucidate the traits regulated by DSF from the Indian isolate of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which exhibits traits very different from other Xanthomonas group of plant pathogen. In this study, transcription analysis was done between a wild type Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain and an isogenic strain that has a mutation in the DSF biosynthetic gene rpfF.
