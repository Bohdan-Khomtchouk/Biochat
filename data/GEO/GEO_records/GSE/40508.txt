TITLE
Expression data of mouse mucinous lung tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mice (Scgb1a1-rtTA/[tetO]-KRAS.G12D/Nkx2-1+/-) develop mucinous lung tumors.  Gene expression analysis was performed using mRNAs from the whole lungs of the mice compared to that of the control mice. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying development of mucinous lung tumors and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
mRNAs were isolated from the whole lungs of the transgenic mice (Scgb1a1-rtTA/[tetO]-KRAS.G12D/Nkx2-1+/-) after 2 months doxycycline administration and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.  We sought to identify genes induced in mucinous lung tumors.
