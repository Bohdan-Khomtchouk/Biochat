TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of BJ foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC: CRL-2522) depleted of endogenous miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To determine the impact endogenous miRNAs have on the overall transcriptome profile of fibroblasts and on the intrinsic response to virus

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of BJ fibroblasts treated with type 5  Adeno vectors expressing either GFP or GFP-VP55 for indicated time points alone or prior to treatment with IFNB or dsRNA

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
