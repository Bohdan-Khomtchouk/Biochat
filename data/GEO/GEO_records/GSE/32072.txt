TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer FNA and surgical specimens from patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The behavior of breast cancers and their response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy depend on their phenotype which is to a large extent determined by gene expression programs within the cancer cell. The purpose of the analysis was to compare matched gene expression profiles of pretreatment cancer with post-neoadjuvant systemic therapy, residual cancer.

DESIGN
Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors or post-treatment surgical specimens were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to afymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
