SUMMARY
A summary of the work associated to these microarrays is the following: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in RNA silencing that play a role in many biological processes. They are involved in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Extensive experimental data show that they play a role in the pathogenesis of cancer as well as the development of drug resistance during treatment. MiRNA microarrays of sensitive and MTX-resistant HT29 colon cancer cells were performed. The results were analyzed using the GeneSpring GX11.5 software. Differentially expressed microRNAs in resistant cells were identified and miR-224, which was greatly underexpressed and displayed robust raw signal values, was selected for further studies. Putative targets were predicted using TargetScan 5.1 software and intersected with the data from expression microarrays previously performed. This approach allowed us to identify miR-224 targets that were differentially expressed more than 2-fold in resistant cells. Among them, ARL3, CDS2, DCP2, HSPC159, MYST3 and SLC4A4 were validated at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR. Functional assays using an anti-miR against miR-224 desensitized the cells toward MTX, mimicking the resistant phenotype. On the other hand, siRNA treatment against SLC4A4 or incubation of Poly Purine Reverse Hoogsteen (PPRH) hairpins against CDS2 or HSPC159 increased sensitivity to MTX. These results revealed a role for miR-224 and its targets in MTX resistance in HT29 colon cancer cells. KEYWORDS Methotrexate, miRNAs, drug resistance, DHFR
