TITLE
Blood DNA methylation biomarkers predict clinical reactivity in food-sensitized infants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling study of PBMC from 71 unique primary patient blood samples. The Illumina Human Methylation 450k array was used. 29 challenge proven food allergy, 29 sensitized but oral tolerant, 13 non food allergics Mixture of food allergy phenotypes (egg allergic (15), peanut allergic (14)), food sensitization phenotypes (egg sensitized (14), peanut sensitized (15)). 4 samples had technical replicate hybridzations.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 75 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2. Technical replicates were combined during processing, resulting in normalized Beta values for 71 unique primary patient blood samples.

PLATFORM
