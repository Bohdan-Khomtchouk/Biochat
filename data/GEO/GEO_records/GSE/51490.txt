TITLE
GEP of PMBCs during treatment with a gene-modified allogeneic tumor cell vaccine in advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor-induced immunosuppression remains a major challenge for immunotherapy of cancer patients. To further elucidate why an allogeneic gene-modified (Interleukin-7(IL-7)/CD80 co-transfected) renal cell cancer vaccine failed to induce clinically relevant TH1-polarized immune responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from enrolled study patients were analyzed by gene expression profiling (GEP) both prior and after vaccination. At baseline before vaccination, a profound downregulation of gene signatures associated with antigen presentation, immune response/T cells, cytokines/chemokines and signaling/transcription factors was observed in renal cell cancer patients as compared to healthy controls. Vaccination led to a partial reversion of preexisting immunosuppression, however, GEP indicated that an appropriate TH1 polarization could not be achieved. Most interestingly, our results suggest that the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway might be involved in the impairment of immunological responsiveness and the observed TH2 deviation.   In summary, our data suggest that GEP might be a powerful tool for the prediction of immunosuppression and the monitoring of immune responses within immunotherapy trials.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled using Affymetrix Human Gene v1.1 ST microarrays in the following settings: 9 RCC patients were profiled before and after vaccination (pairs of measurements) and additionally 9 healthy control samples were profiled.
