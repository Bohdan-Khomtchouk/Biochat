TITLE
Nur77 overexpression in mouse skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated total RNA from gastrocnemius muscle of wildtype and muscle-specific Nur77 overexpressing transgenic mice to identify Nur77-mediated changes in gene expression. Findings confirmed changes in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and muscle development.

DESIGN
2 replicate Illumina Single Color Mouse WG-6_V2_0 chips were used. 6 wildtype and 6 transgenic mice overexpressing Nur77 in skeletal muscle were used.  RNA was isolated by Trizol and further purified through RNEasy column. RNA from 2 mice were pooled, for a total of 6 samples -- 3 wildtype and 3 transgenic.  The same samples were split into two technical replicate chips.  Each chip contains 3 wildtype and 3 transgenic samples.
