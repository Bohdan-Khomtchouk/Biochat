TITLE
Rhythmic growth explained by coincidence between internal and external cues

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant hypocotyls elongate in response to darkness.  The response to darkness is gated by the circadian clock, such that wild-type plants (Col) only respond to darkness with growth once every 24 hours, whereas arrhythmic lines, such as CCA1-34, will respond to darkness with growth at any time of day.  The experiment here was designed to find genes whose expression was correlated with growth. It should also pick up other genes that are gated by the circadian clock or that are direct targets of CCA1. Keywords: time course
