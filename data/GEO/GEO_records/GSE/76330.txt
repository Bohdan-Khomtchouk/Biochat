TITLE
Global analysis of genes regulated by canonical Wnt pathway

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Up-regulation of canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in liver fibrosis and cancer. To determine canonical Wnt target genes potentially implicated in these diseases, we performed microarray analysis of culture-activated rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) treated with canonical Wnt inhibitors, DKK-1, ICG-001, or FJ9.
