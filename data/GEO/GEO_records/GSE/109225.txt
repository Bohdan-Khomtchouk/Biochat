TITLE
RNA-sequencing of chicken primary myoblasts and myotubes

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Chick is an ideal model system for myogenesis study. Lots of genes would change their expression during myogenesis, however, is there any difference about gene expression between chick and mice? Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the transcriptomes of chicken primary myoblasts and myotubes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The data reported here may provide an important understanding of the genes involved in the regulation of chicken myogenesis.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes in chicken myoblasts versus myotubes

PLATFORM
GPL24517 HiSeq X Ten (Gallus gallus)
