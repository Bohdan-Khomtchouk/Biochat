TITLE
Towards an understanding of the mechanism of hypoevolution of Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula from Microtus fortis

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
More than 40 species of mammal have been reported to be infected naturally with Schistosoma japonicum (Chinese mainland strain) in China. The reed vole, Microtus fortis, is the only known mammalian host in which the schistosomes are unable to mature and cause significant pathogenic changes. Gene expression profiling of the 10 day old schistosomula was performed.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was also used to identify differences in gene expression between Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula from BALB/c mice and from Microtus fortis. 10 day old schistosomula were isolated, total RNA obtained and Agilent one colour labeling used. A custom designed Agilent microarray was used to determine what differential gene expression occurs between parasites maintained in either a permissive (mouse) or non-permissive (vole) hosts.
