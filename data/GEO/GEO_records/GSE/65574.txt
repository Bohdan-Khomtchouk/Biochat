TITLE
Human Calu-3 cell transcriptome response to a wild type infectious clone of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (icMERS) coronavirus and icMERS mutant viruses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to obtain samples for transcriptome analysis using wild type infectious clone of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome  (icMERS) coronavirus and icMERS mutant viruses: icMERS-RFP, icMERS-dNSP16, icMERS-d4B, and icMERS-d3-5.

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Cells: 2B4 Calu-3 cells; seed 5 x 10^5 cells per well on 6 well plates 2 days before infection. Prior to infection, washed cells 2 times with PBS, and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5.  Time matched mocks done in triplicate from same cell stock as rest of samples using culture medium. Time points: 0, 7, 12 and 24 h post-infection (For miRNA: 7, 12 hours only)
