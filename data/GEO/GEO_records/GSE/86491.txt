TITLE
Comprehensive RNA sequencing of healthy human endometrium at two time points of the menstrual cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA, sncRNA and lncRNA show a clear difference in expression between proliferative phase and 7–9 days after ovulation, thorough described together with lncRNA, snoRNA and snRNA not previously reported in healthy human endometrium

DESIGN
7 small RNA and 7 total RNA samples sequenced from endmometrial tissue from two time points of the menstrual cycle. Gene expression from the two time points compared. Additionally 12 small RNA from stromal cells was sequenced.
