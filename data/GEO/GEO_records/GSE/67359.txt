TITLE
Non-reciprocal Interspecies Hybridization Barriers in the Capsella Genus are Established in the Endosperm

ORGANISM
Capsella rubella ; Capsella grandiflora ; Capsella grandiflora x Capsella rubella

SUMMARY
We described in this work the reproductive barrier between Capsella rubella and Capsella grandiflora leading to hybrid seed inviability. The transcriptome revealed a similar response to the one observed in interploidy hybrid seeds.

DESIGN
Study of seed transcriptome in Capsella rubella, Capsella grandiflora and reciprocal hybrid seeds
