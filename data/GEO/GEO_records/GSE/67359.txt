TITLE
Non-reciprocal Interspecies Hybridization Barriers in the Capsella Genus are Established in the Endosperm

ORGANISM
Capsella rubella

SUMMARY
We described in this work the reproductive barrier between Capsella rubella and Capsella grandiflora leading to hybrid seed inviability. The transcriptome revealed a similar response to the one observed in interploidy hybrid seeds.

DESIGN
Study of seed transcriptome in Capsella rubella, Capsella grandiflora and reciprocal hybrid seeds
