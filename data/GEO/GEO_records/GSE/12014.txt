TITLE
Expression of EBV miRNAs in numerous EBV-positive cell lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
EBV-positive cell lines were assayed for expression of EBV miRNAs.  The names of the miRNAs are from miRBase from Fall 2007.  Microarray probes are tandem complements of the mature miRNA sequence.  We assayed Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), primary effusion lymphoma, and lymphoblastoid cell lines.   We also assayed primary B cells that were infected with the B95-8 strain of EBV, which was found to express EBV miRNAs as early as 20 hours post infection.  We have found PTLD and BLs from HIV-positive donors both express EBV miRNAs.  These types of cell lines have not previously been found to express viral miRNAs.  We have found that cells that support type I and type II latency express only the BART miRNAs, whereas cells that support type III latency express BART and BHRF1 miRNAs.  Furthermore, BL cell lines that spontaneously lose EBV express levels of the viral miRNAs that are at least 5-fold lower than cell lines that do not lose EBV.
