TITLE
Remission in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Achieved on Different Drug Regimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Remission has become both the gold standard for clinical care and the end point for clinical trials for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Using gene expression microarrays, we found that when remission induced by methotrexate (MTX) or MTX plus a TNF inhibitor (etanercept, Et) (MTX+Et) was compared with healthy controls, there were notable differences in gene expression patterns, demonstrating that remission is not a restoration of immunologic normalcy. Differences were detected in PBMC as well as in granulocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from isolated PBMC and granulocytes from patients with polyarticular JIA and from healthy controls. Patients had achieved remission (clinical remission on medicine as defined by Wallace et al, Arthritis Rheum. 2005;52(11):3354-3562) using either MTX or MTX+Et.
