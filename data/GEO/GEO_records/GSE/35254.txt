TITLE
High-throughput Illumina Hiseq2000 seuqencing of small RNAs from Hevea brasiliensis PB260 and PB217 clones

ORGANISM
Hevea brasiliensis

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, short, single-stranded RNAs with essential roles in gene regulation in various organisms including higher plants.  In contrast to the vast information on miRNAs from many economically important plants, almost nothing has been reported on the identification or analysis of miRNAs from rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis L.), the most important natural rubber-producing crop.  To identify miRNAs and their target genes in rubber tree, high throughput sequencing combined with a computational approach was performed. Four small RNA libraries were constructed for deep sequencing from mature and young leaves of two rubber tree clones, PB 260 and PB 217, which provide high and low latex yield, respectively. 237 miRNAs belonging to 37 known miRNA families were identified, and northern hybridization validated miRNA expression and revealed developmental stage-dependent and clone-specific expression for some miRNAs. We took advantage of the newly released rubber tree genome assembly as well as the genomic databases from leafy spurge and cassava, two species related to rubber tree, and predicted 15 novel miRNAs.

DESIGN
4 samples examined: PB260 mature leaves, PB260 young leaves, PB217 mature leaves, and PB217 young leaves.
