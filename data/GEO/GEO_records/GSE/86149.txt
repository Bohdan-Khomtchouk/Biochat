TITLE
S. cerevisiae RNA-seq in wild-type and sir2Δhst1Δ strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in the sir2Δhst1Δ strain compared to wild-type

DESIGN
The sequenced strains are matα with hmr deleted to avoid pseudodiploid conditions. Differential expression in the sir2Δhst1Δ strain was used to avoid any complementation in a single deletion strain. This experiment represents two technical replicates for each strain
