TITLE
Expression data from IR64 rice transformed with 35S::OsPSTOL1 gene

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsPSTOL1 confers phosphorus (P)-deficiency tolerance in rice through enhancement of early root growth. The larger root surface area at early stage provides the plants an advantage for nutrient uptake. We conducted microarrays to determine the genes which are constitutively regulated by OsPSTOL1, independent of P supply and developmental stage.

DESIGN
For Affymetrix microarrays, root RNA samples from IR64 35S::OsPSTOL1 plants (transgenic: T) and Nulls (non-transgenic: NT) grown in P-deficient soil +/- application of P fertilizer were used. Plants were at the reproductive/heading stage (- P treatment) and at mid-tillering (+P treatment), respectively.
