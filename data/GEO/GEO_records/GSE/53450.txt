TITLE
eRNA: A graphic user interface-based tool for RNA sequencing data analysis [mRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we performed RNA sequencing analysis using 10 tissue samples from human prostate and evaluated efficiency and accuracy of eRNA on mRNA-seq data analysis.

DESIGN
We sequenced mRNAs from the 10 human tissue samples. After that, we identified mRNAs in these samples against known human genes.
