TITLE
Distinct STAT5 concentrations uniquely control establishment and differentiation of mammary epithelium during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To dissect regulatory processes of cell proliferation and differentiation we generated mouse strains carrying any combination of the four Stat5 alleles, thus expressing STAT5 from 0 to 100%. RNA-Seq analyses revealed that different STAT5 levels activate specific genetic programs linked to cell proliferation and differentiation.

DESIGN
We refer to wild-type mice and Stat5abfl/fl mice as AABB mice; Stat5abfl/fl;MMTV-Cre (with Stat5ab-deficient mammary epithelial cells) as Null mice; Stat5a-/- mice as BB mice; Stat5b-/- mice as AA mice; Stat5ab+/null mice as AB mice.
