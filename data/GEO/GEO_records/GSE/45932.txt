TITLE
Rat MeDIP Array, naïve, epileptic, and adenosine treated

ORGANISM
Rattus rattus

SUMMARY
Epilepsy causes altered gene expression; transient adenosine treatment inhibits progression of epileptogenesis Hippocampus of epileptic rat is hypermethylated compared to naïve; adenosine treatment causes hypomethylation

DESIGN
Metylation state in epileptic rats (9 weeks post kainic acid induced status epilepticus) was compared to naïve (untreated) rats and epileptic rats treated with adenosine for 5 days

PLATFORM
GPL16994 NimbleGen Rat CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter 720k array [100718_RN34_CpG_Refseq_Prom_MeDIP]
