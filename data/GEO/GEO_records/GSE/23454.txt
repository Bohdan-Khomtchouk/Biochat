TITLE
LVS iclR deletion mutant vs. wild-type LVS

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis

SUMMARY
These microarray studies are part of a larger study characterizing a deletion mutant of the putative transcriptional regulator IclR in Francisella tularensis LVS and SchuS4 strains. The microarrays were performed using RNA isolated from wild-type LVS and a LVS iclR deletion mutant after growing in Chamberlain?s defined media pH 6.3 to early mid-log phase. Results suggest that IclR affects expression of several genes after determining statistically significant differences by SAM.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between LVS iclR deletion mutant vs. wild-type LVS.

PLATFORM
