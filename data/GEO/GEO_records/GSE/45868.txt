TITLE
Transcriptome study of human mammary epithelial cells following exposure to polymeric Eudragit RS nanoparticles part 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further study the transcriptome of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC 184) after exposure to polymeric Eudragit RS nanoparticles (ENP), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure or not to ENP.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in HMEC 184 cells (90 % confluence) incubated with 25 µg/mL ENPs (70 nm) for 24 h, and without incubation (control) were measured. Three biological replicates were performed as controls (US_09; US_10; US_11) and ENP exposed ones (US_12; US_13; US_14).
