TITLE
Expression data from rat soleus during chronic intermittent physical inactivity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression of the rat soleus muscle was assessed with microarrays after 11 days of intermittent physical inactivity (10 hr/day) and compared to normally caged rats with voluntary standing and intermittent cage movements. Keywords: between group design

DESIGN
Rats were prevented from standing on the their hindlimbs for 10 hrs/day for 11 days and compared to caged rats with normal standing/ambulatory activity. RNA was extracted from soleus muscles and each array represents the pooling of the RNA from the soleus of 4-5 different rats.
