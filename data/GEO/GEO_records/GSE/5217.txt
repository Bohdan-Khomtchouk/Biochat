TITLE
Expression data from rat soleus during chronic intermittent physical inactivity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression of the rat soleus muscle was assessed with microarrays after 11 days of intermittent physical inactivity (10 hr/day) and compared to normally caged rats with voluntary standing and intermittent cage movements. Keywords: between group design
