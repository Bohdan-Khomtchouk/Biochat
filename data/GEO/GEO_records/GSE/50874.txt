TITLE
Methylation Profiling of Human Kidney Tubules

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to decrease the cell type heterogeneity of kidney tissues to increase the resolution of methylation profiles. To that end, microdissected human kidney tissue from patients are used and hybridized on Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays.

DESIGN
We extract genomic DNA from microdissected human kidney tubule samples. And used these genomic DNA for the Illumina 450K beads array.
