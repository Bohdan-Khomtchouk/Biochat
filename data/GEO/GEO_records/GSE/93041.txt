TITLE
Gene expression in the anterior cingulate cortex in mice treated with ketamine (3mg/kg) or sleep deprivation (SD) during 12 hrs., and saline as the control group.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Both, sleep deprivation and ketamine treatments are efficient and fast-acting antidepressants acting within the first 12-24 hr. post-treatment.  This experiment was designed to identify if common transcriptional responses are elicited by both treatments

DESIGN
Mice were divided into 3 groups and administered either:  A) KT (3mg/kg i.p at ZT5; B) saline [100 Î¼l/0.03kg i.p.] at ZT 5; (control) or C) SD (animals were kept awake from ZT 0 to ZT 12). All groups were euthanized at ZT 13.
