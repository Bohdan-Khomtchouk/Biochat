TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of mouse pancreatic islets cultured at low vs high ambient glucose

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Islets are known to respond to changes in ambient glucose. To quantify the transcriptome-wide changes in ambient glucose, we compared transcriptome of islets exposed to low and high glucose.

DESIGN
Isolated islets from wild type male mice. Islets from adult males were pooled, cultured overnight in RPMI containing 11 mM glucose. The next day, all islets were  starved in RPMI containing 2.8 mM glucose for 2 hours before stimulation with 2.8 mM glucose or 16.8 mM glucose for 12 hours. Islets were lysed in Trizol for RNA isolation and library construction.
