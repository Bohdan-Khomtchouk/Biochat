TITLE
Mapping of H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation in zebrafish cells (Gene expression)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The genomic distribution of post-translationally modified histones in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome remain largely unraveled. The objective of this study was to (1) design a microarray covering all zebrafish gene promoters and 5' end of coding regions, and (ii) using these arrrays, map the genome-wide distribution of trimethylated H3K4 and H3K27 in the embryo derived ZF4 cell line.  Specifically, we determined the enrichment profile of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and of both (co-enriched) modifications in ZF4 cells. We determined average enrichment profiles through metagene analysis, functional terms enriched among genes marked by either modification, pathway analysis, and in relation to gene expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression experiments were performed on three biological replicates.
