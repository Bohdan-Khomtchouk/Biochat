TITLE
Expression data from 2-week-old Arabidopsis untreated seedlings grown under a short day condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana defense regulator EDM2 was previously shown to be specifically required for disease resistance to the pathogenic oomycete Hyaloperonospora parasitica aradidopsis mediated by the R protein RPP7. We found EDM2 to have a promoting effect on several distinct developmental processes, such as leaf pavement cell development, vegetative phase change or the floral transition. We further identified the atypical protein kinase WNK8 to physically interact with EDM2 in nuclei. Microarray data support regulatory interactions between WNK8 and EDM2 as well as their functional association with the autonomous floral promotion pathway.

DESIGN
To assess interactions between EDM2 and WNK8 at the transcriptome level, we profiled transcript patterns of Col-0, edm2-2, wnk8-1, wnk8-2, wnk8-3 and an edm2-2 complementation line pXVE:HA-EDM2-a seedlings using Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome arrays. Plant materials were grown under short day conditions for 2 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from untreated seedlings and hybridized to the GeneChip following the manufacturer's instructions. Each genotype has three independent biological replicates.
