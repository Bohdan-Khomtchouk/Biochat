TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that blood and esophageal tissues shared similar DNA methylation patterns within the same individual,suggesting an influence of genetic background on DNA methylation. Recent studies have shown a genetic influence on gene expression variation, chromatin, and DNA methylation.  However, the effects of genetic background and tissue types on DNA methylation at the genome-wide level have not been characterized extensively.  To study the effect of genetic background and tissue types on global DNA methylation, we performed DNA methylation analysis using the Affymetrix 500K SNP array on tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and blood DNA from 30 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).  The use of multiple tissues from 30 individuals allowed us to evaluate variation of DNA methylation states across tissues and individuals.  Our results demonstrate that blood and esophageal tissues shared similar DNA methylation patterns within the same individual, suggesting an influence of genetic background on DNA methylation.  Furthermore, we showed that tissue types are important contributors of DNA methylation states.

DESIGN
Methylation and gDNA intensity data derived from Affymetrix 500k array. 30 individuals with blood, normal and tumor esophageal tissues.
