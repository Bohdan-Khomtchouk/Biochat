TITLE
Antagonizing miR-128 abrogates chemoresistance-associated metastasis and is therapeutic in non-small cell lung cancer [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alteration and significant pathway(s) following miR-128 transduction in A549 lung cancer cells. We find several significant pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and TGF-β signaling activated by miR-128 overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from A549 lung cancer cells stably transduced with miR-128 precursor or vector control and subjected to mRNA microarray (Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K) analysis, with two biological replications for each treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
