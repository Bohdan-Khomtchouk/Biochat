TITLE
Me3K27 Histone H3 ChIP DNA from HeLa S3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Me3K27 Histone H3 ChIP DNA was isolated from HeLa S3 cells and surveyed for binding in the ENCODE regions on NimbleGen ENCODE arrays. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Me3K27 Histone H3-ChIP DNA and reference ChIP DNA (background obtained with normal rabbit IgG) were isolated from untreated HeLa S3 cells. Combined Me3K27 Histone H3 and reference ChIP DNA samples were hybridized to a NimbleGen ENCODE tiling array that contains overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. The series is comprised of three biological replicates, hybridized separately to three arrays.
