TITLE
Gene Expression analysis comparison between control and CC214-2 resistant GBM39 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present gene expression analysis data on two vehicle treated and two CC214-2 (an mTOR kinase inhibitor) resistant GlioBlastoma Multiforme 39 (GBM39) xenografts, showing that the expressioin profiles of 88 genes are significantly different between the two groups.

DESIGN
GBM39 primary neurospheres were cultured in standard cancer stem cell medium conditions and then were injected in the mice flanks to generate xenograft tissues. Mice carrying CC214-2 resistant xenografts were treated with a solution of CC214-2 once every two days, by gavage, for 40 days. Total RNA was extracted from GBM39 control and CC214-2 resistant xenografts using the Qiagen RNA micro kit protocol and analysed by Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array
