TITLE
miR-203 and miR-205 expression patterns identify subgroups of prognosis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Mus musculus x Mus spretus

SUMMARY
Identification of the expression pattern of miRNAs at different stages of skin cancer progression in a panel of murine skin cancer cell lines miR-203 and miR-205 were differentially expressed in this panel, and were evaluated as biomarkers of prognosis in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

DESIGN
Three main tumor phenotypes: (i) Squamous non-malignant: Five non-malignant cell lines: three of them immortalized keratinocyte cell lines, and of them two papilloma cell lines. (ii) Three malignant squamous cell lines. (iii) Five malignant spindle cell lines. One replicate per array, except A5 that was done in duplicate as control

PLATFORM
GPL20794 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.10.0 - hsa, mmu & rno
