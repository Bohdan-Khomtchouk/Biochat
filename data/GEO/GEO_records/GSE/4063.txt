TITLE
Gene expression in skeletal muscle in AMPK gamma3 knock-out mice and wild type littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of AMPK gamma3-dependent transcriptional responses by analyzing global gene expression in the white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle in AMPK gamma3 knock-out mice and corresponding wild type littermates. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Mice were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle. Gene expression profiles were characterized in 14 weeks male mice fasted over-night. 6 biological replicates.
