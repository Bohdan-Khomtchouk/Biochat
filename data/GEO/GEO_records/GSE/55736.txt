TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of vascular smooth muscle cells treated by etonogestrel (ETO), medroxyprogesterone acetate (M) or progesterone (P)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of long-acting progestin-only contraceptive (LAPC)-mediated differential gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We tested the hypothesis that LAPCs influence expression of several common genes associated with differentiation, survival and migration of VMSCs. Results provide important information of several common and unique gene expression profiles in cultured VSMC treated with ETO, M or P. Among ETO and M responsive genes, up- or down-regulated common genes were determined and used further confirmation and in vitro functional analyses.

DESIGN
Total RNA (n=3) obtained from cultured aortic VSMCs treated with vehicle only (CON) or ETO or M or P for 6h.
