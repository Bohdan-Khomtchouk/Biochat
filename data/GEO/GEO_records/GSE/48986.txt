TITLE
Gene expression changes during hematopoietic cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor cells (HPCs), and differentiated cell. Gene expressions of long-term HSCs (CD34-ckit+Sca1+Lineage-),  short term HSCs (CD34+ckit+Sca1+Lineage-), Progenitor cells (ckit+Sca1- Lineage-), and differentiated cels (Lineage+)  were examined by microarray. Results provide insight into the mechanism of hematopoietic cell differentiation.

DESIGN
Long-term HSCs (CD34-ckit+Sca1+Lineage-), Short term-HSCs (CD34+ckit+Sca1+Lineage-), Progenitor cells (ckit+Sca1- Lineage-, and Lineage+), and differentiated cell (Lineage+) were sorted from mouse bone marraw and were examined by microarray. Results provide insight into the mechanism of hematopoietic cell differentiation.
