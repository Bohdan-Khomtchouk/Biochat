TITLE
Genes induced by VEGF on the chick CAM after 24h

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We determined gene expression profiles which were induced in the chick chorio-allantoic membrane 24 h after application of recombinant human VEGF.

DESIGN
Three individual CAMs with clearly visible induction of new capillaries were compared to a pool of three normal CAMs of the same developmental day.
