TITLE
Regulation of genes expression in photoreceptor and other retinal cells by histone H3 tri-methylation at K27 during retinal development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze roles of histone H3 tri-methylation for transcription in retina, global transcription patterns of retinal cells of Ezh2, H3K27 methylase, knockout mice and control were examined

DESIGN
Examination of global mRNA expression patterns of mouse retinal cells fractioned into Cd73+ photoreceptors and Cd73- other retinal cells at postnatal 12 mouse

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
