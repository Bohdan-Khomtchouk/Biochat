TITLE
Investigation of Prognostic Markers in Soft tisse Sarcoma by Gene Expression and Tissue Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential: SW684 (low grade), HT1080 (high grade), GCT (metastatic). Differential gene expression may elucidate biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Common reference design. Reference cell line: Pooled Normal fibroblast cell line MRC5, labelled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Cy3) in every experiment. Samples: Sarcoma cell lines labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Cy5). At least 3 replicates for each tumour grade.
