TITLE
Investigation of Prognostic Markers in Soft tisse Sarcoma by Gene Expression and Tissue Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential: SW684 (low grade), HT1080 (high grade), GCT (metastatic). Differential gene expression may elucidate biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis. Keywords: disease state analysis
