TITLE
Ubiquitinated histone H2A mapping in Drosophila ML-DmBG3 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Monoubiquitinated histone H2A  produced by the Sce/Ring subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) was mapped genome-wide in Drosophila ML-DmBG3 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to Affymetrix tiling arrays.

DESIGN
ML-DmBG3 chromatin immunoprecipitated with anti-histone H2AK119ub antibody and matching input chromatin were amplified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix tiling arrays to determine the locations of ubiquitinated H2A genome-wide.
