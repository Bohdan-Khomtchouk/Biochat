TITLE
Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to zymolyase treatment

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The evaluation of zymolyase treatment using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. The yeast BY4743 strain was used for this study. Yeast cells were treated with Zymolyase (final conc. 300 U/ml), and incubated at 37 degree for ten minutes. Digestion process was not provided for control sample. Total RNA was isolated with commercial kit (FastRNA Pro Red kit, Q-Biogene), and amplified RNA (aRNA) was synthesized with 3'IVT Express kit (Affymetrix). All samples were hybridized with Gene Chip (Yeast Genome 2.0 Array, Affymetrix), then each array chip was scanned by GeneChip Sanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
