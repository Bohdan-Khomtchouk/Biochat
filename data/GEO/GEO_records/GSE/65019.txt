TITLE
Effect in MV4;11 cells of 3hr cortistatin A treatment on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the marine natural product cortistatin A (CA) as an inhibitor of CDK8 to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of CDK8 regulates super-enhancer function and inhibits AML proliferation. In this series, we examine the transcriptional effect on MV4;11 cells of 3hrs exposure to CA to identify immediate effects.

DESIGN
MV4;11 cells were treated in triplicate with either DMSO or CA for 3hrs. RNA was harvested and hybridized to microarrays to assess transcriptional changes.
