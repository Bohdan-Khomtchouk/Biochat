TITLE
Comparative analysis of microRNAs from Calsarcin-1 knockout vs wild-type littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present study focuses on the identification of differentially regulated microRNAs in Calsarcin-1 knockout mice, which shows dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from hearts of Calsarcin-1 knockout and wild-type mice (4x each) was used to identify the differentially regulated microRNA between the genotypes using Illumina mouse Sentrix Beadchip platform. Differentially regulated microRNAs were identified by calculating the standard deviation differences of a given probe in Cs1-ko vs WT mice comparison.
