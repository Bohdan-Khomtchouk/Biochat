TITLE
Gene expression profiles of SOX17 overexpression in the KYSE170 luciferase cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX17 is a transcriptional factor containing DNA-binding domain HMG box, we hypothesized that there are more genes other than in Wnt singnaling pathway to be transcriptionally regulated by SOX17 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  We performed the GeneChips expression array analyses to reveal more transcriptional target for SOX17.

DESIGN
In this study, the esophageal cancer cell line, KYSE170-luc, were transfection with  empty vector and expression plasmids of SOX17 for 12 hours. Total RNA were prepared for microarray assays.
