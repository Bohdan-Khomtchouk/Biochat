TITLE
Expression data from mouse muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The knock-out of calpain 3 (C3KO) is a murine model for calpainopathies wich shows a mild dystrophic phenotype with signs of muscle degeneration. Adult (A) mice show a more severe phenotype than young (Y) mice which only present inflammatory infiltrates in most severely affected muscles, such as the soleus. Other muscles (e.g. quadriceps) are much less affected. We used microarray technology to compare gene expression profiles of young and adult muscles in wild-type (wt) and C3KO mice, in two types of muscle: soleus (affected) and quadriceps (much less affected).

DESIGN
11 wt (7 adult and 4 young) and 11 C3KO (7 adult and 4 young) mice were used in this study for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The soleus and the quadriceps muscles were obtained from each mouse. All mice were males.
