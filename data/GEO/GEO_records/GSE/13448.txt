TITLE
p53 Regulates Hematopoietic Stem Cell Quiescence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The importance of the p53 protein in the cellular response to DNA damage is well known, but its function during steady-state hematopoiesis has not been established. We have defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, especially in promoting the enhanced quiescence seen in HSCs that lack the MEF/ELF4 transcription factor. Transcription profiling of HSCs isolated from wild type and p53 null mice identified Gfi-1 and Necdin as p53 target genes and using lentiviral vectors to upregulate or knockdown the expression of these genes, we show their importance in regulating HSC quiescence. Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells.

DESIGN
RNAs isolated from wild type, p53 -/- and p53 -/- Mef -/-  LSK cells were used in oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix)
