TITLE
Analysis of gene expression and splicing after doxycycline-induced knockdown of SRSF3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SRSF3 is overexpressed in human invasive ovarian cancer and its overexpression is required for cancer cell growth and survival. To decipher the mechnisms behind the role of SRSF3 in ovarian cancer, we examined the gene expression and splicing in the ovarian cancer cell line that was engineered to express a doxycycline-induced SRSF3 siRNA, which was able to knockdown SRSF3 expression by 90% and induce apoptosis.

DESIGN
Total RNAs extracted from A2780/SRSF3si2, a subline of ovarian cancer cell line A2780, treated with or without doxycycline at 0.1ug/ml for three days were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST Array
