TITLE
Engineering Bone Tissue Substitutes from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression data of human embryonic stem cell-, human induced pluripotent stem cell- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells before and after culture onto osteoinductive scaffolds in perfusion bioreactors. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that perfusion culture in bioreactors influenced the expression levels of several genes involved in proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Results provide important information of the response of human embryonic stem cell-, human induced pluripotent stem cell- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cell to osteogenic stimulation under perfusion cultures, such as genes involved in cell proliferation and division as well as osteogenic differentiation and bone development.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human embryonic stem cell-, human induced pluripotent stem cell- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells before and after culture under osteogenic conditions in perfusion bioreactors for 5 weeks.
