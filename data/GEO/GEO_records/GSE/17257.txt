TITLE
Expression data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with clioquinol

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Clioquinol (CQ or iodochlorhydroxyquin, 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) is a hydrophobic chelator of copper, zinc, and iron. It was extensively used as an antibiotic for the treatment of diarrhea and skin infection in the mid-1900s, but then withdrawn because it was reported to be associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) in Japan. Interest in this drug was recently revived as it was shown that CQ specifically kills cancer cells and significantly decreases Aβ level. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of CQ’s drug effects and side effects are still unclear. We used yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model to study how CQ affects molecular and cellular functions. Genechip analysis was utilized to examine the effect of CQ on gene expression at the genomic level.

DESIGN
To study gene expression profiles of yeast treated with CQ, yeast cells were treated with CQ or DMSO for 5 hours and RNAs were extracted for microarray analysis.
