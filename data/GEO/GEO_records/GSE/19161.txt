TITLE
Expression data from patients with advanced ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integration of several ovarian cancer datasets to identify a reproducible predictors of survival Four microarray datasets from different institutions were reprocessed in a uniform manner, into a single training dataset. Survival analysis was performed and a validation cohort (61 patients from 3 institutions) was profiled using a custom array to confirm the prognostic value of the predictors. The four datasets were obtained from the following reports: Spentzos D, Levine DA, Ramoni MF, et al. Gene expression signature with independent prognostic significance in epithelial ovarian cancer. J Clin Oncol 2004;22:4700-10 Bild AH, Yao G, Chang JT, et al. Oncogenic pathway signatures in human cancers as a guide to targeted therapies. Nature 2006;439:353-7 Marquez RT, Baggerly KA, Patterson AP, et al. Patterns of gene expression in different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer correlate with those in normal fallopian tube, endometrium, and colon. Clin Cancer Res 2005;11:6116-26 Zhang L, Volinia S, Bonome T, et al. Genomic and epigenetic alterations deregulate microRNA expression in human epithelial ovarian cancer.
