TITLE
Transcriptional responses of human colon and liver cancer cells to TCF inhibition.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of Wnt/TCF signaling is closely associated with cancers arising from the gastrointestinal tract, inlcluding colon cancer and liver cancer. The goal of this study is to understand the transcriptional programs underlying Wnt/TCF activation in gastrointestinal cancers. We examined the transcriptional responses to TCF inhibition in cultured human colon cancer cells and liver cancer cells that are characteristic of Wnt pathway activation.

DESIGN
Human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and colon cancer cell line LS174T with or without expression of a dominant negative form of TCF4

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
