TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat liver tissues after carbon tetrachloride administration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Liver cirrhosis (LC) is pathologically characterized with abnormality and necrosis of hepatic cells, proliferation of fibrous tissue, nodular regeneration and pseudolobule formation. We used Rat Genome 230 2.0 microarray to further highlight the rat liver tissues after carbon tetrachloride administration

DESIGN
The rat model of liver cirrhosis (LC) was established, and the expression profiles of liver tissues from LC were detected at  3, 6, and 9 weeks using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Then the significantly changed genes related to LC were identified. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
