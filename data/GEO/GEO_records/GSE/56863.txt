TITLE
Effect of MiSSP7 overexpression on the Poplar root transcriptome

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
The Poplar transcriptome was analyzed in Populus tremulaxPopulus alba clone 717-1B4 control roots and in two  poplar lines overexpressing MiSSP7.

DESIGN
We performed 9 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Populus tremulaxPopulus alba clone 717-1B4 control roots, as well as from roots of LINE1 and LINE2 MiSSP7 overexpressor poplars (3 biological replicates each). All samples were labeled with Cy3.
