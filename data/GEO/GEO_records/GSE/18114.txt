TITLE
Osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) within a perfusion bioreactor system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hMSCs were cultured for eight days within perfused three-dimensional matrices under conditions of oscillatory, continuous or static fluid flow of osteogenic media.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from hMSC samples seeded within porous glass scaffolds following eight days exposure to either a high flow rate oscillatory (10L/24hrs), low flow rate oscillatory (1L/24hrs), continuous (1mL/24hrs) or a static (0mL/24hrs) flow rate condition.  3 RNA samples from each flow rate condition were analysed.
