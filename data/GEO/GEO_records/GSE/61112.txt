TITLE
Whole genome microRNA expression profiling of long-lived daf-2(e1370) mutant in C. elegans at young adult stage

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to get an insight into the complex interplay of miRNAs in insulin signaling, we profiled the small RNA polulation of daf-2(e1370) worms at young adult stage by Next Generation sequencing.

DESIGN
We performed Next Generation sequencing to compare miRNA profiles of wild-type and long-lived daf-2(e1370) mutant at young adult stage
