TITLE
Comparative analysis of mouse oral cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative microarray analysis of  indolent or aggressive mouse oral cancer cell lines was performed to identify gene expression signatures and specific molecules involved in aggressive tumor growth.

DESIGN
We compared 3 indolent cell lines (MOC1, MOC22, MOC23) to 1 aggressive line and it's derivatives (MOC2, MOC2-7 and MOC2-10).  We also included a cell line generated from a lymph node metastasis of the MOC2 tumor.  The lines were all analyzed in triplicated except for MOC1 which was done in quadruplicate. Finally, we included duplicate samples of primary, normal C57BL/6 oral keratinocytes grown in the same media as the MOC cell lines.
