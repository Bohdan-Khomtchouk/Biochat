TITLE
Trivalent arsenic inhibits the functions of chaperonin complex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify yeast mutants with arsenite hypersensitivity. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
Matched pools of yeast knockout (YKO) mutants were grown in paired growth media lacking or containing arsenite at various concentrations. The relative abundances of the YKO mutants were profiled using microarrays. Three types of pools were used in this study: (1) heterozygous diploid mutants; (2) haploid mutants obtained as progeny from the heterozygous diploid pool; and (3) haploid mutants also containing a null mutation of the prefoldin gene PFD1.
