TITLE
Genome-wide maps of FoxP3 binding in FoxP3WT and FoxP3A384T Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FoxP3 binding sites in Treg cells expressing WT or A384T mutant FoxP3 were examined.

DESIGN
Chromatin was prepared from FoxP3+ Treg cells from FoxP3WT and FoxP3A384T mice, immunoprecipitated with anti-FoxP3 antibody, and the bound DNA were subjected to deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
