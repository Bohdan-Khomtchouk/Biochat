TITLE
Tn5 transposase-mediated library preparation of single-cell cDNAs for RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of single cell-derived genomic DNA and/or cDNAs brings novel insights into oncogenesis and embryogenesis. However, traditional library preparation for RNA-Seq requires multiple steps, including shearing the target DNA/RNA and following sequential enzymatic reactions, which result in consequent sample loss and stochastic variation at each step. Such variation may significantly affect the output from sequencing. We have found that a new technique of library preparation using hyperactive Tn5 transposase for the next-generation sequencer of Illumina's platform provided high-quality libraries from 100ng of short-length (average 700~800 bp) single-cell level cDNA. This new method reduced the number of steps in the protocol, which resulted in improved reproducibility and reduced variation among the specimens.

DESIGN
Two methods of library preparation (sonication, tagmentation with hyperactive Tn5 transposase) were compared in the case of RNA-Seq for single-cell level cDNA. Technical triplicates were used.
