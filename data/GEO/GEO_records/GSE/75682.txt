TITLE
Characterization of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) in Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We proposed an experiment that determines liver gene regulation profiles in GRLKO. By comparison to the wide type C57BL/6 mouse, we determined the contribution of GR on liver gene expression either at basal level or after  Dexamethasone (DEX) injection.

DESIGN
WT and GR knockout mice were divided into two groups, one with dexamethasone treatment and one with out.  Each group has four replicates.
