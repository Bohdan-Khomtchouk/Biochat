TITLE
Epigenome analysis of dnmt target sites [DKO8 cell line]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of target sites of dnmt3b isoforms in HCT derivative cell line DKO8. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
