TITLE
Tumor suppressor p53 integrates host defense and cell fate during bacterial pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was conducted on lung RNA from C57BL/6J mice and compared to lung RNA from B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Ty/J mice (p53 NULL) to observe differences in baseline gene expression in mice with p53 deficiency.

DESIGN
Lung RNA was isolated at baseline (saline airway exposure) in a total of 5 biological reps for both C57BL/6J (WT) and p53-deficient mice.
