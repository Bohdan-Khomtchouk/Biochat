TITLE
Effect of forced uncoupling protein-1 expression on 3T3-L1 adipocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis underlying the response of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to forced expression of UCP1. Keywords: adipocyte, Uncoupling protein 1, microarray

DESIGN
3T3L1 adipocytes expressing control and Uncoupling protein 1 were grown to confluence.  Total RNA was collected and hybridized to Codelink mouse whole  genome Bioarrays.  All the samples were done in triplicate.
