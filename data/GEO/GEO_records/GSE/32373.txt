TITLE
Gene expression analysis of OX40-triggered mouse Treg

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) maintain the tumor microenvironment in an immunosuppressive state preventing effective anti-tumor immune response. A possible strategy to overcome Treg cell suppression focuses on OX40, a costimulatory molecule expressed constitutively by Treg cells while induced in activated effector T (Teff) cells. OX40 stimulation by the agonist mAb OX86 inhibits Treg cell suppression and boosts Teff cell activation. Here we uncover the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of OX86 treatment dissecting its distinct effects on Treg and on effector memory T (Tem) cells, which are the most abundant CD4+ populations strongly expressing OX40 at the tumor site. In response to OX86, tumor-infiltrating Treg cells produced significantly less interleukin 10 (IL-10), possibly in relation to a decrease in the transcription factor IRF1. Tem cells responded to OX86 by upregulating surface CD40L expression, providing a licensing signal to dendritic cells (DCs). The CD40L/CD40 axis was required for Tem cell-mediated in vitro DC maturation and in vivo DC migration. Accordingly, OX86 treatment was no longer therapeutic in CD40 KO mice. In conclusion, following OX40 stimulation, blockade of Treg cell suppression and enhancement of the Tem cell adjuvant effect both concurred to free DCs from immunosuppression and to activate the immune response against the tumor.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted mouse FoxP3-GFP+ Treg activated in vitro with anti-CD3 in the presence of an OX40-agonist mAb (OX86) or isotype control.
