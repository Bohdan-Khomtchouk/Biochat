TITLE
Expression data from siRNAs against SLC45A3-ELK4 in LNCaP cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SLC45A3-ELK4 is found in LNCaP and other prostate cancer samples. We used microarrays to detail the global changes of gene expression when LNCaP cells were treated with siRNAs against SLC45A3-ELK4.

DESIGN
We transfected LNCaP cells with siRNAs against SLC45A3-ELK4 and siGl2 control. 72hrs later, RNAs were harvested.
