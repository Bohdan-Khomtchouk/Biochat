TITLE
Potential Influence of Staphylococcus aureus Clonal Complex 30 Genotype and Transcriptome on Hematogenous Infections

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA-Seq to assess genomic transcriptional profiles of S. aureus clinical isolates from Clonal Complex 30 and related genetic backgrounds. In this study, CC30 isolates were shown to be significantly less virulent than other CCs in two in vivo sepsis models. The association of CC30 with adhesin-based complications in humans  but not sepsis-induced mortality in animal models may be due in part to its unique genomic transcriptional profile and suggests that specific genotypes of S. aureus may be more likely to elicit certain complication types.

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome profiles of exponential growth phase in vitro cultures were generated by RNA-Seq in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500.

PLATFORM
GPL19006 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Staphylococcus aureus)
