TITLE
Comparison of the Transcriptional Profiles of Melanocytes from Dark and Light Skinned Individuals under Basal Conditions and Following Ultraviolet-B Irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the whole-genome transcriptional profile of 6 cell lines of dark melanocytes (DM) and 6 of light melanocytes (LM) at basal conditions and after UVB at different time points (6, 12 and 24h) to investigate the mechanisms by which melanocytes protect human skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Further, we assessed the effect of different keratinocyte-conditioned media (KCM+ and KCM-) on melanocytes.

DESIGN
We analysed six lines of melanocytes isolated from lightly pigmented neonatal foreskin (LM), and six lines from darkly pigmented neonatal foreskin (DM), at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours post UV irradiation. We also assessed the effect of different keratinocyte-conditioned media (KCM+ or KCM-)
