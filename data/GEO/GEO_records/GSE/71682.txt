TITLE
Za and Zaa binding profiles in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide positions of Z-DNA are mapped. ChIP was performed against transiently expressing Flag-Za or Flag-Zaa using Flag antibody in HeLa cells. Za and Zaa ChIP DNA and fragmented genomic DNA were used for sequencing library construction. Each library was sequenced on Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq 2500 and sequenced reads were mapped and normalized.

DESIGN
The information of Za and Zaa binding sites in HeLa cells transiently expressing Za or Zaa was generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq 2500.
