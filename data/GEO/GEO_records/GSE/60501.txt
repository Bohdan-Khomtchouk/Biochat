TITLE
Whole genome transcriptome analysis of tumor-specific CD8 T cells in pre-malignant lesions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of tumor-specific CD8 T cells encountering a tumor-specific antigen in pre-malignant lesions in the liver at different time points post tumor initiation. The overall goal of this mouse study was to elucidate the molecular program in tumor-specific T cells encountering a tumor-specific antigen in pre-malignant lesions. The study identifies the genes and pathways that are dysregulated in tumor-specific T cells associated with T cell unresponsiveness in tumors. To identify the genes and pathways that are dysregulated in tumor-specific T cells. Gene signatures of the following sample groups were compared:  1. Naïve CD8 T cells; 2. Effector CD8 T cells; 3. Dysfunctional tumor-specific CD8 T cells isolated from pre-malignant lesions 8-12 days after tumor induction. 4. Dysfunctional tumor-specific CD8 T cells isolated from pre-malignant lesions 32-34 days after tumor initiation.  The mouse tumor model that was used is an autochthonous, tamoxifen-inducible liver cancer model (ASTxCre-ERT2; AST=Albumin-floxStop-SV40 large T antigen; Cre-ERT2 = TAM-dependent Cre-recombinase) in which the SV40 large T antigen serves as the oncogenic driver and tumor-specific antigen; SV40-I TCR transgenic mice, whose CD8 T cells express a Db-restricted TCR specific for the Tag epitope I were used as source of naïve tumor-specific CD8 T cells (TCRSV40-I)

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from flow-sorted transgenic CD8 TCRSV40-I T cells from the following sample groups: Naïve, effector, D8-12-pre-malignant lesions, and D32-34 pre-malignant lesions.
