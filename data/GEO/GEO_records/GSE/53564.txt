TITLE
Effect of As (V) 50µm in  transcription change of six rice genotypes (BRG-12, BRG-15, BRG-20, CN1646-5, NAYANMONI and CN1646-2)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Affymetrix expression analysis was used to check transcipt expression in As (V) stress.

DESIGN
The RNA from root of six rice genotypes (BRG-12, BRG-15, BRG-20, CN1646-5, NAYANMONI and CN1646-2) was isolated after 24 hrtreatment of As (V) 0µm and 50µm .The rice gene chip was used for expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
