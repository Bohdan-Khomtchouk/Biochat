TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and Dazap1 mutant mouse testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deleted in Azoospermia Associated Protein 1 (DAZAP1) is a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in the testis. It is a component of the hnRNP particles and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Mice expressing the DAZAP1-Fn mutant protein manifest both growth retardation and spermatogenic arrest before meiosis I. To elucidate the biological function(s) of DAZAP1 and to search for its natural RNA substrates, we compared the expression profiles of wild-type and Dazap1 mutant testes by cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
We used wild-type and Dazap1 mutant mouse testes. Each genotype has three replicates. 6 total samples were analyzed.
