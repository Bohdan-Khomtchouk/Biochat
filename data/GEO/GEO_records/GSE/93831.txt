TITLE
mRNA Profiling of miR-17 family inhibition using TuD lentiviral vector in HepG2 and SK-Hep1 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To functionally characterize the role of miR-17 family in HCC, lentiviral vector-based miR inhibitor TuD was used to inhibit miR-17 family of microRNAs in HepG2 and SK-Hep1 HCC cell lines

DESIGN
Methods: HepG2 and SK-Hep1 HCC cell lines were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and miR-17 TuD or NC TuD expressing lines were generated. mRNA profiling of miR-17 TuD or NC TuD expressing samples was performed using Illumina NGS. Total RNA was extracted as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (RNeasy kit, Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using BioAnalyzer (Agilent). mRNA expression profiles were determined using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform producing 50bp paired-end reads. Bowtie/TopHat suites were used to align the reads to mouse genome or transcriptome and RSEM were used to quantify gene abundances. Gene level counts were then normalized with the R/Bioconductor package limma using the voom/variance stabilization method.
