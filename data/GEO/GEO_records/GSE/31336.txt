TITLE
Transcriptional changes during photoperiodic tuber induction in Solanum tuberosum ssp andigena

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum

SUMMARY
For expression profiling analyses of early stages of tuber induction, plants of Solanum tuberosum ssp andigena (7540) were used. This wild subspecies is strictly dependent on photoperiod for tuberisation, such that short days (SD) inductive conditions are required in order to trigger tuber induction in the stolons. Andigena plants were grown in the greenhouse under LD non-inductive conditions until a 10-leaf stage. They were subsequently transferred to inductive SD conditions (8 h light/16 h dark), and sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days after transfer to SDs. Tuber swelling was visible approximately 6-8 days after transfer to inductive conditions. The apical region of the stolons (2 cm) was collected one hour before the beginning of the light period.

DESIGN
All collected stolons (LD; and 2d, 4d, 6d and 8d under SD) were processed as described. Hybridization scheme with a loop design was applied to compare one sample against the rest of the samples in the induction time course.
