TITLE
Gene expression profile in HCAECs transfected with RNF213 siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome analysis of HCAECs upon treatment with siRNF213 or with a control siRNA. Overall, a total of 217 genes were up-regulated ( > 2.0-fold change in expression), while 499 genes were down-regulated ( < 0.5-fold change in expression), in the siRNF213-treated cells when compared to the control. Expression of four genes (RNF213, CyclinA, B and E) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Gene expression in HCAECs upon treatment with siRNF213 or with a control siRNA. Two independent experiments were performed at each condition.
