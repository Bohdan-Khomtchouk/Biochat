TITLE
Expression analysis in pancreatic and liver tissues of diabetic db/db mice in response to dietary supplementation with selenate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in pancreatic and liver tissues of diabetic db/db mice supplemented with selenate, compared to the diabetic db/db mice administered placebo. Fasting blood glucose levels increased continuously in diabetic  db/db mice administered placebo (DMCtrl) but decreased gradually in selenate-supplemented diabetic db/db mice (DMSe) and approached normal values when the experiment ended. The size of pancreatic islets increased, causing the plasma insulin concentration to double in DMSe mice compared with that in DMCtrl mice.

DESIGN
Two six chip studies using total RNA respectively isolated from pancreatic and liver tissues of three selenate-supplemented diabetic db/db mice, and three diabetic db/db mice administered placebo.
