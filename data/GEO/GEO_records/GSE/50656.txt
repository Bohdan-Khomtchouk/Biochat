TITLE
Wild type cells in different times after transfer to no phosphate medium

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type cells were grown in SC medium and then transferred to no phosphate medium

DESIGN
Cells were grown to logarithmic phase in SC medium (OD=0.5), washed and transferred to no phosphate medium (OD = 0.05). During the experiment (t=0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 25 hours) cells were harvested, pelleted and frozen for further analysis. Cell were also grown in a chemostat in a  dilution rate of 0.3[1/hr] and phosphate concentration in the feeding vessel of 0.3mM, allowed to reach steady state and then harvested, Total RNA was extracted using MasterPureâ„¢ Kit (Epicentre). The samples were amplified, labeled, hybridized to yeast dual color expression microarrays and scanned, all using standard Agilent protocols, reagents, and instruments. The scanned images were analyzed using SpotReader software (Niles Scientific).
