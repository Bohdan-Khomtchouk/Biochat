TITLE
Elevated acid ceramidase promotes acute myeloid leukemia blast survival through sphingolipid dysregulation and Mcl-1 upregulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of patient samples with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were compared to normal controls to study dysregulated signalling pathways. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from primary AML patient samples were isolated using the Ficoll-Paque gradient separation method. RNA from CD34+ bone marrow cells of healthy donors were purchased from AllCells LLC (Alameda, CA; catalog number RNA-BM003C). Total RNA were harvested from patient samples using Trizol and subjected to microarray-based gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from patient PBMCs and healthy donor CD34+ bone marrow cells.
