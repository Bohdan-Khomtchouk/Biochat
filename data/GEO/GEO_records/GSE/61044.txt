TITLE
Methylation analysis of choroid plexus tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The methylation status of a cohort of choroid plexus tumors was examined and unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to identify molecular distinct clusters of samples.

DESIGN
Tumor DNA was extracted from 36 frozen choroid plexus tumors (15 CPCs, 16 choroid plexus papillomas, 5 achoroid plexus papillomas). Samples were bisulfite converted and analyzed on Illumina 450K Infinium methylation bead arrays. No replicates were used
