TITLE
Chromosome wide analysis of parental allele specific chromatin and DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed according to parental inheritance. The maternally and paternally expressed alleles are distinguished epigenetically by DNA methylation and histone modifications. RNA was extracted from MatDup.dist7 and PatDup.dist7 MEFs for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays

DESIGN
Comparsion of gene expression in MatDup.dist7 and PatDup.dist7 MEFs
