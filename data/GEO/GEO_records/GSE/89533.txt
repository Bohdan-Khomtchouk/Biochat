TITLE
Expression data of human clear cell renal cell carcinoma

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human tumor cell lines are important tools in tumor biological studies, here the authors report the establishment and characterization of 7 new ccRCC stable cell lines with complete clinical data. Gene expression and methylation were profiled with microarrays between the new cells and those had a finite in vitro life span, and the results prompt that genes such as SLC34A2 and VHL play key roles in the continuous in vitro growth and development of ccRCC. In order to find out what genetic features are related to the successful establishment of stable cell lines, early stage cells of 5 stable cell lines (UT14(P2), UT16(P2), UT33a(P3), UT48(P2), UT56(P1) ), named as P group and 5 finite cell lines (UT13a(P3), UT27(P3), UT37(P2), UT41(P2), UT54(P3) ) which could not be cultured more than 10 generations named as N group were chosen to do gene expression chip. Features such as age, gender, tumor size and Fuhrman nuclear grading were matched in these two groups.

DESIGN
Early stage cells of 5 stable cell lines ( > 20 generations in vitro)(UT14(P2), UT16(P2), UT33a(P3), UT48(P2), UT56(P1) ), named as P group and 5 finite cell lines (UT13a(P3), UT27(P3), UT37(P2), UT41(P2), UT54(P3) ) which could not be cultured more than 10 generations named as N group were chosen to do gene expression chip. Features such as age, gender, tumor size and Fuhrman nuclear grading were matched in these two groups
