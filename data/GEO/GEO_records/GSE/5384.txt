TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 60-mer selection

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Several custom made Agilent arrays were hybridized to select the best 60-mers for the transcriptional profiling of C. acetobutylicum strains. Keywords: Test of 60-mer performance

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from both C. acetobutylicum ATCC and M5 strains at several points during the exponential phase of growth and the samples for each strain were mixed. For the ATCC824 strain the samples were taken at OD (600 nm) = {1.09, 1.8, 2.6, 2.0} whereas for the the M5 strain samples were taken at OD (600 nm) = {0.868, 1.36, 2.40, 3.20,  4.20}. The total amount of labeled material hybridized was 0.75 micrograms.
