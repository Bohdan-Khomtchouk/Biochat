TITLE
Expression data from 59 human colon tumor tissue samples

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was conducted on RNA from 59 human colon tumor tissue samples to identify genes whose expression level correlates VEGFR-2 Keywords: Identfication of genes coexpressed with a specific drug target

DESIGN
Baseline gene expression profiling was performed using 59 human colon tumor tissue samples to identify genomic signatures highly correlated with VEGFR-2 gene
