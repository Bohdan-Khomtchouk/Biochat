TITLE
Novel linkages between DCE-MRI and genomic profiling in locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression signatures have the capacity to identify clinically significant features of breast cancer and can predict which individual patients are likely to be resistant to neoadjuvant therapy, thus providing the opportunity to guide treatment decisions. Data used in publication: Clin Cancer Res. 2006;12:819–826. 89. Dressman et.al., Gene Expression Profiles of Multiple Breast Cancer Phenotypes and Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combining DCE-MRI imaging and genomics have identified putative genomic biomarkers that are associated with risk for pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Furthermore, IBC gene expression profiles were associated with long term overall survival.  The genomic profiles identified in this pilot study are preliminary but novel, and thus of great interest to validate as biomarkers in independent datasets. 

DESIGN
37 breast tissue samples were collected under ultrasound guidance from patients with stage IIB/III breast cancer before four cycles of neoadjuvant liposomal doxorubicinpaclitaxel chemotherapy combined with local whole breast hyperthermia. Gene expression analysis was done using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays.
