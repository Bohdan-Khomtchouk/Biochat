TITLE
Wild type 3 hours exposure to 1 microM OGT2468

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of O-glycosylation inhibitor OGT2468 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using strains SEY6210 (wild type). Yeast cells exposed to OGT2468 in YPD growth medium show a significant inhibition of mating, filamentation and induction of cell wall compensatory mechanism.
