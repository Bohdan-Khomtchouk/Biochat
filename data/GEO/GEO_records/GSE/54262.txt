TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Bmi1 silenced-K562 CML cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Bmi1 Polycomb protein is involved in the epigenetic repressive control of self renewal and survival of cancer initiating cells. In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), bmi1 expression increases gradually as the disease progresses from a chronic latent phase to a deadly blast crisis. We developped an inducible shRNA system to silence Bmi1 in the human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line in order to identify new Bmi1-target genes.

DESIGN
Gene profiling was performed on inducible shBmi1-K562 cells incubated without (P3-K562+shBMI1) or with doxycycline for 96h (P4-K562+shBMI1+doxycycline) using HG-U133 Plus2 Affymetrix Arrays.
