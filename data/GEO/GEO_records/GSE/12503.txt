TITLE
The protein disulfide isomerase AGR2 is essential for the production of intestinal mucus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) aid protein folding and assembly by catalyzing formation and shuffling of cysteine disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many members of the PDI family are expressed in mammals but the roles of specific PDIs in vivo are poorly understood. A recent homology-based search for additional PDI family members identified anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2), a protein originally presumed to be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells, but the function of AGR2 has been obscure. Here we show that AGR2 is expressed in the ER of secretory cells and is essential for in vivo production of intestinal mucin, a large cysteine-rich glycoprotein that forms the protective mucus gel lining the intestine. A cysteine residue within the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain forms mixed disulfide bonds with MUC2, consistent with a direct role for AGR2 in mucin processing. Despite a complete absence of intestinal mucin, mice lacking AGR2 appeared healthy but were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced experimental colitis, indicating a critical role for AGR2 in protection from environmental insults. We conclude that AGR2 is a unique member of the PDI family that has a specialized and non-redundant role in intestinal mucus production. Keywords: small intestine and colon gene expression profiles for Agr2-/- and littermate control mice

DESIGN
DNA miocroarrays were used to analyze small intenstine and colon mRNA expression of AGR2 KO and littermate control mice. The experiment incorporated a 1 color design and used Agilent arrays that contained roughly 44,00 60mer probes that provide complete coverage of the mouse genome. 12 arrays were hybridized and represent 8 small intestine samples ( 4 each KO and WT) and 4 colon samples (2 each KO and WT)

PLATFORM
GPL7173 Agilent Mouse 4X44K plus 2500 MEEBO
