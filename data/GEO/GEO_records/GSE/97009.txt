TITLE
Widespread activation of antisense transcription of the host genome during Herpes simplex virus 1 infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) induces the expression of about 1000 antisense transcripts from the human host cell genome.

DESIGN
Human WI-38 and HeLa cells were infected with Herpes simplex virus 1, and antisense transcripts on the host cell genome defined using a custom algorithm.
