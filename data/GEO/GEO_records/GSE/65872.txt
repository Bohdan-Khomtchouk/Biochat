TITLE
Expression data from CUTLL1 cells infected with shHES1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To formally address the biological activity of HES1 in vitro, we measured the transcriptional effect of HES1 inactivation infectiing CUTLL1 leukemia cell lines with shHES1 HES1 knockdown triggered apoptosis in human T-ALL lymphoblasts. We show that HES1 inactivation induces programmed cell death in leukemia lymphoblasts

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression analysis of shHES1 vs shRNA LUC
