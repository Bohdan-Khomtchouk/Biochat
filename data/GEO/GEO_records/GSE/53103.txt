TITLE
Expression data from knockdown and Sendai virus induction experiments in Human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have carried out transcriptional profile analysis in macroH2A knockdown cells (Namalwa B cells and HeLa cells) and demonstrated that this histone variant plays positive and negative roles in transcription. We also demonstrated the  role of macroH2A in regulating the response to Sendai Virus infection.

DESIGN
three biological replicates on Affymetrix HG133plus2.0 chips.
