TITLE
Genetic analysis of the genome wide role of G-proteins in rice metabolism

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The current study reports a genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the only known Gα mutants in rice (RGA1).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of 25 day old rice d1 (Gα) mutant (HO-541) and its corresponding wild type (Nipponbare) grown on B-5 agar media.Total RNAs from the rice Gα mutant and wild type were first converted into cDNAs, from which labeled cRNAs were generated with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and hybridized with 44K 60-mer whole genome rice microarrays on glass slides.The slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent scanner (G2565B) at 100 % laser power and data extracted with Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 9.1). The experiment was repeated with a biological-cum-technical replicate, where total RNA samples from a fresh batch of rice (mutant and WT) plants were labeled with opposite dyes (dye-swap) and used for microarray analysis.
