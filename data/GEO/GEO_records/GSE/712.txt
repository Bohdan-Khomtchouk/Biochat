TITLE
CVB3-infected HeLa cells (multiple time points)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were serum starved and preincubated with DMSO (vehicle) and infected with CVB3.  Following infection, virus was removed and fresh media containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added for the remainder of the infectious process.  At 0, 30 minutes, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 hours following CVB3 infection, RNA was isolated, processed and hybridized to GeneChipÂ®s. Keywords: time-course
