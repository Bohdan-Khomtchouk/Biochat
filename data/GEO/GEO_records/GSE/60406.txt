TITLE
Gene expression profiling of pancreatic stem cell derived islet like clusters vs native islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have earlier reported the presence of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) - like cells in adult mouse pancreas and their ability to differentiate into islet-like clusters (ILCs). To determine the global relationship of these cells to native islets  Agilent 8X60K microarray profiling was done.More than 9000 probes were differentially regulated (≥ 1.5-fold, P ≤ 0.05) in the ILCs when compared to primary mouse islets. The mature pancreatic markers were significantly downregulated whereas markers associated with replication and cell cycle entry, inflammation, fatty acid metabolism and so on were predicted to be increased. . As a whole the ILCs though immature offer certain compensations including the infinite number of initiator MSCs which can be expanded and cryopreserved and also the amenity to genetic modifications to create robust mature cells resistant to immune attack in a transplantation perspective
