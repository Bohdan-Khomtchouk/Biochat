TITLE
Gene expression in pif3 mutant under dark and in wt under Red 1h and Red 18h

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PIF3 plays a role as repressor of photomorphogenesis in darkness. To identify PIF3-regulated genes that might be implementing this action, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis in the pif3 mutant.

DESIGN
Seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on GM medium without sucrose, stratified at 4ºC in the dark for 4 days, exposed to white light for 3 hours to induce germination, and placed in a growth chamber at 21ºC in darkness for 4 days (D0h) and 4 days and 1 hour (D1h). For Rc treatments seedlings were moved to Rc growth chambers at 21ºC  for 1 (R1h) and 18 (R18h) hours.
