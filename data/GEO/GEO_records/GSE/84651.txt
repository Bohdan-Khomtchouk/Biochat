TITLE
Schistosoma-pulmonary hypertension sorted macrophage gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alveolar and tissue macrophages were sorted from Schistosoma-exposed and unexposed mice.

DESIGN
The mice were C57Bl6/J background. Schistosoma mansoni exposure was intraperitoneal sensitization and intravenous challenge with purified eggs (see Kumar et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2015;192(8):998-1008. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201410-1820OC. PMID: 26192556). Samples were pooled from N=5 animals per group. Cell sorting was performed on day 3 after IV challenge. Alveolar macrophages were identified as CD45+F4/80+CD11c+SiglecF+. Tissue macrophages were identified as CD45+F4/80+CD11b+SSClow. The RNA library was prepared using a Kappa Stranded mRNA-Seq kit. RNA sequencing was performed on an Ion Proton platform. Expression analysis was performed using Tophat-Bowtie-Cufflinks with Galaxy online.
