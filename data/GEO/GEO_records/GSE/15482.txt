TITLE
The effect of PPARa siRNA on endothelial cells treated with fenofibrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fenofibrate is a synthetic ligand for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, but there are reports that fenofibrate affects endothelial cells in PPARa-independent manner. In order to identify PPARa-dependently and PPARa-independently regulated transcripts we generated microarray data from human endothelial cells treated with fenofibrate with and without siRNA-mediated knock-down of PPARa.

DESIGN
In this study, we generated microarray data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with fenofibrate with pretreatment PPARa or control siRNA. There are four time points (4, 8, 12 and 18hours) (n=1 at each time point).
