TITLE
Changes in gene expression in response to heme deficiency and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We addressed changes in gene expression profile in response to reduced oxygen tension in wild type or heme depletion caused by deletion of heme biosynthesis gene hem1 Keywords: Response to heme depletion and hypoxia

DESIGN
I.Heme depletion.The hem1 delta strain was grown for 6 hrs in YPD media supplemented with 250 uM ALA. Cells were washed three times with water to remove excess ALA. Cells were then inoculated in duplicates into 15 ml cultures of YPD media that was supplemented either with or without ALA. Cultures were induced for 16 h before 5 ml of cells were harvested and washed three times in DEPC water. The culture density at the time of harvest was approximately OD600=0.5. II.Hypoxia. BY45742 strain was grown for 6 hrs in YPD medium and then inoculated in 15 ml the same medium and grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 12 hrs. To create hypoxic conditions, cultures were incubated in an anaerobic chamber using a BBL-GasPak (BD Biosciences).
