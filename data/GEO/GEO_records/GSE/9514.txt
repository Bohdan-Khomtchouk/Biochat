TITLE
Changes in gene expression in response to heme deficiency and hypoxia

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We addressed changes in gene expression profile in response to reduced oxygen tension in wild type or heme depletion caused by deletion of heme biosynthesis gene hem1 Keywords: Response to heme depletion and hypoxia
