TITLE
Modulation of the immune response of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) after infection with viral haemorragic septicaemia virus

ORGANISM
Scophthalmus maximus

SUMMARY
Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a valuable resource for aquaculture in Galicia (NW Spain). Since it has been observed that viral hemorraghic septicaemia can affect turbot, among other finfish, increase of knowledge in molecular factors affected by the exposure to pathogen could help to develop strategies of VHSV prevention and treatment. In this study, it has been used a custom oligo-microarray by Agilent to identify genes differentially expressed in several turbot families showing different susceptibility to VHSV. Fishes from each family (n=30) were injected with either VHSV (Resistant) or control medium (Naive) and monitored for 30 days, when each group was splitted in two new groups and rechallenged with VHSV (Infected) or control medium (Control). Gene expression at the head kidney was evaluated, showing than an important proportion of the variation of the gene expression profiles is explained by the genetic background (family). After infection, fish showed an up-regulation of the interferon-induced Mx2 gene, the IL-8 gene and the VHSV-induced protein 5 gene compared with control groups. Familes with high mortality after VHSV infection showed lower levels of expression of molecules secreted in the mucus and, by contrast, higher expression of genes involved in viral entrance into target cells.

DESIGN
4 different families of turbot were subjected to challenged with VHSV and splitted after 30 days in 2
