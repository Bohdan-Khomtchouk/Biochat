SUMMARY
Extremely variable clinic and genetic features characterize Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Disorders (MED). Pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects can be divided into large-scale rearrangements and single point mutations. Clinical manifestations become evident when a threshold percentage of the total mtDNA is mutated. In some MED, the " mutant load " in an affected tissue is directly related to the severity of the phenotype. However, the clinical phenotype is not simply a direct consequence of the relative abundance of mutated mtDNA. Other factors, such as nuclear background, can contribute to the disease process, resulting in a wide range of phenotypes caused by the same mutation. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide cDNA microarrays (HG-U133A), we studied the gene expression profile of muscle tissue biopsies obtained from 12 MED patients (4 common 4977-bp deleted mtDNA and 8 A3243G: 4 PEO and 4 MELAS phenotypes) compared with age-matched healthy individuals.
