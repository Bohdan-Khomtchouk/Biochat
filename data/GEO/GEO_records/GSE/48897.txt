TITLE
Gene expression signatures in Tif1b, Hp1a or Hp1g knockdown hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of Tif1b, Hp1a or Hp1g knockdown hematopoietic progenitors. Growth of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are significantly impaired upon knockdown of Hp1a and Hp1g. Results provide insight into the role of these factors in hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
HSCs (CD34- c-Kit+ Sca1+  Lineage- )  were transduced with lentivirus expressing shRNA against Tif1b, Hp1a or Hp1g, and cultured for 14 days. Then, GFP+ c-Kit+ Lineage- hematopoietic progenitors were sorted and subjected into microarray analysis
