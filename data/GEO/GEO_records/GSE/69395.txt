TITLE
Gene expression profiling of lung cancer cells following treatment with dasatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mechanisms of resistance and sensitivity to the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib are unknown. We previously found that lung cancer cells with kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations are sensitive to dasatinib and undergo senescence whereas cells with wild type BRAF are resistant. To better understand mechanisms underlaying the differential sensitivity of lung cancer cells to dasatinib, we performed gene expression profiling of lung cancer cells with (sensitive) and without (resistant) kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations

DESIGN
A549 and H661 dasatinib-resistant lung cancer cells and H1666 and Cal12 dasatinib-sensitive cells were treated with vehicle (control) or 150 nM dasatinib for 72 h (8 samples). Total RNA was isolated and whole transcriptomes were profiled using the Human Gene U133A plus 2.0 platform from Affymetrix.
