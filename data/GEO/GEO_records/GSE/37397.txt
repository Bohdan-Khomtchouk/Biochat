TITLE
Global Transcriptional Analysis of Nuclear Reprogramming in the Transition from MEFs to iPSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we focused on the intermediate stages of SCR by comparing the somatic cell line induced by OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK) for 7 days with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), iPSCs, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Transcriptional profiles of these four cell lines were analyzed by microarray, and we found that the transition process from day 7 to the formation of iPSCs is crucial for SCR and that the reverse expression patterns can provide more candidate markers to distinguish ESCs and somatic cells iPSC. Data confirmed that the viral infection results in defense innate immunity, DNA damage, and apoptosis in MEFs, which slows down cell proliferation and immortalization to inhibit SCR. Although SCR is initiated by OSK, the p53 signaling pathway can affect the transcriptional regulatory networks through cell cycle and genomic instability as a powerful core node.

DESIGN
MEFs were derived from embryonic day 13.5 C57BL6 mice embryos. Cell line day7 is MEF induced by OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK) for 7 days with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), iPSCs, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
