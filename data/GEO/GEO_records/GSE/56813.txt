TITLE
Genome wide TFIIB binding during postnatal and pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify the differential TFIIB bindingl patterns during postnatal cardiac growth, pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy and adult mouse hearts Methods: Hearts were extracted from 1-2day old C57 mice, from mice subjecetd to Transaortic coarctation or adult mice. The hearts were sent to Active Motif for TFIIB- ChIP-Seq. Results: In accordance with previosly published data (Sayed D, et. al. JBC, 2013 Jan 25;288(4):2546-58) with genome wide polII and H3K9ac status during cardiac hypertrophy (GSE50637), Denovo TFIIB recruitment was restricted to speclaized genes with cardiac hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Hearts were extracted from 1-2day old C57 mice, from mice subjecetd to Transaortic coarctation or adult mice. The hearts were sent to Active Motif for TFIIB- ChIP-Seq.
