TITLE
Placental changes caused by food restriction during early pregnancy in mice are reversible

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a previous study, 50% calorie restriction in mice from days 1.5-11.5 of pregnancy resulted in reduced placental weights and areas, relatively sparing of labyrinth zone area compared to junctional zone area, and dramatic changes in global gene expression profiles. Here we examined placental gene expression at day 18.5, after the return to normal feeding to see whether differences were reversible

DESIGN
Mice were randomized to 2 treatment groups on day 1.5 of pregnancy: (1) ad libitum fed (control) (2) 50% food restriction (restricted). Mice were returned to ad libitum feed on d11.5, sacrificed on d18.5 and placentas were collected.
