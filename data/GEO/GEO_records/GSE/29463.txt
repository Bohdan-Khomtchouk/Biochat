TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor W03F9.2::GFP Binding Regions in YA

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3217 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: OP215(official name : OP215 genotype : unc119(ed3);wgIs215(W03F9.2::TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119) outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.  The resulting plasmid was used for bombardment transformation of an unc-119(ed3) strain.  The W03F9.2::EGFP fusion protein is mainly expressed in germline cells.  This strain was used for ChIP-seq experiments to map the in vivo binding sites for the W03F9.2 transcription factor. made_by : Tony Hyman's lab from MPI-CBG ); Developmental Stage: L4-Young Adult; Genotype: unc119(ed3);wgIs215(W03F9.2::TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119); Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage L4-Young Adult; Target gene W03F9.2; Strain OP215(official name : OP215 genotype : unc119(ed3);wgIs215(W03F9.2::TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119) outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.
