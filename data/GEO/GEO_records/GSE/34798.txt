TITLE
Early transcriptional programming links progression to hepatitis C virus-induced severe liver disease in transplant patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study determined key transcriptional signatures associated with HCV recurrence and eventual development of severe liver disease in infected transplant patient liver biopsies over time following transplant. We identified molecular signatures associated with severe fibrosis and liver injury prior to histologic evidence of disease progression.

DESIGN
111 liver biopsy specimens collected longitudinally from 57 HCV-infected liver transplant patients following organ transplant. Several batches of pooled normal liver RNA samples (Utah normal pool; UNP) are included.
