TITLE
Expression profile of WT and IKKb(EE)IEC epithelial cells (IEC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate NF-kB-driven gene expression in IEC, we performed microarray analysis from enterocytes of mice that express a constitutively active form of IKKb in intestinal epithelial cells

DESIGN
Total RNA  was prepared from enterocytes obtained from small intestines of IKKb(EE)IEC and WT littermates. Two biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition.
