TITLE
Transcriptional response in normal tissues in mice after 211At administration - dependency of absorbed dose, dose-rate and time

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA microarray analysis of low-dose and dose rate responses versus time after i.v. administration of 211At. Female BALB/c nude mice were intravenously injected with 1.7 kBq 211At and killed after 1 h, 6 h, or 7 d, or injected with 105 or 7.5 kBq and killed after 1 h and 6 h, respectively. Controls were mock-treated. Kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen were excised, flash-frozen, and stored at -80Â°C. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to expression analysis using RNA microarray technology. Enriched biological processes were categorized after cellular function based on Gene Ontology terms.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen tissue samples. Three mice per group were used for 1.7 kBq 211At injections and controls; two mice per group for 105 and 7.5 kBq injections.
