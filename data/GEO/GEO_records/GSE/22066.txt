TITLE
Scylla paramamosain mature gonads: Ovary vs. Testis

ORGANISM
Scylla paramamosain

SUMMARY
In order to identify unexpected, or indeed previously uncharacterized genes may be important in sex- or gonad development, we developed a custom cDNA microarray represent 3837 unique transcripts of Scylla paramamosain derived from our EST project. Thirty-nine putative transcripts were observed to differentially expressed in testis and ovaries (P < 0.05).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Ovary vs. Testis. Biological replicates: 3 Ovaries, 3 Testis, 2 dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL10471 Mud crab 6K cDNA array version 1.0
