TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of novel splice variants induced by topoisomerase I poisoning shows preferential occurrence in genes encoding splicing factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Topoisomerase I (Top1) relaxes both positive and negative supercoilings by producing transient Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc). Several studies have suggested the implication of Top1 in splicing. Here, we tested the implication of Top1cc in splicing at the global genome level in human carcinoma cells to determine whether Top1 inhibition selectively affects particular families of genes.

DESIGN
We tested the impact of Top1 inhibition on splicing at the genome-wide level in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. The RNA of HCT116 cells treated with camptothecin (CPT) for various times was analyzed with ExonHit Human Splice Array.
