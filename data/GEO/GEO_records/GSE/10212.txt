TITLE
Identification of genes responsive to ultrasound in human leukemia U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, the effects of non-thermal low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the gene expression in human lymphoma U937 cells were investigated using by an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Six hours after LIPUS treatment (0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min), apoptosis (14±3.8%, mean±SD) with minimal cell lysis was observed. At 3 h post-treatment, LIPUS down-regulated 193 genes and up-regulated 201 genes by > 1.5-fold. Keywords: ultrasound, gene expression, Human lymphoma U937 cell

DESIGN
U937 cells, a human lymphoma cell line, were treated with low intensity pulsed ultrasound (0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min) and followed by incubation for 3 h at 37°C. Non-treated cells were served as control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with Human Expression Array U133A which was spotted with 22,283 probe sets. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacture’s instructions.
