TITLE
Stochastic Principles Governing Alternative Splicing of RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to analyze the principles governing the usage of alternatively spliced transcript isoform of four types of T-cells (Na√Øve, Central Memory, Transitional Memory and Effector Memory) between resting and activated status. However, the principles discovered in the T cells were universal and can also be applied to other cell type and tissues.

DESIGN
Four types of T cells were sorted and whole transcriptome analysis was performed using an Illumina machine The readme.txt contains the column headers and description for the processed data files.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
