TITLE
The forced expression of Nanog or Esrrb allows preserve ESC status in the absence of nucleostemin expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nucleostemin (NS) gene is known to be expressed in stem cells in general including embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Previous knockdown and knockout studies have demonstrated that NS is important for the preservation of their self-renewality and high levels of pluripotent marker gene expression in mouse ESCs. In this study, we demonstrate that the forced expression of Nanog or Esrrb, but not other pluripotency factors, made NS expression dispensable in mouse ESCs. DNA microarray data deposited here underscored the notion that both Nanog and Esrrb could rather faithfully counteract the alteration of gene expression profile caused by NS expression ablation in ESCs.

DESIGN
NS tet off ESCs (Stem Cells 27, 1066-1076, 2009) in which NS gene was homozygously disrupted, but NS cDNA was introduced in ROSA26 gene locus together with tetracycline-off system were used as parental ESCs to examine the effect of NS expression ablation in ESCs. In this study, how alteration of gene expression profile change associated with NS expression ablation was modulated by the forced expression of either constitutively active Stat3 (Stat3mut), Nanog or Esrrb. Effect obtained by the exposure to 2i condition (medium containing 2 kinase inhibitors against MEK and GSK3b) was also examined
