TITLE
Genome-wide Gene Expression Profiling of Salinity Responsiveness in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Abiotic stresses such as salinity are very important factors limiting rice growth and productivity around the world. Affymetrix rice genome array containing 48,564 japonica and 1,260 indica sequences was used to analyze the gene expression pattern of rice responsive to salinity stress, try to elucidate the difference of genome-wide gene expression profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes in response to salt stress and to discover the salinity related genes and gene interaction and networks. Under salinity condition, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 177-103 was more than that in IR64, and most of up-regulated DEGs in 177-103 are response to stress. But in IR64, most of up-regulated DEGs are transcription related genes. The DEGs under salinity showed very strong tissue specificity, the number of DEGs in leaf was more than that in root. A lot of genes differentially expressed by exogenous ABA treatment under salinity condition, such as Leaf senescence protein, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase 2 precursor and Protein of unknown function DUF26 were induced by ABA and contributed to salinity tolerance.

DESIGN
In this study, the gene expression patterns across two organs including leaves and roots at seedling stage were characterized under control, salinity, salinity+ABA treatments by using the Affymetrix rice microarray platform based on a salinity tolerant rice line derived from IR64.
