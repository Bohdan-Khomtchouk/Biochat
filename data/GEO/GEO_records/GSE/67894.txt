TITLE
Tissue-Specific Transcriptomics and Proteomics of a Filarial Nematode and its Wolbachia Endosymbiont

ORGANISM
Dirofilaria immitis

SUMMARY
We sequenced total RNA from Dirofilaria immitis in order to generate the first tissue-specific gene expression profile of a filarial nematode and its Wolbachia endosymbiont.

DESIGN
Examination of transcript levels in 7 different Dirofilaria immitis tissues, in duplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL20032 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Dirofilaria immitis)
