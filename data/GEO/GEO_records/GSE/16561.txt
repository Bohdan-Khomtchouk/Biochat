TITLE
Gene expression analysis of peripheral whole blood RNA following ischemic stroke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project was to elucidate gene expression in the peripheral whole blood of acute ischemic stroke patients to identify a panel of genes for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. Peripheral blood samples were collected in Paxgene Blood RNA tubes from stroke patients who were > 18 years of age with MRI diagnosed ischemic stroke and controls who were non-stroke neurologically healthy.  The results suggest a panel of genes can be used to diagnose ischemic stroke, and provide information about the biological pathways involved in the response to acute ischemic stroke in humans.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from whole blood in n=39 ischemic stroke patients compared to n=24 healthy control subjects.
