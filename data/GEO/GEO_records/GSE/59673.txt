TITLE
Gene expression analysis of ectopic cyclin D1-expressing myeloma cells compared to their non expressing counterparts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles of myeloma cells belonging to the group of bas prognosis RPMI 8226 and LP1 expressing either the GFP protein or a cyclin D1-GFP fusion protein

DESIGN
Two cell lines RPMI 8226 and LP1. Two clones from each cell line GFP and cyclin D1-GFP. Four biological replicates independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
