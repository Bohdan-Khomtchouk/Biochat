TITLE
Construction of gene expression profiles for anoxia-reoxygenation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand how plants respond to anoxia-reoxygenation, we have employed a global microarray expression profiling as a basic platform to characterize genes with the potential to mediate the recovery responses in Arabidopsis. 7-day-old seedlings were trated with 4hr and 8hr anoxia, and then reoxygenated in air for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 hrs. Genes changed in both condition were designated as reoxygenation-regulated genes. They included the genes in ROS detoxification, dehydration, metabolic process, and many other responses. Interestingly, ethylene was also involved in this recovery process. We further adopted ein2-5 and ein3eil1 microarray to investigate ethylene signaling. Our results showed ethylene partially regulate reoxygenation regulated genes and is reruired for plant survival in reoxygenation.

DESIGN
Genes expression during anoxia-reoxygenation in Arabidopsis seedlings was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 hours after anoxia treatment, and normal condition before anoxia. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (Nor, 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6) under 4hr anoxia-reoxygenation condition by using Col-0, ein2-5, and ein3eil1. Four independent experiments were performed at each time (Nor, 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6) under 8hr anoxia-reoxygenation condition by using Col-0.
