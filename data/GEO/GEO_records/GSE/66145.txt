SUMMARY
The most recurrently mutated oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is NOTCH1. The core Notch complex consists of an ICN protein, a Maml cofactor, and the DNA binding factor Rbpj. The known direct cofactors of Notch appear to act nonselectively, homogeneously driving Notch gene expression functions. It is unclear whether there are direct cofactors of Notch that act selectively and heterogeneously regulate ICN. We discovered that Zmiz1, a Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS)-like coactivator, directly bound ICN1.  ChIP-Seq showed that Zmiz1 selectively co-bound only a subset of Notch-regulated enhancers. This led to hypothesize that Zmiz1 regulates only a subset of Notch1 target genes. To investigate this, we performed RNA-Seq on four 8946 cell linesin which L1601P (activated Notch1) or Zmiz1 were expressed alone or in combination. Zmiz1 induced  ~10% of Notch target genes. The Notch target gene that was most strongly induced by Zmiz1 was Myc. Our data suggest that Zmiz1 selectively amplifies a subset of Notch target genes with strong amplification of Myc.
