TITLE
Molecular characterization of the Rpp4 resistance response

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Experimental design:  2 genotypes: PI- (resistant USDA Plant Introduction (PI459025B) line containing SBR Rpp4 resistance gene) & Cultivar Williams that does not have a known SBR resistance gene  2 treatments: Soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) isolate Hawaii 94-1 & mock infection  3 replications  6 time points: 12, 24, 72, 144, 216 and 288 hours after inoculation  TOTAL: 72 Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Soybean Genome Arrays    Mock treatment: 0.01% Tween 20  Hawaii 94-1 treatment: 500,000 spores per ml in 0.01% Tween 20   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Steve Whitham.
