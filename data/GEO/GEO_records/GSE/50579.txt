TITLE
Expression profiling of HCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
61 human HCCs were analyzed for genome-wide gene expression. Samples were collected at two sites in Germany, Heidelberg (HD) and Hannover (N). The Heidelberg Collection include 40 independent HCC: 19 liver resections and 17 explant liver specimen (4 not determined); median age at surgery was 57 years (range, 16-78), and the male/female ratio was 3:1. All diagnoses were confirmed by histological reevaluation, and use of the samples was approved by the local ethics committee.  From 3 patients, two HCC nodules were included that previously showed different aCGH, indicating independent tumor development (tagged by _2). The underlying etiologies were HBV (n=8), HCV (n=9), alcohol (n=14), cryptogenic (n=11), genetic hemochromatosis (n=3), and Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (n=2). The Hannover Collection include 21 HCC (HCC-Grad: G1-G3). Technical replicates were tagged with _B or _C

DESIGN
differential genes expression in HCC liver (n=61) compared to control group (cell lines, n=3; normal liver tissue(NL), n=7). Technical replicates are indicated by _2.
