TITLE
Derivation of pre-X inactivation human embryonic stem cells under physiological oxygen concentrations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of two active X chromosomes (XaXa) is a hallmark of the ground  state of pluripotency specific to murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Human  ESCs invariably exhibit signs of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and are  considered developmentally more advanced than their murine counterparts. We  describe the establishment of the first XaXa hESCs derived under physiological  oxygen concentrations.  Using these cell lines we demonstrate that (1)  differentiation of hESCs induces random XCI in a manner similar to murine  ESCs, (2) exposure to atmospheric oxygen is sufficient to induce irreversible XCI  and dramatic changes throughout the transcriptome, (3) the Xa exhibits heavy  methylation of the XIST promoter region, and (4) XCI is associated with  demethylation and transcriptional activation of XIST along with H3K27-me3  deposition across the Xi. These findings suggest that XaXa cells exist in the ICM  of the human blastocyst and that this state is preserved in vitro through culture  under physiological oxygen.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on human ES cell lines isolated and maintained under different oxygen concentrations
