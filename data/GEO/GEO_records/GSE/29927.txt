TITLE
Diagnostic marker for lung cancer through microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Kate Olson's Lab is interested to expand these analysis to comparisons between human normal lung tissue and human lung tumor tissue. In hopes that this will help in finding a diagnostic marker for lung cancer. Since there will be more variability between these samples, we would like to get preliminary data on ten normal lung tissue and ten lung tumor tissues from the same patient.

DESIGN
We have already analyzed 4 cell lines and we saw gene expression variability related to how metastatic the cell lines were. This has been written and submitted for publication.  We would like to expand these analysis to comparisons between human normal lung tissue and human lung tumor tissue.  We hope that this will help in finding a diagnostic marker for lung cancer. Since there will be more variability between these samples, we would like to get preliminary data on ten normal lung tissue and ten lung tumor tissues from the same patient. The samples were dissected by a pathologist prior to extraction to maximize the amount of normal tissue included in the tumor samples. RNA samples from non tumor and tumor lung cancer patients were received by Core E.  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
