TITLE
Change of gene expression in mouse heart after permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending artery

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to influence the pathogenesis after myocardial infarction.   Male mice (8 weeks old) were anesthetized  and subjected to permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery [Myocardial infarction (MI) model].

DESIGN
Gene expression in wild-type mouse heart was measured at 3 days after the MI-surgery.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
