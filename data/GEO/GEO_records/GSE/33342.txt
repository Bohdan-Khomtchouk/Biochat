TITLE
Innate immune agonist, dsRNA, induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells and enhances the potency of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed at characterizing the effect of the innate immune agonist, dsRNA, on ovarian cancer cell lines and ascites-derived ovarian cancer cells. DsRNA stimulation revealed two sub-populations of ovarian cancer cells, dsRNA sensitive and dsRNA resistant, that could be categorized based upon dsRNA-induced dsRNA receptor expression.

DESIGN
Human ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with pI:pC and compared against untreated cells.
