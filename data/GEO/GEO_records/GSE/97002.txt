TITLE
Hierarchal gene master regulators of papillary (BCPAP) and anaplastic (8505C) thyroid cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has doubled in recent years but the molecular mechanisms responsible for various TC forms are largely unknown. We hypothesize that, in a thyroid tumor, cancer nodules and surrounding benign tissue are governed by different gene master regulators (GMRs). GMRs are defined as coding/non-coding RNAs whose strongly protected (by the homeostatic mechanisms) abundance modulates most functional pathways by coordinating the expression of their composing genes. GMRs are the most legitimate targets for TC gene therapy. However, because of strong expression control, GMRs are not selectable among TC biomarkers whose frequent regulation in large cancer patient populations indicates low protection as for minor players. We determined the GMRs of the standard papillary (BCPAP) and anaplastic (8505C) thyroid cancer cell lines. The hierarchy of the known biomarkers was established based on their gene commanding height (GCH), an original measure combining the expression control and coordination with expression of other genes. We found that the sets of the GMRs are largely different in the two thyroid cancer cell lines, indicatibg that each type of thyroid cancer needs a different gene-targeting therapy.

DESIGN
Two-conditions (A0 = BCPAP cells, B0 = 8505C cells), 4 replicas of each condition
