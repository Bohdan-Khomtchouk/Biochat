Maternal obesity induced mouse embryonic defects derive from Stella insufficiency in oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to obtain genome-wide profiles, base-resolution methylomes of zygotes were generated using the bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) method for small samples. We find that  global loss of DNA methylation during zygotic development in HFD mice. A total of 412 DMRs were identified, of which 294 were hypomethylated (hypo-DMRs; 71.4%) and 118 were hypermethylated (hyper-DMRs; 28.6%) (Fig. 6A and 6B), showing a predominance of hypo-DMRs. Furthermore, we show that hyper-DMRs are significantly depleted from CGI, but enriched in short interspersed elements (SINEs) and non-CGI regions. Strikingly, hypo-DMRs are specifically depleted from SINEs, with a concurrent enrichment in DNA transposons.
