TITLE
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization of Merkel Cell Carcinoma Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array-CGH profiles of Merkel cell carcinoma tumors Keywords: fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded primary tumor, nodal and metastasis merkel cell carcinoma tumor samples

DESIGN
We perfromed array-CGH on 25 Merkel cell carcinoma tumor samples (2 primary/metastasis pairs) looking for recurrent gains/losses among the cohort of tumors. Results from the Analysis of Copy Errors (ACE) may be found in GSE13239_MccACEAnalyzedData.txt. The overall profiles of the primary/metastasis pairs are similar.  These metastases samples, 1m and 3m, were excluded from the ACE analysis.
