TITLE
Identification and Comparative Analyses of Myocardial miRNAs Involved in Fetal Response to Maternal Obesity

ORGANISM
Papio hamadryas

SUMMARY
Maternal obesity programs the offspring to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and obesity. We sequenced and profiled the cardiac miRNAs that were dysregulated in the hearts of baboon fetuses born to a high fat / high fructose diet fed mothers compared to a regular diet fed mothers.

DESIGN
Fetal hearts were collected from baboon fetuses born to obese and lean mothers, total RNA was isolated, and fetal cardiac miRNA were sequenced and profiled
