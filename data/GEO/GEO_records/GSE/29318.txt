TITLE
Expression profile of FAC-sorted murine retinal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were performed using FAC-sorted young photoreceptors to analyze their transcriptome in comparison to remaining retinal cells at same developmental stage and retinal progenitors.

DESIGN
For each replicate, retinae of 6 to 8 postnatal day 0 pNestin-GFP or postnatal day 4 rhoEGFP mice were dissected and FAC-sorted based on GFP expression. RNA of fractions was isolated and subsequently analyzed with microarray experiment.
