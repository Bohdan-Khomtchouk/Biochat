TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed small RNAs of colon cancer stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Re-evaluating our current knowledge on CRC and developing novel therapeutic strategies is still crucial. Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer cells possess characters reminiscent of those of normal stem cells. Unveiling small RNAs responsible for cell stemness and chemoradioresistance should eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of parental CRC cells and cancer spheres expanded under stem cell medium cultivation were generated for identifying key regulators.
