TITLE
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of primary neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) with a DNA chip carrying 2,464 BAC clones to examine genomic aberrations of 236 neuroblastomas (112 sporadic and 124 mass screening-detected). In paralell, gene-expression profiling was also performed by using in-house cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
A UCSF BAC array carrying 2,464 clones, which covers the whole human genome at roughly 1.2-Mb resolution, was used. The 500-ng aliquots of tumors and reference DNAs were labeled by random priming with each Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Hybridization was performed as previously reported [Pinkel D, et al. Nat Genet 1998;20:207-11.]. UCSF Spot and UCSF Sproc programs to analyze values for spotted clones [Jain AN, et al. Genome Res 2002;12:325-32.] were used.
