TITLE
HNF4α transduction and 5'azacytidine treatment of rat liver progenitor cells (rLEC) to promote the hepatic phenotype

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Stem/progenitor cells represent an unlimited cell source for the generation of hepatocytes. As such, it was already shown that the hepatic liver progenitor-like cell line rLEC acquires a hepatocyte-like phenotype upon sequential exposure to hepatic growth factors and cytokines. However, expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α is still missing, hampering their full differentiation. Therefore, we aim at studying the phenotype of rLEC by transducing the cells with HNF4α. In addition, to make the genes more sensitive to transcription and differentiation, the effect of the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor 5' azacytidine (AZA) (20 µM) was also investigated. The global expression profiles of both microRNA and mRNA were studied by means of microarray technology.
