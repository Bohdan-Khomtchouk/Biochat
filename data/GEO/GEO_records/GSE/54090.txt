TITLE
Slu7 is essential for liver differentiation, metabolism and quiescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The equilibrium between cellular differentiation and proliferation is fundamental for tissue homeostasis. This is particularly important for the liver, a highly differentiated organ with systemic metabolic functions still endowed with unparalleled regenerative potential. Hepatocellular de-differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation are at the basis of liver carcinogenesis. We have identified SLU7, a pre-mRNA splicing regulator inhibited in hepatocarcinoma as a pivotal gene for hepatocellular homeostasis. SLU7 knockdown in human liver cells and mouse liver resulted in profound changes in pre-mRNA splicing and gene expression, leading to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, refractoriness to key metabolic hormones, and reversion to a fetal-like gene expression pattern. Hepatocellular proliferation and a switch to a tumor-like glycolytic phenotype were also observed. Mechanistically, SLU7 governed the splicing and/or expression of essential genes for hepatocellular differentiation like SRSF3 and HNF4a, and was identified as a critical factor in cAMP-regulated gene transcription. SLU7 is therefore central for hepatocyte identity and quiescence.

DESIGN
The expression of the splicing factor SLU7 in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 was knocked down with specific siRNAs (siSlu7). An irrelevant siRNA (siGL2) was used as negative control. The RNAto perfrom the array analysis was extracted 48h after transfection.
