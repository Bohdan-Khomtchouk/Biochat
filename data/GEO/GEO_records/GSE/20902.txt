TITLE
Affymetrix Mouse liver gene expression profiling of Cross B6/J x A/J

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Summary Mapping the genetic architecture of RNA transcript abundances has potential for revealing molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits like disease. Gene expression microarrays allow monitoring genetic control on a whole transcriptome level, but validity and reproducibility of microarray data is a subject of ongoing scientific debate. Here we demonstrate how combining genetic and gene expression data provide a basis for biologically relevant assessment of the current state of microarray technology.  We profile liver samples from a murine F2 intercross population using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Tissue profiling in a mouse F2 cross. We analyzed 294 Liver samples.
