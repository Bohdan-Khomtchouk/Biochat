TITLE
Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 actively changes the expression profiles of mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied the global transcription profiling of mouse upon colonization with Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 by using DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Two groups of mice consisting each of two animals were orally inoculated with either 109 CFU of PRL2010 cells (test strain) or water (control). Animals were 3 months old female BALB/c mice. Bacterial colonization was established by five consecutive daily administrations using a micropipette tip placed immediately behind the incisors.
