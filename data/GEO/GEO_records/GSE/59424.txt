TITLE
MMSET regulates transcription factors critical for survival of t(4;14) myeloma myeloma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations. The multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET), identified by its fusion to the IgH locus in t(4;14) MM, is universally overexpressed and has been suggested to play an important role in tumorigenicity in t(4;14) MM. In order to identify downstream functional targets of MMSET, we knocked down MMSET expression with shRNAs in KMS11, a t(4;14) MM cell line, and identified differentially expressed genes by gene expression microarray analysis.

DESIGN
KMS11 cells were treated with shRNAs for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Germany). Gene expression was performed using the GeneChip Human Genome U133A Array (Affymetrix) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Data analysis was performed using GeneSpring software from Agilent Technologies.
