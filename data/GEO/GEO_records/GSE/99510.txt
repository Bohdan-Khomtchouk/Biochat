TITLE
Treatment of human AML cell lines MOLM-14 and THP-1 with MUC1 specific shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MOLM-14 and THP-1 were silenced for MUC1 expression by  lentiviral transduction of MUC1 specific shRNA or scrambled control. RNA was extracted and NanoString array for microRNAs was performed.

DESIGN
Twelve samples from two cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL23528 NanoString nCounter human miRNA expression system
