TITLE
Transcriptional Response to Ciprofloxacin in Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Deng

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We employed a genome-wide microarray approach to obtain a profile of the transcriptional events in ciprofloxacin-treated EPEC shedding light on how ciprofloxacin affects EPEC transcriptional events and growth, aside from resistance mechanisms, and how this bacterium tolerates antibiotic stress.

DESIGN
Sample of each culture immediately after the addition of ciprofloxacin  (t0), 45 min (t45), 90 min (t90), 135 min (t135), and 180 min (t180), ciprofloxacin induced gene expression in EPEC Deng strain were measure by microarray statistical analysis
