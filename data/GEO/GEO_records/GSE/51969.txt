TITLE
Gene expression profiles of acetaminophen, isoniazid, and paraquat treated C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxicogenomics (tgx) is used as a tool to identify mechanisms and markers of necrosis in C57BL/6 mice treated by oral gavage using acetaminophen (APAP), isoniazid (INZ), and paraquat (PQ). Critical doses for tgx analysis were derived from a 25 day dose range finding study.  For tgx analysis, livers of mice were collected 1 and 2 days after a single compound dose of 168.75, 225, and 300 mg/kg bw for APAP; 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg bw for PQ; and 22, 44, and 88 mg/kg bw for INZ.  All samples were diluted in water.

DESIGN
For the toxicogenomics study, samples were as followed: five mice per low, medium, and high dose group at 1 day, and five mice in the high dose group at 2 days. One set of vehicle controls (n=5) per day was used. The total number of samples was 70.
