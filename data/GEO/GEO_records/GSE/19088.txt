TITLE
Prevotella ruminicola 23: Growth on different carbohydrate sources

ORGANISM
Prevotella ruminicola

SUMMARY
The transcriptional responses of Prevotella ruminicola were determined during growth on 20 different carbohydrate sources including mono-, di- and tri- saccharides, oligosaccharides, polymeric xylan and complete plant material with the aim of obtaining a more complete understanding of the number of genes and metabolic networks associated with carbohydrate catabolism by this organism

DESIGN
All microarray hybridizations and subsequent scanning was undertaken using a two colour system (Cy3 and Cy5): 34 samples

PLATFORM
GPL9696 Prevotella ruminicola whole genome array
