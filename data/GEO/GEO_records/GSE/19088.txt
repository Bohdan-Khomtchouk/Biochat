ORGANISM
Prevotella ruminicola 23

SUMMARY
The transcriptional responses of Prevotella ruminicola were determined during growth on 20 different carbohydrate sources including mono-, di- and tri- saccharides, oligosaccharides, polymeric xylan and complete plant material with the aim of obtaining a more complete understanding of the number of genes and metabolic networks associated with carbohydrate catabolism by this organism
