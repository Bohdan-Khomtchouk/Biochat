TITLE
Gene expression profiles of AML derived stem cells: similarity to hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumors contain a fraction of cancer stem cells that maintain the  propagation of the disease. The CD34‏CD38_ cells, isolated  from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), were shown to be enriched  leukemic stem cells (LSC). We isolated the CD34‏CD38_ cell  fraction from AML and compared their gene expression profiles  to the CD34‏CD38‏ cell fraction, using microarrays. We  found 409 genes that were at least twofold over- or underexpressed  between the two cell populations. These include  underexpression of DNA repair, signal transduction and cell  cycle genes, consistent with the relative quiescence of stem  cells, and chromosomal aberrations and mutations of leukemic  cells. Comparison of the LSC expression data to that of normal  hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) revealed that 34% of the  modulated genes are shared by both LSC and HSC, supporting  the suggestion that the LSC originated within the HSC progenitors.  We focused on the Notch pathway since Jagged-2, a  Notch ligand was found to be overexpressed in the LSC  samples. We show that DAPT, an inhibitor of gamma-secretase,  a protease that is involved in Jagged and Notch signaling,  inhibits LSC growth in colony formation assays. Identification  of additional genes that regulate LSC self-renewal may provide  new targets for therapy.

DESIGN
Microarrays were used to compare the gene expression patterns between AML CD34+CD38- cells and AML CD34+CD38+
