TITLE
Paternally-induced transgenerational environmental reprogramming of metabolic gene expression in mammals (dye swap)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic information can be inherited through the mammalian germline, and represents a plausible transgenerational carrier of environmental information. To test whether transgenerational inheritance of environmental information occurs in mammals, we carried out an expression profiling screen for genes in mice that responded to paternal diet. Characterizing the RNA exression changes in livers of offspring mice in response to the paternal diet, comparing between low-protein diet and control-diet.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of 2 different paternal diets, control diet and low-protein diet, on the mRNA expression in the liver of the offsprinngs. 26 samples: including Control diet vs. Low-protein (with dye swap), and Control diet vs. Low-protein after fasting the mice.
