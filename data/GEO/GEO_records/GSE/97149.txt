TITLE
An epigenomic role of Fe65 in the cellular response to DNA damage.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we hypothesized that the transcriptional activity of Fe65 may contribute to DNA damage pathways by regulating gene expression patterns activated in response to genotoxic stress. To address this hypothesis, we mapped the global binding profile of Fe65 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in the SK-N-SH cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Unexpectedly, the genome-wide location analysis showed a substantial enrichment of Fe65 in the promoter regions of coding genes linked to DNA damage signaling pathways. 

DESIGN
Fe65 target genes were identified based on the ChIP-seq peaks enriched by Fe65 antibody in SK-N-SH treated with etoposide and compared with non-treated conditions. ------------------------------------ Submitter states " We have submitted the ELAND files as   these were generated very early in 2008, when the first GAIIX Illumina   machines were on the market, and at that time, the machines only did output eland files (the fastq format was introduced at a later time point).
