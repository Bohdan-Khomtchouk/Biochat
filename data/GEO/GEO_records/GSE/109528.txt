TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of HuH-7, NCI-H1299 and HEK-293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The diversity and complexity of the cancer transcriptome hold the potential to yield tumor-specific transcripts (TSTs) in cancer. We report a novel LIN28B variant, LIN28B-TST, which is specifically expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and many other cancer types. LIN28B-TST initiates from a de novo alternative transcription initiation site. We found that LIN28B-TST was expressed in HuH-7 HCC cells and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells, while wild-type LIN28B (LIN28B-WT) was expressed in HEK-293T human embryo kidney cells.

DESIGN
Celluar RNAs were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq.

PLATFORM
GPL21290 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens)
