TITLE
Expression data from lung tumors of KrasTgfbr2 -/- mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent data suggests that repression of the Type II TGF-B Receptor (Tgfr2) repression in human lung adenocarcinoma is important for progression from noninvasive to invasive adenocarcinoma. To test this hypothesis in a animal model of non-invasive lung cancer, we generated an inducible, lung specific Tgfbr2 knockout model in the oncogenic Kras mouse. LSL-KrasG12D positive mice were simultaneously backcrossed to C57/Bl6 mice and to the Tgfbr2 flox/flox mice. To induce tumors, 100 _l of saline containing 3x10e10 particles of an adenovirus containing the Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre) was administered to each LSL-KrasG12D mouse intra-nasally.

DESIGN
Mice were sacrificed at 7 weeks after administration of Adeno-Cre.  We used laser capture microdissection to acquire tumor cells from KrasTgfbr2-/-  and KrasTgfbr2 wt mouse tumors.
