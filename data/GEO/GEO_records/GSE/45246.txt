TITLE
miRNAs regulation by miR-145 in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA in various malignancies including pancreatic cancer. How miR-145 regulates expression of other miRNAs could provide a panoramic view of the development of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, in this project, we aimed to characterize how other miRNAs are affected by miR-145 in hope for understanding proteomic changes that are not explained by miR-145 alone.

DESIGN
miRNA microarray was used to compare expression of all miRNAs 48 hr after transfection of miR-145 mimics or control scramble RNA in a pancreatic cancer cell line, Mia-PaCa2.
