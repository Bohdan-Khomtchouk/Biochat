TITLE
Effect of Mirn378 overexpression on gene expression during C2C12 myogenic and BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small, non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. As such, they are believed to play a role in regulating the step-wise changes in gene expression patterns that occur during cell fate specification of multipotent stem cells. Here, we have studied whether terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts is indeed controlled by lineage-specific changes in miRNA expression. Results: Using a previously generated RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) ChIP-on-chip dataset, we show differential Pol-II occupancy at the promoter regions of six miRNAs during C2C12 myogenic versus BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of one of these miRNAs, miR-378, enhances Alp activity, calcium deposition and mRNA expression of osteogenic marker genes in the presence of BMP2. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a previously unknown role for miR-378 in promoting BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation.

DESIGN
Stable C2C12 cell lines C2C12-pMirn0 and C2C12-pMirn378 were generated by lentiviral transduction of C2C12 myoblasts with a Mirn378-overexpression construct and its parent vector, respectively. C2C12-pMirn0 and C2C12-pMirn378 cells were plated at 2.5 x 10^4 cells/cm2 (day -1), cultured for 1 day in DMEM 10%NCS, then (d0) treated with or without 300 ng/ml bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) for 6 days. RNA was extracted on d0, d3 and d6 and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix).
