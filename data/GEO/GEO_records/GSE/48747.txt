SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_4802 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: OP432(official name : OP432 genotype : unc-119(ed3) III; wgIs432(zip-2::TY1-GFP-3xFLA;unc-119(+)) outcross : 3 mutagen : Bombard tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden description : using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.  The resulting plasmid was used for biolistic transformation of an unc-119(ed3) strain. The ZIP-2::EGFP fusion protein is expressed in the correct zip-2 spatio-temporal expression pattern.  This strain was used for ChIP-seq experiments to map the in vivo binding sites for the ZIP-2 transcription factor. made_by : Unknown ); Developmental Stage: L4; Genotype: unc-119(ed3) III; wgIs432(zip-2::TY1-GFP-3xFLA;unc-119(+)); Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage L4; Target gene zip-2; Strain OP432(official name : OP432 genotype : unc-119(ed3) III; wgIs432(zip-2::TY1-GFP-3xFLA;unc-119(+)) outcross : 3 mutagen : Bombard tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden description : using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.
