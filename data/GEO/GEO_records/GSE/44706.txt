TITLE
Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection of 129S1 and 129X1 (heart tissue day 6)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We infected two strains of mice, 129S1/SvImJ and 129X1/SvJ, with coxsackievirus type b3 (CVB3) at a dose of 500 pfu/g.  129S1 mice developed increased cardiopathology despite equal viral replication.  We hypothesized that the increased cardiopathology might result from an ongoing pathologic host response that we could characterize by global expression profiling.  Gene expression was assessed in hearts from 129S1 and 129X1 mice that were uninfected or infected for 6 days.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hearts of 3 129S1 and 3 129X1 that were infected or uninfected with CVB3(H3) at 500pfu/g and collected at day 6 post infection

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
