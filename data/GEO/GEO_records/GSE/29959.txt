TITLE
Human T-ALL cell line response to inhibition of Notch signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of five Notch signaling-dependent human T-ALL cell lines (ALLSIL, DND41, HPBALL, KOPTK1, TALL-1) treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to block Notch signaling. Samples include parental cells, cells rescued by retroviral transduction with ICN (a GSI-independent form of activated Notch1), and cells retrovirally transduced with c-Myc (an important downstream target of Notch1). Results allow segregation of bona fide Notch targets from other genes affected by gamma-secretase inhibition as well as from targets downstream of c-Myc.

DESIGN
Thirty samples were analyzed. Five human T-ALL cell lines (ALLSIL, DND41, HPBALL, KOPTK1, TALL-1) were treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor (1.0 micromolar compound E) vs. DMSO vehicle control for 12 hours. Each cell line was also retrovirally transduced with ICN or c-Myc, FACS sorted, and then treated with GSI vs. DMSO.
