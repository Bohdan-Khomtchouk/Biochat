TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 cells over-expressing RRP1B and MDA-MB-231 control cells with endogenous RRP1B levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RRP1B is a breast cancer metastasis suppressor that interacts with various regulators of gene transcription We examined the changes in gene expression caused by the stable over-expression of RRP1B using lentiviral transduction in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.

DESIGN
10 total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Partek: WT < Ctrl;. Genes with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change â‰¥abs(2.5) were selected.
