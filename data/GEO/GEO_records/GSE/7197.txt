TITLE
Down-regulation of  OsSRT1 induces DNA ﻿fragmentation and cell death in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to study the physiological function of OsSRT1, a 412 bp segment of the 3’-untranslated region of OsSRT1, which was not conserved with OsSRT2, was inserted in inverted repeats to build a construct for RNA interference (RNAi). The construct was used to transform an indica rice variety (Minghui63).To study whether the down-regulation of OsSRT1 affected gene expression, we compared the transcripts of the RNAi to the wild type plants by microarray analysis (Affymetrix). RNAs were isolated from young leaves of 11 day-old plants (before appearance of lesions in the RNAi plants). Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice Genome Array were performed. Data was analyzed with SAM excel add-in and in-house perl scripts.Analysis of data from three biological repeats revealed that 521 genes are up-regulated, and 213 genes are down-regulated (with q – value at 5%). Keywords: expression analysis
