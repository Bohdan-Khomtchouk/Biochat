TITLE
Expression data from batch cultivations with A. niger, A. oryzae and  A. nidulans grown on glucose and glycerol

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Conserved transcriptional regulation of glycerol metabolism was investigated in three Aspergillus species, A. nidulans, A. oryzae and A. niger. For this purpose, batch cultivations under well controlled conditions were performed with the three Aspergilli. Samples for RNA extraction were collected and further processed for hybridization in custom designed Affymetrix microarrays containing probes for the three Aspergillus species. Protein comparisons and cross analysis with gene expression data of all three species resulted in the identification of 88 genes having a conserved response across the three Aspergillus species. A promoter analysis of the up-regulated genes led to the identification of a conserved binding site for a putative regulator.

DESIGN
Triplicate batch fermentations with each of the three Aspergillus species were carried out and transcriptome analysis was performed. Biomass from each Aspergillus species was harvested in the exponential phase of growth and further processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
