TITLE
Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase 2 is associated with DNA damage response and cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MARK2 expression is associated with the malignant phenotype, expression of DNA repair components, NF-ÎºB inhibition and cell cycle transcription factors in lung cancer cells We used microarrays to determine the global gene expression pattern associated with knockdown of MARK2

DESIGN
3 lung cancer cell lines overexpressing MARK2 have been selected to assess the gene expression pattern after MARK2 knockdown. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays have been done on 2 biological replicates for each line (H1993, H1693 and H1650) after shRNA lentiviral transduction and compared with respective contols using the empty vector pLKO.
