TITLE
Transcription comparison of UC26 to wild type G217B

ORGANISM
Histoplasma capsulatum

SUMMARY
The objective of this experiment is to compare gene expression levels of UC26 to wild type G217B.

DESIGN
One UC26 sample and one G217B sample labeled differently were hybridized to one array. Totally three replicated arrays were used with one of them dye-flipped.
