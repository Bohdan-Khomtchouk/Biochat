TITLE
Analysis of differentiation fates in human ES cells using diverse dosages of BMP and WNT signaling for the initial induction of differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ES cells were induced to differentiate using a directed cardiac induction protcol but varying the concentrations of BMP4 and WNT (CHIR00921) applied during the first 24 hours. The resulting differences in cell fate were then analyzed two weeks later.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from differentiated in-vitro samples after two weeks of differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
