TITLE
gonads gene expression profiling in WT and Sox9flox/flox; Sf1:creTr/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mammals, gonadal differentiation is the first step of sex determination, and the transcription factor Sox9 promotes testis differentiation. Here we used the XY Sox9flox/flox; Sf1:creTr/+ mouse model and show that the lack of Sox9 expression induces a full sex reversal of E13.5 XY Sox9flox/flox; Sf1:creTr/+ gonads compared to XY Sox9flox/flox. Keywords: gonads gene expression profiling in WT and Sox9flox/flox; Sf1:creTr/+ mice

DESIGN
3 WT versus 3 Sox9flox/flox; Sf1:creTr/+ mice.
