TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiles in individuals infected with the Human T-Lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) - train set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection with the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) remains asymptomatic in the majority of carriers; however, some 5% develop a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). It is not well understood how the virus triggers the onset of HAM after many years of clinical latency and importantly, what distinguishes hosts who develop the disease from those who remain asymptomatic. In this study we tested the hypothesis that patients with HAM can be distinguished from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) and uninfected subjects by their whole blood transcriptional profiles. Here, we compare unstimulated whole blood gene expression profiles of 20 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), 10 patients with HAM and 9 uninfected healthy control subjects to (1) identify a transcriptional signature associated with presence of HAM and (2) identify cell types and pathways abnormally regulated in HAM by canonical and modular pathway analysis.

DESIGN
Patients attending the HTLV-1 clinic at St Maryâ€™s hospital in London, UK were classified according to their clinical status as asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs, n=20), patients with HTLV-1-associated meylopathy (HAM, n=10) or uninfected control subjects (n=9). HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) can differ among individuals by more than 10-fold and is typically higher in patients with HAM than in ACs, with a 1% PVL cut off generally separating disease from asymptomatic carriage. Thus, ACs were subdivided into AC low PVL ( < 1% infected PBMCs) and AC high PVL ( > 1% infected PBMCs). Three ml of blood were drawn into a Tempus tube (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Total RNA was extracted, globin mRNA depleted and following cRNA generation samples were analysed on HUmanHT12 v3 Illumina BeadChip arrays.
