TITLE
Expression data from Wild type and Wip1 knockout Hematopoietic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging underlies many age-related hematopoietic disorders. Accumulation of DNA damage is a hallmark of HSC aging. Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) is a homeostatic regulator of DNA damage response. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in Wip1 KO HSC

DESIGN
Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) knockout HSC and Wild type HSC were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
