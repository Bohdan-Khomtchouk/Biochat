TITLE
The influence of long-term use of diet enriched with biologically active substances on transcirptomic profile in rats liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify genes which are differentially expressed in the liver from rat fed with control diet and rat fed with diet enriched with biologicaly active compounds after 3 and 14 months of experiment

DESIGN
RNA from rats fed with control diet and rats fed with diet enriched with biologicaly active compunds were hybridized to Agilent two color microarrays with a common reference

PLATFORM
GPL15084 Agilent-028279 SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
