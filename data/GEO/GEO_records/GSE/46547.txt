TITLE
Influence of growth rate and methanogenic partner on syntrophic metabolism of Desulfovibrio G20 (comparative transcriptional analysis of Desulfovibrio G20 grown under various syntrophic conditions relative to respiratory growth)

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20

SUMMARY
Expression data for Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 grown on lactate in sulfate-limited monoculture and syntrophic coculture with Methanococcus maripaludis or Methanospirillum hungatei in chemostats at a low growth rate of 0.027h-1.

DESIGN
7 samples of Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 grown in syntrophic coculture on lactate with either Methanococcus maripaludis (4 replicates) or Methanospirillum hungatei (3 replicates), and 5 samples of sulfate-limited monoculture growth of strain G20 on lactate.
