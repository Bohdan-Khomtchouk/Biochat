TITLE
Microarray based differential transcriptomics study to understand arsenic-thiourea interaction in rice.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In our earlier study, thiourea has been shown to improve the growth of rice and reduce the arsenic load from aerial parts of the seedlings. We have also shown the applicability of thiourea to delineate the redox regulatory mechansisms under arsenic stress in rice. To move further, present microarray was performed to reveal the involvement of overall gene and regulatory netwrok under arsenic with/without thiourea treatment in rice.
