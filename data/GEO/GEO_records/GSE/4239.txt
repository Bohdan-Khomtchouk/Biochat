TITLE
Transcriptome regulation in the adrenal gland of circadian clock deficient Per2Cry1 double mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This array set was used to determine clock regulated genes in the adrenal gland that are not necessarily rhythmic but still controlled by the circadian TTL. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization / time series

DESIGN
LD entrained animals were released into DD an whole adrenals dissected at the specified time points after " lights off "
