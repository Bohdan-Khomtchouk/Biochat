TITLE
mRNA expression in Extensor Digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of adult F2 female offspring from F0-fathers fed a chow or high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether grandpaternal high-fat diet (HFD) transgenerationally remodels the transcriptome of skeletal muscle EDL muscle mRNA expression profiling of F2-female offspring from F0-founders fed either a chow or a chronic HFD challenged. Adult females were challenge or not a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. EDL muscle was dissected at an endpoint experiment. Rats were subjected to 4 hours fasting prior to anesthesia with pentobarbital and tissue collection.

DESIGN
F2-females Sprague-Dawley rats from F0 founders fed or not a high-fat diet were also subjeted to high-fat consumption for 12 weeks. At terminal experiment, EDL from 4-5 animals per group was collected, prepared and subjeted to the array analysis.
