TITLE
Blood transcriptional biomarkers for active TB among US patients: A case-control study with systematic cross-classifier evaluation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a prospective case-control study, we identified novel transcriptional classifiers for TB among US patients and systematically compared their accuracy to other classifiers in published studies.

DESIGN
Whole blood from US patients was collected to accurately diagnose active TB in racially and ethnically diverse populations for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
