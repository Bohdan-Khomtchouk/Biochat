VEGFR-1 expressed by malignant melanoma initiating cells is required for tumor growth

SUMMARY
Melanoma growth is driven by malignant melanoma initiating cells (MMIC) identified by  expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) member, ABCB5. ABCB5+ melanoma  subpopulations have been shown to overexpress the vasculogenic differentiation markers CD144  (VE-cadherin) and TIE-1 and are associated with CD31-negative vasculogenic mimicry (VM),  an established biomarker associated with increased patient mortality. Here we identify a critical  role for VEGFR-1 signaling in ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent VM and tumor growth. Global gene  expression analyses, validated by mRNA and protein determinations, revealed preferential  expression of VEGFR-1 on ABCB5+ tumor cells purified from clinical melanomas and  established melanoma lines. In vitro, VEGF induced in a VEGFR-1-dependent manner  expression of CD144 in ABCB5+ subpopulations that constitutively expressed VEGFR-1, but not  in ABCB5- bulk populations that were predominantly VEGFR-1-negative. In vivo, melanomaspecific  shRNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 blocked the development of ABCB5+ VM  morphology and inhibited ABCB5+ VM-associated production of the secreted melanoma  mitogen, laminin. Moreover, melanoma-specific VEGFR-1 knockdown markedly inhibited  tumor growth (by > 90%). Our results demonstrate that VEGFR-1 function in MMIC regulates  VM and associated laminin production, and show that this function represents one mechanism  through which MMIC promote tumor growth.
