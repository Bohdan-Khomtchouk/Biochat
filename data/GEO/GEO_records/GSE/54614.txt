TITLE
Analysis of differentially-expressed genes in Tg(actb2:KIT-D816V) transgenic zebrafish versus wild-type adult kidneys

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of pooled adult  kidneys from transgenic zebrafish expressing human KIT-D816V mutant gene versus wild-type zebrafish was performed. The aim of this experiment was to determine the expression and cellular changes caused by expression of KIT-D816V oncogene in the hematopoietic organ in zebrafish. This transgenic zebrafish represents a model of systemic mastocytosis with many features of this disease present in adults

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Tg(actb2:KIT-D816V) versus wild-type(AB), one replicate of each prepared from 3 adult kidneys of each genotype and  a dye-swap hybridization of these RNA samples.

PLATFORM
GPL14664 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Probe Name version)
