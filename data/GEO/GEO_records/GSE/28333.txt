TITLE
Expression data from BCL11A-null and wild-type bone marrow erythroid pregenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BCL11A is a critical mediator of hemoglobin switching and gamma-globin silencing. In this study, we showed the BCL11A is required in vivo for developmental silencing of gamma-globin genes in adult animals. We used microarray to determine the changes in gene expression profile after loss of BCL11A in adult erythroid cells

DESIGN
CD71+Ter119+ erythroid progenitor cells were FACS-sorted from bone marrows of 6-week old control (Bcl11a +/+) and BCL11A knockout (Bcl11a fl/fl EpoR-Cre+) mice.
