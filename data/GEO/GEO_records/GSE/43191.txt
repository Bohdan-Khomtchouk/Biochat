TITLE
Genome wide-DNA methylation analysis of articular chondrocytes reveals a cluster of osteoarthritic patients (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify, for the first time, the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human articular chondrocytes from OA and healtly cartilage samples. A subsequent validation of methylation profiles were performed in an idependent cohort of OA samples with Affymetrix Hugene 1.1 st array This represents the gene expression component of the study only

DESIGN
OA gene expression profiling was performed with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 st array was performed in and independent cohort of 23 OA patients
