TITLE
High-resolution custom array spanning short arm of chromosome 17

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the size, genomic extent and gene content of rearrangements involving 17p.

DESIGN
To determine size, genomic extent and gene content for each rearrangement, we used a customized tiling-path oligonucleotide microarray spanning the entire 17p chromosomal region. A 4x44k Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) microarray was designed using the Agilent e-array website. We selected 42,000 probes covering Chr17: 29,000-22,100,000 (hg18), which represents an average distribution of 1 probe per 526 bp.
