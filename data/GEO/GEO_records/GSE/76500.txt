TITLE
Gene expression in a 3-dimensional reconstructed human corneal epithelial tissue after near-infrared irradiation simulating solar near-infrared radiation that reaches human tissues on the Earth’s surface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effects of near-infrared radiation, we assessed DNA microarray after water-filtered broad-spectrum near-infrared (1100-1800 nm together with a water-filter that excludes wavelengths 1400-1500 nm) irradiation.

DESIGN
We performed 5 rounds of near-infrared irradiation (at 10 J ⁄cm2) using 2 sets of transparent polycarbonate plates, one to block UV and the other to block both UV and near-infrared.
