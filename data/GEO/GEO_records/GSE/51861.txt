TITLE
RNA-seq (Illumina and PacBio) of hESC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used PacBio data to identify more reliable transcripts from hESC, based on which we can estimate gene/transcript abundance better from Illumina data.

DESIGN
PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads were generated from the same hESC cell line H1. PacBio reads were error-corrected by Illumina reads to identify transcripts. rSeq is used to estimate gene/transcript abundance of the identified transcriptome.
