TITLE
Gene expression data of parotid tissue from Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with complex etiopathogenesis. Here we use Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarray gene expression data from human parotid tissue. Parotid gland tissues were harvested from 17 pSS and 14 14 non-pSS sicca patients and 18 controls. The data were used in the following article:  Nazmul-Hossain ANM, Pollard RPE, Kroese FGM, Vissink A, Kallenberg CGM, Spijkervet FKL, Bootsma H, Michie SA, Gorr SU, Peck AB, Cai C, Zhou H, Horvath S, Wong DTW (2012) Systems Analysis of Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome Pathogenesis in Salivary Glands: Comparative Pathways and Molecular Events in Humans and a Mouse Model.

DESIGN
Parotid gland tissues were harvested from 17 pSS and 14 non-pSS sicca patients and 18 controls.
