SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles from diagnostic samples of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) to a patient case withsamples of primary and relapsed transformed FL.

DESIGN
SNP6.0 arrays of saliva, primary and relapsed transformed follicular lymphoma from a patient case.
