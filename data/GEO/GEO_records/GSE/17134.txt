TITLE
12h pathway stimulation / inhibition experiment in epiblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment records the transcriptional responses of EpiSCs (line E3) to FGF/ERK inhibition, GSK3ÃŸ inhibition, LIF/STAT3 activation, as well as combined treatment for 12 hours each.

DESIGN
EpiSCs were grown in KSR medium on low-density feeders. At semiconfluency, media were changed as detailed for the individual samples. Cells were harvested for RNA isolation 12 hours later.
