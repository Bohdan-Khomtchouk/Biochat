TITLE
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization of Pancreatic Xenografts and Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) of 70 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples was performed on Agilent 244K CGH arrays in order to find common genomic aberrations for cancer gene discovery. Additionally, matched expression profiling on Agilent 44K arrays was performed. Common copy number aberrations were identified in order to identify a list of putative cancer genes. Expression profiling data was used to further enrich this list of putative cancer genes for more likely candidates. Last, the most promising candidates were functionally interrogated using RNA interference-mediated knockdown to mimic loss. Well-known PDAC cancer genes were observed as amplified (KRAS and MYC) and deleted (CDKN2A, TGFBR2, SMAD4, and MAP2K4).

DESIGN
70 tumor samples (48 xenografts, 22 cell lines). 2-color arrays hybridized against a common reference pool of genomic DNA from 8 normal individuals. This dataset represents the aCGH component of the study.
