TITLE
Trap-80-dependence of TNF-alpha-induced genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In fibroblasts, p65-dependent genes can be sub-divided, depending on whether they are Trap-80-dependent or -independent.  To examine the generality of this grouping, we performed a microarray analysis of wild-type and Trap-80 knock-down fibroblasts, before and after stimulation of NF-kappaB activity using TNF-alpha.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from three independent cultures of wild-type and Trap-80 knock-down fibroblasts, before and after stimulation for 1 hour with 5ng/ml TNF-alpha.  The unstimulated and stimulated wild-type samples, and the stimulated Trap-80 knock-down samples, were used for microarray analysis.
