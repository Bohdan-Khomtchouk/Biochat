TITLE
A novel functional role for the serine protease inhibitor SerpinA3N and its substrate leukocyte elastase in neuropathic pain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Two out-bred rat selection lines were separated to produce different hypersensitivity phenotypes following nerve injury. These lines were termed High Pain and Low Pain (HP or LP). Each sub-strain was either subject to a Sham surgery or a Spinal Nerve Ligation (SNL) surgery to the L4 and L5 spinal nerves. Three days following surgery L4/L5 Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) were dissected from these animals. For the rat line separation protocol see: Devor M, Raber P (1990) Heritability of symptoms in an experimental model of neuropathic pain. Pain 42:51-67.

DESIGN
12 Hybridizations, 3 per condition; Sham HP DRG; 3 day SNL HP DRG; Sham LP DRG; 3 day SNL LP DRG.

PLATFORM
GPL341 [RAE230A] Affymetrix Rat Expression 230A Array
