TITLE
Integrative analysis of translatome and transcriptome of adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To systemically determine the translational control of gene expression in adipose, we performed ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in parallel to depict the translatome and transcriptome changes during primary brown and white adipogenesis, and between brown and white adipose tissue.

DESIGN
ribosome profiling and mRNA profiling were performed using the same biological material for interscapular brown fat, epididymal white fat, in vitro cultured white and brown preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
