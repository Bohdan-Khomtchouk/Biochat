TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in murine breast fibroblasts from normal tissue, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma (MMTV-PyMT model)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differences at gene expression level of hpvE6 immortalized fibroblasts isolated from normal mammary glands and from hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma stages using the MMTV-PyMT model (FVB/N background). Analysis demonstrated the activation of specific transcriptional programs in fibroblasts from later stages.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated hpvE6 immortalized fibroblasts from normal mammary gland (NF) and from different stages of tumour development using the MMTV-PyMT murine breast cancer model. Stages were hyperplasia (HpAF), adenoma (AdAF) and carcinoma (CAF). Fibroblasts were seeded in a deformable Matrigel:collagen I matrix and total RNA isolated 72h later.
