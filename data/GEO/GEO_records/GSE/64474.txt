TITLE
Effect of mifepristone on gene expression in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Illumina sequencing was used to assay the effect of mifepristone treatment on gene expression in adult Drosophila, including males, virgin females and mated females.

DESIGN
Males of strain w[1118]; p53B[6] were crossed to virgins of w[1118]; rtTA(3)E2 and progeny males and virgins were collected over 48 hours.  One half of the virgins were mated to w[1118] males at ratio of 1:1 virgins to males for 4 days.  Mated females were then separated from the w[1118] males.  The mated females, males and virgins females were then maintained at approximately 20 flies per vial, on food with and without supplementation with 160ug/ml mifepristone for 12 days.  Total fly RNA was isolated from 20 animals per sample. Three replicate samples were generated for each type of flies: males, mated females and virgin females.
