TITLE
Global murine pulmonary response to highly and less virulent influenza A (H3N2) virus infections at 12, 48 and 96 h post-infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Array analysis of total lung RNAs from female BALB/c mice collected at 12, 48 and 96 h post-infection with highly and less virulent influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Viruses (designated as LVI and HVI) were derived from influenza strain virus A/Aichi/2/68 (Aichi68). LVI is Aichi68 propagated in eggs, and HVI is mouse adapted Aichi68.

DESIGN
Infection: lung homogenate (mock), LVI and HVI; time of sample collection: 12, 48 and 96 h post-infection; two biological replicates for each group.
