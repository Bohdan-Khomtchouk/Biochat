TITLE
Identification of miR-125b-2 target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to define miR-125b-2 target genes in the hematopoietic system by genetic alteration of miR-125b expression levels. Here we report the identification of miR-125b-2 targets in the hematopoietic system by repressing miR125b in megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cell lines and overexpressing miR-125b-2 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CD34+-HSPCs)

DESIGN
M07 and CMK cells were transfected with Cy3-labelled non-silencing olignucleotides or anti-miR-125b and sorted (two experiments). HSPCs were retrovirally transduced and sorted for GFP positive cells. We generated their expression profiles by microarray.
