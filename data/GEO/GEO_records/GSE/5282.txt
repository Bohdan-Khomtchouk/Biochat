ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Primary cultures of astrocytes from rat optic nerve heads were treated with EGFR ligand, EGF. Two cell lines from two different rat donors were used. The sister cell cultures were set as control and EGF treated groups. Keywords: rat optic nerve head astrocytes

DESIGN
experiment #1: compared control astrocyte cultures to sister cultures treated with EGF for 4 hours. experiment #2: compared control astrocyte cultures to sister cultures treated with EGF for 12 hours
