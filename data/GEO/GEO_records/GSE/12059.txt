TITLE
HeLa cell response to overexpression of wild type and mutated forms of the P19 splice variant of c-H-ras

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The c-H-ras proto-oncogene undergoes alternative splicing of the exon termed IDX giving rise to a novel protein of the Ras family, p19 (H-RasIDX). The experiment tests the effect on the transcriptome of overexpressing the wild type and W164A mutated forms of p19. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, where wild type p19 H-ras transfection or transfection with a mutated form (p19W164A) were compared to transfection with the negative control (empty pRK5 expression vector) which was used as the common reference. Biological replicates: 3 of each set of treatments, independently grown and harvested. Two technical replicates with dye swapping per comparison.
