TITLE
Serpula lacrymans gene expression on different substrates

ORGANISM
Serpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.9

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Serpula lacrymans grown on different substrates were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, department of energy) Serpula lacrymans genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models under various conditions. Another goal was to compare gene expression profiles from Serpula lacrymans grown on liquid MMN medium and on wood.

DESIGN
We performed 9 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived fromfrom Serpula lacrymans grown on liquid MMN medium and on wood.
