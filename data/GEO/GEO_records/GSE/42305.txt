TITLE
TREM-1 is a novel therapeutic target in Psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our group recently described a population of antigen presenting cells that appear to be critical in psoriasis pathogenesis, termed inflammatory myeloid dendritic cells (CD11c+ BDCA1-). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type-1 (TREM-1) signaling was a major canonical pathway in the published transcriptome of these cells. TREM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, active through the DAP12 signaling pathway, with an unknown ligand. Activation through TREM-1 induces inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, MCP/CCL2 and TNF. We now show that TREM-1 was expressed in the skin of healthy and psoriatic patients, and there was increased soluble TREM-1 in the circulation of psoriasis patients. In psoriasis lesions, TREM-1 was co-localized with dendritic cells as well as CD31+ endothelial cells. TREM-1 expression was reduced with successful NB-UVB, etanercept and anti-IL-17 treatments. An in vitro model of PGN-activated monocytes as inflammatory myeloid DCs was developed to study TREM-1 blockade, and treatment with a TREM-1 blocking chimera decreased allogeneic Th17 activation, as well as IL-17 production. Furthermore, TREM-1 blockade of ex vivo psoriatic dendritic cells in an alloMLR also showed a decrease in IL-17. Together, these data suggest that the TREM-1 signaling pathway offers a novel therapeutic target to prevent the effects of inflammatory myeloid DCs in psoriasis.

DESIGN
Monocytes were isolated by plastic adherence, treated with TLR agonists overnight, washed twice and harvested in RTL-buffer. RNA was extracted and processed for microarray. 3 groups and 3 replicates with a paired structure across replicates
