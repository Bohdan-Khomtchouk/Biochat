TITLE
Diabetic mice fat- niacin bound chromium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study effect of niacin bound chromium in changing genetic profile of subcutaneous fat from diabetic mice Keywords: nutritional supplemetation, obesity

DESIGN
Two groups (n=4 each group) of mice were supplemented (oral gavage) with: i) niacin bound chromium (10 mg/kg body wt) in water for 10 wks (5d/wk) or ii) matching volume of water. After 10 wks of supplementation the subcutaneous fat was harvested and gene expression profile was studied using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 v 2.0 chips.
