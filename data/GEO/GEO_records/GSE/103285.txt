TITLE
Gene expression response to glucose/fructose in WT vs. tps1-

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
WT or tps1- yeast grown in galactose were subjected to addition of glucose/fructose; cells were collected for RNA extraction and sequencing to assess the gene expression responses between these treatments

DESIGN
2 strains (one wild type and one mutant); 2 treatments per strain; each treatment is an 8-point time-course

PLATFORM
GPL21656 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
