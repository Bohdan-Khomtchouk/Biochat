TITLE
HIT T cell versus B cell line proof-of-principle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed a multi-analyte fluid-phase protein array technology termed high-throughput immunophenotyping using transcription (HIT).  This method employs a panel of monoclonal antibodies, each tagged with a unique oligonucleotide sequence that serves as a molecular barcode.  After staining a sample, T7 polymerase amplifies the tags which are then hybridized to a DNA microarray for indirect measurement of each analyte.  Here we coupled 44 of the tags to aliquots of an IgG1 isotype negative control antibody and the 4 remaining tags we coupled to anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD19, and anti-CD20 to create a 48-plex HIT cocktail.  We then used this cocktail to stain 1 x 10^6 T or B cells and during amplification incorporated either cyanine 3-UTP (Cy3-UTP) or Cy5-UTP.  Additionally, we snap froze and thawed an aliquot of the cocktail (FT). Keywords: protein profiling, cell type comparison
