TITLE
Microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes of intracellular Brucella abortus in RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Brucella abortus str. 2308 A

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis determined that 7.82% (244/3334) of Brucella abortus genes were up-regulated and 5.4% (180/3334) were down-regulated in RAW264.7 macrophages, compared to free-living bacteria in TSB

DESIGN
In the study, Brucela abortus was isolated from infected macrophages at 24 post-infection, DNA microarray was used to analysis the differentially expressed genes between intracellular bacteria and free-living ones in TSB
