TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type and Δasc1 strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Asc1p and its essential orthologues in higher eukaryotes, as e.g. RACK1 in mammals, are involved in several distinct cellular signaling processes, but the implications of a total deletion have never been assessed in a comprehensive genome-wide manner. This study reveals the major cellular processes affected in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δasc1 deletion background via de novo proteome and transcriptome analysis, as well as subsequent phenotypical characterizations. The deletion of ASC1 reduces iron-uptake and causes nitrosative stress, both known indicators for hypoxia, which manifests in a shift of energy metabolism from respiration to fermentation in the Δasc1 strain. The impact of Asc1p in cellular metabolism is further expressed by its regulative role in the MAP kinase signal transduction pathways of invasive/filamentous growth, pheromone response and cell wall integrity. In the Δasc1 mutant strain aberrations from the expected cellular response, mediated by these pathways, can be observed and are linked to changes in protein abundances of pathway-targeted transcription factors. Evidence for the translational regulation of such transcription factors suggests that ribosomal Asc1p is involved in signal transduction pathways by controlling the biosynthesis of the respective final transcriptional regulators.

DESIGN
The transcriptional data results from from 3 biological replicates for each strain, whereas for each biological replicate 2 technical replications and dye-swaps were analyzed.
