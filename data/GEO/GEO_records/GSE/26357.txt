TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in rice under abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNA and NAT-siRNAs that are associated with abiotic stresses in rice, we generated small RNA sequences from inflorescences from rice under control and under dought, salt, and cold stress treatments. Over 30 million reads were generated.

DESIGN
sequencing of small RNAs in rice under control, drought, salt, and cold stress conditions.
