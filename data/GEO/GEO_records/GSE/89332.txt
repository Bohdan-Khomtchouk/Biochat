TITLE
Expression data for various immune cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Segregated nucleus atypical monocyte (SatM) is novel monocyte cell type. Complehensive Gene expression pattern was examined not only in SatM but also its related cell type. We used microarrays to investigate the character of Segregated nucleus atypical monocyte (SatM) and commeted progenitors

DESIGN
Various cell types involved in innate immune systems were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
