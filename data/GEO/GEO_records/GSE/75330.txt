TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of single cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage from nine distinct regions of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axis of the mouse juvenile central nervous system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5069 transcriptomes of single oligodendrocyte cells from spinal cord, substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei, zona incerta, hippocampus, and somatosensory cortex of male and female mice between post-natal day 21 and 90. The study aimed at identifying diverse populations of oligodendrocytes, and revealing dynamics of oligodendrocyte maturation.

DESIGN
5069 individual cells were sampled from CNS regions of mice of various strains as detailed in the protocols section
