SUMMARY
A co-culture of 60% GFP-labeled human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCGFP) and 40% mcherry-labeled NIH:OVCAR-3 tumor cells were incubated in MSC culture medium for up to 7 days in cell culture plates (diameter 10 cm, Greiner BioOne GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) at an initial density of 2,000 cells/cm2.

DESIGN
All 4 biological samples were processed in a single color microarray design
