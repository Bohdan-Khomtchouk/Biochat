TITLE
Gene expression change in Skov3 after EZH2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes whose expression was suppressed by EZH2, we performed gene expression microarray analysis in control and EZH2 knockdown human SKOV3 EOC cells. Two individual short hairpin RNAs to the human EZH2 gene (shEZH2) were used to limit potential off-target effects.
