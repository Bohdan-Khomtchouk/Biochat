TITLE
24 hour time course: regulation of uterine genes by estradiol in ovariectomized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray technology, we compared the global expression pattern of uterine RNA from ovariectomized control mice to those of ovariectomized mice treated with estradiol for various intervals between 30 minutes and 24 hours. Keywords: estrogen, uterus, genomic, mouse

DESIGN
Mice (C57 BI/6) were treated with sesame oil or estradiol and uteri were collected at 30 minutes, two hours, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after treatment and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Three or four uteri from each treatment group were pooled and RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent and the RNeasy clean up protocol.  Two arrays for each time point were used, incorporating a fluor reversal.
