TITLE
Expression data from TNF-stimulated mouse glomeruli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The specific contribution of the two TNF-receptors Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 to TNF-induced inflammation in the glomerulus is unknown. In mice, TNF exposure induces glomerular expression of inflammatory mediators like adhesion molecules and chemokines in vivo, and glomerular accumulation of leukocytes. To examine Tnfr-specific inflammatory responses in intrinsic glomerular cells but not infiltrating leukocytes we performed microarray gene expression profiling on intact glomeruli isolated from wild-type and Tnfr-deficient mice following TNF exposure in vitro.

DESIGN
Glomeruli were isolated from male C57BL/6J wild-type and Tnfr-deficient mice applying a magnetic bead-based isolation technique. Isolated intact glomeruli were stimulated with TNF for 12 hours in vitro for subsequent RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
