TITLE
DNA methylation at transcription start sites blocks TBP binding and transcription onset by RNApolII [MeDIP]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We measured the methylation levels of gene promoters of cerebral cortex of mice. We used MeDIP-array,  immunoprecipitating genomic DNA with an antibody against methylated DNA and measuring methylation levels using custom arrays. The input DNA was used as control.

DESIGN
triplicates of frontal cortex DNA pools of 3 mice

PLATFORM
GPL19110 Agilent-039828 mouse promoter tiling
