TITLE
Gene Expression Data of Hibernating and Summer Active Black Bears

ORGANISM
Ursus americanus

SUMMARY
We conducted a large-scale gene expression screen using the 3,200 cDNA probe microarray developed specifically for Ursus americanus to detect expression differences in liver and skeletal muscle that occur during winter hibernation in comparison to animals sampled during summer. The expression of 12 genes, including RNA binding protein motif 3 (Rbm3), that are mostly involved in protein biosynthesis, was induced during hibernation in both liver and muscle. The Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment analysis consistently showed a highly significant enrichment of the protein biosynthesis category by over-expressed genes in both liver and skeletal muscle during hibernation. Coordinated induction in transcriptional level of genes involved in protein biosynthesis is a distinctive feature of the transcriptome in hibernating black bears. This finding implies induction of translation and suggests an adaptive mechanism that contributes to a unique ability to reduce muscle atrophy over prolonged periods of immobility during hibernation. Comparing expression profiles in bears to small mammalian hibernators shows a general trend during hibernation of transcriptional changes that include induction of genes involved in lipid metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis as well as depression of genes involved in the urea cycle and detoxification function in liver.

DESIGN
Black bears sampled during winter hibernation were compared with the animals sampled during summer. Two tissue types, liver and muscle, were hybridized on a custom 3,200-gene nylon membrane microarray platform with three replicates for each gene (9.600 spots in total). Six hibernating and five summer active bears were studied in experiments with liver tissue, five hibernating and five summer active animals were tested with muscle tissue.
