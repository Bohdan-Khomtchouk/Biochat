TITLE
GATA2/eGFP knockin study to trace the endothelial to hematopoietic transition and hematopoietic progenitor cells in human hematopoiesis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated GATA2/eGFP knockin human embryonic stem cells (H1-GATA2W/eGFP hESCs) and analyzed eGFP expression at different hematopoietic stages, paritcularly the hemogenic endothelium (HE) and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) stage. Our results revealed that, at the HE stage,  eGFP expression discriminates authentic HE from non-hematopoietic endothlial cells (EC) and, at the HPC stage, eGFP expression marks the HPC. Further transcriptome comparison analysis revealed distinct characteristics of the HE and EC. Our study provided ideal model to study the EHT and HPC generation, therefore underpining further study on human ESC modeled hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptome of eGFP+CD34+CD31+CD43- hemogenic endothelium and eGFP-CD34+CD31+CD43- endothelial cells derived from GATA2w/eGFP hESCs by RNA-Seq.
