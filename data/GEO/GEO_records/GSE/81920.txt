TITLE
Effect of E-cadherin by N-cadherin replacement in mouse intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conditionally substituted E-cadherin (E-cad; cadherin 1) with N-cadherin (N-cad; cadherin 2) during intestine development by generating mice in which an Ncad cDNA was knocked into the Ecad locus We used microarray to follow gene expression changes derived from lack of E-cadherin on intestinal epithelial cells

DESIGN
Epithelial cells were harvested from the small intestine of 14 days old mice harboring N-cadherin and no E-cadherin and from E-cadherin-positive littermates.
