TITLE
Human embryonic stem cell, rhesus embryonic stem cell and mouse transchromosomic (hsa11) embryonic stem cell (with and without ectopic ZNF91 expression) RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the expression in embryonic stem cells of KRAB ZNF proteins and retrotransposon elements in the human genome under several conditions. Native human stem cells. Mouse stem cells containing a transchromosomic copy of human chromosome 11, with and without the introduction of plasmids containing KRAB Zinc Finger sequences. We show that certain KZNFs are responsible for the repression of certain retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, preventing their spread across the genome.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of hESCs, rhESCs and mouse TC11 ESCs with ZNF91 plasmids (2 replicates), with empty vector plasmids (2 replicates), or no plasmids.
