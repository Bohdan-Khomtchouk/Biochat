TITLE
Allergic contact dermatitis to nickel is characterized by a specific microRNA signature [PBMCs]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (from subjects with allergy to nickel) stimulated with nickel were characterized by a specific miRNA signature that were different from vehicle-stimulated PBMCs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, nickel vs. vehicle challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Biological replicates: 3 subjects with allergy to nickel, 3 subjects with no history of dermatitis. One replicate per array.  Sample 1-12 (A28-A39)

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
