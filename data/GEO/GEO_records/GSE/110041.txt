TITLE
In-vitro stimulation of healthy donor blood with IL-3 cytokine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to look for in vitro IL-3 gene signature in donor blood at two different time points (6 and 24 hours). RNA from lysed whole blood cells was used for the sequencing.

DESIGN
Lysed whole blood from seven healthy donors was stimulated with recombinant human IL-3 for 6 hours, or 24 hours, prior to RNA extraction for next-generation sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Unstimulated samples were included as controls.

PLATFORM
