TITLE
septante project-Impact of genetically modified plants on bacteria from rhizosphere

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-02_opine - septante project - We have tools to estimate this modification for the bacterial part. On the other hand, concerning the plant part, we know plants produce opines compounds but we dont know if this expression can modify the transcriptional state of the plant. - Transgenic lines producing respectively octopine and mannopine and the WT line were grown in hydroponic tanks (containing nutritive solution) under short day conditions (8h light, 24Â°C). Whole plant aged of one month were harvested and frozen in nitrogen liquid. The plants were ground with a mortar and pestle and RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy extraction kit (QIAGEN). The RNA concentration estimation was performed on a NANODrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).
