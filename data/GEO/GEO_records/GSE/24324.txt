TITLE
The Drosophila melanogaster Transcriptome by Paired-End RNA-Sequencing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to generate an extensive map of the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome by broad sampling of 10 developmental stages.  In total, 142.2 million uniquely mapped 64-100bp paired-end reads were generated on the Illumina GA II yielding 356x sequencing coverage.  More than 95% of FlyBase genes and 90% of splicing junctions were observed.  Modifications to 30% of FlyBase gene models were made by extension of untranslated regions, inclusion of novel exons, and identification of novel splicing events.  A total of 319 novel transcripts were identified, representing a 2% increase over the current annotation.  Alternate splicing was observed in 31% of D. melanogaster genes, a 38% increase over previous estimations, but significantly less than that observed in higher organisms.  Much of this splicing is subtle such as tandem alternate splice sites.

DESIGN
Poly(A)+ transcripts from 10 distinct stages during the live cycle of D. melanogaster were isolated to generated cDNA libraries which were sequenced on the Illumina GA II instrument.
