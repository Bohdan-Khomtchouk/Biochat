TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of cloned CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infected or not by HTLV-1 in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To address whether changes in miRNA expression accompany cell-associated replication of HTLV-1 in vivo, we carried out the miRNA expression profiling of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells derived from naturally HTLV-1 infected individuals with no clinical sign of malignancy. T-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution culture of PBMCs of HTLV-1 carriers. miRNA expression was assessed by Agilent V3 miRNA array according to the manufacturer's instructions.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles of cloned CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (carrying or not HTLV-1) derived from naturally HTLV-1 infected individuals.
