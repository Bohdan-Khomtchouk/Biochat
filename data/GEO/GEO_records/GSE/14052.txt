TITLE
Differentially expressed cellular genes in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic HPV18 positive HeLa x fibroblast hybrid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes differentially expressed in tumorigenic compared to non-tumorigenic, HPV18 positive cells Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in tumorigenic HeLa x fibroblast hybrid cells (CGL3) and parental HeLa cells compared to non-tumorigenic HeLa x fibroblast hybrid cells (444). Gene expression profiles of proliferating cells under cell culture conditions were compared to identify differential gene expression patterns of upregulated and downregulated mRNA expression patterns of tumorigenic CGL3 and HeLa cells versus non-tumorigenic 444 cells..
