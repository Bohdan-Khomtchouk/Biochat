TITLE
Gene expression in post cardiac surgery acute kidney injury

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To determine the changes in intra-renal gene expression in a novel large animal model of post Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) acute kidney injury, we collected renal medulla samples obtained 24hours post intervention. The transcriptional profile of the mRNA in these samples was measured with gene array technology.

DESIGN
Pigs were subjected to 2.5 hours of general anaesthesia or 2.5 hours of CPB under general anaesthesia. Renal medulla samples were collected 24 hours post intervention.
