TITLE
Cultured fibroblasts treated with media from cardiomyocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of the role of hyaluronan in cardiomyocytes. The aims of the study were to determine if cardiomyocytes are capable of signal to fibroblasts to affect their hyaluronan synthesis and if intracellular signaling causes changes in gene expression. The study showed that cardiomyocytes send a signal to fibroblasts, to causing them to increase hyaluronan synthesis, with following change in gene expression.

DESIGN
Media from cultured cardiomyocytes were transfered to cultured fibroblasts. Gene expression in fibroblasts were analyzed with Illumina Beadstation.
