TITLE
Gene expression profile in response to doxorubicin-rapamycin combined treatment of HER-2 overexpressing human mammary epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HER-2 positive breast cancers frequently sustain elevated AKT/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling which has been associated with resistance to doxorubicin treatment in the clinic. In our study we investigated if the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin therapy in HB4a, a luminal normal mammary cell line; C5.2, a transformed cell derived from HB4a transfected with HER-2 and SKBR3 that exhibits HER-2 amplification. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the combination treatment for 24 hours with rapamycin 20nM and doxorubicin caused accumulation of HB4a and C5.2 cells in S-G2/M. Otherwise in SKBR3 cells, we observed a relative depletion of cells in S-G2/M and concomitant accumulation in G0/G1 of 10% of the cells. The analysis of IC50 of doxorubicin alone and in combination with rapamycin indicated that the sensitivity was increased 2.37 fold in HB4a, 2.46 in C5.2 and 1.87 in SKBR3, suggesting that rapamycin might have enhanced the effects of doxorubicin. Changes in gene expression resulting from co-treatment demonstrated that functional groups of genes with roles in cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis regulation were represented in the 3 cells analysed. Other biological functions were exclusively associated with each cell suggesting that the inhibition of mTOR activation induced by HER-2 is complex and depends on the cellular context.

DESIGN
Five independent experiments were performed for each treatment conditions: HB4a,  C5.2 and SKBR3 cell lines were treated  with vehicle  (DRC), 20 nM of RAPAMYCIN alone (R) and 30  nM of DOXORUBICIN alone (D). The combined treatment consisted of 20 nM of RAPAMYCIN associated with 30 nM DOXORUBICIN of (DR). Total RNA extraction and hybridization  on Affymetrix microarrays.
