TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of human CD14+ monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed single-cell RNA-seq on CD14+ monocytes isolated from the blood of healthy donors. Using the 10x chromium technology, we analyzed 425 and 431 cells from 2 individual donors.

DESIGN
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were prepared by centrifugation on a Ficoll gradient. Blood CD14+ monocytes were isolated from healthy donors’ PBMC by positive selection using magnetic beads. Monocytes were 93-95% CD14+CD16- as assessed by flow cytometry. Cellular suspensions (1700 cells) were loaded on a 10X Chromium instrument (10X Genomics) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
