TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen reactivity in BXD2 mice with spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease Pepperchip 2.0

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the array was to determine the BXD2 mouse sera IgG and IgM reactivity profile to linear peptide epitopes.  Pooled sera from three 6-9 month old BXD2 mice was diluted at 1:200 for IgG specific analysis or 1:1000 for IgM specific analysis and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens

DESIGN
In this study, pooled sera from three 6-9 month old BXD2 mice was profiled for IgG and IgM specific autoantibody reactivity to peptide auto-epitopes printed in duplicate on a PepperPrint Chip.
