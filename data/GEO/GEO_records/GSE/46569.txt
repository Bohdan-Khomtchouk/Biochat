TITLE
Prostaglandin-modulated umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valuable source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for use in allogeneic transplantation. Key advantages of UCB are rapid availability and less stringent requirements for HLA matching.  However, UCB contains an inherently limited HSC count, which is associated with delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates and early mortality. 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) was previously identified to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis and we hypothesized that a brief ex vivo modulation could improve patient outcomes by increasing the “effective dose” of HSCs. Molecular profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips were used to determine the optimal ex vivo modulation conditions (e.g., temperature and media) for use in a clinical setting by measured pathway induced expression changes.

DESIGN
Isolated human CD34+ from umbilical cord blood were incubated ex vivo in Stem Span (SS) media evaluating three treatment temperatures (4 deg C, 25 deg C, and 37 deg C) with 10uM 16,16-dmPGE2 or Vehicle (DMSO) for 2 hours.  To evaluate optimal media, similar CD34+ cells were incubated ex vivo in either Stem Span-SFEM (SS) media or 8% Low Molecular Weigh Dextran 40/5% HSA solution (LMD/HSA) with 10uM 16,16-dmPGE2 or Vehicle (DMSO) for 2 hours at 37 deg C.  Total RNA was isolated post incubation and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays for pathway activation.
