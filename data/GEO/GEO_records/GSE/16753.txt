TITLE
C. elegans fer-1 mutant gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In vertebrate muscle, loss of Dysferlin results in the activation of compensatory muscle gene  expression, even at pre-pathological stages. We hypothesized that if C. elegans  fer-1 is also expressed in muscle, then fer-1 mutant worms might also exhibit  compensatory muscle gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used Affymetrix microarrays to profile gene expression from synchronized wild type and fer-1 mutant  adults. To improve the specificity of this approach, we profiled two well characterized loss-of-function fer-1 mutants (hc1ts and hc24ts) and considered genes that changed similarly in both mutants as fer-1-regulated transcripts.

DESIGN
For each genotype, six individual replicates were performed and were hybridized to Affymetrix C. elegans Genechips using the manufacturerâ€™s  recommended protocols. The best four preparations (as determined by the overall Pearson Correlation within a  genotype) were used for RNA labeling and hybridization.
