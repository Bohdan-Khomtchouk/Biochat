TITLE
Gene expression data from murine M1 and M2 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages have distinct characteristics depending on their microenvironment. We performed proteomic analysis between M1 and M2 macrophages and found that cellular metabolism is the key regulator of macrophage function. We used microarray to support proteomic data between M1 and M2 macrophages.

DESIGN
M1 macrophages are obtained using cell sorting of CD45+MHCII+CD8a-F4/80+ population from C57BL/6J bone marrow cell derived heterogenous cells under GM-CSF conditioning for 7 days. M2 macrophages are differentiated with 20% L929 cell supernatant for 7 days and sorted from CD45+F4/80+CD11b+ population.
