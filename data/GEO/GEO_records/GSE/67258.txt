TITLE
Genome-wide identification of BATF2 binding sites in HeLa-BATF2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basic leucine zipper transcription factors (BATFs) play profound roles in the regulatory networks of gene expression in tumor cells. BATF2, also known as SARI (suppressor of AP-1, regulated by interferon), was able to suppress both growth and migration of various cancers. In searching for BATF2/SARI-specific regulatory DNA elements, we first established a stable BATF2 over-expression HeLa cell line, then employed ChIP-Sequencing in order to identify the responsive DNA motifs for BATF2/SARI.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different antibodies enrichment in HeLa-BATF2 cells.

PLATFORM
