TITLE
Expression data from inflamed PANC1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of mutant p53 on TNFa stimulated PANC1 cells was tested. PANC1 cell harbor endogenous mutation in p53 (R273H). We knocked down this mutp53 (using sirna for p53) and then treated with low doses of TNFa to detect any differential transcription regulation governed by mutp53.

DESIGN
A total of 7 samples, 3 of them were duplicated
