TITLE
H3K9 Trimethylation Silences Fas Expression to Confer Colon Carcinoma Immune Escape and 5-Fluorouracil Chemoresistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have determined that verticillin A is a histone methyltransfease inhibitor that selectively inhibits human SUV39H1, SUV39H2, G9a and GLP to inhibit H3K9 methylation in human colon cancer cells. The objective here is to identify verticillin A target genes in human colon cancer cells.

DESIGN
5-FU-resistant human colon carcinoma cell lines LS411N-5FU-R was established from the metastatic human colon carcinoma cell line LS411N. LS411N-5FU-R cells were cultured in the absence or presence of verticillin A (50 nM) for 3 days and used for RNA lsolation. DNA microarray analysis was done in replicates in the Georgia Regents University Cancer Center Genomic Core Facility.
