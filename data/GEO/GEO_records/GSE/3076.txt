TITLE
Impact of Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay on the Global Expression Profile of Budding Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Isogenic UPF1+ or upf1- yeast strains were treated with 10 ug/ml thiolutin to inhibit global transcription.  Targets were obtained from 16 time points: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60 minutes after transcription inhibition. Three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix YG-S98 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with differential expression over time between UPF1+ and upf1-. Keywords: time course
