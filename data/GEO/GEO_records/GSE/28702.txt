TITLE
CRC samples for FOLFOX therapy prediction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify responders to FOLFOX therapy by applying the Random Forests (RF) algorithm to gene expression data. Eighty-three unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC) patients including 42 responders and 41 non-responders were divided into training (54 patients) and test (29 patients) sets.

DESIGN
Samples were divided (approximately 2:1 ratio) into training and test sets. As a result, 54 of 83 samples obtained in the first half of this period were selected for the training set, and the remaining 29 samples in the latter half were selected as the test set.
