TITLE
Integrator orchestrates RAS/ERK1/2 signaling transcriptional programs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the occupancy of RNA PolII and INTS11 during the stimulation of EGF and compared with drug treated condition using inhibitors against MAPK pathway and Integrator. Additionally, we examined transcription by sequencing the chromatin-bound fraction of RNA.

DESIGN
We employed several cel lines in our experiment, including HELA, KRAS mutant lung cancer cell line A549 and BRAF mutatant melanoma cell line A375.  The conditons we  checked including EGF stimulation, MAPK pathway inhibition using BRAF, MEK or ERK inhibitiors, targeting INTS11 with RNAi or integrator inhibitor.  We used RNA sequencing to measure the expression profile and CHIP sequencing to detect INTS11 and RNA PolII recruitment on chromatin.
