TITLE
A profile of murine gastric epithelial cells:  Parietal, Zymogenic, Pit

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Continuous regeneration of digestive enzyme (zymogen) secreting chief cells is a normal aspect of stomach function that is disrupted in pre-cancerous lesions. Regulation of zymogenic cell (ZC) differentiation is poorly understood.  Here we profile Parietal, Pit, and Zymogenic cells for comparison and study. Keywords: Bhlhb8, Mist1, mucous neck cell, laser-capture microdissection, zymogenic, gastric cell differentiation
