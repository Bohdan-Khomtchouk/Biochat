SUMMARY
Coordinated regulation of gene expression levels across a series of experimental conditions provides valuable information about the functions of correlated transcripts. To map gene regulatory pathways, we used microarray-derived gene expression measurements in 60 individuals of an F2 sample segregating for diabetes. We performed correlation analysis among ~40,000 expression traits. By combining correlation among expression traits and linkage mapping information, we were able to identify regulatory networks, make functional predictions to uncharacterized genes, and characterize novel members of known pathways. Using 36 seed traits, we found evidence of coordinate regulation of 160 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway expression traits. Of the 160 traits, 50 had their major LOD peak within 8 cM of a locus on chromosome 2, and 81 others had a secondary peak in this region. A previously uncharacterized Riken cDNA clone, which showed strong correlation with stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 expression, was experimentally validated to be responsive to conditions that regulate lipid metabolism. Using linkage mapping, we identified multiple genes whose expression is under the control of transcription regulatory loci. Trait-correlation combined with linkage mapping can reveal regulatory networks that would otherwise be missed if we only studied mRNA traits with statistically significant linkages in this small cross. The combined analysis is more sensitive compared with linkage mapping only. References: Kendziorski C., M. Chen, M. Yuan, H. Lan, and A.D. Attie.
