TITLE
Gene expression profiling in cardiac AngII-overexpressing mice (TG1306/1R)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy in TG1306/1R transgenic mice with cardiac angiotensin II overproduction leads to a gradual transition from a compensatory hypertrophic state to heart failure. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that play a role in maintaining cardiac integrity in the diseased heart, we performed a comparative study of gene expression between wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) hearts using microarray analysis. TG1306/1R transgenics were separated into two phenotypic groups (hypertrophic and dilated) based on morphological parameters (cardiac weight index and histology) and either a moderate (hypertrophic) or a high (dilated) upregulation of molecular markers for hypertrophy and failure, and compared to age and sex-matched wild-types.
