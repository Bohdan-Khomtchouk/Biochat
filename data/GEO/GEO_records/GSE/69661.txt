TITLE
The function of ERRalpha in viral infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the function of ERRalpha in viral infection, we compared the cDNA expression profile of ERRalpha knockdown 293T cells and control 293T cells.  The cells infected with VSV for 12 h or left uninfected were collected and RNA was extracted by Trizol.

DESIGN
Viral infection induced gene expression in ERRalpha knockdown 293T cells or control  293T cells were measured at 0 and 12 hours.
