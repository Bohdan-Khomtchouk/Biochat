TITLE
MicroRNAs differentially present in the plasma of HIV elite controllers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Elite controllers maintain HIV-1 viral loads below the limit of detection. The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and some of them modulate HIV infection, we have studied the miRNA profile in plasma from HIV elite controllers and chronically infected individuals and compared against healthy donors. Several miRNAs correlate with CD4+ T cell count or with the known time of infection. No significant differences were observed between elite controllers and healthy donors; however, 16 miRNAs were different in the plasma of chronic infected versus healthy donors. In addition, levels of hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-33a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p were higher in plasma from elite controllers than chronic infected and hsa-miR-29b-3p and hsa-miR-33a-5p overexpression significantly reduced the viral production in MT2 cells. Therefore, levels of circulating miRNAs might be of diagnostic and/or prognostic value for HIV infection. Additionally, hsa-miR-29b-3p and miR-33a-5p may be used in therapeutic strategies.

DESIGN
An exploratory cross-sectional study of microRNA levels in EDTA plasma samples. Plasma samples were obtained from 24 subjects and were classified in 3 groups, 9 Elite Controllers (defined as individuals with plasma viral load (PVL) < 50 copies/ml, CD4 count > 350/ml), 9 chronic HIV patients (CH) under anti-retroviral treatment and 6 healthy HIV negative donors (HD). This study was approved by the Huésped Foundation Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
