TITLE
Variability in Small Airway Epithelial Gene Expression Among Normal Smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite overwhelming data that cigarette smoking causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), only a minority of chronic smokers are affected, strongly suggesting that genetic factors modify susceptibility to this disease. We hypothesized that there are individual variations in the response to cigarette smoking, with variability among smokers in expression levels of protective / susceptibility genes. Affymetrix arrays and TaqMan PCR were used to assess the variability of gene expression in the small airway epithelium obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of 18 normal non-smokers, 18 normal smokers and 18 smokers with COPD. We identified 201 probesets representing 150 smoking-responsive genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated, and assessed the coefficient of variation in expression levels among the study population. Variation was a reproducible property of each gene as assessed by different microarray probesets and realtime PCR and was observed in both normal smokers and smokers with COPD. There was greater individual variability in smokers with COPD than in normal smokers. The majority of these highly variable smoking responsive genes were in the functional categories of signal transduction, xenobiotic degradation, metabolism, transport, oxidant-related and transcription. A similar pattern of the same highly variable genes was observed in an independent data set.We propose that there is likely genetic diversity within this subset of genes with highly variable individual to individual responses of the small airway epithelium to smoking, and this subset of genes represent putative candidates for assessment of susceptibility/protection from disease for future gene-based epidemiological studies for the risk of smokers for COPD.
