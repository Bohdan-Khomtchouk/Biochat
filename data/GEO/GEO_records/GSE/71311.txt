TITLE
DNA methylation proﬁling in GC-2 cells following  2×10-5M diethylstilbestrol exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation expression has been related to diethylstilbestrol exposure, but little is known about effect of diethylstilbestrol exposure on DNA methylation in male reproductive system. To identify DNA methylation varied in GC2 cells treated with DMSO and diethylstilbestrol, we performed Gene promoter methylation using an Affymetrix Mouse Promoter 1.0R Array to analysis different DNA methylation pattern.

DESIGN
Mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells were treated with 2×10-5M diethylstilbestrol for 72h, and DMSO was added to control cells. DNA methylation expression was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Promoter 1.0R Array.
