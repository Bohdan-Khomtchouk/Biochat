TITLE
Gene expression profiling in wear-particle induced and infectious endoprosthesis loosening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify markers for the early diagnosis of endoprosthesis loosening, for the differentiation between wear-particle induced and septic loosening, as well as to gather new insights into the pathogenesis. 824 genes were differentially expressed with a fold change greater than 2. Among these were Chitinase 1, CD52, Calpain 3, Apolipoprotein, CD18, Lysyl oxidase, Cathepsin D, E-Cadherin, VE-Cadherin, Nidogen, Angiopoietin 1 and Thrombospondin 2, and the differential expression levels were validated by RT-PCR. The chitinase activity was significantly higher in the blood from patients with wear-particle induced prosthesis loosening (p=0.001). However, using chitinase activity as a marker for early diagnosis, it has a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of only 52%, due to a high variability both in the disease and in the control group. Keywords: Tissue type comparison, disease state analysis, search for new biomarkers

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from 5 periprosthetic membranes of wear-particle induced and 5 of infectious (septic) type using Affymetrix HG U133A oligonucleotide microarrays. The results of selected differentially expressed genes were validated by RT-PCR (n=30). The enzyme activity and the genotype of chitinase-1 were assessed in serum samples from 313 consecutive patients hospitalized for endoprosthesis loosening (n=54) or for other reasons, serving as control subjects (n=259).
