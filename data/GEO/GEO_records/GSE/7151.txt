TITLE
Whole-genome transcriptional profiles of SGIV both in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Iridovirus

SUMMARY
Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is the major agent that causes severe iridovirus diseases in grouper maricluture. Based on the genomic information, a DNA microarray, containing probes corresponding to 162 putative SGIV open reading frames (ORFs), was constructed to map the viral gene transcriptional profiles over the time course by establishing the models of SGIV-infected GS cells and SGIV-infected grouper. All the data from real-time RT-PCR, RT-PCR and dilution RT-PCR assays were confirmed with the findings of microarrays, which were clustered into groups with the similarity expression profiles by the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) approach. The microarray analysis showed that SGIV had big differential expression profiles in the special infected cells and organ and the viral DNA replication mechanisms were firstly prevented as an important strategy of the host defense during the natural course infection.Our studies firstly uncover the relative of a marine viral gene expression patterns between in vitro and in vivo infection, which provides a better understanding of SGIV transcription regulation and a greater degree shared with other iridoviruses on their repliaction and pathogenesis. Keywords: time course
