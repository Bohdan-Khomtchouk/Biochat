TITLE
Gene expression in near isogenic spring wheat lines carrying different combinaison of the FHB resistance QTLs 2DL, 3BS and 5A during early infection with Fusarium graminearum, the major causal agent of fusarium head blight in wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease of cereal crops caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg). FHB affects the flowering heads (or spikes).  This study compare the gene expression profile in wheat spikelets from near isogenic spring wheat lines carrying different combinaison of the FHB resistance QTLs 2DL, 3BS and 5A, after inoculation with water (H2O) or Fg; the point inoculation method was used.

DESIGN
We used the Affymetrix wheat array to compare wheat spikelets from the near isogenic spring wheat lines (all sister lines) 2890 (null for FHB resistance QTLs 2DL, 3BS and 5A), 2618 (carrying 2DL QTL; null for QTLs 3BS, 5A), 2598 (carrying 3BS QTL; null for QTLs 2DL, 5A), 2543 (carrying 2DL and 3BS QTLs; null for QTL 5A), 2557 (carrying 2DL and 5A QTLs; null for QTL 3BS), and 2614 (carrying 2DL, 3BS and 5A QTLs), after inoculation with water (H2O) or Fg.  the point inoculation method was used.  Samplings were done at 4 days (d) after inoculation, for 2 or 3 biological replicates.
