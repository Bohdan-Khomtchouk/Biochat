TITLE
Identification of target genes of tumor suppressor microRNAs in human cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify target genes of tumor suppressive microRNAs in human cancer, several cell lines (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays. miR-517a, miR-218, miR-145, miR-1 and miR-874 function as tumor suppressors.

DESIGN
Human cancer cell lines (BOY, T24, A498, PC3, DU145, FaDu, SAS, HSC3, IMC3) were transfected with miRNAs (miR-517a, miR-218, miR-145, miR-1, miR-874). The miRNA-transfected human cancer cell lines were compared to control cell lines.
