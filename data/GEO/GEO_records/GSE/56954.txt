TITLE
A687V EZH2 is a driver of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) hyper-trimethylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes were analyzed in 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines treated with the GSK126 EZH2 inhibitor using  Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Two ALL cell lines (SUP-B8, NALM-6) were treated with DMSO (control) or GSK126 at 0.5 uM for 72 hours. Two biological replicates are included for each treatment group.
