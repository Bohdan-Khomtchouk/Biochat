TITLE
Reciprocal Regulation between the Circadian Clock and Hypoxic Signaling in Mammals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We propose that the clock plays an important role in fine-tuning the hypoxic response under pathophysiological conditions, which can serve as a strategy to reduce the severity of fatal hypoxia-related diseases.

DESIGN
RNA-seq  between wildtype and mutant MEF cells and Chip-seq in U2OS cells

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
