TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis GR-REVOLUTA and KANADI1-GR transgenic seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The REVOLUTA and KANADI1 transcription factors act in opposite directions to control polarity in Arabidopsis. By analyzing mRNA profiles following activation of REVOLUTA or KANADI1 proteins we identified genes regulated by both transcription factors, focusing on those regulated in opposite directions.

DESIGN
To coordinate transcriptional responses for microarray analysis, we constructed transgenic seedlings with the REV or KAN1 transcription factor fused to a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) domain. The GR domain tethers the transcription factor in the cytoplasm, and treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) allows movement into the nucleus. Transgenic seedlings and wild-type controls were grown simultaneously in liquid culture, treated with dexamethasone for 0min, 30min, 60min, or 120min, and total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays. Treatment: Dexamethasone Biological replicates
