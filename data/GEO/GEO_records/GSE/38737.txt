TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling analysis of a SMC6 mutant mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The function of the SMC5-6 complex is less clear, but it has an important role in a variety of different DNA repair processes and in resolving recombination structures. Interestingly mutation at a highly conserved residue (Ser994) in the ATP hydrolysis motif in the SMC6 C-terminal domain, resulted in mice with a mild phenotype.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from homozygote 4 male mutant mice was compared to 2-4 wild type or 2 heterozygote controls.
