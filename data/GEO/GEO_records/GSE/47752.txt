TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of dentate granule cells in 4 rat epilepsy models

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Global expression profiling of epileptogenesis has been confounded by variability across laboratories, epilepsy models, tissue sampled and experimental platforms, with the result that very few genes demonstrate consistent expression changes.  The present study minimizes these confounds by combining Affymetrix microarray datasets from seven laboratories, using three status epilepticus (SE) models of epilepsy in rats (pilocarpine, kainate, self-sustained SE or SSSE) and the rat kindling model. Total RNA was harvested from laser-captured dentate granule cells from 6 rats at three times during the early-to-mid latent phase that precedes epilepsy symptoms in the SE models (1, 3 and 10 days after SE), or 24 hr after the first stage 2, stage 4 and stage 5 seizure in the kindling model. Each epilepsy model was studied in two independent laboratories except SSSE. The initial goals of this study were to a) identify model-independent transcriptional changes in dentate granule cells that could point to novel intervention targets for epileptogenesis, b) characterize the basal transcriptional profile of dentate granule cells, and c) identify genes that have highly variable expression.

DESIGN
Each experimental group consists of 6 rats (biological replicates) from one laboratory at a single time point, except for the SSSE group (6 at day 1 after SSSE, 5 controls and at day 3 after SSSE, 4 at day 10). Thus granule cells were harvested from 164 rats.
