TITLE
Genome-Wide Analysis of Somatic Copy Number Alterations and Gene Expression in Metastatic Melanoma: RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All cancers are diseases of the genome. A combination of somatic point mutations, focal amplifications and deletions, and chromosome level aberrations conspire to disrupt gene expression and the interplay between signaling pathways that control normal growth and tissue homeostasis. Here we investigate transcript levels in 7 melanomas and a pool of melanocytes.

DESIGN
The transcriptome from 7 cutaneous melanomas and a pool of 2 normal melanocyte cultures was sequenced using the 454 technology

PLATFORM
GPL9186 454 GS FLX (Homo sapiens)
