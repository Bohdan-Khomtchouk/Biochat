TITLE
Gene expression and functional annotation of choroid plexus epithelium failure in Alzheimer disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression of the human CPE in Braak stadia 0, 3 and 6.We isolated CPE cells with laser dissection microscopy from healthy human donor choroid plexus tissues and from human choroid plexus tissue from brains that were post-mortem staged in Braak 3 and Braak 6 Alzheimer disease stages . Next, we performed RNA isolation, amplification, labeling and hybridization against 44k Agilent microarrays.

DESIGN
We performed the microarrays against a common reference sample, namely human RPE/choroid RNA. We performed 7 replicates of human CPE-Braak-0 (healthy) samples from 7 different donors, 7 replicates of human CPE-Braak-3 from 7 different donors and 7 replicates of human CPE-Braak-6 from 7 different donors.
