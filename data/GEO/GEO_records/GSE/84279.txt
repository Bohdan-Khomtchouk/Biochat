TITLE
Linkages between 3D genome organization and transcriptome during muscle cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to interrogate the interrelationship between 3D genome organization and global gene expression during muscle development using a mouse C2C12 cell line as an in vitro model. The C2C12 cell line is a well-established and extensively studied in vitro model derived from serial passage of myoblasts cultured from the thigh muscle of C3H mice after a crush injury. C2C12 cells divide when mitogens are present in the culture medium and spontaneously differentiate into muscle-like multinucleated (myotubes) cells if the medium is depleted of mitogens (i.e. serum; (Bischoff 1986)).

DESIGN
C2C12 cells were either harvested as: 1) proliferating myoblasts (Myoblasts); 2) myotubes that were not treated with AraC (as such these myotubes contained myoblasts) - Myotubes(Day3); or 3) myotubes which were treated with AraC (myoblasts were largely depleted from these myotube cultures; Myotubes(Day7+AraC).
