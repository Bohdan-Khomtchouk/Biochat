TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Chinese mininature pig liver tissue following clenbuterol administration

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Clenbuterol-HCL can greatly reduce fat deposition and increase skeletal muscle growth at high dosages. In order to advance our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms, Genechips were used to study the differential gene expression profiles of liver tissues among the pigs with/without Clenbuterol-HCL. Differentially expressed genes identified will be the candidates for further investigations on the molecular mechanisms involved in Clenbuterol-HCL of exerting repartition effects on adipose and skeletal muscle tissue.
