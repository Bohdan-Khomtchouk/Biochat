TITLE
Expression data from Burkitt Lymphoma cell lines followed by expression or inhibition of ebv-BART6-3p microRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus is associated with several human malignancies, including Burkitt Lymnphoma. The virus encodes more than 40 microRNAs, which participate in its possible pathogenetic role. We used microarrays to study the effect of the expression of an Epstein-Barr virus-encoded microRNA (ebv-BART6-3p) on the global gene expression profile of Burkitt Lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
In order to determine the BART6-3p targets, EBV-negative Akata 2A8 or EBV-positive Akata cells were transiently transfected (in duplicates) with synthetic BART6-3p mimic or inhibitor (100 nM; Custom synthesized by Dharmacon- Thermo Scientific, Germany), respectively. For each treatment, a further transfection with corresponding negative control was performed as well (10 nM; I-300145-01, Dharmacon- Thermo Scientific, Germany). The transfection of 5,000,000 cells per treatment was performed by Amaxa nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne-Germany), using the program G23 and the transfection solution V according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection efficiency was assessed by means of a further treatment (2µg of pmaxGFP) and detection of both fluorescence and cell viability by flow cytometry. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using Trizol, and transfection efficiency was further confirmed by evaluating the expression level of BART6-3p using q-PCR by means of Taqman probes, employing RNU43 as housekeeping miRNA (Applied Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). RNA was further hybridized to HuGene-2.0-st array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
