TITLE
Expression data from leaf of Arabidopsis TGS mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in Arabidopsis is regulated by two distinct pathways, DNA methylation-dependent and –independent. ddm1 and mom1 mutants are defective in the DNA-dependent and –independent pathway, respectively. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression in the TGS mutants Keywords: TGS mutants

DESIGN
We sought to obtain differential gene expression in each mutant in order to characterize the effect of deficiency in two distinct TGS pathways. To that end, we took mutants that regulate TGS by DNA methylation-dependent (ddm1) and -independent (mom1) pathways, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of these mutants and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix Arabidopsis 8K microarrays.
