TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in myocardial tissue by caloric restriction initiated in different aged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we assessed the effect of CR, beginning in different ages, on modulating miRNAs expression in the heart and found miRNAs were related to cardiac aging and changed differently after 3 months CR during aging.

DESIGN
In this study, 6 samples from young, middle-aged, and old mice with or without caloric restriction (CR) were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling thus to elucidate the possible molecular pathways underlying the observed different effects of CR on cardiac aging.
