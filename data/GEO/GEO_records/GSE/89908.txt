TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in myocardial tissue by caloric restriction initiated in different aged mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we assessed the effect of CR, beginning in different ages, on modulating miRNAs expression in the heart and found miRNAs were related to cardiac aging and changed differently after 3 months CR during aging.
