TITLE
Identification of genes that are differentially expressed in alt1 and WT

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
we characterized the rice alkaline tolerant mutant, alt1. Map-based cloning revealed that alt1 harbors a mutation in a putative chromatin remodeling ATPase gene. ALT1-RNAi transgenic plants mimicked the alt1 phenotype, exhibiting tolerance to alkali stress in a transcript dosage-dependent manner. We found that the predicted ALT1 protein belonged to the Ris1 subgroup of the Snf2 family and was localized in the nucleus. qRT-PCR analysis showed that ALT1 was predominantly expressed in leaf blades and sheaths, and that ALT1 transcription was rapidly suppressed after alkaline treatment. These results support the notion that ALT1 is a negative regulator of alkaline tolerance. Roots of two-leaf stage alt1 and WT seedlings grown under normal conditions were sampled for microarray analysis. The transcriptomic profiles were investigated using an Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4Ã—44 K Microarray (Agilent Technology) containing 32,325 probes corresponding to cDNA, 6,934 probes corresponding to expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and 2,612 probes corresponding to gene predicted loci, respectively, with three independent biological replicates.
