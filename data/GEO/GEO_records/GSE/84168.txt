TITLE
Identification of a novel long-range enhancer driving Sonic Hedgehog expression in neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A novel long-range enhancer for Shh - Shh-Brain-Enhancer-6 (SBE6) â€“ that is located 100kb upstream of Shh and that is required for the proper induction of Shh expression during neural differentiation ChIP-on-chip for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in ESCs and NPCs showed a gain of these two enhancer marks in NPCs at SBE6 which identified this sequence as having potential enhancer activity.

DESIGN
Comparison of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac profiles between ESCs and NPCs at the Shh locus
