TITLE
Integrated approach to explore the mechanisms of aromatase inhibition and recovery on fathead minnow ovaries

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
Aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis and is responsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogens. Here, we used an integrated approach to better understand the effects of aromatase inhibition as well as the mechanisms involved in the adaptation and recovery process. We exposed female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to 30 μg/L of a model aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole, during 8 days (exposure phase). Fish were then held in clean water for 8 more days (recovery phase). Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 8 days of both the exposure and the recovery phase. We used transcriptomics, metabolomics, and network inference to understand changes and infer connections at the transcript and metabolite level in the ovary. Other apical endpoints such as plasma estradiol, testosterone, and vitellogenin levels were also measured. An integrated analysis of the data revealed changes in gene expression consistent with increased testosterone. Metabolites such as glycogen and taurine were strongly correlated with increased testosterone levels.  Comparison of in vivo and ex vivo data suggested the accumulation of steroidogenic enzymes, including aromatase, as a mechanism to compensate for aromatase inhibition.
