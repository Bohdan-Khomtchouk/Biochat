TITLE
Parkinson's disease-associated DJ-1 is required for the expression of GDNF receptor Ret in human neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DJ-1 is an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase that may act as a redox-dependent chaperone and a regulator of transcription. To explore DJ-1-mediated transcriptional control in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), we generated human neuroblastoma cells with inducible knock-down of DJ-1 expression. We then used functional genomic techniques to identify novel pathways dysregulated by loss of DJ-1 function. Using microarray gene expression profiling, we found that DJ-1 silencing alters the expression of 26 genes, with 10 down-regulated and 16 up-regulated transcripts. Among the down-regulated genes we found Ret, tyrosine kinase receptor for the neurotrophic factor GDNF. Taking advantage of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, we identified hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1a) as a possible mediator of the interplay between DJ-1 and Ret. We show that Hif1a is stabilized in the absence of DJ-1, and that loss of DJ-1 generates hypoxia and accumulation of free radical species (ROS). Overexpression of wt DJ-1, but not of C106A and L166P mutants deficient in ROS scavenger activity, rescues Ret expression in neuroblastoma cells. These findings reveal novel players in PD pathogenesis and provide evidence for additional pathways involved in DJ-1-mediated neurodegeneration.

DESIGN
Comparison between DJ-1-silenced human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and control cells. Two clones were selected for each condition, and each clone was analyzed in duplicate, for a total of 8 samples.
