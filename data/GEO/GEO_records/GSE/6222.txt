TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns in human liver cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of liver cancer progression and metastasis, we did expression profiling of human liver cancer and benign tissues. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human liver cancer at various stages (T1-1~4, T3-1~6), 2 normal human livers and HuH7 cell line. Genes showed differentially up- or downregulated by two-fold with respect to the normal human livers were identified using GeneSpring software version 7.2 (Silicon Genetics, Agilent Technologies).
