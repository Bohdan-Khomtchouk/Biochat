TITLE
Expression data in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with siATM, sip53 or control (SiNC) siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase regulates the DNA damage response and is associated with cancer suppression. Here, we used microarray to study global transcriptomic expression to identify tumor-promoting functions of ATM.

DESIGN
Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with siATM, sip53 or control siRNA followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
