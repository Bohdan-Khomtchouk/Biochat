TITLE
SAMHD1 degrades nascent DNA at stalled Forks to promote replication restart

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SAMHD1 is a triphosphohydrolase and a 3'-5' exonuclease that restricts HIV-1 infection in non-cycling cells. It is also mutated in the Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) and in different cancers, including chronic lymphotic leukemia. We report herre that SAMHD1 localizes to DNA replication foci during S phase suggesting that it is involved in DNA synthesis. Using microarray analysis, we examine the replication timing program an we show that SAMHD1 regulates the fork progression but also the replication timing program.

DESIGN
Two experimen tal condition : shRNA LUC cells (control) versus shRNA SAMHD1 cells
