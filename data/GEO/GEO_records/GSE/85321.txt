TITLE
mRNA sequencing of wildtype and jhd2-delete strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA expression in WT and jhd2Î” cells in various nutritional sources

DESIGN
Strand-specific total RNA was sequenced (Illumina stranded TruSeq, with dUTP second strand-incorporation) from wildtype and mutants cells, in biological replicates, normalized by RNA spike-in controls
