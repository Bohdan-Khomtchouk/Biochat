TITLE
Array analysis of wound induced hair neogenesis (early stage)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Mice were wounded and skin samples of the scar  collected on the day of wound closure. We compared Mixed mice (B6/FVB/SJL), a strain of  high regeneration, versus  C57bl mice, a strain of low regeneration.

DESIGN
Whole skin  biopsies of wound scars were submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 4 mice each of 2 distinct strains of differing regeneration levels were collected.
