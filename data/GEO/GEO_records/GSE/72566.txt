TITLE
Induction of insulin gene transcription by Gli-similar Krüppel-like zinc finger protein 3, Glis3, in αTC1-9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined the effect of  Glis3 on the transcriptional activation of  gene expression, including insulin gene, in pancreatic α-cell line, αTC1-9,  which do not express the insulin gene. We demonstrate that Glis3 induces the transcription of the insulin and identified a number of other genes that are induced by Glis3.

DESIGN
Using ChIP-Seq we map the genome-wide sites with which Glis3 is associated. From this the consesus Glis3 binding site was calculated. This study shows that Glis3 is recruited to the proximal promoter of the insuln gene inthe pancreatic α-cell line, αTC1-9.
