TITLE
Human respiratory and stool specimens used to detect cardioviruses

ORGANISM
Viruses

SUMMARY
Cardioviruses are a genus of picornaviruses that cause severe illnesses in rodents, but little is known about the prevalence, diversity, or spectrum of disease of such agents among humans.  We report the identification of a group of human cardioviruses that have been detected and cloned directly from patient specimens (Chiu and DeRisi, et al, PNAS, 2008).  This series includes 9 arrays (both raw and normalized data) used to detect cardioviruses in human respiratory and stool specimens.  The arrays employed here are capable of pan-viral detection (Wang and DeRisi, et al., PNAS, 2002). Keywords: viral detection, cardiovirus, TMEV, gastroenteritis

DESIGN
The series includes 3 arrays from respiratory samples and 6 arrays from stool samples.  Among the 3 arrays from respiratory sample, 1 array has a signature for an adenovirus, 1 array has a signature for human metapneumovirus, and 1 array has a signature for cardiovirus UC1 (see Chiu and DeRisi, et al., PNAS, in 2008).  All 6 arrays from stool samples are cardiovirus-positive; some show evidence of dual infection with other gastroenteritis viruses (i.e. norovirus, rotavirus, etc.). Data in Sample records fed to E-Predict (Urisman, et al, Genome Biology, 2005) E-Predict normalization metrics Array Normalization: Sum E-Matrix Normalization: Quadratic Distance Metric: Pearson Uncentered
