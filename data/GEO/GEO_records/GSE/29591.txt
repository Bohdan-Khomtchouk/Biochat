TITLE
SG200 vs. SG200 delta-tup1

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
We use this array to determine genes under the control of the transcriptional regulator Tup1

DESIGN
We have compare the overal gene expression in wild type strain in compare to a mutant harbouring Tup1 deletion. Cells were grown on charcoal containing minimal media for 48h before total RNA extraction.
