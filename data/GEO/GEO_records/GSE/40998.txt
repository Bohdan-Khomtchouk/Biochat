TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis flowers under drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We also used microarray analysis to examine transcriptomic changes under drought, identifying thousands of genes that potentially mediate drought responses in the flower, including genes encoding transcription factors that likely play crucial regulatory roles.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased sharply and, after about 80 hours (defined as day 3 for drought treatment), the relative soil moisture content was near 35% of the soil water-holding capacity. The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water-holding capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened flower samples were collected, from both treated and control plants, at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10.
