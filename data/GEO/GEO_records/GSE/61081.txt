TITLE
Dilution and amplification control study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse adult female brain’s cortex (C57BL/6, Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) was isolated and stored immediately at -80°C. Subsequently, the mRNA (15µg) was isolated using TRIzol Reagent and MicroFastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen). A Sample of 5µg was assessed on Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 array. Aliquots from the leftovers of the same cortical mRNA were diluted to single-cell RNA levels (0.1, 1, and 10 pg) and independently aRNA amplified for a total of 2 and 4 rounds and assessed on Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 arrays.

DESIGN
A Sample of 5µg of mRNA was assessed on Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 array. Aliquots from the leftovers of the same cortical mRNA were diluted to single-cell RNA levels (0.1, 1, and 10 pg) and independently amplified, as described above, for a total of 2 and 4 rounds and assessed on Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 arrays.
