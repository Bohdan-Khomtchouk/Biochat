TITLE
Target of Ascl1 in CG4 cell

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify the downstream targets of transcription factor Ascl1, transcriptional profiling of rat glial cell line, CG4 cell, transfected with either Ascl1 or mock control was performed.

DESIGN
Comparison was performed between Ascl1 overexpressing CG4 cell and mock control transduced cell on 3D-Gene rat mRNA oligo 12k chip. Biological replication was not prepared. The results were confirmed by real time RT-PCR in several genes.
