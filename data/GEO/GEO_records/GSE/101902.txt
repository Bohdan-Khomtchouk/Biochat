TITLE
RNA-sequencing of GFP+ cells 2 days post-transduction of LSK cells with Scr or miR-99 KD lentiviral vectors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We FACS purified GFP+ cells 2 days post-transduction of LSK (Lin-Negative c-Kit+ Sca1+) cells with miR-99 KD and Scr lentiviral vectors and performed RNA-sequencing; this allowed us to identify potential miR-99 target genes for inclusion in the shRNA library

DESIGN
FACS purification of Scr and miR-99 KD GFP+ cells 2 days after infection, with two to three replicates per experimental group

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
