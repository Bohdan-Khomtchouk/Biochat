TITLE
Massive parallel sequencing uncovers actionable FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion and ARAF mutations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. By performing RNA- and exome sequencing analyses we have discovered a novel fusion event, FGFR2-PPHLN1 (16%), and damaging mutations in the ARAF oncogene (11%).

DESIGN
Methods: mRNA and gDNA were exctracted from fresh frozen tumor tissues and corresponding normal tissue (n=8 pairs) from patients with iCCA who underwent surgical resection. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 System with 100 nucleotide single-end reads. One sample and its paired non-tumoral tissue were eliminated from the subsequent analysis because of bad RNa quality. The same 8 paired tumors were also analyzed by whole-exome seq. *** Submitter confirms there are no patient privacy concerns with these data. ***
