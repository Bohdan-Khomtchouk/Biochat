TITLE
Antiviral RNA interference in mammalian cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Plants and invertebrates protect themselves from viruses through RNA interference (RNAi), yet it remains unknown whether this defense mechanism exists in mammals. Antiviral RNAi involves the processing of viral long double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the ribonuclease (RNAse) III Dicer. These siRNAs are incorporated into effector complex(es) containing members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family and guide silencing of complementary target viral RNAs. Here, we detect the accumulation of phased Dicer-dependent virus-derived siRNA (viRNAs) and demonstrate their loading into Ago2 after infection of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). We further show that the production of these viRNAs is drastically reduced, yet not completely abolished, if ES cells are first induced to differentiate before infection. Finally, we reveal that the mammalian virus Nodamura virus (NoV) encodes for a protein that counteracts such antiviral RNAi in ES cells supporting the existence of an effective RNAi-based immunity in mammals.

DESIGN
Infection of wild-type or mutant mouse ES cells and analysis of small RNAs from total extracts or immunoprecipitated components of the RNAi pathway
