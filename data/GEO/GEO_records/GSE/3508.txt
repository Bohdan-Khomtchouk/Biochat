TITLE
Transcript copy number estimation using a mouse whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray (22k Linearity)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E12.5 mouse whole embryo and E12.5 placenta total RNA were pooled to create 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 ratio mixtures, based on Bioanalyzer quantitation.  These samples, along with the original unmixed RNAs, were used as templates for duplicate linear amplification labeling reactions. cRNA target mixtures were hybridized against a Universal Mouse Reference (Stratagene).  Pairwise comparison using the NIA Microarray Analysis (ANOVA) software produced log ratios, which were compared to the expected log ratios for genes showing statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) differential expression between unmixed embryo and placenta. Keywords: cell type comparison design,development or differentiation design,normalization testing design,reference design
