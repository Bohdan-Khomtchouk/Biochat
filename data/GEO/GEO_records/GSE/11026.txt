TITLE
Wind-responsive changes in poplar leaves of different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Populus nigra

SUMMARY
A developmental series of wind-treated Populus leaf tissue was subjected to array analyses in order to address the issue of age-dependent responsiveness to environmental changes. The following developmental stages were defined for the experiment: Y – “youngest leaf” including the shoot tip = smallest fully enrolled leaf; E – “expanded leaf” = oldest leaf that had not reached full leaf thickness; M – “mature leaf” = 5th leaf below E = has reached full leaf expansion and full leaf thickness; O – “old leaf” = 5th leaf below E. Keywords: transcription profiling

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control (K) vs. Wind-treated (W) leaves. Biological replicates: 3 control (1-3), wind-exposed (1-3), independently grown and harvested. One swap replicate per array.
