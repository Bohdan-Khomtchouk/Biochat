TITLE
Comparsion of gene expression profile in polaris (pola) mutant lines and its POLARIS (POLA) wild-type at meiotic and ripening stages

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To assess the role of POLA in relation to ovule development, embryogenesis and endosperm development, we analyzed gene expression profiles by using microarray. Compared to the wild-type plants, several groups of transcription factors in the pola mutant plants and POLA RNAi lines showed up- or down-regulation at meiotic stage and ripening stages of floral development. Specifically, we confirmed significant changes of up- or down-regulation in some genes required for several biological processes, such as biosynthesis, transport, signal transduction, and degeneration of hormone, sugar, starch, fatty and lipid, protein and amino acid. These results supported that MADS protein POLA could function both as a transcriptional activator and repressor, directly and/or indirectly interacted with dozens of potential target genes involved in  developmental and hormonal pathways.

DESIGN
To perform microarray analysis, the samples were pooled by 20 panicles from 10 individual plants at meiotic and ripening stage. For meiotic stage RNA sample, panicle of pola mutant were prepared at early to late meiotic stage, and panicle of POLA RNAi line(T2) were prepared at ten to fifteen days after pollination stage for ripening stage RNA sample.
