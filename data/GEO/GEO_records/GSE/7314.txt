TITLE
Expression data from non-infected and Salmonella Choleraesuis infected mesenteric lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To understand the host transcriptional response to S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), the first generation Affymetrix porcine GeneChip® was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the mesenteric lymph nodes responding to infection at acute (8 hours (h), 24h, 48h post-inoculation (pi)) and chronic stages (21 days (d) pi) The objectives of this study were to identify and examine the stereotypical gene expression response within the host mesenteric lymph nodes to S. Choleraesuis infection, and to characterize the global host responses by revealing the specific features of the host’s innate immunity. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Fifteen piglets from Salmonella spp.-free sows were weaned at 10 days (d) of age, shipped to the National Animal Disease Center, Ames, IA and raised in isolation facilities. To confirm that all piglets were free of Salmonella spp. prior to challenge, bacteriological cultures were performed on rectal swabs twice. Seven week old pigs were randomly divided into 2 groups,  3 non-infected pigs and 12 infected pigs. Three non-infected control pigs were necropsied 3 days prior to experimental infection. On day 0, pigs in the infected groups were intranasally challenged with 1 billion CFU of Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis x3246. Three infected pigs were necropsied at 8 hours post-inoculation (hpi), 24 hpi, 48 hpi and 21 day post-inoculation (dpi). Tissue samples from the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation.
