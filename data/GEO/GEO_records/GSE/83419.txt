TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of Guanylate Cyclase Soluble Subunit Beta-3 (GUCY1B3 or sGCβ1) binding to chromatin DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify sGCβ1 binding sites to chromatin DNA, we performed ChIP analysis by using anti-sGCβ1 antibody (Sigma G4405). We have successfully identified 4169 intervals. In this study, sGCβ1 was found to bind to many genes' promoter region.

DESIGN
We used U-87 MG (ATCC® HTB-14) glioma cells which overexpress sGCβ1 (generated by us) to perform ChIP assay by using anti-sGCβ1 antibody (Sigma G4405) and genome-wide sGCβ1 binding was determined with sequencing. The ChIP DNA was processed into a standard Illumina ChIP-Seq library and sequence. The 75-nt sequence reads generated by Illumina sequencing (using NextSeq 500) are mapped to the hg19 genome using the BWA algorithm with default settings. Only reads that pass Illumina’s purity filter, align with no more than 2 mismatches, and map uniquely to the genome are used in the subsequent analysis. Intervals (= Peaks) were determined using the MACS peak finding algorithm.
