TITLE
miRNA profiling of GFAP+ cells isolated from GBM and adjacent non-tumor glial brain tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs expression changes in human gliomas, we conducted a comprehensive microarray analysis to compare miRNA expression profiles in primary cells obtained from matched pairs of GBM and adjacent non-tumor brain tissues from 6 patients.

DESIGN
Paired primary glioma cells and astrocytes, isolated from GBM tissues andperipheral non-tumor glial brain tissues, respectively, with each pair prepared from a same patient, were established for primary culture. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to microarrays overnight at 65°C.
