TITLE
Expression analysis of fast-fermenting high-gravity maltose Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y55 mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in three S. cerevisiae Y55 mutants, compared to the wild-type strain.  The UV-induced mutations enable the mutant strains to ferment  high-gravity maltose faster than the WT. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Baerends, R.J.S., J.L. Qiu, L. Gautier, and A. Brandt. A high-throughput system for screening of fast-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Manuscript in preparation.

DESIGN
A single-dye 12-plex array chip study using double-stranded DNA prepared from messenger RNA purified from total RNA recovered from three separate Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y55 wild-type cultures and 3x three separate cultures each corresponding to a fast-fermenting UV-induced mutant (mutant 1, 2 and 3), during fermentation of high-gravity maltose at day 2. Each array on the 12-plex chip measures the expression level of 5,777 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C with eight 60-mer probes per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
