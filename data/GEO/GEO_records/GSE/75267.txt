TITLE
Tumor infiltrating HLA-matched CD4+ T cells retargeted against Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent hematological malignancies. Due to its extraordinary composition, few tumor cells surrounded by a reactive infiltrate, HL can be seen as an ideal model system for research focusing on tumor immunology. In fact, the tumor cells of HL, so called Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells attract CD4+ T cells, which then build rosettes with the HRS cells. HRS cells further modulate the tumor microenvironment with the help of CD4+ T cells to avoid tumor rejection. Here, we mimicked this scenario using compatible CD4+ T cells receiveing data of profound interactions for the first time, as former studies were performed with allogeneic donors. Finally, we genetically retargeted compatible CD4+ T cells to kill HRS cells.

DESIGN
19 samples of 7 day-old co-cultures of L428 cells and primary T cells were MACS-depleted of T cells. When indicated addition of 0.75ÂµM dexamethasone.
