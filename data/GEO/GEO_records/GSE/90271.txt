TITLE
total RNA-seq from mesenchymal stem cell of adipose (ENCSR000CTZ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from mesenchymal adipose derived stem cells, hMSC-AT isolated from independent donors. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
