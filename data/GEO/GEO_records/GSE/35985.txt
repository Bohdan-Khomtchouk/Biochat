TITLE
Identification of Cux2 binding sites in female and male mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Growth hormone (GH)-regulated transcription factors, notably STAT5 and BCL6, play a major role in regulating genes showing sex differences in expression in mouse liver, primarily through their effects in male liver, where male-biased genes are up regulated and many female-biased genes are actively repressed. Here we investigate whether complementary mechanisms, involving up regulation of female-biased genes and down regulation of male-biased genes occur in female liver. To address this question, we identified genes regulated by Cux2, a highly female-specific transcription factor that is repressed in male liver and is induced by the female plasma GH pattern in female liver.  ChIP-seq analysis identified Cux2 binding sites in female liver only, where they are enriched at sites of male-biased DNase hypersensitivity and at genomic regions showing male-enriched STAT5 binding.  Cux2 binding sites were enriched at genes repressed by adenoviral-Cux2, but not at genes induced by adenoviral-Cux2 (see GSE35897), indicating a direct binding mechanism in Cux2 repression but not in Cux2-dependent gene induction.

DESIGN
Mouse livers were excised from individual male and female. Sonicated, cross-linked liver nuclear chromatin was then used to identify Cux2 binding sites by ChIP-Seq using antibody specific to Cux2, amino acids 356 to 415
