TITLE
Expression data from cell aggregates before and after pre-differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell aggregates were cultured with BMP4 and bFGF for 3 days as pre-differentaition process We used microarrays to detect the expression of markers of pluripotency, three germ layers, and cardiac lineages

DESIGN
Cell aggregates before pre-differentiation and after pre-differnetiation were collected for microarrays. Typical markers for pluripotency, three germ layers, and cardiac lineages were investigated.
