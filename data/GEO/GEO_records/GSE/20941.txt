TITLE
Mediators in Crohn’s disease influence the gene expression profiles of mesenchymal progenitor cells differentiated into the osteoblastic lineage.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Crohn’s disease (CD) is associated with a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, a complication that is increasingly recognised as a significant cause of morbidity. Its pathogenesis is still controversial, but activity of CD is thought to be one contributing factor.

DESIGN
Two-Color DRLL-IS-Design [Landgrebe et.al 2004: Efficient two-sample designs for microarray experiments with biological replications. In Silico Biology 4] including 12 Arrays, osteoporosis samples from 4 mc patients, control samples from 3 mc patients without osteoporosis

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
