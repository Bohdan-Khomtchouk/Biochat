TITLE
CiaR Transcriptome in Streptococcus agalactiae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
Regulation of gene expression in response to variable and often adverse environmental conditions is an essential component of microbial pathogenesis.  We identified the two-component regulatory system CiaRH in a screen for genes essential for the survival of Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) on exposure to in vitro models of environmental stress.  We constructed site-directed, non-polar deletion mutations in the regulator gene ciaR and compared the growth of CiaR mutant GBS to wild-type GBS under stressed conditions.  CiaR mutant GBS are more sensitive than wild-type GBS to elevated temperature, low pH, chemical mutagens and ultraviolet light; the mutants are also more sensitive to cell-wall active antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides.  CiaR mutant strains are markedly attenuated in a mouse model of GBS sepsis.  To determine the genes regulated by CiaR that account for these defects, transcriptional profiling was performed using DNA microarray analysis, comparing wild-type GBS to CiaR mutant GBS under non-stressed conditions.
