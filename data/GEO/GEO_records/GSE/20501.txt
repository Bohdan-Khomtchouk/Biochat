TITLE
Meta-transcriptomic analysis of the response of river biofilms to pharmaceutical products using anonymous DNA microarray

ORGANISM
environmental samples

SUMMARY
Low concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds were shown to induce transcriptional responses in isolated microorganisms, which could have consequences on ecosystem dynamics. In order to test if these transcriptional responses could also be observed in complex river microbial communities, biofilm reactors were inoculated with water from two distinct rivers and supplemented with environmentally relevant doses of four pharmaceutical products (erythromycin-ER, gemfibrozil-GM, sulfamethazine-SN and sulfamethoxazole-SL). To follow the expression of functional genes, we constructed a 9,600 features anonymous DNA microarray platform onto which cDNA from the various biofilms was hybridized.
