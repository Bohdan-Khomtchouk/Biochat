TITLE
Effect of NF-kappaB activation in bone marrow stromal cells co-cultured with CLL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor cell survival critically depends on heterotypic communication with benign cells in the microenvironment. Here we describe a novel survival signaling pathway activated in stromal cells by contact to B-cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients.  The expression of PKC-βII and the subsequent activation of NF-κB in bone marrow stromal cells is a prerequisite to support the survival of malignant B-cells. PKC-β knockout mice are insusceptible to CLL-transplantations, underscoring the in vivo significance of the PKC-βII- NF-κB signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment. Upregulated stromal PKC-βII in biopsies from CLL, breast- and pancreatic- cancer patients suggest that this pathway may commonly be activated in a variety of malignancies. We used microarrays to determine Nemo/ IKK-gamma dependent gene expression changes in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) induced by co-culturing with leukemic B-cells (CLL)

DESIGN
We compared mouse BMSC cells from Nemo knockout cells (Nemo+CRE)  and Nemo wild type cells (Nemo-CRE) co-cultured for 5 days with leukemic B-cells microarray analysis on Affymetrix MG-430_2.0 arrays..
