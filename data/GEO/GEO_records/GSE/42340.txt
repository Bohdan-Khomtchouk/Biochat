TITLE
Expression analysis of Gordonia sp. KTR9 upon exposure to RDX and Nitrogen limitation

ORGANISM
Gordonia sp. KTR9

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in Gordonia sp. KTR9 upon exposure to RDX and Nitrogen Limitation, compared to controls with no RDX. The Gordonia sp. KTR9 strain used in this study has been previously described by Thompson KT, Crocker FH, Fredrickson HL.2005. Mineralization of the cyclic nitramine explosive hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine by Gordonia and Williamsia spp. Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Dec;71(12):8265-72.

DESIGN
A 12 x 135K array study using total RNA recovered from triplicate cultures of KTR9 exposed to RDX, triplicate cultures of KTR9 exposed to RDX and high nitrogen conditions, triplicate cultures of KTR9 exposed to low nitrogen, and triplicate cultures of controls exposed to high nitrogen.
