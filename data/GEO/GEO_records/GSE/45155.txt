TITLE
The effect of YAP/TAZ knockdown on the intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Hippo pathway plays a crucial in organ size control during development and tissue homeostasis in adult life. To examine a role for Hippo signaling in the intestinal epithelium, we analyzed gene expression patterns in the mouse intestinal epithelilum transfected with siRNAs or expression plasmids for shRNAs targeting the Hippo pathway effectors, YAP and TAZ.

DESIGN
We performed two independent series of experiments (siGFP (n=3) vs siYAP/siTAZ (n=3), and shLacZ (n=1) vs shYAP/shTAZ (n=1)). Control siRNA (siGFP), YAP/TAZ siRNAs, or expression plasmids for control shRNA (shLacZ) or YAP/TAZ shRNAs were introduced into the mouse intestinal epithelium by the newly-developed in vivo transfection method. Four days after transfection, intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from the tissues and total RNA was extracted.
