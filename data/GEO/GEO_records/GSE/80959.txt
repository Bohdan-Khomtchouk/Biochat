TITLE
Dynamic DNA methylation landscape defines brown and white cell specificity during adipogenesis (RRBS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We depicted a genome-wide integrative view of DNA methylome by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and transcriptome by RNA-seq during brown and white adipocyte differentiation. Our analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic signature for brown and white cell lineage before, during and after differentiation. When comparing white to brown adipocytes at all three time points of differentiation, we identified five members of the Hox family whose expression levels were anti-correlated with promoter methylation, suggesting a regulatory role of DNA methylation in transcription.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylome in brown and white adipocytes
