TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Tn5 mutants

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
We used Progenika oligonucleotide arrays to monitor the gene expression after cold shock from 30°C to 10°C. The 10°C samples of the P. putida wild type were compared to those of the respective P. putida KT2440 Tn5 mutants affected in either cbrA (PP4695), cbrB (PP4696), pcnB (PP4697), vacB (PP4880) or bipA (PP5044).

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in minimal medium supplemented with succinate at 30°C. In mid-exponential phase, cells were cooled down to 10°C. Two hours after the medium had reached 10°C, cells were harvested for subsequent RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
