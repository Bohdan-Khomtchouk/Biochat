TITLE
Whole methylome analysis of SEM cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of human B-ALL cell line SEM after 48 h incubation with DMSO (control), CX-4945 (Silmitasertib), Decitabine (DEC) or combined CX-4945 + DEC treatment. The Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 866,895 CpG islands.

DESIGN
Bisulfite treated DNA of 4 samples was hybridised to the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
