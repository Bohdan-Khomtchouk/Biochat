TITLE
Murine Fgf3-/-;Fgf10-/- vs. Fgf3+/-;Fgf10+/- otic placode profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse 4-8 somite microdissected otic placodes from Fgf3/Fgf10 double heterozygotes (controls) compared to Fgf3/Fgf10 double null mutants.  The purpose was to determine the effectors that are induced (or repressed) by Fgf3 and Fgf10 in the course of otic placode induction.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, double heterozygote vs. double null placodes.  Biological replicas:  3 Fgf3+/-;Fgf10+/- and 3 Fgf3-/-;Fgf10-/- pools of ten placodes each.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
