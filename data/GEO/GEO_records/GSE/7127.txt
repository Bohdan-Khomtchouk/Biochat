TITLE
63 Melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
63 melanoma cell lines hybridized to Affymetrix Hu133_Plus 2 oligo arrays. The aim of this study was to identify potential downstream targets of key oncogenes and TSGs in melanoma (including p14ARF, p16INK4A, BRAF etc). Publications relevant to this series include: Johansson et al. Pigment Cell Res 2007. Keywords: melanoma

DESIGN
63 melanoma cell lines hybridized to Affymetrix Hu133_Plus 2 oligo arrays. These cell lines were sequenced for key tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes known to be involved in melanoma development. The microarray data was then analysed together with a particular genotype status (see relevant publications) to identify genes that potentially act downstream of these oncogenes and TSGs to contribute to melanoma development. See publications for analysis methods.
