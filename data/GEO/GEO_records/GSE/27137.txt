TITLE
Gene expression profiles of CD8+ partial memory T cells (Tpm) compared to naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells (analysis 1, 17 samples)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression of partial memory T cells compared to naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells demonstrating that Tpm constitute a unique cell population with distinct global gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated/FACSorted murine T cells  lysed  in Trizol after isolation.
