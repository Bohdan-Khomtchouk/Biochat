TITLE
Gene expression profiling of E18.5 FoxD1 Cre;Dicer and control embryonic kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to address the functional role of miRNAs in the FoxD1+ renal stroma progenitors and derivatives during embryonic kidney development. To achieve this, we generated transgenic mice that lack miRNAs in the renal stroma lineage (FoxD1 Cre;Dicer), and performed a microarray analysis on E18.5 whole kidneys to determine the transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
3 litters of E18.5 FoxD1 Cre;Dicer and control littermate kidneys were used for the microarray analysis. Each litter consists of kidneys pooled from 2 embryos per genotype for the RNA extraction.
