TITLE
Identification of putative Arabidopsis DEMETER target genes by GeneChip Analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip to profile RNAs active in wild type columbia (glabrous) and CaMV::DME pollen and stamens. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
DME is not active in wild type pollen and stamen.  DME was induced in pollen and stamen by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV).  RNA profiles from wild type and CaMV::DME pollen and stamens were compared using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip.
