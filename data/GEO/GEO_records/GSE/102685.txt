TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Control and FoxM1-knockdown C2C12 Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:To identify FoxM1-dependent genes and the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of muscle stem cells function, we performed RNA-Sequence of C2C12 from shControl and shFoxM1 cells. Methods: C2C12 mRNA and lncRNA profiles of shControl and shFoxM1 cells (quiescent or activated states) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results:Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 80 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm10) and identified 49,586 transcripts in the control C2C12 and FoxM1-knockdown C2C12 with BWA workflow. Conclusions: Our results represents the first detailed analysis of C2C12 transcriptomes and found that knockdown of FoxM1 perturbed multiple mRNA pathways, as well as for novel lncRNA pathways.
