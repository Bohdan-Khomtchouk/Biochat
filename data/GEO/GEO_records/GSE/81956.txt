TITLE
Gene expression level of Aspergillus fumigatus CEA17_ΔakuBKU80 at three different stages

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression level of Aspergillus fumigatus CEA17_ΔakuBKU80 strain in dormant conidia, in swollen conidia (after 4h of culture in Glucose 3%, Yeast Exrtract 1% liquid medium) and in germinated conidia (after 8h of culture in Glucose 3%, Yeast Extract 1% liquid medium after construction of an RNAseq library.

DESIGN
Three different samples have been analyzed including 3 replicates each.
