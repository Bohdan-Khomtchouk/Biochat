TITLE
Multiparameter functional diversity of human C2H2 zinc finger proteins [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C2H2 zinc finger proteins represent the largest and most enigmatic class of human transcription factors. Their C2H2 arrays are highly variable, indicating that most will have unique DNA binding motifs. However, most of the binding motifs have not been directly determined. We have determined the binding sites and motifs of 119 C2H2 zinc finger proteins and the expression pattern of 80 cell lines overexpressing C2H2 zinc finger proteins in order to study the role of C2H2 zinc finger proteins in gene regulation.

DESIGN
We expressed GFP-tagged C2H2-ZF proteins in stable transgenic HEK293 cells. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and sequencing libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold or TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2.
