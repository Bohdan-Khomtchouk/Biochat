TITLE
Next generation sequencing in ZS rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy was employed to study in depth the pathogenic alterations involved in progressive diabetic kidney damage. We employed the obese, diabetic ZS rat, a model that develops renal failure and fibrosis, the hallmarks of human disease. We then used RNA-seq to examine in a comprehensive manner the combined effects of renal cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells acting as a pathophysiological unit.

DESIGN
12 samples (4 independent samples for each of 3 groups, 1 control group)

PLATFORM
GPL14980 AB SOLiD 4 System (Rattus norvegicus)
