TITLE
Transcriptome of IL-19 negative and IL-19 positive macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of LPS stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages, derived from heterozygous Il19-tdTomato reporter mice to compare the transcritptome of IL-19/tdTomato negative with IL-19/tdTomato positive macrophages.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression profiling of Il19-tdT positive versus negative BM-derived macrophages
