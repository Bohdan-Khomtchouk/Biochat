TITLE
RNA Sequencing Analysis Generates Comprehensive Transcriptomic Landscape and Identifies PTK6 as a Novel Tumor Suppressor Gene in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the integrative transcriptome analysis of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. A total of 187 million 38bp sequencing reads were generated containing 7 billion bases for three pairs of matched patient-derived ESCC clinical specimens and their adjacent non-tumorous tissues. By investigating the digital gene expression profiling, we found 1425 genes significantly differentially expressed and detected more than 9000 SNPs across all six samples. We also identified protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) as a novel tumor suppressor gene, which is critical in ESCC development.

DESIGN
Analysis of whole transcriptome from 3 paired patient-derived ESCC clinical specimens and their adjacent non-tumorous tissues.
