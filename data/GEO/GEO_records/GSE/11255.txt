TITLE
Peripheral blood stem cell gene and microRNA profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 4

SUMMARY
Mobilized-peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been used for transplantation, immunotherapy, and cardiovascular regenerative medicine. Agents used for HPC mobilization include G-CSF and the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. The HSCs cells mobilized by each agent may contain different subtypes and have different functions. To characterize mobilized HSCs used for clinical applications, microRNA (miRNA) profiling and gene expression profiling were used to compare AMD3100-mobilized CD133+ cells from 4 subjects, AMD3100 plus G-CSF-mobilized CD133+ cells from 4 subjects and G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells from 5 subjects. The HSCs were compared to peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from 7 subjects. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
