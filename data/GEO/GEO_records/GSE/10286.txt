TITLE
Differential expression of inflammatory and immune response genes in sheep infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the causative agent of tick-borne fever (TBF) in ruminants and human, equine and canine granulocytic anaplasmosis. A. phagocytophilum modifies host gene expression and immune response. The objective of this work was to analyze differential gene expression in A. phagocytophilum-infected sheep using microarray hybridization and real-time RT-PCR in experimentally and naturally infected animals. Keywords: disease state analysis
