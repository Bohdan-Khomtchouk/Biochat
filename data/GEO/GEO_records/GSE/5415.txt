TITLE
hES cell FGF2 re-stimulation experiments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series includes hES cell samples starved and re-stimulated with FGF2. Controls were FGF2-starved but not re-stimulated. Two independent experiments were carried out (one sample plus control each). Keywords: Growth factor stimulation experiment

DESIGN
hES cells were grown in conditioned medium for 2 days, starved in unconditioned medium (UM) without FGF2 and with 30uM of SU5402 (Calbiochem), for 24h, and, after extensive washing, re-treated with 40 ng/ml of FGF2 in UM for 4h. Controls were FGF2-starved but not re-stimulated. After the FGF2 starvation period the cells did not show any obvious signs of spontaneous differentiation.
