TITLE
Expression time series during the differentiation of ventral motor neurons from embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to profile gene expression dynamics during the in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells into ventral motor neurons. Expression levels were profiled using Affymetrix microarrays at six timepoints during in vitro differentiation: ES cells (Day 0), embryoid bodies (Day 2), retinoid induction of neurogenesis (Day 2 +8hours of exposure to retinoic acid), neural precursors (Day 3), progenitor motor neurons (Day 4), postmitotic motor neurons (Day 7).

DESIGN
The differentiation of ventral motor neurons is induced by treating embryonic stem cell cultures with retinoic acid and hedgehog agonist. Here, gene expression patterns are profiled at various defined stages during the differentiation process using Affymetrix expression arrays.
