TITLE
High-Throughput Drug Screening identifies Pazopanib and Clofilium tosylate as effective treatments for malignant rhabdoid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression in two different cell lines (DEV and G401) and two conditions (CLOFILIUM and DMSO) were assessed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 plateform in order to detect genes that are differentially expressed in CLOFILIUM condition compared to control (DMSO)

DESIGN
DEV and G401 cell lines were treated with CLOFILIUM and DMSO. mRNA were extracted 48 hours after treatment. 3 biological replicates were extracted for analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
