TITLE
Expression data from OCUBM cells trasfected with IGF1R

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate genes that might influence resistance to infection through IGF1R, we screened human breast cancer-derived OCUB-M cells transfected with expression vector encoding IGF1R using microarray analysis. Keywords: overexpression comparison

DESIGN
OCUBM cells were transfected with/without IGF1R for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
