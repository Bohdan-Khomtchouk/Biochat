TITLE
Gene expression in whi3 and WHI3x4 in YPD and YPE

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Measurement of the change in steady state mRNA level in cells with whi3 deletion or WHI3 overexpression relative to wildtype cells. In the overexpression experiment, WHI3 is moderately overexpressed by integrating four copies of WHI3 at its endogenous locus. This was performed in YEP glucose medium and YEP ethanol medium. Goal was to measure the effects of WHI3 on global gene expression at RNA level.

DESIGN
Two testing mutants whi3 vs WHI3, WHI3x4 vs WHI3 in two conditions YPD and YPE. Biological replicates: 2 whi3 in YPD, 2 WHI3x4 in YPD, 2 whi3 in YPE, 2 WHI3x4 in YPE.

PLATFORM
