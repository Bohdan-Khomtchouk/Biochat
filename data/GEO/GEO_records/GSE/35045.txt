TITLE
Genomic copy number profiling of different generations of Atm-/-TERT-ER T-cell lymphomas and associated resistant tumors following telomerase inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic copy numbers of various generations of  Atm-/-TERT-ER mice treated with 4-OHT or vehicle were profiled. Genomic copy numbers of transplanted G3 Atm-/-TERT-ER T-cell lymphomas with telomerase or ALT

DESIGN
T-cell lymphomas were developed in various generations of Atm-/-TERT-ER mice with 4-OHT or vehicle treatment. These tumors were profiled with aCGH. G3 Atm-/-TERT-ER tumors were transplanted into SCID mice treated with 4-OHT or vehicle. Cells maintained on vehicle eventually developed ALT-dependent resistance. We used aCGH to profile telomerase+ tumors vs. ALT+ tumors from the same parental lines.
