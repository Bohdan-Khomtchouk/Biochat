The Warburg effect alters histone acetylation in cancer cells by influencing the utilization of HDAC and HAT mechanisms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray transcriptome analysis of siMock and siACL HCT116 cells treated with 0, 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 mM butyrate over three days.

DESIGN
Gene expression is measured at control cells (siMock) and ACL-depleted (siACL) cells with 4 dosages (0, 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 mM) of butyrate treatments
