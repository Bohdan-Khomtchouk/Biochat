TITLE
Identification of the transcriptional profile of the hyphal tip of Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
A colony of fungus is comprised of long, branching filamentous cells called hyphae. Genetic mechanisms underlying the development of hyphae are poorly understood. We sectioned hyphae of a model fungus, Neurospora crassa (pink bread mold), into six parts depending on the age of the cells; 1 hour, 3 hour, 9 hour, 15 hour, 21 hour and 27 hour old, respectively. This data submission reflects an RNAseq analysis of mRNA extracted from the 1 hour time-point.

DESIGN
1 mycelial mRNA profile of 1 hour growth (hyphal tip) from Neurospora crassa strain FGSC 2489, Data was generated using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL15629 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Neurospora crassa)
