TITLE
Expression profile for early stationary phase E. coli W3110 expression profile

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Quorum signal uptake is an indispensable part of quorum sensing regulations.  The coperative regulation of uptake repressor and kinase  precisely signale the cells for quorum sensing uptake and terminate the quorum sensing signal production. We use the DNA microarray to detail the E. coli quorum sensing uptake reuglations and related gene regulations. Keywords: specific growth

DESIGN
W3110 wild type and its isogenic mutants lsrR, lsrK's RNA samples were extracted and hybridized for Affymetrix array.

PLATFORM
