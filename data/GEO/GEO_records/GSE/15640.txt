TITLE
Salivary gland during development and onset of xerostomia in  murine model of Sjögren's syndrome-like disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in the salivary gland during development and onset of xerostomia in Sjögren’s syndrome-like disease of the C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mouse. Recently, we reported the development of the C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mouse that carries two genetic intervals derived from the NOD mouse capable of conferring Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS)-like disease in SjS-non-susceptible C57BL/6 mice. In an attempt to define the molecular bases underlying onset of stomatitis sicca (xerostomia) in this C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mouse model, we have carried out a study utilizing  microarray technology.

DESIGN
The present study was designed to define the changing gene expression profiles within the salivary glands of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice at five time points representing a pre-disease stage (4 weeks), the early pre-clinical stage (8 weeks), the initial influx of leukocytes into the salivary glands (12 weeks), the early clinical phase of autoimmunity (16 weeks), and the early onset of clinical SjSlike disease characterized by secretory dysfunction (20 weeks). The C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mouse is a model of primary SjS in which the Idd3 region of chromosome 3 and the Idd5 region of chromosome 1 derived from the NOD mouse were bred into the non-autoimmune C57BL/6 mouse, resulting in a SjS-like disease susceptibility that mimics both the pathophysiological characteristics and reduced secretory responses observed with NOD mice during development and onset of disease. This SjS-susceptible strain was designated C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2, where Aec1 corresponds to Idd3 (of chromosome 3) and Aec2 corresponds to Idd5 (of chromosome 1).
