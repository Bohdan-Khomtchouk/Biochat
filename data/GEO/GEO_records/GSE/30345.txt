TITLE
Bacterial Adaptation Through Loss of Function

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mutants with beneficial in-frame null mutations.  The goal of the study is to understand how expression of the mutants and their parental strain differs in conditions where the mutations are beneficial.

DESIGN
For each of two conditions (media with either glutamine or alanine as the sole carbon source) four mutants were compared with the parental strain.  Two biological replicates were done for each comparison.  A total of 16 arrays were used.

PLATFORM
GPL14135 Agilent E. coli Gene Expression Microarray G4813A (GenePix version)
