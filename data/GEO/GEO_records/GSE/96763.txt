TITLE
Effect of increased insulin signaling on third instar larval fat body gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We characterized constitutively active insulin receptor (InR)-dependent gene expression in the Drosophila fat body. Transient activation of InR was elicited via heat shock and RNA-seq was used to identify potential target genes.

DESIGN
Drosophila were reared on control diets until the third instar stage. Control (hs-GAL4 x y1w1118) offspring were compared with InRCA (hs-GAL4 x UAS-InR.A1325D).  Fat bodies were isolated 6 hours after a heat shock, and RNA was extracted to determine the effects of transiently increased InR activation on gene expression using Illumina RNA-seq.
