TITLE
RNA sequencing of cells treated with DMSO or Retinoic acid during cardiac differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional differences between control and RA-treated cells during cardiac differentiation. The hypothesis tested in these samples is that addition of RA during differentiation towards atrial-like cardiomyocytes while control cells treated with DMSO result in ventricular-like cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
NKX2.5 (eGFP/w)-hESCs were differentiated to cardiomyocytes with spin EB protocol, with the addition of RA or DMSO. Cells were sorted at day-31 based on GFP resulting in CTplus, CTminus, RAplus or RAminus goups. RNA was isolated from each of these fractions for sequencing.
