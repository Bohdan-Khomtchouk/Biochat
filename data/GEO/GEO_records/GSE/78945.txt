TITLE
Fast revascularization of the injured area is essential to support zebrafish heart regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To better understand the possible mechanisms that vegfaa mutants display to compensate for the lack of vegfaa, we performed transcriptomic profiling of vegfaa+/+ and vegfaa-/- ventricles. Total RNA was isolated from hearts extracted from vegfaa+/+ and vegfaa-/- fish (8 months old) pooling 4 hearts per sample.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from vegfaa+/+ and vegfaa-/- fish was isoleted. Each sample was generated by pooling 4 vegfaa+/+ hearts (Control) and 4 vegfaa-/- hearts (Mutants).
