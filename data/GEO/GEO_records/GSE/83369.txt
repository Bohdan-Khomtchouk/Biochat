TITLE
Effect of H2O2 treatment on gene expression of islet derived hybrid cell of 1.1B4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the comprehensive gene expression changes by H2O2 in pancreatic beta-cell derived 1.1B4 cells using Agilent microarray. The genes of 2903 H2O2 treated were up-regulated and 2283 genes were down-regulated compared with control sample. HMOX1, EGR1, IGF, IL8 and NR4A3 were strongly up-regulated

DESIGN
Gene regulation associated with antioxidant defense system in pancreatic beta cells still needs to be elucidated, we analyzed the genes expression with Agilent micro-array after 4 hours of 100mM H2O2 treatment by one color method, and found 2903 genes were up-regulated and 2283 genes were down regulated. Changes of some genes expressions were confirmed by real time PCR.
