TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of NKX2-1 and SPDEF binding sites in A549 lung carcinoma cells by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed to identify the binding regions of SPDEF and NKX2-1 in A549 lung carcinoma cells expressing NKX2-1 and SPDEF.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiments were performed in A549 cells infected with lentivirus expressing NKX2-1 and SPDEF on two biological replicates per each transcription factor (TF). Peak regions were identified in all ChIP-seq TF data sets using the peak caller algorithm MACS2 (Zhang et al., Genome Biology, 9(9):R137, 2008).
