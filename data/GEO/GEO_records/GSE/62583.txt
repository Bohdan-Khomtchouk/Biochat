TITLE
Cytokines & Chemokines PCR Array on human DC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stimulation of human DC with LPS, VSL#3, or a combination of both resulted in their maturation, evident from enhanced expression of activation markers on the cell-surface, as well as the induction of various chemokines and cytokines.

DESIGN
24 samples were analyzed (4 experimental conditions and 6 biological replicates)
