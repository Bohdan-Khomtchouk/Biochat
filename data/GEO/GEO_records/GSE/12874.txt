TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in G. uraniireducens during Growth on Iron or Manganese Oxide as Electron Acceptor

ORGANISM
Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4

SUMMARY
G. uraniireducens was isolated from a subsurface site in Rifle, CO undergoing in situ uranium bioremediation. Sediments from the Rifle site were heat-sterilized, amended with acetate to simulate in situ bioremediation conditions, and inoculated with G. uraniireducens. Gene transcript abundance in these cells using sediment Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides as the electron acceptor were compared with transcript levels in cells grown with fumarate as the electron acceptor. Additional comparisons were made between cells grown on synthetic Fe(III) or Mn(IV) oxides and cells grown on fumarate.
