TITLE
High-resolution Sox2 DNA-binding sites mapping by ChIP-exo in TSA-treated ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mapping ultra-high resolution of Sox2:DNA interaction after trichostatin A (TSA) treatment would provide us with valuable new mechanistic insights into how epigenome regulates transcription factor DNA interactions in the cells.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cells were treated with 50nM TSA (Sigma: T8552) for 8 hours prior to ChIP-exo mapping.
