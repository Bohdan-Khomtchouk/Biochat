TITLE
Differential expression pattern in AICD resistent TReg vs. CD4+CD25high TReg cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this screen we compared cDNA from rTreg (AICD resistent TReg cells) against cDNA derived from all CD4+CD25hi Treg  for further molecular characterization of rTreg Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Single comparison of rTReg vs. TReg. We pooled rTreg-cDNA derived from FACS-sorted CD4+CD25hi Treg of eight healthy blood donors and performed gene chip microarray analysis.
