TITLE
Yeast response to TFM exposure over time (YPD)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This time course microarray experiment was performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the global gene expression alterations due to 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) exposure  over time. In this experiment,  yeast grown in standard, glucose-containing media were treated with 0.05mM TFM over a four hour period.

DESIGN
The wild type S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 were grown in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD), a fermentable medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose), at 30°C to saturation and treated for 1h, 2h, or 4h with 0.05mM TFM in 2% isopropanol (TFM solvent). The two biological replicates taken immediately before treatment represented “time zero”, untreated (2% isopropanol only) controls. For each TFM treated time point, two independent RNA samples (two biological replicates) were isolated (except for at time 4h, only one RNA sample was isolated but two technical replicates were prepared and processed).
