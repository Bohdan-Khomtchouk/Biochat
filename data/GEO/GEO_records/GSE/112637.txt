TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat hypertrophic zone after treatment of CNP53 or U0126 [CNP53]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the similarity of gene expression profile of CNP53 and U0126 treatment in growth plate.

DESIGN
Tibiae from E18.5 embryonic rat were isolated and pre-cultured in BGJb media for 1 day, followed by culturing in the presence of vehicle or CNP53 (100 ng/mL) for 1 day. The tibiae (12 bones) were micro-dissected into the hypertrophic zone and pooled, from which RNA was isolated by using Qiagen RNeasy micro Kit, then microarray analyses were performed by using Agilent array system.
