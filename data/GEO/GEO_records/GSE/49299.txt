TITLE
CGH analyses for the Chinese indigenous pig breeds and commercial pig breeds [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Since CNVs play a vital role in genomic studies, it is an imperative need to develop a comprehensive, more accurate and higher resolution porcine CNV map with practical significance in follow-up CNV functional analyses To detect CNV of pigs, we performed high density aCGH data of diverse pig breeds in the framework of the pig draft genome sequence (Sscrofa10.2)

DESIGN
9 Chinese indigenous pig, one Chinese wild boar and 2 commercial pigs were detected using one pig of Duroc as reference. These 12 animals include 1 wild pig, 2 pigs each from Yorkshire and Landrace as the representatives of modern commercial breeds and 9 unrelated individuals selected from 6 Chinese indigenous breeds (2- Tibetan pig, 2- Diannan small-ear pig, 2-Meishan pig, 1- Min pig, 1-Daweizi pig, and 1-Rongchang pig).
