TITLE
Inter-individual variation in genes governing human hippocampal progenitor differentiation is associated with hippocampal volume in adulthood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the antidepressants, escitalopram (0 nM, 145 nM, 290 nM, 1160 nM) and nortriptyline (0 nM, 267 nM, 534 nM, 1068 nM), in human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC0A07/03C), either when proliferating or differentiating. We also considered expression changes occuring when proliferating cells switch to a differentiating state to form young neurons and astrocytes.

DESIGN
We assessed the genome-wide expression effects of neural stem cell differentiation. We compared 48 proliferating cell populations of the human hippocampal cell line with 48 cell populations after a 7-day differentiation protocol (1 sample dropped). We performed this analyses using data originally collected to compare the effects of antidepressants on proliferating/differentiating hippocampal progenitor cells; we regressed out the effects of antidepressant drug and dose, biological replicate and array batch in our analyses.
