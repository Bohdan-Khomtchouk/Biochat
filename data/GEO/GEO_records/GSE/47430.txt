TITLE
Expression data from murine Hemophagocytes (HPCs) versus resting splenic macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hemophagocytes are activated macrophages seen morphologically to have engulfed other hematopoietic cells. Their function is unknown. Attempts to induce these cells in vitro or purify them ex vivo have been unsuccessful. We isolated HPCs and resting splenic macrophages by laser capture microdissection. RNA was isolated from captured cells and microarray performed to compare the activation state of HPCs versus resting splenic macrophages.

DESIGN
We treated WT mice with PBS or CpG1826 and an IL-10receptor blocking antibody. Cells were captured from splenic touch preps on PEN-coated slides, RNA isolated by WT-Ovation One-Direct Amplification System and assayed on Affymetrix mouse gene ST 1.0 chips.
