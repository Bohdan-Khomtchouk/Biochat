TITLE
Gene profiling of pathological cardiac hypertrophy vs physiological hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure, and is induced either by physiological stimuli eg postnatal development, chronic exercise training or pathological stimuli eg pressure or volume overload. Majority of new therapies for heart failure has mixed outcomes. A combined mouse model and oligo-array approach are used to examine whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p110-alpha isoform) activity is critical for maintenance of cardiac function and long-term survival in a setting of heart failure. The significance and expected outcome are to recognise genes involved in models of heart failure ie pathological- vs physiology-hypertrophy, and examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for such activity. Growth of the heart can be induced by physiological stimuli e.g., postnatal development, chronic exercise training, or pathological stimuli e.g., pressure or volume overload. Physiological hypertrophy (“good”) is characterised by a normal organisation of cardiac structure, and normal or enhanced cardiac function. In comparison, pathological hypertrophy (”bad”) is associated with fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanistic process which allows the heart to enlarge in response to physiological stimuli while maintaining normal or enhanced function is of great clinical relevance because one potential therapeutic strategy is to inhibit the pathological growth process while augmenting the physiological growth process. One of the major process that regulate heart size is by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Thus the end goal of this project is to determine whether the p110 alpha isoform of PI3K could be a potential tool for augmenting physiological growth and improving cardiac function of the failing diseased heart, and to examine the underlying mechanisms responsible.
