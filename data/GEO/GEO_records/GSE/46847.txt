TITLE
CGH analyses for the Chinese indigenous pig breeds and commercial pig breeds

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Since CNVs play a vital role in genomic studies, it is an imperative need to develop a comprehensive, more accurate and higher resolution porcine CNV map with practical significance in follow-up CNV functional analyses To detect CNV of pigs, we performed high density aCGH data of diverse pig breeds in the framework of the pig draft genome sequence (Sscrofa10.2)

DESIGN
9 Chinese indigenous pig, 2 commercial pigs, 1 wild pig were detected using one pig of Duroc as reference.
