TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of in vitro MSC-derived osteoblastic cells from patients with Primary Myelofibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm whose severity and treatment complexity is attributed to the presence of bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and alterations of stroma impairing the production of normal blood cells.  Despite the recently discovered mutations including the JAK2V617F mutation in about half of patients, the primitive event responsible for the clonal proliferation is still unknown. In the highly inflammatory context of PMF, the presence of fibrosis associated with a neo-osteogenesis and an osteosclerosis concomitant to the myeloproliferation and to the increase number of circulating hematopoietic progenitors suggests that the crosstalk between hematopoietic cells and the osteoblastic niche is deregulated in the PMF BM microenvironment. Osteoblastic niche is well known to be an important support to regulate hematopoietic stem cell functions in bone marrow. A transcriptome analysis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) induced in vitro to differentiate in osteoblasts will help to understand the role of these cells in pathophysiology of PMF.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on BM-MSC at J0 and J21 of in vitro osteoblastic differentiation. Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays were used to compare expression profiling of BM-MSCs from PMF patients and healthy donors before and after osteoblastic differentiation.
