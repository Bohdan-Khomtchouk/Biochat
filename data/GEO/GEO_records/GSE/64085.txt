TITLE
MYC-negative BL frequent in posttransplant patients (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genomic and transcriptomic analysis of seven cases of molecular Burkitt lymphoma (mBL) developed in immunosuppressed patients who underwent solid organ transplantation. Interestingly, three cases (43%) were MYC-translocation-negative and revealed the 11q-gain/loss aberration recently identified in 3% of mBL developed in immunocompetent hosts.1 Based on array CGH data, minimal gain and loss regions of 11q (MGR/~4Mb and MLR/~13.5Mb, respectively) were defined and integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis identified 35 differentially expressed genes, when compared with classic BL. All 16 MGR-dysregulated genes were upregulated, including cancer related USP2, CBL and PAFAH1B2. As expected, all 19 MGL-dysregulated genes were downregulated and two of them, TBRG1 and EI24, are potential tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, the vast majority of dysregulated 11q23-q25 genes are involved in the MYC and TP53 networks. We hypothesize that the 11q-gain/loss aberration represents a “molecular variant” of t(8q24/MYC) and affects the same pathological pathways as the MYC oncogene.

DESIGN
Seven cases of PTLD with BL features were selected from a cohort of 174 posttransplant patients diagnosed with PTLD between 1989 and 2012 at the University Hospitals of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). In addition, five classic BL cases were selected as immunocompetent controls (IC-BL). Morphologic, immunophenotypic, clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of the selected cases were reviewed.
