TITLE
Gene expression analysis after reconstitution of Ebf1-deficient pre-pro-B cells with Ebf1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ebf1 deficient pre-pro B-cells (Fraction A) can be cultured in the presence of stromal feeders and cytokines. The retroviral transduction of these cells with Ebf1 was used as gain-of-function experiment for the analysis of direct and functional target genes of Ebf1.

DESIGN
Ebf1 deficient pre-pro B-cells were retrovirally transduced with an Ebf1-expressing or control retrovirus. 24h after transduction the infected cells were isolated and their gene expression profile was compared.
