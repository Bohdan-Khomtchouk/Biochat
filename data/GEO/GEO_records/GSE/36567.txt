TITLE
Mll1 regulates the downstream gene transcription activated by TNFa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genes of mixed lineage leukemia family regulate transcription via methylating histone H3K4. we studied the role of MLL1 in innate immunity and found it selectively regulates the activation of NF-kB downstream genes mediated by TNFa.

DESIGN
Mll1+/+ and Mll1-/- MEF cells were treated for 4 hr with 10ng/ml TNFa or control solution respectively. The same treatment were performed three times independently and the harvested cells of same treatment were mixed together and submitted for high throughput sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
