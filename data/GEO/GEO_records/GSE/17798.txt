TITLE
Transcriptional profile of EHEC O157 TUV93-0 overexpressing PsrA or PsrB

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
PsrA and PsrB were found to repress Type III secretion (T3S) when provided in multicopy. Total RNA was extracted at late exponential phase in T3S permissive media (MEM-HEPES). Transcriptional profiles were expressed relative to the vector control (pGEM).
