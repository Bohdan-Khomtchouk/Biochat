TITLE
Transcriptional profile of EHEC O157 TUV93-0 overexpressing PsrA or PsrB

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
PsrA and PsrB were found to repress Type III secretion (T3S) when provided in multicopy. Total RNA was extracted at late exponential phase in T3S permissive media (MEM-HEPES). Transcriptional profiles were expressed relative to the vector control (pGEM).

DESIGN
Dual colour design. Cy5 labelled cDNA from TUV93-0 pPsrA or pPsrB cultures were hybridised against TUV93-0 pGEM Cy3 labelled cDNA. Data were normalised using the Genespring GX 7.3.1 analysis package.
