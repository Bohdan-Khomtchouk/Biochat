TITLE
Transcriptional pathways associated with skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disuse atrophy is a common clinical phenomenon which significantly impacts muscle function and activities of daily living. In this study, we did expression profiling to identify transcriptional pathways associated with muscle remodeling in a clinical model of disuse. Keywords: Differentiation design
