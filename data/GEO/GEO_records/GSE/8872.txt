TITLE
Transcriptional pathways associated with skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disuse atrophy is a common clinical phenomenon which significantly impacts muscle function and activities of daily living. In this study, we did expression profiling to identify transcriptional pathways associated with muscle remodeling in a clinical model of disuse. Keywords: Differentiation design

DESIGN
28 Skeletal muscle biopsies from the medial gastrocnemius in patients with an ankle fracture (4 patients, 8 profiles) and from healthy volunteers (2 subjects, 4 profiles) subjected to 4-11 days of mobilization, as well as from the non-immobilized contralateral legs (16 profiles).
