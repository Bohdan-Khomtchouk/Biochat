TITLE
Gene expression profile of adult male mouse liver using total liver RNA-seq and nuclear liver RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in male mouse liver was assayed by RNA-seq, as part of a study to study cellular compartmentalization of hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Pools comprised of total or nuclear liver RNA isolated from individual male mice killed at either 11 AM or 2 PM were prepared and used for RNA-seq (paired-end 100 seq reads).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
