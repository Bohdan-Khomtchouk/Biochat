TITLE
Dynamics of chromatin accessibility during TGF-beta-induced EMT of Ras-transformed mammary gland epithelial cells [FAIRE-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global mapping of accessible chromatin in mouse mammary gland epithelial EpH4 cell line and its Ras-transformed derivative (EpRas) using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory element (FAIRE)-sequencing (seq) to analyze the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation during TGF-beta-induced EMT.

DESIGN
FAIRE-seq was perfomed using EpH4 and EpRas cells stimulated with 1 ng/ml TGF-beta or left untreated for 8 days.
