TITLE
CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarray data from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of miR-125a (+/+) wild-type and miR-125a knockout mice with myeloproliferative disorder (MPD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-125a knockout mice develop myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of MPD induced by the loss of miR-125a, gene expression profiling on hematopoietic stem cells of miR-125a (+/+), (+/-) MPD, and (-/-) MPD mice was performed by using CodeLinkTM Whole Genome DNA array analysis.

DESIGN
CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction on total RNA extracted from hematopoietic stem cells of miR-125a (+/+) wild-type mouse, miR-125a (+/-) heterozygous mouse with MPD, and miR-125a (-/-) homozygous mouse with MPD. One replicate per array.
