TITLE
aTEA 40 uM 12 hour treatment for MDA-MB-435 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an effort to identify novel signaling molecules modulated by α-TEA, microarray analyses were performed.  DNA array data obtained from human MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells treated with 40 µM α-TEA for 12 h revealed over 400 genes that were consistently either up- or down-regulated. Thirty-four genes were selected based on their possible involvement in the known biological activities of α-TEA, and three: phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate-induced protein (PMAPI) which codes for the protein NOXA, ABL2 which codes for the protein referred to as ARG (Abelson-related gene) and THBS1 which codes for thrombospondin 1, TSP-1 were chosen for further study. Keywords: Anti-cancer drug (aTEA at 40 uM 12 hour) treatment for MDA-MB-435 cells
