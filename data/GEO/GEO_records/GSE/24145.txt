TITLE
Soybean root hair cell response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculation

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean root hair transcriptional response to their inoculation by the symbiotic bacteria B. japonicum involved in soybean nodulation.  We used the first generation of an Affymetrix microarray to quantify the abundance of the transcripts from soybean root hair cells inoculated and mock-inoculated by B. japonicum. This experiment was performed on a time-course from 6 to 48 hours after inoculation.

DESIGN
Soybean seeds were sowed on sterile agar medium and grown for 3 days in a growth chamber before being treated with H2O (mock-inoculated) or B. japonicum (inoculated). Soybean root hair cells were isolated at different time points (6hr, 12hr, 18hr, 24hr, 36hr, 48hr) after treatment. For each time point and condition, 3 or 4 independent biological replicates were produced.
