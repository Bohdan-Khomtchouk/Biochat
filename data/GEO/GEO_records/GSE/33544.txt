TITLE
Human B cell receptor light chain repertoire analysis in healthy individuals and SLE patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determination of expression levels of light chain V genes in peripheral blood B cells after FACS sorting for two populations of B cells (CD20+CD138-IgKappa+IgLambda- and CD20+CD138-IgKappa-IgLambda+).  Analysis was performed on healthy individuals and SLE patients with analysis performed using several models.

DESIGN
Dual channel hybridization with experimental samples detected on red channel and reference sample detected on green channel.  Two replicate hybridizations.
