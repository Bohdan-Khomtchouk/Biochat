TITLE
miRNA expression signatures in Tif1b-deficient hematopoietic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression analyses of Tif1b-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Tif1b loss leds to  rapid depletion of HSCs. Expression analyses provide insight into the role of Tif1b in the maitenance of HSC.

DESIGN
HSCs (c-Kit+ Sca1+ Lineage- )  are sorted from adult bone marrow and are subjected into microarray analyses.

PLATFORM
GPL17912 Agilent-046065 Mouse_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
