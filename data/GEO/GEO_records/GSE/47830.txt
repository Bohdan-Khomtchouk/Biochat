TITLE
Uniform response to aneuploidy in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are many different types and origins of aneuploidy, but whether there is a uniform cellular response to aneuploidy in human cells has not been addressed so far. To uncover a uniform transcriptional response to aneuploidy we evaluted the transcription profiles of trisomic and tetrasomic cell lines and cell lines with complex aneuploid karyotypes.

DESIGN
mRNA expression analysis of aneuploid cell lines derived from HCT116 compared to the HCT116 diploid cell line. With the exception of HCT116 3/3, three biological replicates of the Microarray experiment were performed.
