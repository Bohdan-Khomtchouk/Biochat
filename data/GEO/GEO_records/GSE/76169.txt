TITLE
DNA-methylation profiling of Whole blood genomic DNAs collected from participants of  Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study the association of DNA-methylation and metabolic memory by examing DNA-methylation alternation between cases (received conventional therapy in DCCT  and showing retinopathy or albuminuria progression at EDIC year-10)  and Controls (in DCCT intensive treatment group  and did not have retinopathy or nephropathy progression during EDIC).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 63 whole blood samples (32 Cases and 31 Controls) were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip arrays.
