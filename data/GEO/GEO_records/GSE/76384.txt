TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of MCL-treated leukemic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the molecular mechanisms by which MCL may induce apoptosis, microarray gene expression profiling of MCL-treated KG1a cells was performed.

DESIGN
MCL induced gene expression in KG1a cell was measured at 8 hours after exposure to doses of 10ÂµM. Each sample was performed in triplicate.
