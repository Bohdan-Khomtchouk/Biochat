TITLE
OSCC whole genome expression by T stage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes between T4 and T1 stage human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)

DESIGN
36 OSCC samples separated by tumor size T stage, in dual color microarray, using a pool of human cell lines as control. Screening for differentially expressed genes was performed in a cohort of 36 patients randomly selected. Transcriptional profiles were performed using Agilent one color hybridizations in a G4851A platform.
