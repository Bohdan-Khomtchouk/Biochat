TITLE
General retardation of mRNA degradation caused by speB 5â€™ UTR partial deletion in Streptococcus pyogenes

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131

SUMMARY
The speB gene of Streptococcus pyogenes has a long 5' UTR with unknown functions. Preliminary studies showed that the partial mutation of this region led to altered expression patterns of the speB gene and ropB, its upstream gene. In this study, we used microarray to examine the effect of speB 5' UTR mutation on the S. pyogenes transcriptome.
