TITLE
Expression data of NIH3T3 in G0 and G1 phases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH3T3 in the middle of G0 to G1 transion consists of the cells which is still staying G0 phase and the cells which enters G1. Monitoring the expressions of p27 and Cdt1 enables to distinguish these two; p27+/Cdt1+ cells as the cells in G0 phase and p27-Cdt1+ cells as G1 phase We sorted  p27+Cdt1+ (G0) NIH3T3 cells and p27-Cdt1+ (G1) NIH3T3 cells in the middle of G0-G1 transition, 5 hours after serum addition following the serum addition using mVenus-p27K- and mCherry-hCdt1(30/120) . We compared the expression profiles of these NIH3T3 cells in G0 and G1 phases and identified the genes upregulated in G0 or G1 phases.

DESIGN
The p27+Cdt1+ (G0) NIH3T3 cells and p27-Cdt1+ (G1) NIH3T3 cells were sorted by FACS for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
