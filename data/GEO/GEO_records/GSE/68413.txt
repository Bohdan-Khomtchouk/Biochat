TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CREB knockdown in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed to examine genetic consequences that resulted from shRNA mediate knockdown of CREB in the four ALL cell lines Jurkat, Nalm6, Molt4, and RS4;11 using two CREB shRNAs.

DESIGN
Leukemic cells were incubated with lentiviral supernatants for one or two consecutive days after which stably transduced cells were expanded. Transduced cells were pelleted and total RNA was isolated from CREB or scrambled transduced cells. The quality control, RNA labeling, hybridization, and data extraction was profiled on Illumina Human v2 Expression BeadChips, all performed at ServiceXS B.V.
