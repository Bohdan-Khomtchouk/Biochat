TITLE
The FtsH3 protease is an epistatic master regulator of the iron and phosphate stress responses in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Regulation of gene expression is a sophisticated process leading to the activation or suppression of genes due to adaptation to environmental stimuli. The membrane-embedded FtsH proteases conserved in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria, are involved in such regulation. The genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes four FtsH homologues FtsH1-4, functioning in the form of oligomeric complexes. Homologue FtsH3 is bound in two hetero-oligomeric complexes, FtsH1/FstH3 and/or FtsH2/FtsH3, respectively. Previous data showed that the FtsH1/FtsH3 complex is involved in the acclimation of cells to iron deficiency by controlling the availability of the transcriptional regulator Fur (Sll0567). To gain more comprehensive insight into the physiological role of FtsH hetero-complexes, we carried out genome-wide expression profiling of a mutant conditionally depleted in FtsH3, grown under nutrient sufficiency and iron depletion. Our results show, that besides Fur, also the SufR and Pho regulons belong to the set of genes controlled by FtsH. Moreover, by combining the transcriptome data with in silico prediction we identified novel targets of Fur in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Fur tends to evoke mostly repression, but also appears to activate some target genes.

DESIGN
We monitored the global gene expression in a conditional Synechocystis PCC6083 ftsH knockdown strain (FtsHdown) (Boehm et al., 2012) and a control strain (WT) at standard conditions and at iron depletion. The presence of ammonia to induced the conditional knockdown. Each sample was done in biological replicates.
