TITLE
Gene expression studies to identify skeletal muscle genes related to stress in pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of porcine muscle Semimembranosus were studied to identify genes beeing significantly affected by pre-slaughter stress or no stress treatment in pigs of different breed (Italian Duroc, Italian Large White or Pietrain) and differnt Halothane genotype (RYR1 locus CC-NN, CT-Nn or TT-nn) in Pietrain pigs.

DESIGN
