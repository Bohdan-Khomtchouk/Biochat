Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray analyses and subsequent verification by RT-PCR, we studied the changes in gene expression in the inferior colliculus after an ictal event in one models of audiogenic epilepsy, genetic audiogenic seizure hamster (GASH:Sal). GASH:Sal, a hamster strain developed at the University of Salamanca, exhibits genetic audiogenic epilepsy similar to human Grand Mal epilepsy. GASH:Sal shows an autosomal recessive inheritance for susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, which manifest more severely in young animals; the seizure severity progressively declines with age. Genetic animal models of epilepsy are an important tool for further understanding the basic cellular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and for developing novel antiepileptic drugs. We conducted a comparative study of gene expression in the inferior colliculus, a nucleus that triggers audiogenic seizures, using two animal models, the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR) and the genetic audiogenic seizure hamster (GASH:Sal). For this purpose, both models were subjected to auditory stimulation, and 60 minutes after stimulation, the inferior colliculi were collected. As a control, intact Wistar rats and Syrian hamsters were subjected to identical stimulation and tissue preparation protocols to those performed on the experimental animals.
