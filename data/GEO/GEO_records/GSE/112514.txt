TITLE
Towne induced changes to human foreskin fibroblast transcriptional activity.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblasts infected with human cyotmegalovirus strain Towne at a multiplicity of infection equal to 6. Host transcriptional levels were quantitated at 12 and 96 hours post infection using Illumina HT-12 beadarrays. These array depostions are an extension of a previous submission, GSE50955.

DESIGN
Cells were infected in biological triplicate then harvested at 12 and 96 hpi time points when they were assayed for transcriptional activity.
