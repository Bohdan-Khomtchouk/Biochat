SUMMARY
affy_popsec_nancy_stomata_poplar  - This project aims to identify genes of interest for water deficit acclimation and/or adaptation in a tree species: poplar. We look for genes and gene expression networks related to drought stress. We intend to analyse the transcriptome in laser-microdissected stomata, in two genotypes, Carpaccio and Soligo, at various stages and intensities of stress. In response to water deficit, water loss is adjusted through stomatal conductance. Transcriptome of pure stomatal material should bring valuable information hardly reachable in whole leaf transcriptome analysis. The comparison between medium and severe stress intensities and between early and long term stresses will power the selection of genes of interest. The co-analysis of two genotypes of contrasted tolerance to water deficit should help to discriminate genes presenting a potential adaptative character from genes responding passively to the constraint.-Two poplar clones, Soligo (S) and Carpaccio (C) were submitted to 4 treatments: control, mild water deficit, moderate water deficit (12-day long for both) and early-drought stress (about 36-h long). Growth and physiology was characterised on a batch of plants and samples collected on another batch of plants. Five hundred stomata (one thousand five hundreds guard cells) were laser microdissected in mature leaves of each tree. Stomata from 3 trees (1500) were pooled for total RNAs extraction. A pool is considered as one biological replicate and corresponds to one Affymetrix slide. The two biological replicates originate from the same experiment. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
