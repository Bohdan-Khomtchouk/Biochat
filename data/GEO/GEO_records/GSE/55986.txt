TITLE
Expression data from mouse whole bladders of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the gene expression of non-bacterial bladdder inflammation, mouse cyclophosphamide(CYP)-induced model of cystitis was adapted. Forty-eight hour after CYP or vehicle treatment, total RNA was extracted from CYP-treated group (CYP150) and control group (CYP0). We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying bladder inflammation.

DESIGN
Five-week-old female Balbc/A mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150mg/kg body weight of CYP diluted in 15ml/kg body weight of saline. Mice injected with saline alone served as controls. Treated mice were killed 48 hours after administaration and the whole bladders harvested. Total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed.
