TITLE
Drug treatment of colorectal and endometrial cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used expression profiling of colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer cell lines treated with demethylating agents to search for epigenetically regulated miRNAs. The study included three MMR-deficient colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, HCT15, and RKO), two MMR-proficient colorectal cancer cell lines (SW480, and T84) and two MMR-deficient endometrial cancer cell lines (AN3CA and HEC59).

DESIGN
Cancer cell lines were cultured and divided to two parts. One part of cell culture was treated with demethylating agents (5 uM 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine, Sigma A3656, for 96 hours and with 300 nM trichostatin, Sigma T1952, for 18 hours). The other part of cancer cell line was cultured without treatments. All treatments were performed in duplicates.
