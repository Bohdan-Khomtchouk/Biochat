TITLE
RNASeq analysis of Salmonella B cell infection model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome analysis of S. enterica 14028 during infection of murine B cells. Mice spleens were infected with Salmonella enterica 14028. Mouse spleens were harvested and cells FACS sorted into various immune cells containing bacteria. Short reads were mapped to the S. enterica 14028 genome.

DESIGN
Mice were infected with S. enterica strain 14028. Spleens were collected, homogenized and cells FACS sorted. Total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana RNA isolation kit. Purified RNA was depleted of rRNA utilizing the epicentre ribozero metabacteria and eukaryotic kits.
