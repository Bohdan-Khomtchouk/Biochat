TITLE
Distinct signal transduction pathways downstream of the (P)RR revealed by microarray and ChIP-chip analyses [Expt: Geni_Bafi]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Within the overall project, we performed a set of microarray and chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments using siRNA against the (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR), stable overexpression of PLZF, the PLZF translocation inhibitor genistein and the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin to dissect transcriptional pathways downstream of the (P)RR.

DESIGN
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from KELLY cells incubated with genistein or bafilomycin A1. Five intervention samples and three control samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Chipinspector (Genomatix Software GmbH) and a FDR of 0.5% (bafilomycin), 5% (genistein): genistein- versus DMSO- and bafilomycin- versus DMSO-treated cells. ChipInspector carries out significance analysis on the single probe level. Normalized probe set level data not provided for individual Sample records. Processed data is available on Series record.
