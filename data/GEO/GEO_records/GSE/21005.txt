TITLE
Expression data from different stages and types of oocytes and cumulus cells (CCs)

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The bidirectional communication between bovine oocytes and CCs is vital for functioning and development of both cell types. We used microarray to identify genes which are differentially expressed between germinal vesicle (GV)- and metaphase II (MII)-stage oocytes and CCs and those differentially expressed when oocytes mature with or without the other. We also identified genes differentially expressed between CCs at GV and MII stages.

DESIGN
Slaughterhouse ovaries were collected and GV-stage cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated. Different stages and types of oocytes and CCs were used for total RNA isolation and hybridisation on Affymetrix microarray.
