TITLE
Gene Expression in mice liver after knockdown of Rab5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAi-mediated silencing of Rab5 and the consequent loss of endosomes in the mouse liver caused severe metabolic defects such as hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia and glycogen accumulation. Gene expression in mice liver after knockdown of Rab5 has been performed the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays to identify biological processes and pathways affected by Rab5.

DESIGN
The mice received either PBS or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with siRNAs agains Rab5all or Luciferase control at 1.5 mg/kg via tail vein injection. At 5 day post injection mice were sacrificed using cervical dislocation and liver tissue was harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation; Gene expression studies were performed applying the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays.
