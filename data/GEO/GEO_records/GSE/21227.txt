TITLE
Characterization of the RNA content of chromatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We deep sequenced chromatin-associated RNAs (CARs) from human fibroblast (HF) cells. This resulted in the identification of 141 intronic regions and 74 intergenic regions harbouring CARS.

DESIGN
We purified CARs from normal HFs by isolating soluble chromatin after MNase treatment, followed by separation of chromatin fragments of different lengths on a sucrose gradient. CARs were converted into double-stranded cDNAs and sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer I.
