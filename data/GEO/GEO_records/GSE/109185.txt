TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of iPSC-derived keratinocytes with or without a disease-associated TP63 mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were generated from two patients affected by ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia and clefting (AEC), an ectodermal dysplasia caused by mutations in TP63. The two TP63mutations(I537T and R598L) were corrected using Crispr/Cas9- mediated homologous recombination. The resulting conisogenic iPSC pairs were differentiated into keratinocytes and subjected to RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
2 conisogenic pairs of AEC and gene-corrected iPSC-derived keratinocytes were analyzed (4 samples total)

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
