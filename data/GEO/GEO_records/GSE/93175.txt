TITLE
RNA sequencing  quantitative analysis of exosome miRNAs in plasma in Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Since clinical characteristics are often inaccurate and subjective, we evaluated the prognostic value of plasma exosomal miRNAs to predict survival in metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). Methods: RNA sequencing was performed to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs associated with overall survival in a screening cohort of 41 mRCC patients.Candidate miRNAs were further evaluated for prognosis by TaqMan quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a follow-up cohort of 65 mRCC patients. Results: RNA sequencing in screening cohort generated 3.75 million mappable reads per patient, of those with normalized read counts > 8 RPM (reads per million), 93.8% were mapped to miRNAs for a total of 322 unique miRNAs. Cox regression analysis identified 20 miRNAs that were associated with overall survival (OS, FDR < 0.05). Among these 20 significant miRNAs, three were validated in a separate independent cohort of 65 patients with mRCC.Patients with lower expression of miR-26a1-3p, miR-let-7i-5p and miR-615-3p had a significantly poorer OS than those with higher expression. Multivariate model by combining miR-let-7i-5p and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score significantly improved survival prediction. Conclusions: Our study identifies multiple plasma exosomal miRNAs showing association with survival in mRCC stage patients. Multivariate model by combining miR-let-7i-5p and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score significantly improved survival prediction.

DESIGN
exosomal miRNAs profiles of 41 mRCC patients were generated by 50 bp single read sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000 DNA sequence analyzer.
