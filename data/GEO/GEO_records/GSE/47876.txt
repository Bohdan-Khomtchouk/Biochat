TITLE
Expression data from uninephrectomized dogs compared to sham operated dogs

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Renal insufficiency is a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease. In this study our aim was to investigate functional and structural changes in the heart of dogs with mild renal insufficiency induced by uninephrectomy (UNX).  In addition to comprehensively assessing functional parameters 12 week after UNX or sham surgery, we harvested tissue for assessment of structural changes.  Microarray analyses were performed on snap frosen tissue from the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) of UNX  and sham operated animals.  Gene expression in LA was compared between the groups, and gene expression in the LV was compared between the groups.  We aimed to assess whether a potentially altered gene expression in the heart of the UNX group also included genes associated with cardiac remodeling.
