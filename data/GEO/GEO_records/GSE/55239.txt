TITLE
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 : Wild-type cell harboring plasmid (pAST2) in nutrient media

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. oleivorans DR1 cells harboring pAST2. Plasmid pAST2 is a tetracycline-resistance plasmid which was isolated from activated sludge (Hong et al., 2014). The complete plasmid sequence was deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank under accession number KC734561 [PMID: 24337108].

DESIGN
Acquisition of TC resistance through plasmid uptake is related to loss of biological fitness and affected host gene expression in oil-degrading soil bacterium, Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1. To identify genes in A. oleivorans DR1 harboring pAST2, the cells were grown to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.4) and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.
