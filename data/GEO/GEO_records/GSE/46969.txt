TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for 29 MCL cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA from four 29 cases, 38 tumor samples (23 PB, 12 LN, 1 Tonsil, 1 colonic biopsy, 1 spleen) and 29 normal DNA from the same patients were analyzed with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform for copy number alterations study. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from blood samples, lymph nodes and other tissues like spleen, tonsil and colonic biopsy

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 29 MCL cases samples and their respective matched non-tumor DNA, which were used as references for copy number inference.
