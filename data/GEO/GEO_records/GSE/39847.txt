TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in T-ALL and B-ALL of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in leukemia cases may predict the clinical outcome of the patients and may improve the treatment for specific leukemia subtypes. The goal is to compare the differences in gene expression pattern between T-ALL and B-ALL subtypes in Malaysian childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

DESIGN
Microarray study was carried out on 29 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia which include T-ALL and B-ALL subtype based on immunophenotyping and molecular result. Data on gene expression level was later confirmed using qRT-PCR.
