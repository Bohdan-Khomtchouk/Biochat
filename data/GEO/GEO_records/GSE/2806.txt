TITLE
Transcriptional profile of an acs2Ts1 mutant yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild-type and the acs2Ts1 mutant yeasts were shifted from 25deg to 37deg. After 60 minutes, Yeasts were harvested and divided into 2 x 2 cell samples. Total RNAs were purified from 4 populations. Keywords: WT vs mutant

DESIGN
microarray data of 2 x 2 = 4 samples were background-corrected with RMA. Because of a global change in expression, the data were taken as 1 x 2 = 2 means and normalized with controls using lowess curve.
