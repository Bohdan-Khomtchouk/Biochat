TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide binding of the insulator factors CTCF and CP190

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified about 3000 CTCF sites in the genome. In addition to binding to CTCF sites we found CP190 to bind to transcriptional start sites of actively transcribed genes where it inversely correlates with nucleosome occupancy. Keywords: ChIP-chip
