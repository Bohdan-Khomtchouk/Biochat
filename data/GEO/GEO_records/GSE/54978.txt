TITLE
Map Brachyury-bound enhancers by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain new mechanistic insights into highly-regulated lineage specification and morphogenetic processes during early embryogenesis, we applied ChIP-seq to identify transcriptional programs mediated by a key developmental regulator - Brachyury.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cells were differentiated into Brachyury-positive mesoendoderm cells. And, ChIP-seq experiments were carried out by two independent Brachyury antibodies.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
