TITLE
Differential Gene Expression and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Imprinting center deletion (PWS- IC del) Mouse model of Prader-Willi Syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by deficiency of imprinted gene expression from the paternal chromosome 15q11-15q13 and clinically characterized by neonatal hypotonia, short stature, cognitive impairment, hypogonadism, hyperphagia, morbid obesity and diabetes. Previous clinical studies suggest that a defect in energy metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of PWS. Assessment of enzyme activities of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in the brain, heart, liver and muscle were assessed. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlyingthe PWS and identified distinct classes of disregulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Skeletal (quadriceps) muscle Vastus Lateralis and whole brain samples from the mutant mice and their wild-type age-matched littermates were analyzed by microarray technology using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix).
