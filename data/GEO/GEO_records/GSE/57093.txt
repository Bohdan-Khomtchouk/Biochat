TITLE
Transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to potassium starvation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the transcriptional response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to potassium starvation. To this end yeast cells were grown for 60 min in media without potassium or in media with a standard potassium concnetration (50 mM KCl).   Using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)-tag sequencing the effect of potassium starvation on the transcriptome was determined.

DESIGN
4 samples of cells grown in media without potassium and 4 samples of cells grown in the presence of potassium were analyzed.
