TITLE
0.3M NaCl vs Control and 2M NaCl vs Control

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans R1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Deinococcus radiodurans comparing control untreated wild type cells with wild type cells treated with 0.3M NaCl or 2M NaCl

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. 0.3 M NaCl. Biological replicates: 4 replicates (Two replicates per array, N=8), dye-swapped, independently grown and harvested.
