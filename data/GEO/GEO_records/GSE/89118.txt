TITLE
DNA methylome analysis identifies transcription factor-based epigenomic signatures of multi-lineage competence in neural stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a microarray experiment to compare gene expression profiles of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) isolated form E11.5, E14.5 and E18.5 mouse brain and differentiated cells such as neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes).

DESIGN
18 samples
