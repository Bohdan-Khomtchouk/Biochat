TITLE
Comparison of Transient + articular cartilage (TC+AC) over pure transient cartilage (TC) from both E12 and E14 chicken tibia

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
During the past two decades although many genes e.g.,Gdf5, Wnt9a, Noggin etc. have been identified and characterized in joint development, still a comprehensive understanding of molecular network operational in articular cartilage morphogenesis is far from being drawn. This might be due to incompleteness in the number of molecules identified. We used microarray profiling to identify chicken articular cartilage specific genes. We decided to conduct microarray-based transcriptome comparison of HH38 (E12) and HH40 (E14). As it is difficult to clearly dissect out articular cartilage even at these late stages we decided to identify the transcripts that are enriched in the transient + articular cartilage (TC+AC) over pure transient cartilage (TC) thus using TC as control or reference samples

DESIGN
Transient + articular cartilage (TC+AC) and pure transient cartilage (TC) were dissected out of both E12 and E14 chicken tibia. Many such tissues were pooled together and RNA was isolated using Trizol method. The RNA solution was cleaned-up using Qiagen micro KIT. 5 microgram of total RNA for each sample was used. Pure transient cartilage (TC) was used as reference samples
