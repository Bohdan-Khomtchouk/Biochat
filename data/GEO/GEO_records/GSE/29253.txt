TITLE
Gene expression changes upon Dot1L knockdown and Dot1L inhibitor treatment during reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through a loss-of-function approach, we identified that inhibition of the histone methyltransferase, Dot1L, accelerated somatic cell reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and substituted for Klf4 and c-Myc in the reprogramming cocktail. To understand the mechanism by which Dot1L inhibition results in these phenotypes, we carried out gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
GSM723207-GSM723224: Embryonic stem cell-derived fibroblasts (dH1fs) were retrovirally transduced in culture with vectors expressing either a control shRNA or an shRNA targeting Dot1L. These cells were then superinfected with either Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) retroviruses or Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OSM) retroviruses. Total RNA was harvested 6 days later. There were three biologic replicates for each condition. GSM880675-GSM880682: dH1fs were treated with 10uM Dot1L inhibitor (EPZ004777) and then superinfected with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) retroviruses. Total RNA was harvested 6 days later. There were two biologic replicates for each condition.
