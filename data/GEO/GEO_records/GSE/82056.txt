TITLE
Genome-wide identification and characterization of small RNAs in Rhodobacter capsulatus and identification of small RNAs affected by loss of the response regulator CtrA

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter capsulatus

SUMMARY
We present the first genome-wide identification and characterizaion of 422 novel sRNAs in R. capsulatus. In addition we report a comparative analysis of conserved sRNAs across 24 bacterial species.

DESIGN
Genome-wide identification of sRNAs in R. capsulatus
