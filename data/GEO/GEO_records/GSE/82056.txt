TITLE
Genome-wide identification and characterization of small RNAs in Rhodobacter capsulatus and identification of small RNAs affected by loss of the response regulator CtrA

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We present the first genome-wide identification and characterizaion of 422 novel sRNAs in R. capsulatus. In addition we report a comparative analysis of conserved sRNAs across 24 bacterial species.
