TITLE
Comparative expression profiling of miRNA during anther development in genetic male sterile and wild type cotton [degradome]

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
In this study, in order to identify miRNA targets, a degradome library derived from anthers of the WT and GMS (Genetic Male Sterility) mutant representing three stages of development was constructed and sequenced, resulting in the generation of 24.6 million raw reads. After removal of low quality sequences and adapter sequences, 24.4 million clean reads were obtained and 98% were 20 or 21 nt in length as expected in that normally length distribution peak of degradome fragment is between 20 and 21 nt [Addo-Quaye C, Eshoo TW, Bartel DP, Axtell MJ: Endogenous siRNA and miRNA targets identified by sequencing of the Arabidopsis degradome. Curr Biol 2008, 18:758-762].

DESIGN
Identification of miRNA targets in the WT and GMS muant anthers. Anthers of the WT and GMS mutant representing three stages of development [the meiosis stage (WT: Mar-F-1; mutant: Mar-S-1) and tetrad stage (WT: Mar-F-2; mutant: Mar-S-2), together with the uninucleate microspore stage (WT: Mar-F-3; mutant: Mar-S-3) from the GMS ‘Dong A’ mutant and its fertile wild type] were collected during early mornings.

PLATFORM
