TITLE
Analysis of altered LncRNA expression profiles in proximal renal tubular cells in response to calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal adhesion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study aims to assess the potential changes in LncRNAs of proximal renal cells in response to the adhesion of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals.

DESIGN
lncRNA microarray were applied to evaluate the expression of HK-2 cells exposed to COM crystal for 0 and 24 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
