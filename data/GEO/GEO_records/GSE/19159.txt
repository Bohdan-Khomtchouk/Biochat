TITLE
Genomic profiling of ductal breast carcinoma to identify high risk small node negative breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract:   Purpose: To identify a DNA signature to predict metastasis of small node-negative breast carcinoma  Experimental Design: The authors used Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) array to analyze 168 pT1T2pN0 invasive ductal carcinoma patients with either good (no event 5 years after diagnosis: 111 patients) or poor (57 patients with early onset metastasis) outcome. A CGH classifier, identifying low and high-risk groups of metastatic recurrence, was established in a training set of 78 patients. This classifier was based on both genomic regions with statistically different alterations between the two groups of clinical outcome and the number of alterations. It was then tested on a validation set of 90 patients and compared to clinicopathological parameters.  Results: The genomic status of regions located on chromosomes 2p22.2, 3p23 and 8q21-24 and the number of segmental alterations were defined in the training set to classify tumors into low or high-risk groups. In the validation set, this CGH classifier produced a highly significant odds ratio of 10.39 (95%CI: 3.75-28.78, p=6.63×10-6, Wald test) in univariate analysis with a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 84% and an accuracy rate of 78%. The 5-year metastasis-free survival analysis showed a highly significant difference between the two predicted groups (Hazard Ratio=5.7, p=1.82×10-7, log-rank test). Together with estrogen receptor and grade, this CGH classifier provided significant prognostic information in multivariate analysis.   Conclusions: In addition to classical parameters, this DNA signature may constitute an accurate tool to identify patients with T1T2N0 luminal tumors, who may benefit from adjuvant treatments.
