TITLE
Gene expression of abnormal uric acid synthesis animal model of silk worm Bombyx mori.

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Uric acid (UA) is the final product of purine metabolism and plays an important role as a physiological antioxidant. In recent years, several different groups have reported a correlation between decreased UA in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) and clinical progression and stage of PD. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of decreased UA under oxidative stress. We used our systematic functional annotation pipeline for silkworm genes to identify a novel UA metabolic pathway regulator under oxidative stress in a UA metabolism mutant silkworm Bombyx mori model.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 3day of fifth instar larvae of abnormal uric acid synthesis Bombyx mori mutant of op.
