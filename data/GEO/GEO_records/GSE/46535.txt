TITLE
Transcriptional impact of removing H2A.Z

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We profiled the strand-specific transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking SWR1 and HTZ1 and compared it to the wild-type transcriptome

DESIGN
3'-end RNA-seq was performed on RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type and swr1 htz1 strains (two biological replicates each)

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
