TITLE
Regulation of neuronal gene and miRNA expression by the complement protein C1q associated with neuroprotection

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of transcriptional profiles stimulated by the complement protein C1q in rat immature neurons associated with the C1q-dependent neuroprotection observed in vitro. Use of the unbiased whole genome microarray approach to identify genes regulated by C1q.

DESIGN
Immature neurons grown in vitro for 3 days were stimulated with 10 nM C1q for 3h.
