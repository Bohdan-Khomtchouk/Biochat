TITLE
comparison ws vs de and dy-Impact of a plastidial redox perturbation on Arabidopsis transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af47_thioredoxins - comparison ws vs de and dy - Knock-out mutants of the ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase were used to evaluate the impact of the redox perturbation of the plastidial thioredoxins on Arabidopsis transcriptome. - Wild-type (WS) and two T-DNA mutant lines for the variable subunit of ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase ( DY and DE from INRA of Versailles collection) were compared Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
