TITLE
Expression in Aneuploid Drosophila S2 Cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromosomal and segmental aneuploidies are usually lethal or common features of cancer cells and variety of disease, but little is known about how copy number relates to gene expression. Drosophila males have a single X chromosome and two sets of autosomes, but X chromosome and autosome transcripts are equally abundant.  This 2-fold increase in X chromosome gene expression requires a dosage compensation complex (MSL) that acetylates histone 4 at lysine 16 (H4AcK16).  To determine the contribution of general buffering and MSL to X chromosome dosage compensation, we analyzed genome-wide copy number, expression and histone modification pattern in male Drosophila S2 cells with and without MSL. Keywords: Gene Regulation Study, genomic analyses

DESIGN
RNA-seq and microarray were performed in Drosophila non-treated or RNAi treated S2 cells. Two biological replicates were used for expression profile. DNA-seq and CGH were performed (CGH data forthcoming) to check the copy number variation in S2 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed in Drosophila non-treated or RNAi treated S2 cells with different histone modification antibodies. At least three biological replicates were performed for each antibody and treatment.
