TITLE
Genomic signatures characterize leukocyte infiltration in myositis muscles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immune cell infiltration in myositis were by examining microarray expression profiles in muscle biopsies from 31 myositis patients and 5 normal controls.

DESIGN
Muscle samples from 36 subjects (5 normal controls, 5 NM, 8 DM, 8 PM and 10 IBM) were studied
