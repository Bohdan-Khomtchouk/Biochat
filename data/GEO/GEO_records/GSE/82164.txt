TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of diaphragms from FKRPP448L-NSG and NSG mice induced by swimming exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle pre-injury is commonly used prior to cell transplantation to enhance engraftment and to further promote homing of injected cells to diseased muscles. To better understand the changes that occurred in the diaphragm upon swimming (1hour/day for 2 weeks), we analyzed global changes using RNA-Seq in dystrophic FKRPP448L-NSG mice as well as in NSG control mice.

DESIGN
Diaphragm mRNA profiles of 8-10 week old  FKRPP448L-NSG and NSG mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
