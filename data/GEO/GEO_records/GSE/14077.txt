TITLE
RPCC analysis of rap1-sil, tpk1 & tpk2.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RPCC (RNA pol II ChIP-on-chip) experiments with different mutants that affect to the accumulation of non active RNA pol II along the yeast genome. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
There are 4 different strains: rap1-sil (without the silencing domain), RAP1 (both from Graham I.R. et al 1999) and tpk1 & tpk2 mutants (Euroscarf). The IP was done using an Ab against the RNApol II CTD (8WG16 Covance).There are 3 independent biological replicates of Rap1 and rap1-sil experiments and 2 for the tpk1 & tpk2 experiments.
