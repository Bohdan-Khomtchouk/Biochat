TITLE
Vibrio cholerae stringent response

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
This study is an analysis of changes in gene expression during stringent response in Vibrio cholerae. V. cholerae cells in mid-log were treated with serine hydroxamate and gene expression was compared to untreated cells. Keywords: Stress response, stringent response

DESIGN
V. cholerae cells in mid-log were treated with the stringent response inducer serine hydroxamate for one doubling time, then RNA was harvested using a Trizol method.  Mock-treated cells (V. cholerae with dH2O added) also had RNA harvested.  Both serine-hydroxamate treated and wild type cell RNA was converted to cDNA, with one set incorporating Cy5, the other Cy3, with fluorophores reversed in the multiple analyses.  RNA from both conditions was applied to a whole genome PCR microarray from V. cholerae N16961, containing two sets of every ORF.  Data was analyzed by Genepix and Rosetta Resolver.
