TITLE
Racial Difference in Human Platelet PAR4 Reactivity Reflects Expression of PCTP and miR-376c

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Racial differences in the pathophysiology of atherothrombosis are poorly understood.  We explored the function and transcriptome of platelets in healthy black (n=70) and white (n=84) subjects. Numerous differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were associated with both race and PAR4 reactivity, including phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP), and platelets from blacks expressed higher levels of PC-TP protein.

DESIGN
Purified platellets were obtained from 154 healthy volunteers not taking blood thinning medication, suffering from blood diseases or otherwise excluded for health reasons. RNA was extracted and profiled on these subjects.  Simultaneously, purified platelets were phenotyped using aggregation in response to stimulation with agonist.  The agonist response scores and races as ewll as gene expression values on these individuals are provided.
