TITLE
Gene expression data from 4T1 cells stably transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding a control shRNA (shscramble) or two shRNAs targeting TM4SF1 (shTM4SF1-1 and shTM4SF1-5) and from 4TO7 cells stably expressing with or without TM4SF1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profile between shscramble with shTM4SF1 knockingdown 4T1 cells and between 4TO7 cells stably expressing with or without TM4SF1

DESIGN
