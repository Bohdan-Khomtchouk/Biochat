Expression data from ES cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H2A.B is a unique histone H2A variant that shares only 40 ~ 50 % sequence identity with canonical H2A. It has only been identified in mammals and has quickly evolved with remarkable sequence diversity among different species. H2A.B is ubiquitously expressed in most cells and tissues. It is mainly deposited in gene body region.The localization of H2A.B is associated with methylated CpG islands in mouse ES cells.H2A.B facilitates transcription elongation to go through methylated CpG islands in the gene bodies. One typical example is that H2A.B regulates transcription elongation at imprinted loci. We used microarray to test the function of H2A.B on gene expression.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells infected with control knockdown(KD) or H2A.B KD virus were treated with G418. ES cells were extracted for RNA and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
