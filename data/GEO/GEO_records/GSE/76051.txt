TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome of the coleoptile and the first leaf treated by white light or shade in rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Purpose: In order to figure out the tissue-specific mechanism in rice, we collected coleoptiles and the first leaves separately from the seedlings treated by 1 hr shade or white light for RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Methods:Coleoptiles were collected from two-day-old rice seedlings grown under white light treated with or without 1hr shade for RNA sequencing. The first leaves were collected from three-days-old rice seedlings grown under white light treated with or without 1 hr shade for RNA sequencing. 2x150 bp paired end RNA-sequencing was conducted using an Illuminia Hi-seq 2500 platform from Genergy Biotech Co. Ltd. (Genergy, Shanghai, China).

PLATFORM
