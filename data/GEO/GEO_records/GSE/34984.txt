TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in aquaporin PIP1;2 deficient Arabodposis plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The leaf transcriptome of the Arabidopsis thaliana aquaporin gene PIP1;2 T-DNA insertion line was compared to that of control plants. In total 730 genes were found to be differentially regulated. This regulation pattern was compared to mild drought stress and low CO2 Affymetrix data to elucidate whether loss of the aquaporin resembles transcriptomic changes of drought stress or lack of CO2 supply. Mild drought stress data were obtained from Harb A, Krishnan A, Ambavaram MMR, Pereira A (2010) Molecular and Physiological Analysis of Drought Stress in Arabidopsis Reveals Early Responses Leading to Acclimation in Plant Growth. Plant Physiology 154: 1254-1271 (GSE24177). Low CO2 data were obtained from Oliver E. Bläsing, Yves Gibon, Manuela Günther, Melanie Höhne, Rosa Morcuende, Daniel Osuna, Oliver Thimm, Björn Usadel, Wolf-Rüdiger Scheible, and Mark Stitt (2005) Sugars and Circadian Regulation Make Major Contributions to the Global Regulation of Diurnal Gene Expression in Arabidopsis. The Plant Cell, Vol. 17, 3257-3281 (GSE3423).
