TITLE
AhR activation by TCDD in the ET, cortical epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by TCDD results ampng other phenotypes in severe thymic atrophy accompanied by immunosuppression. The link between thymic atrophy, skewed thymocyte differntiation and immunosuppression is still not fully resolved. This study investigates the TCDD elicted exprssion changes in the ET, cortical thymus epithelial cell line. Keywords: TCDD, AhR, thymic epithelial cells, thymic involution, thymus atrophy
