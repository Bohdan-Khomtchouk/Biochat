TITLE
Gene expression in the pancreas of healthy control, auto-antibody positive, and type 1 diabetic subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to identify differentially expressed genes in the pancreas of healthy humans, auto-antibody positive and type 1 diabetic patients. All samples were obtained from the network of pancreatic organ donors with diabetes (nPOD).  ID numbers are specified.  Patient information can be obtained at

DESIGN
Pancreas tissues were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).  Total RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Reagent Kit (Agilent). One color microarrays were performed at the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center using the SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K microarray kit (Agilent Technologies). All samples were processed and run at the same time.
