TITLE
Comparison of gene expression at day 11 of iPSC reprogramming with different reprogramming cocktails

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes altered upon LIN-41 expression during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells, human dermal fibroblasts were infected with combinations of GFP alone, OSK, OSKM, OSK+LIN-41, or OSK+let-7 inhibitor (transfected on days 1 and 6). After 11 days, TRA-1-60+ reprogramming cells were isolated as described in Tanabe et al 2013 or in the case of GFP-infected fibroblasts, GFP+ cells were collected. Total RNA was used for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
After 11 days of reprogramming with OSK, OSK+let-7inh, OSKM, or OSK+LIN-41, TRA-1-60+ cells were isolated and total RNA was isolated.
