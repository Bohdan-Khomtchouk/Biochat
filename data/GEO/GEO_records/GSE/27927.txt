TITLE
Post-fasting olfactory, transcriptional, and feeding responses in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The sensation of hunger after a period of fasting and the sensation of satiety after eating is crucial to behavioral regulation of food intake, but the biological mechanisms regulating these sensations are incompletely understood. We studied the behavioral and physiological adaptation to fasting in the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster). Here we show that flies demonstrated increased behavioral attraction to food odor when food-deprived with no corresponding increase in sensitivity in the peripheral olfactory system. Flies increased their food intake transiently in the post-fasted state, but returned to a stable baseline feeding level within 24 hr after return to food. This modulation in feeding was accompanied by a significant increase in the size of the crop organ of the digestive system, suggesting that fasted flies responded both by increasing their food intake and storing reserve food in their crop. The post-fasting feeding response was observed in both male and female flies of diverse genetic backgrounds. Expression profiling of head, body, and chemosensory tissues by microarray analysis revealed several hundred genes that are regulated by feeding state, including 247 genes in the fly head. We performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of, takeout, one of the genes strongly downregulated by fasting in multiple tissues. When takeout was knocked down in all neurons the post-fasting feeding response was abolished. These observations suggest that a coordinated transcriptional response to internal physiological state may regulate both ingestive behaviors and chemosensory perception of food

DESIGN
6 Pool of flies were used for this experiment. For each pool, samples were taken at 0,24 and 48h and separated in each body part. 56 samples were used for the analysis.
