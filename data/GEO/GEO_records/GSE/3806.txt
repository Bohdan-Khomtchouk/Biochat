TITLE
Histone H2B^3-32, H2B K- > G, H2B^3-37, and H2B^30-37 mutations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Histone H2B was mutated to give H2B^3-32, H2B K- > G, H2B^3-37, and H2B^30-37.  Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H2B HBR domain. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
