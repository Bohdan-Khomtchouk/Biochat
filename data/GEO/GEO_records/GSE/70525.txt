TITLE
Target miRNAs of MLL-AF9 as revealed by RNAi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study the function of MLL-AF9 was investigated by efficient and specific knockdown via siRNAs in the AML M5 cell line THP1 which harbors the corresponding t(9;11) translocation. MiRNA expression profile analyses revealed 21 differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed, each corresponding to a pool of five replicate experiments. MLL-AF9 knockdown treatments are represented by 2 samples employing two distinct siRNAs, each targeting MLL-AF9 breakpoint of THP1 cells. Control treatments are represented by 2 samples employing two distinct non-targeting control siRNAs.
