TITLE
Alpha-amanitin treatment effect on intronic transcription

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression profiles of prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP, treated or not with an inhibitor of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II), alpha-amanitin. These experiments pointed to a fraction of intronic messages that seems to be insensitive to alpha-amanitin or up-regulated in cells with blocked RNAP II transcription. Keywords: RNA-polymerase II inhibition experiments

DESIGN
Two samples of RNA isolated from alpha-amanitin-treated cells and two samples of control LNCaP cells were used in the hybridization experiments, performing a total of 4 hybridizations.
