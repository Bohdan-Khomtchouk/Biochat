TITLE
Identify the downstream targets of CHIR99021 and XAV939 in EpiSC using microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The requirements for self-renewal differ between EpiSCs and ES cells and the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that mouse EpiSCs can be efficiently derived and robustly propagated even from single cells, using two small-molecule inhibitors: CHIR99021 and XAV939. To better define how CHIR and XAV act together to maintain EpiSC self-renewal, we performed microarray analyses to identify their downstream targets. The data show the genes regulated by addition of CHIR, XAV or both.
