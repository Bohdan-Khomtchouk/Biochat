TITLE
PolyA site sequencing (PAS-seq) analysis of Hela cells treated with NC ASO or snoRD50a ASOs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our RNA-seq experiment and subsequent in vitro analysis suggested that snoRD50a is a trans-acting RNA that can function in mRNA 3' processing. To test this hypothesis at transcriptomic level, we performed PAS-seq experiments to compare the polyA+ transcripts profile between negative control ASO (nc ASO) and snoRD50a ASO treated Hela cells

DESIGN
ASO (antisense oligonucletode) technique is a commonly used technique to deplete nuclear RNAs. snoRD50a ASO is used to deplete endogenous snoRD50a. PAS-seq was performed in control and snoRD50a KD Hela cells
