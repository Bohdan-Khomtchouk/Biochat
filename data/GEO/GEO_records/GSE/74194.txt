TITLE
Muscle Transcriptome Profile of Resistance Exercise is Augmented by Aerobic Exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 male subjects performed ~45 min one-legged cycling and 4 x 7 maximal concentric-eccentric knee extensions for each leg 15 min later. Thus, one limb performed aerobic and resistance exercise (AE+RE), while the opposing leg did resistance exercise only (RE). Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis of each leg 3 h after the resistance exercise bout. Gene expression analysis was carried out on the Affymetrix HuGene-2.1-st platform.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle gene expression after a single bout of one-legged resistance type exercise only or one bout of one-legged resistance type exercise combined with one bout of aerobic exercise

PLATFORM
