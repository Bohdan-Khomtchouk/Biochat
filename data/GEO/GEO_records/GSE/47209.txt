TITLE
Differential regulation of gene expression by two isoforms of the human transcriptional coactivator MKL1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified two isoforms of human MKL1 that differ in their N-terminal domains. Since MKL1 is a transcriptional coactivator of SRF and regulates many SRF target genes, we wanted to analyze if transcription is differentially regulated by the two isoforms upon stimulation of the Rho-actin-MKL1-SRF pathway.

DESIGN
Activity of the Rho-actin-MKL1 pathway was induced in EcR293 cell lines stably over-expressing the empty vector control, a 5’UTR-full length MKL1_S construct, or a 5’UTR-full length MKL1_L construct by LPA treatment.
