TITLE
Investigation of the gene expression pattern of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) infiltrating γδT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fresh human HCC tissue and paired pertumor liver tissue were acquired, isolation of the infiltrating lymphocytes was conducted by discontinous density gradient centrifugation in Percoll. After removal of dead cells and incubation with components of TCRγ/δ isolation kit (Mitenyi Biotec), γδ T cells were positively selected from the single-cell suspension using autoMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) with recommended programs. Then we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to indentify genes which are differentially expressed between HCC-derived and paired peritumor-derived γδT cells.

DESIGN
Ten paired fresh HCC tissue and peritumor liver tissue were acquired and subjected to γδT cells isolation.
