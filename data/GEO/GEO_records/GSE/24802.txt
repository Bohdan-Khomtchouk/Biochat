TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deleted for different subunits of the THO/TREX complex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
THO/TREX is a conserved nuclear complex that functions in mRNP biogenesis at the interface of transcription-RNA export with a key role in preventing transcription-associated genome instability. We used microarrays to analyze the impact of different THO/TREX mutations on gene expression and found that THO-Sub2 deletions have a high functional impact on highly expressed, long and G+C-rich genes regardless of gene function.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPAD liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
