TITLE
Identification of genomic regions regulated by the Xrn1 and Upf1 proteins

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison of WT, xrn1 delta and upf1 delta strains were used in a tiling array to yield genomic regions regulated by these proteins The supplementary CHP files record either the signal in log2 space or the p-values in linear space, per TAS output.  The CHP files are further divided between UPF1 delta vs. WT and XRN1 delta vs. WT.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of WT, upf1 delta, and xrn1 delta from the BY4741 background were grown independently and analyzied by Affymetrix yeast tiling microarray analysis.
