TITLE
Separation of mouse ES cell-derived mesodermal cells based on the expression of Flk1, PDGFRa and CAR.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that mouse ES cell-derived Flk1+ cells could be subdivided into three population by the expression of PDGFRa and CAR (Flk1+PDGFRa-CAR-, Flk1+PDGFRa-CAR+, and Flk1+PDGFRa+CAR+).   Therefore, global gene expression analysis was perfomed by microarray to characterize these mesodermal subsets.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from five separate experiments was pooled and used for comparison
