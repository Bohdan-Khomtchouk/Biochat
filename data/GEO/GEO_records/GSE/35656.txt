TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for myelodysplastic syndrome with 5q deletion treated with lenalidomide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lenalidome is a drug especially effective in low risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with isolated 5q deletion. However, 25% of the patients did not respond. TP53 mutations have been described to play a role in the disease progression, and karyotypic complexity also has an important impact in the outcome. We selected 53 MDS patients with 5q deletion and treated with lenalidomide and we studied by the following techniques: conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CC), single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) and sequencing, in order to assess their impact on treatment response and disease progression.   Low karyotypic complexity (by CC), a high baseline platelet count ( > 280x103/L) and TP53 unmutated gene status are associated with the achievement of hematological response (P=0.005, P=0.008 and P=0.057, respectively). In a multivariate model, the most important predictors for lenalidomide failure are karyotypic complexity (P=0.014) and a platelet count below 280x103/L (P=0.042). Additionally, none of the TP53 mutated cases achieved complete cytogenetics response. Nevertheless, inclusion of defects by SNP-A did not allow for a better separation of responders and non responders. These findings constitute a useful reference data to be considered before lenalidomide treatment enrollment.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood and, in some cases, also lymphocytes CD3 isolated from peripheral blood samples. Copy number analyses of Affymetrix 250K and 6.0 SNP arrays were performed for 53 MDS with 5q deletion samples. There are also 30 samples from lymphocytes CD3 isolated from peripheral blood, which were used as germ-line DNA (control).
