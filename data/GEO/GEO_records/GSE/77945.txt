TITLE
Role of Yng2 PHD and CHD-containing Eaf3 subunits of NuA4 on genome wide histone H4K8 acetylation, NuA4 localization and Pol II distribution

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The NuA4 acetyltransferase complex contains two reader modules, an H3K4me3-specific PHD domain within the Yng2 subunit and H3K36me2/3-specific chromodomain in the Eaf3 subunit. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the role these two reader modules on NuA4 genome-wide localization, histone H4K8 acetylation and RNA polymerase II occupancy. We demonstrate here that Yng2 PHD specifically directs H4 acetylation near the transcription start site of highly expressed genes while Eaf3 is important downstream on the body of the genes. Strikingly, the recruitment of the NuA4 complex to these loci is not significantly affected.  Furthermore, RNA polymerase II occupancy is decreased only in conditions where both PHD and chromo domains are lost, and mostly in the second half of the gene coding regions.  Altogether, these results argue that methylated histone reader modules in NuA4 are not important for its recruitment on the promoter or coding regions but rather orient its acetyltransferase catalytic site to the methylated H3-bearing nucleosomes in the surrounding chromatin, allowing proper transcription initiation and elongation.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed on myc-epl1 wild-type, yng2-W247A, ∆eaf7 and yng2-W247A ∆eaf7 mutants Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. NuA4 complex genome wide localization is defined by Myc-Epl1 signal and RNA polymerase II occupancy using a specific antibody against total RNA Pol II. Histone acetylation profile is determined by H4K8 acetylation corrected on total H4 signal.
