TITLE
Expression data from MDS patients with der(1;7)(q10;p10)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was significantly different between der(1;7)(q10;p10) and -7/7q- patients by cluster analysis. There were total 1628 dysregulated genes in both der(1;7)(q10;p10) and -7/del(7q) cohorts.

DESIGN
In order to identify the possible candidate genes implicated in the initiation or maintenance of MDS patients with der(1;7)(q10;p10), we  performed the gene expression array (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, USA) in 7 der(1;7)(q10;p10)(A1,A2,A3,A5,A6,A11,A12) and 6 -7/7q- samples(B3,B4,B5,B6,B8,B9).
