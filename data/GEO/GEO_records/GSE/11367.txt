TITLE
Effect of IL-17 on human vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigate the effect of recombinant human IL-17A on vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from human aortas. Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
SMCs from the aortas of three different donors were cultured in M199 media supplemented with 20% FCS and used at passage 3. The cells were either not treated or treated with IL-17 at 100 ng/ml for 6 hr. The six samples were labeled as Untreated or IL-17-treated from three independent experiments labeled A, B, and C.
