TITLE
EcR-dependent gene expression in MB neurons at the onset of axon pruning

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study identifies genes that show EcR-dependent gene expression in MB neurons at the onset of axon pruning. Keywords: nuclear receptor gene regulation

DESIGN
A dominant negative form of the ecdysone receptor (EcRDN) was expressed in MB neurons by OK107-GAL4.  Animals were staged at 0 and 5 hours relative to puparium formation.  RNA was isolated from MB neurons labeled with mCD8::GFP driven by OK107-GAL4 by laser capture microdissection, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Arrays.  These microarrays were compared to RNA isolated from y,w animals at similar time points.
