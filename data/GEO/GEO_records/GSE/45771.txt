TITLE
Promoters Active in Interphase are Bookmarked during Mitosis by Ubiquitination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed genome-wide modification of chromatin by ubiquitination in human cells and whether this mark changes through the cell cycle using modified ChIP-seq technique (ChAP-seq).

DESIGN
Chromatin affinity purification was based on a standard ChIP method with modification of a two-step affinity purification.
