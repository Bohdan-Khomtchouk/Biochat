TITLE
Mouse lung CD103+ and CD11b-high dendritic cell (DC) subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse lung CD11c+ dendritic cells are composed of 2 major DC subsets, the CD103+CD11b-low/intermediate DC (CD103+ DC) and the CD11b-highCD103- DC (CD11b-high DC).  These 2 subsets are functionally distinct.  Comparison of their functions showed CD103+ DC Microarray analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of the 2 lung DC subsets in naïve mice.

DESIGN
Perfused lungs from 6-8-week naïve BALB/cByJ mice were pooled and digested with collagenase D.  CD11c+ cells were selected by anti-CD11c magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi) and stained by fluorochrome-conjugated mAb against I-A, CD103, CD11b, and CD11c plus 7-
