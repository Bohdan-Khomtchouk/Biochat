TITLE
H4K16ac modification profile difference between Peg3-WT and KO MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PEG3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3) is an imprinted gene encoding a DNA-binding protein.  Two components of the mammalian MSL (Male-Specific Lethal) complex, Msl1 and Msl3, are known to be the genomic targets of PEG3.  In this report, we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments profiling H4K16ac levels using a set of MEF cells (Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast), the WT and KO of Peg3.  The results indicated that about 10% of the mouse gene catalog showed high levels of H4K16ac levels in Peg3-KO MEFs than in Peg3-WT MEFs.  This further suggests that mammalian Peg3 may control its downstream genes through the MSL complex.

DESIGN
Comparison of H4K16 ac levels between Peg3-WT and Peg3-KO MEFs.
