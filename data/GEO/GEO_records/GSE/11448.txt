TITLE
Gene expression signature of cerebellum hypoplasia in a mouse model of Down syndrome (Part I).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We designed a large scale gene expression study in Ts1Cje mice between P0 and P10 in order to measure the effects of trisomy 21 on a large number of samples (56 in total) in a tissue that is affected in Down syndrome (the cerebellum) and to quantify the defect during development in order to correlate gene expression changes to the phenotype observed. Keywords: Down syndrome, Ts1Cje, cerebellum, development, hypoplasia

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression in the cerebellum of Ts1Cje and euploid mice at P0, P3, P7 and P10 using pangenomic two colors microarrays containing 25 344 probes representing approximately 15 574 mouse genes. 56 samples from individual cerebellum were hybridized on 28 microarrays. On each microarray we hybridized a Ts1Cje sample versus an euploid sample and always a male versus a female. In addition on the same microarray we always compared samples from mice of the same age or with a maximum difference of 4 days (P0 versus P3, P3 versus P7 or P7 versus P10).
