TITLE
Gene expression signature of cerebellum hypoplasia in a mouse model of Down syndrome (Part I).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We designed a large scale gene expression study in Ts1Cje mice between P0 and P10 in order to measure the effects of trisomy 21 on a large number of samples (56 in total) in a tissue that is affected in Down syndrome (the cerebellum) and to quantify the defect during development in order to correlate gene expression changes to the phenotype observed. Keywords: Down syndrome, Ts1Cje, cerebellum, development, hypoplasia
