TITLE
Dependency of ISG expression on IFNAR1 and Tyk2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyze the expression profile of ISGs in the context of IFNAR1-KO primary murine B cells and macrophages. These analses were used to define ISG gene sets that are under tonic control. Furthermore, these analyses enabled the definition of ISGs that are dependent on Tyk2 signaling.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 IFNAR1-KO mice were injected subcutaneously with 10,000U IFNa for 2hrs. Splenic B cells and peritoneal macrophages were sorted by FACS directly into TriZol and gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
