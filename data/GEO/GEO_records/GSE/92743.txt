TITLE
Broad Institute L1000 Connectivity Map and RNAseq gene expression profiles on tissue samples from the GTEx project

ORGANISM
Connectivity Map

SUMMARY
The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH program which funds the generation of perturbational profiles across multiple cell and perturbation types, as well as read-outs, at a massive scale. The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to profile a range of cellular models and perturbations of cellular state. These data relate to using  RNA-Seq datasets from the GTEx consortium ( ) to validate the L1000 assay and to improve the statistical model used in imputing the transcriptome. The Platform is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilon For questions or assistance with this dataset, please email the CMap support team at: clue@broadinstitute.org
