TITLE
Effect of W805EC nanoemulsion (NE) on global gene transcription in JawsII dendritic cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nanoemulsion adjuvant affects immune gene expression in dendritic cells. Microarray was used to asses global changes in gene expression in JAWS II dendritic cells  upon treatment with nanoemulsion (NE) adjuvant W805EC

DESIGN
JawsII cell were incubated with NE formulation for 6 and 24 hours, and RNA was extracted for Affymetrix hybridization
