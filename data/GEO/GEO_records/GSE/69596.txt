TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CD4+ and CD4- ILC1 subsets by RNAseq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets that mirror helper T cells in their effector cytokine profiles have recently emerged as central players in both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.  Like their Th1, Th2 and Th17/Th22 helper T cell counterparts, ILC subsets are categorized based on their expression of specific transcription factors and effector cytokines:  group 1 ILC (ILC1) express T-bet and IFN-Î³; group 2 ILC (ILC2) express GATA-3 and type 2 effector cytokines such as IL-13 and IL-5; and group 3 ILC (ILC3) express RORgt and the cytokines IL-22 and/or IL-17.  Under this nomenclature, natural killer (NK) cells and lymphoid tissue inducers (LTi) are considered ILC1 and ILC3, respectively.  ILC1 contain both CD4+ and CD4- populations, but whether this phenotypic characteristic reflects functional differences between these two populations is unknown.  These studies examine the gene expression profiles of CD4+ vs CD4- ILC1 in a cohort of healthy control subjects.

DESIGN
ILC subsets were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy control subjects.  cDNA was isolated and amplified from sorted populations, and gene expression was analyzed by RNAseq
