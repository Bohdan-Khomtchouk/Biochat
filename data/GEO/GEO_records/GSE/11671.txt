TITLE
Comparative expression analysis between logarithmic and stationary phase of T. thermophilus HB8 on a synthetic medium

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain grown in a synthetic medium at 70°C.

DESIGN
Three wild-type T. thermophilus HB8 strains were pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 3 ml of synthetic medium. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 500 ml of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 10 h and 20 h, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample in this website.
