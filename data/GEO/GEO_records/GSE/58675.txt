TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of PRDM2 Knock down vs.controlGFPsh proliferating C2C12 Myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Knockdown of PRDM2 led to precocious differentiation. To understand the molecular basis for this phenotype, we performed microaary analysis of growing myoblasts. Genes differentially regulated by PRDM2 knock down were reveraled by microarray analysis  using NIA15K mouse chips.

DESIGN
Control and knock down cells were grown in proliferating conditions

PLATFORM
GPL18846 Murine 15K Spotted cDNA array
