TITLE
Viral shRNA Knockdown of INS Promotor Activity in EndoC-βH1 Cells 

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To inhibit INS expression, we used shRNA to target the INS promoter. We find that knocking down INS expression with such an shRNA targeting the INS promoter significantly affects expression of 259 genes.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of EndoC βH1 with or without shRNA targetting INS promoter were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
