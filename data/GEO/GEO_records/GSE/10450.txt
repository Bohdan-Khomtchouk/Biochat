TITLE
Met induces mammary tumors with diverse histologies and is associated with poor outcome and human basal breast cancer

SUMMARY
Elevated Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression correlates with poor outcome in breast cancer, yet a causal role for Met in the development of breast cancer has not been directly established. To examine this question, we generated a transgenic mouse model that targets expression of an oncogenic Met receptor (MetMut) to the mammary epithelium. We show that MetMut induces mammary tumors with a variety of histopathologies that exhibit gene expression profiles sharing similarities with human basal and luminal breast tumor subtypes. Among all breast cancers, we further demonstrate that the Met receptor is primarily overexpressed in human basal and HER2 positive breast cancers, and that a Met associated gene expression signature identifies patients with poor prognosis.
