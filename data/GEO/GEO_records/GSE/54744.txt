TITLE
Expression data at drug-sensitive and drug-resistant phases of canine B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major obstacles during the chemotherapy in lymphoma patients. Although there have been various molecules associated with acquisition of MDR phenotype in human tumor cells, MDR of tumor cells have not been successfully overcome. Canine lymphoma is thought to be a spontaneous animal model of human lymphoma because it shares many similarities with human non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of changes in gene expression profiles of canine lymphoma cells by microarray analysis using tumor cell samples at drug-sensitive and drug-resistant phases in 4 dogs. It was revealed that expression of the molecules related to chemotaxis and inflammation were down regulated in MDR phases of all of the 4 dogs.

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from tumor cell samples at drug-sensitive and drug-resistant phases of 4 dogs and detected changes in gene expression profiles between 2 phases of each dog using microarrays.
