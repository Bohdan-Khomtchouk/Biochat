TITLE
Inflammation induced repression of Foxp3-bound chromatin in regulatory T cells [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Foxp3 is indispensable for the ability of regulatory T (Treg) cells to suppress fatal inflammation. Here, we characterized the role of Foxp3 in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression in actively suppressing Treg cells in an inflammatory setting. Although genome-wide Foxp3 occupancy of DNA regulatory elements was similar in resting and in vivo activated Treg cells, Foxp3-bound enhancers were poised for repression only in activated Treg cells. Following activation, Foxp3-bound sites showed reduced chromatin accessibility and selective H3K27 tri-methylation, which was associated with Ezh2 recruitment and downregulation of nearby gene expression. Thus, Foxp3 poises its targets for repression by facilitating formation of repressive chromatin in regulatory T cells upon their activation in response to inflammatory cues. The supplementary file GSE55705_dt_expr.txt is a matrix for Treg expression data from platform GPL1261 that includes co-normalized data from GSE40685.
