TITLE
ATM regulates a DNA damage response post-transcriptional RNA operon in lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maintenance of genomic stability depends on the DNA damage response (DDR), a biological barrier in early stages of cancer development. Failure of this response results in genomic instability and high predisposition toward lymphoma, as seen in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) dysfunction. ATM activates multiple cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair following DNA damage, but its influence on posttranscriptional gene expression has not been examined on a global level. We show that ionizing radiation (IR) modulates the dynamic association of the RNA-binding protein HuR with target mRNAs in an ATM-dependent manner, potentially coordinating the genotoxic response as an RNA operon. Pharmacologic ATM inhibition and use of ATM-null cells revealed a critical role for ATM in this process. Numerous mRNAs encoding cancer-related proteins were differentially associated with HuR depending on the functional state of ATM, in turn affecting expression of encoded proteins. The findings presented here reveal a previously unidentified role of ATM in controlling gene expression post-transcriptionally.  Dysregulation of this DDR RNA operon is likely relevant to lymphoma development in ataxia-telangiectasia individuals. These novel RNA regulatory modules and genetic networks provide critical insight into the function of ATM in oncogenesis.

DESIGN
B-lymphocyte cell lines GM02184 (wild type, ATM +/+) and GM03332 (AT, ATM -/-) were either untreated or exposed to 1 Gy of IR. 6 h later cells were harvested and used for immunoprecipitation (IP) in the presence of HuR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech.). RNA from IP material was extracted and used for microarray analysis.
