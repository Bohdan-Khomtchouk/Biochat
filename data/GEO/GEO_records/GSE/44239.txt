TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-203 in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism through which miR-203 inhibited the breast cancer cell invasion, we overpression miR-203 in MDA-MB-231 cell line and performed a microarray to examine the genes which maybe targeted and down-regulated by miR-203.

DESIGN
We made a stable cell line(MB231/miR-203) which overexpressing miR-203 and a control cell line (MB231/EV) which expressing a contrlol vector. Total RNA were extracted from these two cell lines and subject to microarray.
