TITLE
Transcriptomic sequencing of the murine testis during the first wave of spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our experimental design includes samples at different time points during the first wave of spermatogenesis. Each time point corresponds to specific cell content in the testis. First time point is post natal day (PND) 7, when only somatic cells and spermatogonia are present in the testis. Thereafter additional cell types are present in selected samples in chronological order: PND 14 contains early spermatocytes, PND 17 late spermatocytes, PND 21 round spermatids and finally PND 28 elongating spermatids. Our results highlight differentially expressed genes and gene isoforms, which are important for correct sperm development and male fertility. In addition, functional analysis suggests a highly controlled gene expression pattern during the first wave of spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
Transcriptome sequencing of the mouse testes at PND 7, 14, 17, 21 and 28 for analysis of differences in gene expression pattern during the first wave of spermatogenesis. In total 10 samples were analysed, replicates for each time point.
