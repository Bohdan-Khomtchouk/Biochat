TITLE
Cyclophilin D extramitochondrial signaling controls cell cycle progression and chemokine-directed cell motility.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mitochondria control bioenergetics and cell fate decisions, but whether they also participate in extra-organelle signaling is not understood.  Here, we show that interference with cyclophilin D (CypD), a mitochondrial matrix protein and apoptosis regulator, causes accelerated cell proliferation and enhanced cell migration and invasion.  These responses are associated with global transcriptional changes in CypD-/- cells, predominantly affecting chemokines and their receptors, and resulting in increased activating phosphorylation of Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).  In turn, STAT3 signaling promotes increased proliferation of CypD-/- cells via accelerated S-phase entry and supports Cxcl12-directed paracrine cell motility.  Therefore, mitochondria-to-nuclei transcriptional signaling globally affects cell division and motility.  As immunosuppressive therapies often target CypD, this pathway may predispose the tissue microenvironment of these patients to oncogenic transformation.

DESIGN
Three wild type (WT) and three CypD-/- knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been compared.
