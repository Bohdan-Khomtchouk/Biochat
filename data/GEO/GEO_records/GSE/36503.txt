TITLE
Cancer arises through reprogramming-like processes in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from CD22+B220+ FACS-purified splenocytes of adult wild-type, Sca1-Bcl6(floxed) and Sca1-Bcl6(Δ) knock-in CBAxC57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
The Bcl6 floxed vector was generated by inserting the mouse Bcl6–IRES-eGFP cassette flanked by loxP sites into the ClaI site of the pLy6 vector. The transgene fragment was excised from its vector by restriction digestion with NotI, purified and injected into CBAxC57BL/6J fertilized eggs. Two independent transgenic lines were generated and analyzed. Sca1-Bcl6(floxed) mice were bred to mb1-Cre mice to generate Sca1-Bcl6(Δ) mice. Splenic B220+CD22+ cells were FACS purified from wild-type, Sca1-Bcl6(floxed) and Sca1-Bcl6(Δ) mice and arrayed using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
