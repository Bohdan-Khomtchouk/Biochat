TITLE
WT Dorsal Skin Time Course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skin and bladder epithelia form effective permeability barriers through the activation of distinct differentiation gene programs. Employing a genome-wide gene expression study, we identified transcription regulators whose expression correlates highly with that of differentiation markers both in bladder and skin, including the Grainyhead factor Get1/Grhl3, already known to be important for epidermal barrier formation. In the bladder, Get1 is most highly expressed in the differentiated umbrella cells and its mutation in mice leads to a defective bladder epithelial barrier formation due to failure of apical membrane specialization. Genes encoding components of the specialized urothelial membrane, the uroplakins, were downregulated in Get1-/- mice. At least one of these genes, Uroplakin II, is a direct target of Get1. The urothelial-specific activation of the Uroplakin II gene is due to selective binding of Get1 to the Uroplakin II promoter in urothelial cells, most likely regulated by histone modifications. These results demonstrate a key role for Get1 in urothelial differentiation and barrier formation.

DESIGN
To gain insights into common and unique transcriptional regulatory programs during epidermal differentiation, we profiled global gene expression in mouse dorsal skin at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5.
