TITLE
Molecular pathways of early CD105-positive erythroid cells as compared to CD34-positive common precursor cells by high-sensitive flow cytometric cell sorting and gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene network of erythropoietic cells Special attention has recently been drawn to the molecular network of different genes that are responsible for the development of erythroid cells. The aim of our study was to establish in detail the phenotype of early erythroid cells and to compare the gene expression profile of separated early erythroid precursors with the CD34-positive compartment. Multicolor flow cytometric analyses of human bone marrow mononuclear cell fractions (n=20) defined three distinct early erythroid stages. Sorted populations were analyzed for their gene expression profile using Affymetrix array technology. In 4,524 genes, a differential regulation was found in CD105-positive erythroid cells as compared to the CD34 common progenitor compartment (2,362 upregulated genes). A highly significant difference was observed in the expression level of genes with known functions, e.g. transcription factors, heme synthesis, iron and mitochondrial metabolism and transforming growth factor-ÃŸ signaling. A comparison with recently published data showed over 800* genes which as yet have not been reported to be upregulated in the early erythroid lineage as compared to the CD34 compartment . The gene expression level within distinct pathways can be illustrated directly by applying the Ingenuity software program. The results of the gene expression analyses can be seen at

DESIGN
We analyzed bone marrow CD14 positive, CD105-positive erythroid cells and CD34-positive common precursor cells from  healthy subjects using the Affymetrix HG-U133_Plus_2 platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.
