TITLE
miR-182 is Overexpressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas Leading to Downregulation of Specific Transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study correlated miR expression with predicted targets to determine those miRs that both downregulated a subset of their predicted targets and showed differential expression in cancer samples compared to controls

DESIGN
Case: Control with HNSCC tumors and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) samples

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
