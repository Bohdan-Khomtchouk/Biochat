TITLE
miR-182 is Overexpressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas Leading to Downregulation of Specific Transcripts

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
This study correlated miR expression with predicted targets to determine those miRs that both downregulated a subset of their predicted targets and showed differential expression in cancer samples compared to controls
