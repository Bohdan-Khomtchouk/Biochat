TITLE
IFNb induced genes in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A number of IFN-induced proteins are believed to be responsible for the antiviral state induced by IFNs. Our microarray analysis of IFN-regulated genes in MEFs from wild-type mice identified 124 probe sets that were differentially regulated upon IFN treatment. This group consisted of many known ISGs such as Ifit1, Gbp2, mx1, Isg15, Stat1, nmi, mx2, If204, Adar, Irf1, and protein kinase R. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
3 control and 3 IFNb-treated biological replicates were analyzed
