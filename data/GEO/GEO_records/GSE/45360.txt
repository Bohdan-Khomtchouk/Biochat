TITLE
Differential gene expression during Exobasidium vexans and Pestalotiopsis theae infection in tea by DNA Microarray

ORGANISM
Camellia sinensis

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis is being performed with cultivated selections using custom designed arrays. Custom designed arrays include the design of microarray probes using clearly described bioinformatics methods. We have used the sequence data related to fungal resistance from Camellia Sp. and Arabidopsis thaliana available in the biological databases, to design these arrays. Results of this work will help us to understand the genes expressed during the blister blight and grey blight infection.

DESIGN
Camellia sinensis 4x44k Microarray  designed by Genotypic Technology Private  Limited. (AMADID:043117)
