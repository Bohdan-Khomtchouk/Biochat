TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild type (N2) and hlh-30(tm1978) mutant worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The hlh-30 gene encodes a C. elegans basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor; We compared RNA from wild type worms and worms mutant for the hlh-30 gene to identify putative target genes of the HLH-30 transcription factor.

DESIGN
Total RNA from three biological replicates were isolated from embryos, L1 larvae, and L2 larvae from both wild type and hlh-30(tm1978) mutant worms
