TITLE
Expression data in the presence of miR-29a inhibition in human dermal fibroblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-29 can target many gene transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins. To unravel novel targets, we used microarray analysis to detect global gene expression changes when inhibiting endogenous miR-29.

DESIGN
Total RNA from human dermal fibroblast cells after 48 h treatment with miR-29a inhibitor or control inhibitor were isolated and subjected to whole gene expression microarray analysis.
