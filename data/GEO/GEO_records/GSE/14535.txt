SUMMARY
In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However, it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns. These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitated with the targeted RNA-binding proteins HuR, IMP-1 and PABP using RIP-Chip (Ribonomic) profiling Keywords: RIP-Chip For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
