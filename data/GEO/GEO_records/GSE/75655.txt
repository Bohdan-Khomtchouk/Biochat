TITLE
5-Day Gavage Study of Crude 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol in Male Harlan Sprague Dawley Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to characterize the potential toxicity and genomic benchmark dose  of crude 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol in liver and kidney of male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats using a 5 day dose-response toxicogenomics study design. The 5 day study is used to quickly identify the dose levels where changes in molecular pathways occur. These dose level where pathway level effects begin to occur have been shown to provide a close approximation of a no effect dose level from more resource intensive guideline toxicological assessments.

DESIGN
A total of 44 samples were evaluated in this study. 27 were from liver and 17 were from kidney. Signficant batch effects were detected with a subset of samples and these were removed from the study prior to data analysis and are therefore not included in this GEO series. 3 (kidney) or 4 (liver) biological replicate were obtained for the 0 mg/kg/day control group for both liver and kidney. All other non-zero dose groups contain 2-4 biological replicates. The groups that contain only 2 or 3 replicates do so due to a number of samples not passing QC as byproduct of batch effects. The control groups for liver and kidney are the 0 mg/kg dose groups for those organs.
