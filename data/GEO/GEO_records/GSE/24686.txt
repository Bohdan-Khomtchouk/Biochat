TITLE
Integration of a splicing regulatory network within the meiotic gene expression program of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Splicing regulatory networks are essential components of eukaryotic gene expression programs, yet little is known about how they are integrated with transcriptional regulatory networks into coherent gene expression programs. Here we define the MER1 splicing regulatory network and examine its role in the gene expression program during meiosis in budding yeast. Mer1p splicing factor promotes splicing of just four pre-mRNAs. All four Mer1p-responsive genes also require Nam8p for splicing activation by Mer1p, however other genes require Nam8p but not Mer1p, exposing an overlapping meiotic splicing network controlled by Nam8p. MER1 mRNA and three of the four Mer1p substrate pre-mRNAs are induced by the transcriptional regulator Ume6p. This unusual arrangement delays expression of Mer1p-responsive genes relative to other genes under Ume6p control. Products of Mer1p-responsive genes are required for initiating and completing recombination, and for activation of Ndt80p, the transcriptional network that controls subsequent steps in the program. Thus the MER1 splicing regulatory network mediates the dependent relationship between the UME6 and NDT80 transcriptional regulatory networks in the meiotic gene expression program. This work reveals how splicing regulatory networks can be interlaced with transcriptional regulatory networks in eukaryotic gene expression programs.
