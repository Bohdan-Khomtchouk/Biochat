TITLE
An ultra-low-input native ChIP-seq protocol for genome-wide profiling of rare cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The development of combined chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) technologies has enabled genome-wide epigenetic profiling of numerous cell lines and tissue types. A major limitation of ChIP-seq, however, is the large number of cells required to generate high quality datasets, precluding the study of rare cell populations. Here, we present an ultra-low-input micrococcal nuclease-based native ChIP (ULI-NChIP) and sequencing method, to generate genome-wide histone mark profiles with high resolution and reproducibility from as few as one thousand cells. Using ULI-NChIP, we generated high quality maps of several covalent histone marks from 10^3-10^6 embryonic stem cells. To further validate our procedure we demonstrate that genome-wide H3K27me3 profiles generated from 10^3 E13.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs) using ULI-NChIP-seq show high similarity to recently generated datasets using 50-180Ã— more material, illustrating the utility of this method for generating high quality libraries with improved complexity from rare cell populations.
