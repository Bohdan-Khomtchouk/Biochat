TITLE
Gene expression profile in tumor tissue in murine human lung cancer model between p-T-miR-7 and p-Cont injection group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lung cancer cell line 95D cells were injected subcutaneously into right flank of Balb/c nude mice (n=8). 7 days later, the plasmid of p-T-miR-7 (100mg) or p-Cont (100mg) was remote given by subcutaneous injection into the left flank of nude mice five times every three days. 3 days after last injection, tumor mass were collected. We sent the tumor tissue to Shanghai Kang Cheng company to detecte the cDNA chip in order to detect the gene expression in p-T-miR-7 injection group.

DESIGN
Human lung cancer cell line 95D cells were injected subcutaneously into right flank of Balb/c nude mice (n=8). 7 days later, the plasmid of p-T-miR-7 (100mg) or p-Cont (100mg) was remote given by subcutaneous injection into the left flank of nude mice five times every three days. 3 days after last injection, all mice were killed and we got the tumor tissues.We sent the tumor tissue to Shanghai Kang Cheng company to detecte the cDNA chip. In this study,the total RNA was extracted from in tumor tissue between p-T-miR-7 and p-Cont injection group.Then the expression profiles of gene on these tumors was detected by microarray.
