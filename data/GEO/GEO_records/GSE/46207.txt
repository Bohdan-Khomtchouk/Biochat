TITLE
Impairment of Muscle Regeneration in Muscleblind-like 3 Isoform Knockout Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed an RNA-seq experiment to identify expression and alternative splicing differences between WT and Mbnl3 isoform knockout mice E15 forelimbs. We have also identified and characterized transcriptome wide Mbnl3-binding sites in C2C12 cells and E15 forelimbs.

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed: E15 forelimbs from 3 WT and 3 MBNL3 ΔE2/ΔE2 female mice (15dpc). For HITS-CLIP, 3 samples each of C2C12 cells, WT E15 forelimbs and Mbnl3 ?E2 forelimbs were analyzed for Mbnl3 binding site analysis.
