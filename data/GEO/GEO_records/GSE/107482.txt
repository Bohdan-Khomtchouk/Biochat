TITLE
Transcriptional data from yeast expressing mammalian AKT1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We studied the transcriptional profile in yeast cells in response to heterologous expression of mammalian activated AKT1

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of samples of yeast cells co-expressing for 4 hours mammalian catalytic subunit of class I PI3K and Akt (PI3K-AKT) or a kinase-dead (KD) version of Akt (PI3K-AKT K179M), and a microarray experiment was carried out for each sample.
