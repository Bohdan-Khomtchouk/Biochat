TITLE
Characterizing the transcriptional profile of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes with altered expression of Dnmt3a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-Seq data file from 3T3-L1 adipocytes following overexpression and knock-down of Dnmt3a

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes with altered expression of Dnmt3a from biological triplicates. Overexpression or knockdown of Dnmt3a was achieved by lentivirus transduction in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
