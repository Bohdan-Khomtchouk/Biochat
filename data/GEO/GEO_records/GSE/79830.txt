TITLE
Transcriptome and analysis of Wdr70 deletion by next-generation sequencing

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
CRL4 is a family of SCF-like ubiquitin ligase constituted by Cul4-Ddb1-RING finger scaffold and DCAF substrate adaptors. We revealed Wdr70 as a novel DCAF protein that assembles with Cul4-Ddb1 and functions as chromatin remodeling factor in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Besides its function in DNA repair, CRL4Wdr70 is speculated to regulate gene expression in a  subset of yeast transcriptome. Here we use the next-generation sequencing to show that deletion of Wdr70 gene disturbs the gene expression profile of G2-synchronised yeast cells.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide gene expression in 2 different yeast strains using Illumina Hiseq2500.
