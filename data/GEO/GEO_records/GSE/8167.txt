TITLE
Distinct gene-expression-defined classes of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GIST is considered to invariably arise through gain-of-function KIT or PDGFRA mutation of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). However, the genetic basis of the malignant progression of GIST is poorly understood. We analysed the expression levels of 54,613 probe sets in 32 surgical samples of untreated GIST of the stomach and small intestine with GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 32 fresh frozen tumour specimens. We analysed the global gene exprssion profiles of these GIST cases in order to clarify the genomic basis behind the malignant progression of this tumor
