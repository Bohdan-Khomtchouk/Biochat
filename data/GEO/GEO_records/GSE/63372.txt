TITLE
Expression data of HSFA6b-overexpression and HSFA6b dominant-negative mutant lines of Arabidopsis after NaCl or Heat shock treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to study the improtance of HSFA6b in salt and heat stresses of arabidopsis, we generated the HSFA6b-overexpression (HSFA6b-OE) and dominant-negative (HSFA6b-RD) mutant lines. We used microarray to investigate how genes regulated by HSFA6b after NaCl or heat shock treatment.

DESIGN
Seven-day-old seedlings of wild type (Col-0), HSFA6b-overexpression (HSFA6b-OE) and HSFA6b dominant-negative (HSFA6b-RD) mutant lines grown at 22℃ on 0.5X MS plates containing 1% sucrose were treated with 150mM NaCl for 6hr or 37℃ heat shock for 1hr, with 22℃ treatment as a control. Subsequently, samples were collected for RNA extraction by use of the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). The results were representative of two independent biological replicates for analysis.
