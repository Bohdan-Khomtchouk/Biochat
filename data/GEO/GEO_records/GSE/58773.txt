TITLE
RNA sequencing of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis in response to various substrates

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 = JCM 1222 = DSM 20088

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project was to determine the whole transcriptome response of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. Infantis to pooled and individual human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) relative to lactose

DESIGN
Bacterial isolates grown on lactose, pooled human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), 2’fucosyllactose (2’FL), 3-fucosyllactose (3FL), and 6’sialyllactose (6’SL). RNA was extracted and sequenced, in duplicate, on an Illumina HiSeq. Early, mid, and late timepoints in response to pooled HMO were additionally sequenced in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL18859 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 = JCM 1222 = DSM 20088)
