TITLE
Expression data from antimycin A-treated BE(2)-C cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcription response of undifferentiated human BE(2)-C neuronal cells to stimulation with purified antimycin A1a or unfractionated commercially available antimycin A (Sigma A8674).

DESIGN
Three independent sets of BE(2)-C cells were treated DMSO control or 200 nM of either purified antimycin A1a or unfractionated antimycin A.  Total RNA was harvested at 24 h after stimulation and analyzed with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips.
