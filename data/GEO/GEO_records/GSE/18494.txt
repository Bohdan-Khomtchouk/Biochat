TITLE
Expression profiling of hypoxic HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression changes of cultured HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells subjected to hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 0, 4, 8, 12 hours . Results provide insight to cell type-specific response to hypoxia.

DESIGN
HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were collected under normoxic conditions (~19% O2, 0 hours) and after 4, 8 and 12 hours of hypoxia treatment (0.5% O2). For each cell line, three replicates of total RNA at each time point were prepared using Trizol and submitted to the DFCI Microarray Core for labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2 oligonucleotide arrays and image scanning.
