TITLE
Expression profiling of hypoxic HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression changes of cultured HepG2 hepatoma, U87 glioma, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells subjected to hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 0, 4, 8, 12 hours . Results provide insight to cell type-specific response to hypoxia.
