TITLE
Pho and Ph, H3K27me3 and Engrailed ChIP-seq data in PRE-deleted third instar Drosophila larval brains and disks and 4C-seq data in the third instar larval brains and disks

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide binding profile of PcG proteins- Pho and Ph, H3K27me3 and Engrailed in Drosophila third instar larval brains and disks, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed.

DESIGN
Drosophila third instar larval brains and disks were dissected and fixed with 2% HCHO before sonication. After sonication, chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
