TITLE
Expression data in dSTING knockdown and control sibling flies after mock or pathogenic infection

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Parental flies (y1v1;P{TRiP.JF01138}attP2 and y1w*;P{Act5C-GAL4}25FO1/CyO,y+) were mated and 4-7 day old flies were used for all subsequent experiments. dSTING RNAi flies expressed the dsRNA hairpin targeting dSTING and had straight wings, while sibling flies not expressing dSTING dsRNA had curly wings. Pathogens used for inoculation were Listeria monocytogenes, Drosophila C Virus (DCV), and Insect Iridescent virus 6 (IIV6), at the following concentrations: 1e7 CFU/ml, 5e7 TCID50/ml, 5e6 TCID50/ml. Mock inoculation was performed with PBS. Whole flies were homogenized 24 or 72 h post-infection.

DESIGN
Determining the effect of genotype on gene expression profiles following pathogenic infection was the overall goal of this project.
