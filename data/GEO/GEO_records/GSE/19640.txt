TITLE
Expression data from 20-week-old mice proximal tubules

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
dB/dB mice develop different kidney pathologies resulting from high body weight. We seek to better understand the mechanisms of this kidney damage in proximal tubules. We isolated RNA from proximal tubules of different groups of mice, and we seek to understand how the anti-oxidant enzyme catalase may regulate kidney damage in this model.

DESIGN
Proximal tubules were isolated from 4 groups of 20-week-old mice: wild type, catalase-transgenic, dB/dB, and dB/dB catalase-transgenic. RNA was then extracted from these tubules to use in the microarrays. Triplicates were performed for each group.
