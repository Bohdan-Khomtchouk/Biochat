TITLE
Expression Data from 226 patients of the REMAGUS02 trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of predictive markers of response to treatment is a major objective in breast cancer. A major problem in clinical sampling is the variability of RNA templates, requiring accurate management of tumour material and subsequent analyses for future translation in clinical practice. Our aim was to establish the feasibility and reliability of high throughput RNA analysis in a prospective trial. Our data showed that strict quality criteria for RNA integrity assessment and well calibrated and standardized RT-qPCR allows multicentre analysis of genes transcripts with high accuracy in the clinical context. More stringent criteria are needed for transcriptome analysis for clinical applications.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of 226 patients of the REMAGUS02 trial were analyzed using Affymetrix U133plus2 Arrays.
