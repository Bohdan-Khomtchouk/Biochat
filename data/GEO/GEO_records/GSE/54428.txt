TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human liver biopsies from HBV+ patients and healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human livers biopsies from HBV+ patients and healthy donors were collected . RNA and Protein were extract  and The Human Adipogenesis RT² Profiler™ PCR Array was used to compare the gene expression in the two group. At the same time PBMCs were collected and the same array were used to compare the adipogenesis expression in the two system.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Fresh Livers from 20 HBV+ and 20 HD patients were used . Equal amount total RNA from each samples were used.
