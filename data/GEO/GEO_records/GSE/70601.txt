TITLE
Reversible Burst of Transcriptional Changes During Induction of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) in Talinum triangulare

ORGANISM
Talinum fruticosum

SUMMARY
Rapid, reversible induction of crassulacean acid metabolism in conjunction with pronounced reconfiguration of carbon metabolism enables T. triangulare to survive cycles of severe drought.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from leaves of Talinum triangulare plants (3 biological replicates) after plants were grown under 0, 4, 9 and 12 days of drought as well as after 2 days of re-watering. Paired-end samples were used for purposes of creating a de novo transcriptome assembly.
