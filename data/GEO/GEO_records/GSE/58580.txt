TITLE
Identification of AP2-O targets [microarray]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Stage-specific transcription is a fundamental biological process in the lifecycle of the Plasmodium parasite. Proteins containing the AP2 DNA-binding domain are responsible for stage-specific transcriptional regulation, and belong to the only known family of transcription factors in Plasmodium parasites. A comprehensive identification of their target genes will advance our understanding of the molecular basis of stage-specific parasite development. In this study, we have used ChIP-seq technology to identify the target genes of the ookinete-specific AP2 transcription factor AP2-O.

DESIGN
Five biologically independent AP2-O(âˆ’) and seven biologically independent wild-type ookinete samples were used in the analyses.

PLATFORM
