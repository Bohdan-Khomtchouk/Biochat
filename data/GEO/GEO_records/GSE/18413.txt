TITLE
Expression in larvae fed on resistant or susceptible plants, and in larvae that are at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Mayetiola destructor

SUMMARY
Genes expressed in the salivary glands and gut of Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae are likely involved in interactions with host plants.

DESIGN
RNA samples were extracted from whole larvae. The microarray was used to determine the abundance of transcripts in larvae at different developmental stage or larvae that feed on resistant and susceptible host plants.
