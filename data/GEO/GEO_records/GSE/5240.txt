TITLE
Stress-related gene expression of HK-2 cells exposed to GF/FAF HSA, GF HSA, or AngII

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atlas Human Stress Arrays with 234 stress-related genes immobilised on nylon membranes (Clontech, UK) were used to identify the changes in mRNA expression in human proximal tubular HK-2 cells in response to HSA overload or AngII. Keywords: Stress response
