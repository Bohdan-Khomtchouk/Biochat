TITLE
Microarray analysis of cortical cells of maize primary root grown under aereobic conditions with or without ethylene treatment

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Aerenchyma is continuous gas space between shoot and roots that contributes to the internal aeration in plants. In response to excess water stress and the plant hormone ethylene, maize (Zea mays) forms aerenchyma in root cortical cells by programmed cell death (PCD). The aim of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism of ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation by identifying genes that are up- or down-regulated by ethylene treatment in the maize root cortical cells isolated by laser microdissection.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis in cortical cells of maize primary root
