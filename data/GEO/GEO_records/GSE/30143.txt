TITLE
Gene expression profiling in lungs of mice with mesenchyme-specific GR ablation (GRCol1-Cre)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiment was to assay the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in development of mesenchynmal cells of the lung occuring between the 16 and 18 day of embryonal development.

DESIGN
Two time points, E16.5 and E18.5, were analyzed for mutants (GRCol1-Cre) and controls, respectively. For each of the four conditions, five GeneChips were used each representing one animal.
