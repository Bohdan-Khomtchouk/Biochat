TITLE
The cohesin release factor WAPL restricts chromatin loop extension [DamID]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The spatial organization of chromosomes influences many nuclear processes including gene expression. The ring-shaped cohesin complex shapes the 3D genome by looping together convergent CTCF sites along chromosomes. We show here with high-resolution Hi-C analysis that chromatin loop size can be increased, and that cohesin’s DNA release factor WAPL restricts the degree of this extension. WAPL alsoincreased, and that cohesin’s DNA release factor WAPL restricts the degree of this extension. WAPL also prevents looping between incorrectly oriented CTCF sites. Through haploid genetics we find that WAPL deficiency bypasses the need for cohesin’s DNA loader SCC4 and we reveal that SCC4 promotes the extension of chromatin loops. We provide functional evidence in support of the model that chromatin loops are processively enlarged by the extrusion of DNA from cohesin rings. We conclude that the balanced activity of SCC4 and WAPL enables cohesin to correctly structure chromosomes to ensure proper transcriptional control.
