TITLE
Comparison of gene expression (hESC, PGC-like cell from hESC, SSC from testis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis to identify the similarity of gene expression between ESC-derived PGC-like cells and testis-derived SSCs

DESIGN
hESCs were differentated into PGC-like cell. And those cell campared with SSC from testis

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
