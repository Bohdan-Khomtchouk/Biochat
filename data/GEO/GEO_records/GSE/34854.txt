TITLE
Transcriptome of double-positive thymocyte precursors transduced with a retrovirus encoding Lin28a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed paired-end RNA-seq to compare the transcriptome of DP thymocytes that ectopically express Lin28 in vivo versus untransduced (GFP-ve) DP thymocytes.

DESIGN
Transduced (GFP+) and untransduced (GFP-) CD4+ CD8+ CD3- thymocytes were sorted and pooled from three recipients of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with Lin28-RV six weeks post-reconstitution.  Total RNA was extracted and paired-end library construction and sequencing was performed on oligo-dT purified RNA.
