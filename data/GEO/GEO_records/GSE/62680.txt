TITLE
AEBP2â€™s roles in cell migration and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aebp2 encodes a zinc finger protein that is associated with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The alternative promoters and protein isoforms of Aebp2 have been characterized in this study. Aebp2 is controlled through three alternative promoters, deriving three different transcripts which encode the embryonic (32 kDa) and somatic (52 kDa) forms. Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that AEBP2 binds to its own promoter as well as the promoters of Jarid2 and Snai2. While the embryonic form acts as a transcriptional repressor for Snai2, the somatic form functions as a transcriptional activator for Jarid2, Aebp2 and Snai2. Cell migration assays suggest that the Aebp2 somatic form can enhance cell migration. This is consistent with the functional association of Aebp2 with migratory neural crest cells. Overall, the two protein isoforms of AEBP2 may have opposite functions for the PcG target genes, and may play significant roles in cell migration during development.
