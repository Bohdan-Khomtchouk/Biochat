TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of fibroblast, dOB, osteoblast, MSC and MSC-OB

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of each cell mRNA expression pattern. We generated osteoblasts like cell by direct reprogramming technique from human fibroblast. To confirm dOB gene expression pattern similarity to osteoblasts, we analyzed and compared the gene expression profiles of the samples by cDNA microarry. These analysis revealed that dOB are similar to osteoblats in comparative level to MSC-OB.

DESIGN
6 samples.
