TITLE
Profiling of plant miRNAs induced by drought stress in the rice plant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Expression profiles were analyzed between drought stress and normal watered control at the tillering and inflorescence stages.

DESIGN
1. We applied microarray analysis to detect drought-stress-regulated miRNAs from tillering to inflorescence-forming stages in rice. 2. Three time courses at the tillering stage and two time courses at the inflorescence-forming stage. Two replicates were carried out in each time course.
