TITLE
Transfer RNAs mediate rapid adaptation of Escherichia coli under oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) ; Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
We performed tRNAome sequencing to assess the tRNA changes of E.coli under oxidative stress. We found that the global translation inhibition is caused by global down-regulation of almost all tRNA species under oxidative stress. The translation elongation speed is resumed after the cells are fully adapted to the oxidative environment.

DESIGN
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown in M9 minimal medium under normal condition and oxidative stress (0.5mM H2O2). After application of H2O2, samples were taken at 15min, 30min and 90min. The tRNAs were sequenced. We also performed three independent biological replicates, growing cells in 15N labeled M9 minimal medium under normal conditions, to assess the reproducibility of the tRNAome sequencing.  E. coli BW25113 cells were grown in M9 minimal medium under normal condition and oxidative stress (0.5mM H2O2). After application of H2O2, samples were taken at 15min and 90min. The tRNAs were sequenced.
