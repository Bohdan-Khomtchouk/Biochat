TITLE
Gene activation by Rag-mediated DNA double strand breaks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective is to identify genes that are differentially expressed following the introduction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the Rag proteins in murine pre-B cells. Cells lacking Artemis are used since the Rag-induced DSBs will not be repaired and, thus, will provide a continuous stimulus to the cell. Cells lacking Artemis and Atm are used to determine which gene expression changes depend on Atm and cells lacking Artemis that express an I kappa B alpha dominant negative are used to determine which gene expression changes depend on NFkB.
