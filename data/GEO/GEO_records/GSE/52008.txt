TITLE
Genome-wide Profiling of NR2F2 (COUP-TFII) Binding in Human Endometrial Stromal Cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChickenÂ ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII; NR2F2) is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in cell-fate specification, organogenesis, angiogenesis and metabolism. Ablation of COUP-TFII in the mouse uterus causes infertility due to defects in embryo attachment and impaired uterine stromal cell decidualization. Although the function of COUP-TFII in uterine decidualization has been described in mice, its role in the human uterus remains unknown. To better elucidate the mechanisms with which COUP-TFII regulates target gene transcription, genome-wide COUP-TFII binding sites in human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) treated with deciduogenic hormones were identified using ChIP-seq. A total of 16,298 intervals (binding regions) for COUP-TFII were identified compared with the input in HESC chromatin with a very low false discovery rate (0.17%) using a stringent cutoff of p =1x10-10. Distribution of intervals showed that more than half (58.6%) of the COUP-TFII binding sites are located within 10 kb of gene boundaries. 7.5% of total intervals reside within the 10 kb promoter region. A total of 6,077 unique genes were identified to have COUP-TFII binding sites within 10 kb of their gene boundaries.

DESIGN
Examination of NR2F2 binding in pooled primary human endometrial stromal cells from 6 healthy women upon decidualization with a hormone cocktail of cAMP, E2 and medroxyprogesterone acetate.
