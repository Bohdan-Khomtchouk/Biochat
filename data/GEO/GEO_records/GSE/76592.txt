TITLE
miRNA expression data from the hearts of murine myocardial infarction model

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Sexual dimorphisms are well recognized in various cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). MI develops later in women, but once established, it contributes more persistent symptoms and higher mortality than in men. Similar observations have been reported in murine model of MI. Although mRNA-level sexual dimorphism of MI have been reported, whether miRNA transcriptome also confers such dimorphism remains unknown. Comprehensive understanding of the mRNA- and miRNA-level genetic programs underlying the heart sexual dimorphisms will expectedly improve clinical outcome by facilitating the development of gender specific treatment strategies. Here, by conducting miRNA microarray analysis of murine MI model samples, we set out to characterize the heart sexual dimorphisms at the level of miRNA transcriptome
