TITLE
mRNA content of extracellular vesicles, microvesicles and exosomes derived from human H9 embryonic stem cells in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles released from cultured H9 cells were fractionated by differential ultracentrifugation and their total RNA were isolated for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
H9 hESC-derived hESEVs were fractionated into microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs) by differential centrifugation. The total RNA was extracted from MVs, EXOs and non-fractionated hESEVs and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. We expected to see differences in the mRNA contents of MVs and EXOs.
