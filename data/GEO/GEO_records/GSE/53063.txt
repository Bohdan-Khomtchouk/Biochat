TITLE
Identification of TEAD4 target genes in colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified TEAD4 as a key prognosis factor in colorectal cancer. To elucidate the potentail mechanism and function of TEAD4 in colorectal caner, we generated two stable cell lines expressing different shRNA targeting TEAD4 in the mesenchymal-like LoVo cells and the differential genes were detected by microarray.

DESIGN
LoVo colorectal cancer cells stably expressing pLKO.1 control shRNA or sh1_shTEAD4 or sh2_shTEAD4

PLATFORM
