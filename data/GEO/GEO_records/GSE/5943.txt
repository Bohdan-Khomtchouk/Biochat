TITLE
Colonic gene expression upon dietary treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To increase our knowledge of the effects of Fructo oligosaccharides (FOS) on the intestinal barrier function in rats, a controlled rat infection study was performed. Two groups of rats were adapted to a diet with or without FOS. mRNA was collected from the mucosa of the colon and changes in gene expression were assessed using an agilent rat whole genome microarray (G4131A Agilent Technologies). Results indicate that dietary FOS influences energy metabolism, which will most likely play a role in the effects of FOS on the intestinal barrier. Keywords: Dietary treatment, colon mucosa, Rat
