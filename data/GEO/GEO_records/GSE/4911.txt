TITLE
Expression data from mouse E14.5 wt and RUNX2 -/- humeri

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed between mouse RUNX2 -/- and wt embryonic humeri at stage E14.5 Keywords: wildtype versus knockout comparison

DESIGN
To minimize the effects of random biological variation, humeri from different preparations were pooled (approximately 75 wildtype and 60 Runx2-/- for each of the two biological replicates).
