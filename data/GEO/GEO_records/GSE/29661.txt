TITLE
Cellular aging can be monitored by DNA-methylation changes at specific CpG sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long-term culture associated changes need to be considered for quality control of cell preparations â€“ especially in cellular therapy. Here we describe a simple method to track cellular aging based on continuous DNA-methylation changes at six specific CpG sites. This epigenetic signature can be used as a biomarker for various cell types to predict the state of cellular aging with regard to the number of passages or days of in vitro culture.

DESIGN
8 samples of human dermal fibroblasts.  4 samples of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from human adipose tissue.
