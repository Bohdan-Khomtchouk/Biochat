TITLE
Profiling of adipose tissue from the F2 M16xICR mouse cross.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression in adipose tissue from F2 progeny from a cross between the outbred M16 (selectively bred for rapid weight gain) and ICR (control) mouse strains. We developed a framework for reconstructing tissue-to-tissue coexpression networks between genes in hypothalamus, adipose or adipose tissues that are independent of networks constructed from single tissue analyses. The subnetworks we identify as specific to tissue-to-tissue interactions associate with multiple obesity-relevant biological functions like circadian rhythm, energy balance, stress response, or immune response. Keywords: Tissue profiling in a mouse F2 cross.

DESIGN
We analyzed 308 adipose samples.
