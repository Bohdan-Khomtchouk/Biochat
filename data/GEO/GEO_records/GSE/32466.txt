TITLE
miRNA profiles in Primary and Recurrent GBM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) bears a dismal prognosis with rapid relapse following complete resection and radiochemotherapy. The involvement of microRNAs in tumor progression has been demonstrated in hepatoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancers. However, the microRNAs involved in modulating the progression and relapse of GBM are still unclear. Initially, we compared the miRNA expression profiles between primary and recurrent GBM tissues from the same patient in twelve independent cases.

DESIGN
