TITLE
Expression data of differentiated human erythroid cells with or without Tranylcypromine (TC) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that LSD1 inhibition by a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TC), could enhance fetal gamma globin expression. Global effects of TC on erythroid expession were conducted by HG-U219 array strips.

DESIGN
Primary human erythroid cells, which differentiated from CD34+ cells for 8 days,  were harvested before or and after TC treatment (0.5 µM, 1.5 µM or 5 µM)  for the gene expression analysis.
