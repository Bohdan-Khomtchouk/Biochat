TITLE
Reprogramming human somatic cells to a pluripotent state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we compare the global gene expression of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) cells with those of normal human embryonic stem cells and parental mesenchymal cells. Keywords: reprogramming, iPS

DESIGN
We used 1 chip/sample (3 iPS clones for each mesenchymal clone - 12 iPS clones; 4 mesenchymal clones and 5 normal human ES cell lines).
