TITLE
Global Gene Expression analysis of CUTLL1 cell lines after treatment with Perhexiline

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify perhexiline, a small molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, as a HES1-signature antagonist drug with robust antileukemic activity against NOTCH1 induced leukemias in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq from CUTLL1 cell lines treated with Perhexiline or vehicle for 3 days

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
