TITLE
Expression data from primary MEF lacking either HDAC1, HDAC2 or both

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously published data suggested some redundant functions between HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mouse. To test this hypothesis, we used microarrays to have a genome wide analysis at the transcription level of primary MEFs lacking HDAC1, HDAC2.

DESIGN
MEF HDAC1 F/F were were transduced with two different retroviruses: one virus expresses the Tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase Cre-ERT2 and the second virus expresses either a small hairpin micro-RNA against HDAC2 or a scrambled version. HDAC1F/F MEFs expressing either a scrambled micro-RNA or a micro-RNA against HDAC2 can be induced by addition of Tamoxifen to delete HDAC1, thereby generating four different genotypes: WT, HDAC1 KO, HDAC2 knockdown (Kd) and HDAC1/2 KO/Kd.
