TITLE
Expression data from region-specific postnatal astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Astroglial cells in the adult brain constitute a heterogeneous population endowed with region-specific properties. Recently, they have acquired greater relevance as active components of the adult neural stem cell (aNSC) niches. Astrocytes located in the vicinity of aNSC reservoirs are thought to regulate aNSC behaviour. We have compared the function of glial cells isolated from the postnatal and adult subventricular zone and hippocampus (two stem cell niches, where aNSCs self-renew and give rise to immature neurons), from the olfactory bulb (a neurogenic region where the immature neurons cease to proliferate and terminally differentiate) and from a non-stem and non-neurogenic area such as the ventral mesencephalon. Co-culture experiments demonstrate that subventricular zone glial cells secrete soluble signals that promote NSC self-renewing divisions. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of astroglial cells isolated from four different brain regions (olfactory bulb, ventral mesencephalon, hippocampus and subventricular zone) and identified up-regulated genes coding for secreted proteins in astrocytes from the subventricular zone.

DESIGN
Primary astrocytes were cultured from four CD-1 mouse brain regions and cells were employed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Primary tissue for the astrocyte cultures was dissected from four postnatal day 3 littermate pups. The tissue from the three pups was pooled in order to reduce individual differences of expression profiles.
