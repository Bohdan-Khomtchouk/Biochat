TITLE
Genetical toxicogenomics of lead treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
75 Diosophilia Roo lines, recominant inbred lines, were raised to adulthood either on conventional diet or diet supplemented with lead acetate. Whole flies were used for RNA extraction. RNA was run on Dros Genome 2 arrays. Each line also genotyped for 88 markers Control food consisted of standard cornmeal, agar, sugar, yeast, and 250 microM NaAc (Ashburner 1989). Lead-contaminated food consisted of standard food plus 250 microM PbAc (lead exposure at this concentration has been shown to affect locomotion in adults (Hirsch et al. 2003)). Keywords: genetical genomic
