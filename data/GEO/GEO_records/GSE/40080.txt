TITLE
ZNF-mediated resistance to imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
siRNA knock-down of ZNF genes determined to impact gastrointestinal stromal tumor response to imatinib were used to determine functional significance of ZNFs and identify key targets related to imatinib resistance.

DESIGN
exploratory array design to identify candidate effector genes for targeted study
