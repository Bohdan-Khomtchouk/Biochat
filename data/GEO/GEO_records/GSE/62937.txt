TITLE
C/EBPα and PPARγ-specific transcriptional programs in mature adipocytes in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We took a systematic approach to determine the transcriptional programs that are specifically regulated by C/EBPα in mature white adipocytes of mice on chow diet or high fat diet. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that C/EBPα, as a lipogenic transcription factor, has unique direct targets compared to PPARγ. Our inducible adipocyte specific knockout system allows us to test the direct targets of C/EBPα and PPARγ in adipocytes by short-term C/EBPα or PPARγ elimination in mature adipocytes in vivo. Results indicate that although it has been shown that C/EBPα and PPARγ cross-regulate each other, they have distinct direct responsive targets. Moreover, there are very few C/EBPα specific targets in mice on a chow diet, most of the C/EBPα targets in mature adipocytes are genes modulated by HFD feeding.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissue of Adn-C/EBPα-/- mice on doxycycline chow diet for 3 days,  doxycycline high fat diet for 3 days or 1 month and  Adn-PPARγ-/- mice on doxycycline chow diet for 3 days, compared to control littermates.
