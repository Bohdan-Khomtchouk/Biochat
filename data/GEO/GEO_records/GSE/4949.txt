TITLE
Tissue-specific expression profiles in L. vannamei

ORGANISM
Litopenaeus vannamei

SUMMARY
RNA from different tissues of Litopenaeus vannamei was used to test the ability of the microarray to discriminate tissue-specific gene expression profiles Keywords: validation, tissue comparison

DESIGN
RNA from circulating hemocytes, gills, hepatopancreas, or muscle (3 biological replicates each) was hybridized to the L. vannamei microarray. The number of hybridizing genes was noted and the relationships among the global profiles in each sample were determined by cluster analysis
