TITLE
Analysis of postnatal gene expression in a transgenic rat kidney

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have generated a transgenic rat model with postnatal pathology. In order to investigate the potential contribution of changes in kidney gene expression to the pathology, we have conducted microarray-based gene expression profiling of postnatal kidney.

DESIGN
Rat kidneys were sampled at mid-day of postnatal day 6 for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix Genechip arrays. Two biological replicates of both wild-type and transgenic kidneys were included in the study.
