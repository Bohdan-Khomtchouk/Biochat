TITLE
Gene expression profiling in porcine chronic myocardial ischemia treated with intramyocardial injections of secretome

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Closed-chest reperfused MI was induced in pigs by 90-min occlusion, followed by reperfusion of the mid LAD (day 0) and by cardiac MRI with late enhancement (LE) at day 3. At day 30 the animals received either porcine APOSEC (n=8) or placebo medium (n=8) in a randomized manner, injected into the border zone of MI using 3D NOGA percutaneous intramyocardial guidance. At day 60, control cardiac MRI with LE and measurements of myocardial viability via diagnostic NOGA were performed.  Gene expression profiling of the infarct core, border zone and normal myocardium was performed using microarray analysis, confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR.   Percutaneous endomyocardial injections of APOSEC led to a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in infarct size and in improvement of cardiac index and myocardial viability compared to medium treatment. Trend towards higher LV ejection fraction was observed in APOSEC vs. the Medium placebo group (45.4±5.9% vs 37.4±8.9%, p=0.052). Transcriptome analysis revealed significant downregulation of caspase-1 and other inflammatory genes in the APOSEC-affected areas. PCR showed higher expression of myogenic factor, Mefc2 (p < 0.05) gene with downregulated caspase-3 (p < 0.05) in the APOSEC-pigs. We have investigated the effects of catheter-based endomyocardial injections of APOSEC (secretome of apoptotic peripheral white blood cells) on porcine chronic post-infarction (MI) left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Pigs randomized to receive eithersecretome (n=8) or medium (placebo control, n=8)
