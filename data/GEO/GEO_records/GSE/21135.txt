TITLE
OCT4 Knockdown in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the genomic locations of three key regulatory proteins (OCT4, NANOG and CTCF) in human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [see Series GSE20650]. To identify the conserved and unique human OCT4 targets, we performed an OCT4 RNAi knock-down experiment. We find that species-specific transposable elements have profoundly altered the transcriptional circuitry of pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
To identify the mRNA targets of OCT4: 12 samples were collected in total. Each sample is done in triplicate and samples were collected at 2 different time point, 2 days and 3 days after transfection. Luciferase knockdown serves as negative control and OCT4 knockdown is the experimental sample.
