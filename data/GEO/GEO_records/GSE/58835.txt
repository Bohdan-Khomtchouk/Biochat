TITLE
RNA-sequencing of Culex pipiens molestus and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus

ORGANISM
Culex quinquefasciatus ; Culex pipiens molestus

SUMMARY
Culex pipiens molestus and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus are the members of Culex pipiens Complex, but they display relatively large differences in behavior and physiological responses. We compared the genes of these mosquitoes to identify those that were differentially expressed in each subspecies. Such genes could play important roles in subspecies-specific blood feeding or oviposition behavior.

DESIGN
Culex pipiens molestus and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus females were undertaken Illumina RNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL14891 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Culex quinquefasciatus) GPL18865 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Culex pipiens molestus)
