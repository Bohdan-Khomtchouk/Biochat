TITLE
Role of yeast Spt10p in gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression patterns for wild type yeast (BJ5459) and spt10-null::URA3 cells. Triplicate samples. Keywords = yeast SPT10 Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
Three RNA samples from wild type, spt10-null and spt10-C388S cells were prepared independently on three occasions. These nine RNA samples were used to make cRNA and hybridised separately to Affymetrix S98 arrays at the same time.
