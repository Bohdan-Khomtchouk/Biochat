TITLE
Microarray-based gene expression profiles in multiple tissues of the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
We designed and constructed a genome-wide microarray with 22,987 70-mer oligonucleotides covering the presently known and predicted genes in the silkworm genome, and surveyed the gene expression in multiple silkworm tissues on day 3 of the fifth instar. Clusters of tissue-prevalent and tissue-specific genes and genes that are differentially expressed in different tissues were identified, and they reflect well major tissue-specific functions on the molecular level. The data presented in this study provide a new resource for annotating the silkworm genome.

DESIGN
In the present study, we surveyed gene expression in the A/MSG, the PSG, testis, ovary, fat body, midgut, integument, hemocyte, malpighian tubule, and head from silkworm individuals on day 3 of the fifth instar. In order to establish gene expression differences between sexes, we prepared male and female samples of the same tissue. In addition, we also selectively performed the biological replicates at least twice for five tissues including testis, ovary, A/MSG, PSG and malpighian tubule, to evaluate biological reproducibility. In all, we prepared 30 two-channel hybridizations across the selected tissues for study. We extracted the single channel intensity instead of the ratio value from each two-channel hybridization for further analysis, a strategy that has been reported as being more flexible and valid previously.
