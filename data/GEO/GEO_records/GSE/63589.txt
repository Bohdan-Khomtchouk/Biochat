TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of HSF1 binding in human 451Lu melanoma cancer cells under basal conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HSF1 orchestrates a transcriptional program vital for cancer cells. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of HSF1 enrichment in the 451Lu melanoma in untreated cells. These results revealed a transcriptional program enriched for metastasis-related genes.

DESIGN
Twenty million cells were used for the ChIP and precipitated using 5 micrograms of antibody (cell signaling, 4356) against human HSF1

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
