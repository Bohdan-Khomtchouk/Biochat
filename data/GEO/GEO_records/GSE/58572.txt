TITLE
Deletion of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 kaiAB1C1 gene cluster causes impaired cell growth under light-dark conditions

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
In contrast to Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which has been the model cyanobacterium for the study of the prokaryotic circadian clock for more than 20 years, only few data exist on the circadian behaviour of the widely used cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The standard kaiABC operon present in this organism was shown to encode a functional KaiC protein which interacts with KaiA, similar to the Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 clock. Inactivation of this operon in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 resulted in a mutant with a strong growth defect in light-dark cycles, which was even more pronounced when glucose was added to the growth medium. In addition, mutants showed a bleaching phenotype. No effects were detected in mutant cells grown in constant light. Microarray experiments performed with cells grown for one day in a light-dark cycle revealed many differentially regulated genes with known functions in the ΔkaiABC mutant in comparison to the wild type. Most interestingly, we identified genes like the gene encoding the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and the light repressed protein LrtA as well as several hypothetical open reading frames with a complete inverse behaviour in the light cycle. These transcripts showed a stronger accumulation in the light but a weaker accumulation in the dark in ΔkaiABC cells in comparison to the wild type. In addition, we found a considerable overlap with microarray data obtained for hik31 and sigE mutants. These genes are known to be important regulators of cell metabolism in the dark.
