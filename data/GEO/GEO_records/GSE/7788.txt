Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma vs T cell/histiocyte rich B cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell/histiocyte rich B cell lymphoma (THRBL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) share some morphological characteristics, including a prominent stromal reaction, but display a markedly different prognosis. To investigate the difference between the stromal reactions of these lymphomas at the molecular level, we performed microarray expression profiling on a series of THRBL and NLPHL cases. Keywords: lymphoma, NLPHL, THRBL, stromal reaction
