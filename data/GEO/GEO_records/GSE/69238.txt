TITLE
Expression data from M0505 (with and without PAX2) murine ovarian surface epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our lab established the M0505 cell line from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) of FVB/N mice in May 2005 in order to study OSE biology. This cell line was infected with PAX2 to study the biological consequences of PAX2 expression in normal mOSE cells We used microarrays to try to determine the downstream targets of PAX2 in mOSE (M0505) cells  to gain information that may lead to a greater understanding of its oncongenic potential.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of M0505+WPI, M0505+PAX2  and M0505+PAX2+Cre cells were collected for RNA extraction and subesequent hybridization on the Affymetrix MoGene-1_0-st-v1 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
