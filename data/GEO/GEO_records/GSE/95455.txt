TITLE
Assessing the impact of the R252W Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutation in MORC2 on HUSH-mediated repression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells lacking MORC2 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption were reconstituted with either wild-type or R252W mutant MORC2, and re-repression of HUSH target genes assessed by RNA-seq

DESIGN
Total RNA-seq of MORC2 knockout cells, either 1) mock transduced, 2) transduced with lentiviral vector encoding wild-type MORC2 or 3) transduced with lentviral vector encoding R252W MORC2.
