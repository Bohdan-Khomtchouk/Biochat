SUMMARY
The subcellular localization of specific mRNAs is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that underlies the establishment of cellular polarity and specialized cell functions.  In neurons, mRNA trafficking and local protein translation in dendrites provides an important mechanism that mediates synaptic development and plasticity.  The significance of mRNA targeting and protein synthesis in axons, however, is still unclear.  Only a small number of transcripts have been identified in axons to date, and their contribution to axon growth and neuronal survival remains largely unknown. Here, we report the results of a novel screen that allowed the separate identification of mRNAs localized in cell bodies and in axons of developing neurons. Using compartmentalized cultures of sympathetic neurons and Sequential Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), the screen identified more than 200 axonal mRNAs, including ones that encode cytoskeletal proteins and proteins that function in neural development and signal transduction.  Importantly, several classes of transcripts were selectively enriched in axons, indicating that an active process drives the targeting of specific mRNAs from the cell bodies to the axons.  This study is the first comprehensive and unbiased analysis of mRNA localization in subcellular domains of any neuronal cell type.
