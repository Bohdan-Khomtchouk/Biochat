TITLE
Circulating mRNA Profiles Differ between Qi-Deficiency and Yin deficiency in Ischemic Stroke Rats with Blood Stasis Syndrome

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Qi deficiency blood stasis (QDBS) and Yin deficiency blood stasis (YDBS) are the two major subtypes of which according to the traditional Chinese medicine. This study was conducted to distinguish these two syndromes at transcriptomics level and explore the underlying mechanisms.

DESIGN
Male rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, QDBS/MCAO group and YDBS/MCAO group. Microarray and bioinformatics analyses with circulating mRNA were then performed to identify differential gene expression profile.
