TITLE
Expression data from Human gingival fibroblast transfected with CEMP1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cementum protein 1 (CEMP1) is involved in cell adhesion, cell differentiation, regulates the mineralization processes during cementogenesis, and selects progenitor cells from periodontal ligament. To determine the gene expression profiling induced by CEMP1 overexpression by non-osteogenic cells such as human gingival fibroblasts  we performed microarrays (Human Gene 1.0 ST, Affymetrix) to identify differentially expressed transcripts (ED) between human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and those that overexpress CEMP1 (HGF/CEMP1).

DESIGN
HGF cells overexpressing CEMP1 and controls were harvested at 3, 7 and 14 days after transfection of CEMP1, three biological replicates were analyzed for each time point and condition for a total of 18 microarrays.
