TITLE
Expression data from  human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) either cultured alone or co-cultured with human colon cancer cells HT29 or HCT116 respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cross-talk between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer cells remains controversial. It is imperative to understand how MSC and tumor cells communicate with each other and whether the MSC responds to the tumor according to its stage of progression. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in human BMSCs either cultured alone or co-cultured with colon cancer cells HT29 or HCT116 respectively

DESIGN
Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were isolated from the iliac crest bone marrow of the patient following their bone defect reconstruction. BMSCs cultured alone (B-ctrl), BMSCs co-cultured with HT29 (B-co-HT29) and BMSCs co-cultured with HCT116 for 5 days were collected and their gene expression profiles were assessed by human whole-genome microarray assay. Three batches of BMSCs were analyzed. Total RNA was extract from BMSCs using TRI reagent and the microarray study was performed at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China) using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array according to manufacturer's protocol. Microarray images were processed and the image analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console Software and digitized with the Affymetrix Expression Console. Data analysis was performed using Significance Analysis of Microarray software (SAM 3.0, Stanford University, USA; http://www-stat.stanford.edu ).
