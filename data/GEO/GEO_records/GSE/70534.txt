TITLE
Global miRNA expression in small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SBNET) and their lymph node/liver metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling study revealing novel miRNAs deregulated in SBNET compared to normal small bowel and identifying miRNA that are differentially regulated with disease progression. These have the potential to be used in the future for patient stratification and treatment response monitoring.

DESIGN
Dataset 1 Matched samples from 15 SBNET patients (47 samples) were used to determine a miRNA profile for SBNET and identify potential markers of disease progression. Patient numbers: 1-15. Dataset 2 A second dataset of miRNA expression data (43 samples) containing an increased number of liver metastases, as well as SBNET and lymph node metastases. Patient numbers: B9-B140, controls: C1, C2.
