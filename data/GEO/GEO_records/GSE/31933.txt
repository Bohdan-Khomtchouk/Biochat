TITLE
To determine the changes in the expression of human colon cancer cells (HCT-15) untreated and treated with 5-aza-2''-deoxycytidine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human colon cancer cells (HCT-15) treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine greatly enhanced sialyl Lewis X epitope, which correlated with increased binding of these cells to immobilized E-selectin in a parallel plate dynamic flow binding assay.

DESIGN
Human colon cancer cells (HCT-15) treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine greatly enhanced sialyl Lewis X epitope, which correlated with increased binding of these cells to immobilized E-selectin in a parallel plate dynamic flow binding assay. The sialyl Lewis x epitope resides at a 250 Kd protein band as assessed following immunoprecipitation. We would like to know changes in the expression of glycogenes following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment.
