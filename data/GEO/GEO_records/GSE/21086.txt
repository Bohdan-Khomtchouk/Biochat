TITLE
Investigation of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by microRNA expression profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and language development and/or usage, and by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Differential gene expression of neurologically relevant genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twins discordant in diagnosis or severity of autism suggested that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation or microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in ASD. The goal of this study was to reveal dysregulation in miRNA levels that are inversely correlated with altered levels of target genes that, in turn, may be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of ASD, and to provide a better understanding of the role of miRNAs as a post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism associated with ASD.

DESIGN
Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from peripheral lymphocytes of 14 male subjects were obtained from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE, Los Angeles, CA). The subjects included three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for diagnosis of autism, a normal sibling for 2 of the twin pairs, two pairs of autistic and unaffected siblings, and a pair of normal monozygotic twins. Global miRNA expression profiling of these LCLs was performed using high-throughput miRNA microarray analysis. A reference design was used for microarray hybridization in this study. The sample miRNAs were coupled with Cy3, whereas the common reference miRNA was coupled with Cy5, and two-colored miRNA microarray analyses were carried out by cohybridizing an equal amount of both miRNA samples onto one slide. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, and the putative target genes of two of the confirmed miRNAs were validated by knockdown and overexpression of the respective miRNAs.
