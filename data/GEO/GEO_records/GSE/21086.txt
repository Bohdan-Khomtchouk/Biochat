TITLE
Investigation of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by microRNA expression profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and language development and/or usage, and by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Differential gene expression of neurologically relevant genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twins discordant in diagnosis or severity of autism suggested that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation or microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in ASD. The goal of this study was to reveal dysregulation in miRNA levels that are inversely correlated with altered levels of target genes that, in turn, may be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of ASD, and to provide a better understanding of the role of miRNAs as a post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism associated with ASD.
