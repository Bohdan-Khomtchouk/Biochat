TITLE
Central Role of ULK1 in Type I Interferon Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide evidence that the Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is phosphorylated and activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor. Our studies demonstrate that the function of ULK1 controls expression of key interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate important biological functions, including anti-viral and antineoplastic responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from untreated and IFNβ-treated Ulk1/2+/+ and Ulk1/2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Cells were treated for 6 hours with or without mouse IFNβ (2500 IU/ml).
