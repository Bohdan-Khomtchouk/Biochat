TITLE
CGH to ascertain levels of gDNA in third instar salivary glands of various mutant Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to compare levels of gDNA in third instar salivary glands of Drosophila mutants/nulls in the SuUR and orc proteins, compared with 0-2hr diploid embryo gDNA.  This illustrates regions of differential replication in the genome.

DESIGN
CGH of salivary gland DNA compared with diploid early embryonic samples for four different Drosophila strains
