TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Cellular Dose-Response to Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a potent oxidant that is produced endogenously in mammalian tissue by phagocytes. Exogenous exposure to HOCl also can occur following inhalation of chlorine gas. HOCl has been implicated as a source of oxidative stress associated atherosclerosis and other diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify dose-dependent transitions in cellular response to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), with a  focus on understanding how various cellular defense and stress dose-responses overlap.
