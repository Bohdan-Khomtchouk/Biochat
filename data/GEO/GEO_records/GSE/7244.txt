TITLE
Expression data from AJ mouse control lung tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AJ mouse is susceptible to lung carcinogenesis from urethane treatment and is a good model for human adenocarcinoma.  We completed a study using microarray analysis to identify a unique macrophage expression signature in the lung tumor microenvironment. Keywords: Urethane treatment time course

DESIGN
RNA from lung tissues of age matched untreated controls (Normal) from AJ mice were from two time points 24 to 26 weeks (N) or 42 weeks (N42) after saline injection. Datasets were compared to previously published adjacent to tumor lung tissues in Stearman et al Am J Path 167 1763 (2005).
