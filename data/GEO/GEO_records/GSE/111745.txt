TITLE
Gene expression in the liver of mice infected with Fst288-AAV-TBG

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared RNA expression profiles of wild type of mice maintained on high fat diet or Irs1/2:foxo1-LTKO mice infected with Fst288 AAV-TBG virus Fst288-AAV-TBG infection modestly up- or down-regulated the expression of many genes, including several related to hepatic glucose metabolism (Pck1, G6pc and Gck) (Fig. S8a); qPCR confirmed that Fst288AAVâ€¢TBG affected the expression of these and other genes during both fasting (Pck1, G6pc and Gck) and feeding (Foxo1, Igfbp1, Pck1, and Ppargc1a)

DESIGN
All mice were fasted and Liver were collected.
