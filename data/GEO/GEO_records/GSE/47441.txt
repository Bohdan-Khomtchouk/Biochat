TITLE
Induction of pluripotency in mouse somatic cells with novel factors (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For years, reprogramming factors that induce pluripotency have been identified primarily from ESC-enriched factors, pluripotency-associated factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, Esrrb, Sall4, Utf1, Lin28, PRDM14, and Tet2. Through genome-wide screen we identified novel regulators of reprogramming. Our study is the first proof-of-principle report to suggest a putative general mathematical model. This model provides novel mechanistic insight into the fundamental understanding of the establishment of cellular identity during programming and reprogramming. Through genome-wide screen to identify novel factors of reprogramming in addition to Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc

DESIGN
Through genome-wide screen to identify novel factors of reprogramming in addition to Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc. Induced pluripotent stem cells versus mouse embryonic fibroblast.
