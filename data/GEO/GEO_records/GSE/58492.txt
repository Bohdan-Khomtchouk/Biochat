TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of LSD1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determination of the genes regulated by LSD1 in MDA-MB231 cells

DESIGN
MDA-MB231 cells were inactivated for LSD1 using siRNA. Two different siRNAs were used (siL1, siL2). Cells treated with a control siRNA (siC samples) were used for comparison. Duplicate samples were analyzed. Transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
