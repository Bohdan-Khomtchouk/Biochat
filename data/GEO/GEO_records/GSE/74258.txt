TITLE
A new metabolic route for the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid in Corynebacterium glutamicum

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Corynebacterium glutamicum shows a great potential for the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glucose fermentation via putrescine. GABA, a non-protein amino acid widespread in nature, is a component of pharmaceuticals, foods and the biodegradable plastic polyamide 4.  Here, the effect of GABA in the growth of C. glutamicum was evaluated. It was estimated that the presence 1.1 M of GABA in the medium reduces the maximum growth rate of C. glutamicum to half. It was also shown that the presence of GABA in the medium negatively affects the growth of C. glutamicum in ethanol as sole carbon source. Furthermore, a new route for the production of GABA in C. glutamicum was established. GABA production from glucose fermentation via putrescine was achieved by plasmid-based overexpression of putrescine transaminase (PatA) and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (PatD) in a putrescine production strain. The resultant strain can produce 5.3 ± 0.1 g L-1 of GABA. GABA production was improved by avoiding the formation of N-acetylputrescine and by reducing the amount of nitrogen in CGXII medium. Deletion of the genes responsible for GABA catabolism and GABA re-uptake led to an increase in the GABA production of 21% achieving a titer 8.0 ± 0.3 g L-1 and an increase in the volumetric productivity of 41% reaching a productivity of 0.31 g L-1 h-1, the highest volumetric productivity achieved so far for GABA production in C. glutamicum from glucose fermentation in flasks fermentations.  The results obtained hitherto are very promising and competitive compared to the traditional pathway for the production of GABA.
