TITLE
Expression Data from in vivo follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH) versus non follicular helper CD4 T cells (non-TFH)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of in vivo antigen-specific (LCMV-specific, SMARTA TCR transgenic) follicular helper CD4 T cells (CXCR5high),versus non-follicular helper CD4 T cells (CXCR5low), eight days after viral infection. A paper including data analysis of these experiments has been accepted for publication (Robert J. Johnston et al. Bcl6 and Blimp-1 are reciprocal and antagonistic regulators of follicular helper CD4 T cell differentiation).

DESIGN
Analysis of in vivo antigen-specific (LCMV-specific, SMARTA TCR transgenic) follicular helper CD4 T cells (CXCR5high), versus non-follicular helper CD4 T cells (CXCR5low), eight days after viral infection.
