TITLE
MiRNA array based, miRNA expression profiles of oral leukoplakia (OLK) and malignant transformed oral leukoplakia (mtOLK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the 122 miRNAs revealed a marked separation of mtOLK from OLK, suggesting that this differential expression profile might be used as a possible phenotypic discriminator between OLK and mtOLK.Comparing with OLK, 72 up-regulated and 50 down-regulated miRNAs were found in the mtOLK (p < 0.01)

DESIGN
In the study presented here,20 OLK（OLK), 5 mtOLK（Ca） tissues and 5 normal mucousal tissues（N） were examined by miRNA array
