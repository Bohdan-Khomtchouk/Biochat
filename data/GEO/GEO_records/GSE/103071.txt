TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of melanoma and carcinoma cells expressing FOXQ1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide RNA sequencing for high-throughput profiling of FOXQ1 target genes in melanoma and carcinoma cells. We generated melanoma (SK-Mel-147) and ovarian carcinoma cells (SCOV3) ectopically expressing FOXQ1. We find that FOXQ1 differentially regulates the expression of several genes in melanoma cells as compared to carcinoma cells. Specifically, FOXQ1 induces the expression of several genes in ovarian carcinoma cells SCOV3 and suppresses the expression of the same genes in melanom cells.  We show that this differentialy regulation of the same target gene depends upon the nuclear levels of beta-catenin. High levels of active nuclear beta-catenin promote FOXQ1 mediated transcriptional activation of genes whereas low levels contribute to TLE/Groucho- mediated repression. This study provides a framework for understanding the lineage specific pattern of transcriptional regulation by FOXQ1 and its contextual determinants.
