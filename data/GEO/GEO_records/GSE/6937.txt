TITLE
Ptdsr-/- (phosphatidylserine receptor) fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is fundamental to animal development, immune function and cellular homeostasis. The phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti-inflammatory signaling. Ptdsr is essential for the development and differentiation of multiple organs during embryogenesis. Ptdsr may thus have a novel, unexpected developmental function as an important differentiation-promoting gene. Moreover, Ptdsr is not required for apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages but seems to be necessary for the regulation of macrophage cytokine responses. Keywords: ptdsr, fibroblast, cDNA microarray experiments,

DESIGN
Comparison of Ptdsr-/- and Ptdsr+/+ fibroblasts in 14 chip experiments including 2 biological replicates (2 different fibroblast cell culture samples) and 50% dye swap experiments.

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
