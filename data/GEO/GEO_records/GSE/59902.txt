TITLE
DNA methylation study in breast cancer [aCGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Addressing the still unresolved question of the existence of CIMP in breast cancer DNA methylation alterations among histological breast cancer subtypes were examined by applying the HM450K BeadChip of Illumina Inc., covering about 480,000 single CpG sites. In addition to the occurrence of the hypermethylator phenotype in breast cancer, its relation to genetic instability and histological subtypes was investigated.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from 32 fresh-frozen primary breast tissue samples and 4 breast cancer cell lines were hybridized onto the HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip from Illumina Inc. Additionally, 28 of these primary samples were analyzed by array-based comparative hybdridization (aCGH).

PLATFORM
GPL10123 Agilent-022060 SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 4x180K (Feature Number version)
