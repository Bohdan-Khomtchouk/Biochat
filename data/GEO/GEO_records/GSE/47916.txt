TITLE
Expression of four hESC lines in enzymatic and mechanic passaging methods

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hESC have morphologic, genetic and genomic alternatiions when cells cultured in different passaging condition. Here transcriptome of four different hESC lines were compared in two passaging methods.

DESIGN
Cells had initially mechanic passaging. From the initiating passage (p13 for HD291, p16 for HD129 and p25 for HS306), cell were switched to enzymatic passaging. At indicated passges, the transcriptome were analysed by microarray.
