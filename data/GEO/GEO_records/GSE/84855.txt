TITLE
Total RNA: naïve ex vivo mouse OT-1 T lymphocytes, WT vs Lck-/- (OFF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment aims to study the transcriptome of naïve T cells at the steady state. A T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse model (OT-1) posessing a homogenous alpha-beta CD8 T lymphocyte population was used, and cells with intact TCR signalling pathways (WT) were compared to those with defective signal transduction (Lck-/-, OFF). Naïve (CD8b+, CD44low) ex vivo T cells were isolated from the superficial cervicals, axillary, brachial, mesenteric, and inguinal lymph nodes. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, labelled with Cy3, and hybridised onto an Agilent-074809 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE v2 8x60K Microarray.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of WT + 4 biological replicates of Lck-/- (OFF).
