TITLE
Murine Back Skin: Control vs. Cyclosporin A-treated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the gene expression at the onset of hair growth induced by cyclosporin A (CsA), a well-known hair growth inducer,  with DNA microarray, and unveiled the step-by-step progression of hair growth. KEYWORDS: Cyclosporin A, Cyclosporine A, Ciclosporin A

DESIGN
Ethanol-treated vs. cyclosporin A-treated mice back skin. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 cyclosporin A-treated replicates. Two, 4, and 7 days after application

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
