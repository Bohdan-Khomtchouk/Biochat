TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effect on ficolin deficient spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleens from ficolin knockout and wildtype mice treated without and with LPS to induce inflammation. Ficolins are pattern recognition molecules that initiate the lectin pathway of complement. Results provide insigt into the molecular basis of the inflammatory response of ficolin knockout mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression was investigated in spleens from the following groups (n=3 mice/group): untreated ficolin knockout (KO) mice; untreated wildtype (WT) mice; ficolin KO mice treated with 10mg/kg LPS for 6 hours; WT mice treated with 10mg/kg LPS for 6 hours.
