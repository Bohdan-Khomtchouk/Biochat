TITLE
Analysis of impact of a novel RNA gene named Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Susceptibility 3 (PTCSC3) on gene expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line cells (TPC-1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis in TPC-1 cells transfected with and without expression construct for PTCSC3 .

DESIGN
TPC-1 cells were transiently transfected in quadruplicate with an empty vector (pcDNA3) and with the expression vector harboring cDNA for PTCSC3. After 24 hours from transfection total RNA was extracted and used for microarray expreiment.
