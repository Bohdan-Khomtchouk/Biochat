TITLE
mRNA profiling in gastric cancer cell line AGS upon miR-25-3p silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed in AGS, gastric cancer cell line, upon miR-25 silencing. At 48 hours upon anti-miR-25-3p (miRNA inhibitor) and non-targeting control RNA transfection, the whole transcriptome profiling was performed in triplicates. The miR-25 silencing elevates the diffuse gastric cancer features like expression of COL1A2, expression of COL1A2 co-expressed genes, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and angiogenesis associated genes.

DESIGN
AGS cells were transfected with anti-miR-25-3p (miRNA inhibitor) and non-targeting control RNA in triplicates.  miRNA inhibitor transfection was performed twice with 24 hrs interval. Total RNA was isolated from the samples after 48 hrs of initial transfection. The RNA samples were processed and hybridized in Human Gene 1.0 ST Array and the differentially expressed probe sets were taken for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
