TITLE
Expression data of murine GPI-deficient bone marrow cells in a mouse model of targeted Pig-a deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Somatic mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) gene causes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deficiency in humans with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). Clinically, patients with PNH have intravascular hemolysis, venous thrombosis and bone marrow failure. We produced a conditional Pig-a knock-out mouse model specifically inactivating the Pig-a gene in hematopoietic cells to study the role of PIG-A deficiency in PNH pathophysiology. We used Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 chips to investigate the gene expression pattern in the mouse model of targeted Pig-a deletion. Keywords: Gene expression comparison between untransplanted and transplanted GPI-deficient bone marrow cells
