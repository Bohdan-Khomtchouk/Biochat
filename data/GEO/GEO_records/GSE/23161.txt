TITLE
Beta cell overexpression of HSD11B1 in high fat fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To model the potential diabetogenic effects of higher level of HSD11B1 in b-cells of the pancreas in vivo, we created a transgenic model overexpressing HSD11B1 under the mouse insulin I promoter (MIP-HSD1) in diabetes-prone C57Bl/KsJ mice. KsJ wild type and MIP-HSD1 heterozygous mice have been high fat fed for 12 weeks. Pancreata have been perfused with collagenase and islets isolated by hand picking. Isolated islets (around 500) coming from at least 3 mice (around 200/mice) have been directly lysed in Trizol. Total RNA have been extracted by Trizol plus RNA Purification Kit (invitrogen).

DESIGN
Four biological replicates per group: Wild type KsJ mice on High Fat diet (KsJ1, KsJ2, KsJ3, KsJ4) and MIP-HSD1 transgenic mice on High Fat diet (MIP1, MIP2, MIP3, MIP4) were used to prepare RNA for microarray analysis.
