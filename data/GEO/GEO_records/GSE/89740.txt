TITLE
Array comparative genomic hybridization of spheres derived from TH-MYCN (hemizygote) mice [Agilent-027441]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been already reported that there are undifferentiated/proliferating neuroblasts in the postnatal sympathetic ganglia in TH-MYCN mice, a neuroblastoma model. We established suitable spheroid culture condition that selectively isolates undifferentiated neuroblasts from superior mesenteric ganligon (SMG) of TH-MYCN mice. In order to investigate the chromosomal alterations (gains or losses) of spheres derived from TH-MYCN mice, we carried out array comparative genomic hybridization. We investigated whether chromosomal alterations occured during early neuroblastoma tumorigenesis in TH-MYCN mice.

DESIGN
Primary spheres were cultured from SMG of E13.5 and 3-week-old TH-MYCN mice, and from tumor tissues of TH-MYCN mice. Eight biological replicates of primary spheres from tumor tissues of TH-MCYN mice were subjected to the array CGH. Passageable spheres were obtained by subculturing primary spheres derived from E13.5 and 3-week-old TH-MYCN SMG. Six biological replicates of E13.5 TH-MYCN spheres and eight biological replicates of 3-week-old TH-MYCN spheres were subjected to array CGH.
