SUMMARY
Transcriptional Profiling of Insulin Sensitive and Insulin Resistant Samples

DESIGN
Sixty two participants at the tail ends of the distribution of insulin sensitivity adjusted for age, gender and natural logarithm of BMI for each ethnic group separately. Individuals at tail ends were well matched for age, gender, BMI, and percent fat, but were different for insulin sensitivity. Participants were of age 20 years to 55 years, body mass index (BMI) between 19 kg/m2 and 42 kg/m2, and had all biopsies obtained in the fasting state.
