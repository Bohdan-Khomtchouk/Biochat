TITLE
mRNA/microRNA expression profiles of HCC or CCC patients' liver, together with those of non-tumor part tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
11 CCC and 5 HCC patients' tumor and non-tumor parts tissues are extracted. Then total RNA are purified from tissues and mRNA and miRNA profiles are measured using agilent one color microarrays designed for mRNA or microRNA expression profiles.

DESIGN
Tumor and non-tumor parts are extracted from obtained tissues.
