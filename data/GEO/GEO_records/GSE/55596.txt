TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Follicular Helper T cells, Central Memory Precursors, and Terminal Effector Th1 Cells from Wild Type and Stat3fl/fl Cd4cre mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To compare the transcriptomes of activated CD4 T effector cell populations in the presence and absence of STAT3 at 8 days post-infection using high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis. Methods: Cell sorting of the populations was done using the markers Ly6c and PSGL-1

DESIGN
CD4 T cell Ly6c and PSGL-1 population mRNA profiles 8 days post-LCMV infection of wild type (WT) and STAT3fl/fl Cd4cre mice were generated by mRNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
