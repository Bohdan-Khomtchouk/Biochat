TITLE
Microarray Analysis of microRNA Expression during Axolotl Limb Regeneration

ORGANISM
Ambystoma mexicanum

SUMMARY
The salamander microRNA expression between mid-bud limb regenerating blastemas (17 days post amputation) and non-regenerating stump tissues was compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
LC Sciences arrays: Six paired samples were analyzed: three mid-bud 17dpa blastemas (bl), and three non-regenerating stumps (st). Three arrays were hybridized comparing two paired samples each time. Biological dye-swaps were made by labeling bl samples once with Cy3 and twice with Cy5; st samples were labeled accordingly twice with Cy5 and once with Cy3.  Multiple arrays averaged into a single Sample record.

Six arrays were hybridized comparing each sample labeled with Hy3 against a common reference sample made by pooling all the samples and labeling it with Hy5. Multiple arrays not averaged, represented as multiple Sample records. Supplementary file: GSE29727_Exiqon_matrix_complete.txt
