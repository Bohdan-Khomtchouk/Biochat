TITLE
IL-17A and IL-6 -stimulated expression data from primary epithelial cell cultures derived from human trachea tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAs were isolated from primary cultures after 24 hour treatment with IL-17A or IL-6 (10 ng/ml) in primary human TBE cells. We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression profiling of IL-17A or IL-6 regulated genes in TBE cells.

DESIGN
TBE cells were grown and stimutaed with the cytokines indicated. Total RNA were then extracted for Affymetrix microarray studies.
