TITLE
Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA-seq experiments in control and zfp217 shRNA infected cells delineate a Zfp217-driven network required for ES cell self-renewal.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was used to measure gene expression levels in luciferase control and Zfp217 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) infected mouse stem cells

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
