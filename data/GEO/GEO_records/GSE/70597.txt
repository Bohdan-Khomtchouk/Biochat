TITLE
Chromosomal origin utilisation in Haloferax meiditerranei wild type and mutant strains

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
We have comprehensively explored the origin utilisation in Haloferax mediterranei. Here we report three active chromosomal origins by genome-wide replication profiling, and demonstrate that when these three origins are deleted, a dormant origin becomes activated.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from the H. mediterranei cultures at specific time points(12h,18h,24h,36h,42h and stationary phase 66h), or during the exponential phase (OD600≈0.5) and stationary phase (OD600≈4.0)for the origin deletion strains. After being lablled, Genomic DNA from exponential phase and stationary phase were hybridized to Haloferax mediterranei genome array genechips.
