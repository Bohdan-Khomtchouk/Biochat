TITLE
Assessing the impact of loss of MORC2 on the transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing HeLa cells lacking MORC2 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to wild-type HeLa cells, the goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of loss of MORC2 on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Total RNA-seq of three independent knockout HeLa clones lacking MORC2.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
