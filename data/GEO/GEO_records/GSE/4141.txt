TITLE
Response to antimycin A in wild type Arabidopsis and in alternative oxidase overexpresser

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In higher plants, various developmental and environmental conditions enhance expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX). In this work transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were generated that either overexpress AOX or inhibit its synthesis. Gene expression following antimycin A treatment, which inhibits the cytochrome pathway in mitochondria, was studied in an AOX overexpressor line. An accumulation of AOX protein blocked normal responses of a number of genes, including some AOX genes. This result indicates that AOX can generate feedback to inhibit induction of its own synthesis. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Two wild type replicates: Poly-A RNA from two batches of plants were labeled with dye-swaps then hybridized to custom-designed arrays containing two sets of spotted DNA elements. Two S5 replicates: Poly-A RNA from two batches of plants were labeled with dye-swaps then hybridized to custom-designed arrays containing three sets of spotted DNA elements.
