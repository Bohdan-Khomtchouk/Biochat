TITLE
Microarray analysis of apple buds during dormancy

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
Closed terminal buds of apple trees (Malus x domestica Borkh, Royal Gala and Castel Gala varieties) grown in commercial orchards were harvested during autumn and winter and exposed to cold treatments

DESIGN
18 biological samples, consisting of 9 pairs of replicates, were analysed in dye-swap. Samples are whole closed terminal buds. Biological replicates are buds from 2 different harvest year subjected to similar cold treatments. Samples with contrasting dormancy status in the same harvest year were compared in 8 dye-swap. Most samples were hybridized more than once in different combinations
