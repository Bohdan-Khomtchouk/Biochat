TITLE
Analysis of HeLa cells after transfection with miR-1, miR-124 and miR-181.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells at 24 hours after transfection with wild type miR-1, miR-124, miR-181 versus control transfected HeLa cells.  Results were compared to protein down-regulation at 48 hours measured by SILAC-MS.
