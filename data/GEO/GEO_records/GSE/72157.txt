TITLE
Expression data from pooled biological replicates (n=6) from MEF2D knockdown in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Differentiation and maintenance of cardiac muscle is a complex biological process. MEF2D appears to play an important role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte homeostasis. We knocked down expression of MEF2D in NRVMs, and assessed global expression pattern changes in MEF2D knockdown against a negative control.

DESIGN
NRVMs were extracted from 1 to 2 day old rat pups and were allowed to recover for 24 hours before being transduced with shRNA viral vectors to knockdown expression of MEF2D or LacZ (negative control). After 3 days, total RNA was harvested for Affymetrix global gene expression microarray analysis. Each array was pooled RNA from six biological replicates.
