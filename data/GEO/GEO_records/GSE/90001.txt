TITLE
To find out microRNA contribute to the development of gallbladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the progression of cancer. However, little is known on the miRNAs expression profiles of gallbladder cancer.We performed this microarray to identify miRNAs associated with gallbladder cancer.

DESIGN
4 pairs of  gallbladder cancer tissues and paired normal gallbladder tissues were collected after colecystectomy.
