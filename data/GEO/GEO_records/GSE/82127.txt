TITLE
Chemical Mapping Reveals Novel Features of The Nucleosome Landscape in Mouse Embryonic Stem CellsÂ 

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nucleosome organization influences gene activity by controlling DNA accessibility to transcription machinery. Here, we develop a chemical biology approach to determine mammalian nucleosome positions genome-wide. Using this strategy, we uncover surprising new features of nucleosome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the prevailing model, we observe that for nearly all mouse genes a class of fragile nucleosomes occupies previously designated nucleosome-depleted regions around transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. We show that a subset of DNA-binding proteins including insulator CTCF and pluripotency factors co-occupy DNA targets with nucleosomes. Furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence that promoter-proximal nucleosomes, with the +1 nucleosome in particular, contribute to the pausing of RNA Polymerase II. Lastly, we find a characteristic preference for nucleosomes at exon-intron junctions. Altogether, we establish an accurate method for defining the nucleosome landscape, and provide a valuable resource for studying nucleosome-mediated gene regulation in mammalian cells.
