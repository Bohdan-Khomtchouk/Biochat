TITLE
AGO6 functions in RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in shoot and root meristems in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated epigenetic modification that contributes to transposon silencing in plants. RdDM requires a complex transcriptional machinery that includes specialized RNA polymerases, named Pol IV and Pol V, as well as chromatin remodelling proteins, transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and other plant-specific proteins whose functions are not yet clarified. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DICER-LIKE3 and members of the ARGONAUTE4 group of AROGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are involved, respectively, in generating and using 24-nt siRNAs that trigger methylation and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of homologous promoter sequences. AGO proteins act in silencing effector complexes by anchoring the 3â and 5â ends of the guide siRNAs at their N-terminal PAZ domain and MID domain, respectively. In addition, many AGO proteins cleave complementary target RNAs through an endonuclease (âslicerâ) activity in their C-terminal PIWI domain. AGO4 is the main AGO protein implicated in the RdDM pathway. Here we report the identification of the related AGO6 in a forward genetic screen for mutants defective in RdDM and TGS in shoot and root apical meristems in Arabidopsis thaliana. The identification of AGO6, and not AGO4, in our screen is consistent with the primary expression of AGO6 in shoot and root growing points and the preferential association of Pol V with AGO6.

DESIGN
Examination of siRNA abundance in the trasngenic wild type plant (contains trigger and silencer transgenes) and the ago6-4 mutant.
