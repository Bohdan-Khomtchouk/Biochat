TITLE
Expression analysis of mouse retinas after treatment with VEGF-A or Dll4-Fc.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of retinas extracted from mouse pups 24 hours after IVT injection (at P8) of 1 microgram VEGFA, 4 micrograms Dll4-Fc, or 4 microgram hFc alone.  Goal was to determine the mechanism by which inhibiting Dll4/Notch pathway is vasoprotective during retinal development.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: VEGF-A treated vs hFc, Dll4-Fc vs hFc.  Four replicates each for Dll4-Fc and hFc, five for VEGF-A.
