TITLE
Immortalized Human Hepatocyte (IHH) transcriptome response to wild-type Ebola viruses Zaire Ebola (ZEBOV '76) and Reston Ebola (REBOV '08)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to obtain samples for transcriptome analysis using wild-type viruses: Zaire Ebola (ZEBOV '76) and Reston Ebola (REBOV '08).

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Cells: Immortalized Human Hepatocytes (IHH); seed 60,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. After infection, 3x wash with PBS and replace with 5% FCS DMEM without NaPyr or NEAA. Time matched mocks done in triplicate from same cell stock as rest of samples. Time Points = 0, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hrs post infection in triplicate. (For miRNA: 8, 24, 48, 72 hours.)
