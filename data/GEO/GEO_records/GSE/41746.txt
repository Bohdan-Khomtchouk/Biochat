TITLE
Comparative expression data of PD21 Pik3cd+/- and Pik3cd-/- female mice ovaries responsed to exogenous gonadotropins.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Pik3cd null females are subfertile and have less growing follicles than their heterozygous littermates in the ovary. These mice poorly respond to the exogenous gonadotropins and ovulate much less oocytes than controls. In addition, the estrodial stimulated GC proliferation in preantral follicles is also impaired in Pik3cd null ovaries. FSH and E2 dramatically activates PI3K/AKT pathway in GCs of wild type mice, but not in the Pik3cd null mice. we used microarray to identify those genes regulated by Pik3cd in response to PMSG (Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin) and E2 treatment in ovary.

DESIGN
We set 3 treatment groups of both Pik3cd+/- and Pik3cd-/- female mice, including PD21 untreatment, PD21 after PMSG administration for 44 hours, PD21 after E2 administration for 72 hours, each group contained three biological repeats. The genes up/down-regulated significantly (not less than 2 fold change) in Pik3cd+/- mice after PMSG and E2 treatment were listed out as PMSG or E2 target genes, in which, those had not the same change trends in Pik3cd-/- were considered as Pik3cd-dependent genes.
