TITLE
Murine fibroblast-like synoviocytes: Control vs Ad-Epas1 infected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) comparing FLS infected with empty adenovirus and Epas1 adenovirus. RNA was extracted from each FLS. We used microarrays to determine the effect of Epas1 overexpression on FLS and identifying the noble regulatory molecules during rheumatoid arthritic pathogenesis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mock vs. Ad-Epas1 FLS. Biological replicates: 3 mock adenoviral infected replicates, 3 Ad-Epas1 infected replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
