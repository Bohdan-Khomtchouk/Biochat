TITLE
Microarray Analysis of the Delipidation of White Adipose Tissue of Mice Fed Conjugated Linoleic Acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The white adipose tissue (WAT) rapidly loses mass when mice are fed a diet containing trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA).  A microarray analysis of WAT due to CLA feeding was performed to better define the processes and genes involved.  WAT weight decreased by ca. 80% over 17 days of feeding a 0.5% t10c12 CLA diet.  The lipid volume decreased by 90% and the number of adipocytes and total cells were reduced by15% and 47%, respectively.  Microarray profiling of replicated pools of control and treated mice (n=140) at seven time points over the 17day feeding indicated between 2798 to 4318 genes showed mRNA changes of 2-fold or more.  Transcript levels for genes of glucose and fatty acid import or biosynthesis were significantly reduced. A prolific inflammation response was indicated by the 2 to100-fold induction of many cytokine transcripts, including those for IL-6, IL1?, TNF ligands, and CXC family members We used microarrays to characterize transcriptome changes in mouse adipose tissue due to feeding trans-10 cis-12 linoleic acid . Keywords: time course
