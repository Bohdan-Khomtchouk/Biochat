TITLE
Cell type-specific alternative splicing during mammalian neuronal differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative precursor-mRNA splicing (AS) is a key regulation of gene expression and protein diversity. AS is highly happened in the nervous system and misregulation of AS caused neurological diseases. In current research, we identified and validated the differential AS events from purified neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons. Our data demonstrated a systematic characterization of AS events between endogenous NPCs and neurons, which may serve as a useful resource for further investigations.

DESIGN
Differential alternative splicings of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons were analyzed
