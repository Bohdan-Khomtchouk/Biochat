TITLE
Gene expression signatures for TCM Suduxing treated HepG2.2.15 cells compared to  Suduxing untreated HepG2.2.15 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further analyze the gene expression profile regulated by TCM Suduxing, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the differentially expressed genes. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2.2.15 cells were treated for 48 hr with 0.001 μg/ml and 0.01μg/ml Suduxing or without Suduxing(control samples) in vitro. The differentially expressed genes including all detected and normalized signal more than 8 were selected and 538 upregulated- and downregulated- genes  were identified between 0.01μg/ml dose and control samples.Afterwards, the differentially-expressed genes were analyzed using KEGG database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) and 10 genes related to HBV infection-related molecular interaction network were identified.

DESIGN
Suduxing-regulated genes in HepG2.2.15 cells was measured at 48 hours after exposure to doses of 0 μg/ml, 0.001 μg/ml,and 0.01 μg/ml.Three independent experiments were performed at each time (48 hours) using different doses for each experiment.
