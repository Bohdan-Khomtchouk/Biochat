TITLE
Gene expression data from murine mDC and pDC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mDC and pDC exhibit distinct TLR expression pattern and differ in their responses to various TLR ligands. The goal of this study was to identify genes, that were differentally expressed between mDC and pDC as a means to determine how TLR signaling pathways operate. Suprisingly, expression of TLR-assoociated signaling proteins were found to be present at equivalent levels between mDC and pDC, despite differential expression of TLRs, and thus revealing insight into use of adaptor proteins that function as general regulators of TLR signaling pathways in both cell types.

DESIGN
mDC and pDC were sorted from spleens of mice in 2 independent experiments: The first experiment included 2 replicates of pDC that were cultured in medium for 1h prior to RNA extraction and 1 replicate of mDC that were directly processed for RNA extraction after the sort. In a second experiment we obtained 2 more replicates of mDC that were processed for RNA extraction directly after the sort and run on a seperate microarray for gene expression analysis.
