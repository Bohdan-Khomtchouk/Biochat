TITLE
MicroRNA Regulation by Phorbol-ester and cytokines in Human Lung Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Fetal pulmonary Fibroblasts (CCL153) were treated by PMA, IL1, TGFbeta and TNFalpha for 24 hours and compared for microRNA expression with control cells.

DESIGN
Dye-swap-experiment in which each stimulated (PMA,IL1,TGFbeta,TNFalpha) condition is compared with control cells.
