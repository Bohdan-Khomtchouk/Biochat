TITLE
CMPF alters expression of genes related to metabolism in isolated mouse islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CMPF is elevated in diabetes and is associated with impaired insulin secretion. We used microarrays to determine the effect of CMPF on gene expression in isolated islets.

DESIGN
Isolated islets from male CD1 mice were treated for 24h with vehicle control or 200uM CMPF.
