TITLE
DNA methylation signatures define molecular subtypes of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed DNA methylation (HELP array) and gene expression profiling in 69 samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). First, by gene expression, two molecular subtypes of DLBCL termed as " germinal center B cell-like " (GCB) and " activated B cell-like " (ABC) DLBCL were assigned to the 69 DLBCL cases. Then, the supervised analysis using HELP data revealed strikingly different DNA promoter methylation patterns in the two molecular DLBCL subtypes. These data provide epigenetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that utilize different oncogenic pathways.

DESIGN
The retrospective study included RNA and DNA extracted from 69 clinical samples. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study.
