TITLE
LECT2 effect on the bone marrow cells of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is under dynamic controlled in the bone marrow to differentiate into cells of all lineages that constitute the blood. The bone marrow niches form a specific microenvironment to maintain and regulate HSC. However, the mechanisms that the effect of cytokines from blood on HSC function still remain largely unknown. Leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 (LECT2), a liver-derived cytokine, is involved in many immune dysfunctions, such as sepsis, cancer and diabetes. Here we showed that LECT2 affected the gene expression of bone marrow cells in mice. Especially, we found that LECT2 treatment for 3 and 5 days led to the down-regulation of cytokines such as, TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL3 et al. Moreover, the functions and mechanisms for LECT2 regulated HSC in bone marrow is still needed further investigation.

DESIGN
Recombinant LECT2 was subcutaneously injected at a dose of 300 μg/kg body weight (once a day for 0, 3, or 5 days) in mice. The bone marrow cells were flushed out from femur, tibia, pelvis, and humerous in PBS.
