TITLE
Gene expression profiles in nineteen Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared global gene expressions between pre- and post- intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in nineteen Kawasaki disease (KD) patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from nineteen patients before and after IVIG treatment was extracted using a PAXgene blood RNA isolation kit. Amplified cRNAs of each patient were analyzed using with Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F array.

DESIGN
Nineteen pair of dye-swapped experiments were performed.
