TITLE
Genome-wide map of H3K4me3 in 12 day post-partum mouse spermatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we characterize the genome-wide chromatin modification by PRDM9, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. In order to detect PRDM9 binding sites we created coisogenic strains of mice differing only in the zinc finger array of PRDM9. One strain is C57BL/6J, which carries the Prdm9Dom2 allele, the other strain was created using genomic replacement and named B6.PRDM9Cst (also called KI), and contains the Prdm9Cst allele originally found in CAST/EiJ mice. Many H3K4me3 positions are common between strains and represent other methyltransferase activity (such as promoters), sites that are unique to one mouse strain likely represent the binding position of that allele of PRDM9.

DESIGN
Identify PRDM9-dependent H3K4me3 sites by comparing modified chromatin from mice coisogenic for Prdm9.
