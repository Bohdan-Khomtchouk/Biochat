TITLE
Comparison Ezh1 and Ezh2 binding by ChIP on chip in F9 mouse cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of Ezh2 and Ezh1 promoter binding in F9 mouse teratoma cell line.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated F9 cells were used for this experiment. Antibodies specificity were checked using a stable cell lines overexpressing a GAl4-Ezh1 or a Gal4-Ezh2 in an inducible manner followed by conventional ChIP at Gal4 responsive transgene.
