TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression changes during differentiation in the Drosophila wing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in dissected Drosophila wings of the genotype w1118, at the wandering L3 larval stage, 2h, 6h, 18h, 24h and 36h After pupa formation. Stages after pupa formation were compared to the larval L3 stage to identify changes in gene expression. The data included here is further discussed in Oâ€™Keefe, Thomas, Edgar and Buttitta (2012). Combinatorial control of temporal gene expression in the Drosophila wing by enhancers and core promoters Submitted to BMC Genomics

DESIGN
A 24 chip study using total RNA recovered from three to four independently isolated samples of 10 dissected Drosophila wings at the indicated developmental stages from flies with the genotype w1118;+;+ (Bloomington Stock #3605). For sample 36BD, total RNA from sample 36B and 36D were pooled, labeled and hybridized independently.
