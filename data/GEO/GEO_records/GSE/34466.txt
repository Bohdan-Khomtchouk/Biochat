TITLE
Airway Epithelial miRNA Expression in Asthma

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression in the airway epithelial compartment in asthma to identify miRNA pathways associated with epithelial abnormalities using miRNA microarrays and real-time PCR. We also sought to identify the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on airway epithelial miRNA expression
