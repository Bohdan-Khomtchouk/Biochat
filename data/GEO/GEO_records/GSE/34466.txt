TITLE
Airway Epithelial miRNA Expression in Asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression in the airway epithelial compartment in asthma to identify miRNA pathways associated with epithelial abnormalities using miRNA microarrays and real-time PCR. We also sought to identify the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on airway epithelial miRNA expression

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from  airway epithelial cells by bronchoscopic brushing from three groups of subjects: Healthy Controls ( N=12), Steroid Na√Øve Asthma (N=16), Steroid-requiring Asthma (N=19).
