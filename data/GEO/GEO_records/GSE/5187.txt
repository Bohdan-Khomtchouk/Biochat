TITLE
Identification of transcriptome of nst1-1 nst3-1 plant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Wood is one of the most important and enormous biomass that is widely used in our life. It is formed by successive addition of secondary xylem that develops continuously from cambium. The transcriptome of nst1 nst3 “double-knockout” lines was examined to know the effect of mutations on wood formation. Keywords: mutant vs wt comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the base 4 cm part of inflorescence stems whose heights were between 12 and 17 cm of three independent nst1-1 nst3-1 double T-DNA tagged lines and the whole transcriptome was compared with that of wild-type plant.
