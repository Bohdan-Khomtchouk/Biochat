TITLE
Gene expression profile in HHUA treated with telmisartan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential and novel target genes responsive to the anticancer effect in telmisartan-treated gynecological cancer cells, we examined the global changes in gene expression in HHUA endometrial cancer cells after treatment with telmisartan.
