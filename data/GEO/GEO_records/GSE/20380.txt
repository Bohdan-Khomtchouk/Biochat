TITLE
Global transcriptional response of E. coli to the presence and absence of bile salts

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Unlike many other types of diarrheagenic bacteria that act primarily in the small intestine, O157:H7 expresses virulence primarily in the large intestine. In this study, microarray analysis is employed to examine the transcriptional response of O157:H7 to bile treatment, to gain insight into how bile affects virulence and whether bile might be temporally defending the small intestine against virulence by these bacteria. Keywords: Expression profiling of two different growth conditions

DESIGN
Two groups of three replicates were used:  E.coli O157:H7 grown in Luria broth with or without 0.8% bile salts
