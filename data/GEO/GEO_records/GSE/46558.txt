TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNA in burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Interactions between stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 are crucial for the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow (BM) reservoirs to damaged tissues for repair during alarm situations. MicroRNAs are differentially expressed in stem cell niches, suggesting a specialized role in stem cell regulation. Here, we gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating SDF-1α. Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of microRNAs (in all organisms as annotated in Sanger miRBase Release 11.0 ( ))in one burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue,which had 57 upregulated microRNAs and 28  down-regulated microRNAs.
