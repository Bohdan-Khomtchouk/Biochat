TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression alterations in human primary hepatocytes compared with cAMP treated and non-treated human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived hepatic populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression differences between primary human hepatocytes and hESC derived hepatoblast cultures treated or non-treated with cAMP. hESC's were differentiated with a hepatic cell lineage specific protocol that included the use of a 3-dimensional cell aggregation culturing technique. Followed by cAMP signaling, this promoted the maturation of hepatoblasts into a more hepatocyte-like population. Importantly, key enzymes related to liver function show that cAMP induced populations have a gene expression profile that is similar to primary human hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured primary hepatocytes and hESC derived hepatic populations.
