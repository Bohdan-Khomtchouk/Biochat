TITLE
Fine-tuning of the anaerobic response in plants relies on trihelix protein repression of the oxygen sensing machinery

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study analyzes transcriptomic data of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and overexpression lines of Hypoxia Response Attenuator (HRA1; At3g10040) with Col-0 background (OE-HRA1). Two independent transgenic lines of OE-HRA1 were considered as biological replicates (OE-HRA1#1 and OE-HRA1#2). Seven-day-old seedlings were treated either with or without hypoxia (low oxygen) stress for 2 hours. This dataset includes CEL files, RMA signal values and MAS5 P/M/A calls from total mRNA populations. Quantitative profiling of cellular mRNAs was accomplished with the Affymetrix ATH1 platform.

DESIGN
8 samples, 2 genotypes (Col-0 and OE-HRA1), 2 conditions (2 h non-stress and 2 h hypoxia stress), 2 independent biological replicate experiments
