TITLE
Expression data from WT and ELK-1 overexpressing stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two ELK-1 overexpressing cells were generated from CSES7 cell line and compared to WT CSES7. We used microarrays to study the gene expression profiles of the ELK-1 overexpressing cells in order to identify ELK-1 target genes that might be involve in the processes of apoptosis and differentiation

DESIGN
CSES7 cells were transfected with the ELK-1 vector.
