TITLE
Casein kinase II promotes target silencing by miRISC through direct phosphorylation of the DEAD-box RNA helicase CGH-1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In this study we show that global levels of mature miRNAs are unaffected in C. elegans after knockdown of either subunit of CK2 (encoded by kin-3 and kin-10) by RNAi.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were quantified from wild-type animals at L4 stage fed either vector (L4440), kin-3, kin-10, or alg-1 RNAi. Mature miRNA counts were quantified by summing the total number of reads mapping to each miRNA and normalized to the total number of mapped reads per sequencing library.
