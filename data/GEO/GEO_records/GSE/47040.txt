TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B (docetaxel sensitive) and  TaxR (docetaxel resistant) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer C4-2B cells were cultured in docetaxel in a dose-escalation manner. After nine months selection, cells were able to divide freely in 5 nM docetaxel, with a specific sets of genes been deregulated. We performed global gene expression analysis by cDNA microarrays to  identify genes responsible for docetaxel resistance in TaxR cells.

DESIGN
Docetaxel resistant TaxR cells were selected from C4-2B cells during long time docetaxel treatment. Genes responsible for docetaxel resistance were identified using C4-2B vs. TaxR RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
