TITLE
ERRalpha wt vs. ko hearts, baseline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa), which recruits PGC-1a to metabolic target genes in heart, exerts protective effects in the context of stressors known to cause heart failure. ERRa-/- mice subjected to left ventricular (LV) pressure overload developed signatures of heart failure including chamber dilatation and reduced LV fractional shortening. 31P-NMR studies revealed abnormal phosphocreatine depletion in ERRa-/- hearts subjected to hemodynamic stress, indicative of a defect in ATP reserve. Mitochondrial respiration studies demonstrated reduced maximal ATP synthesis rates in ERRa-/- hearts. Cardiac ERRa target genes involved in energy substrate oxidation, ATP synthesis, and phosphate transfer were downregulated in ERRa-/- mice at baseline or with pressure overload. These results demonstrate that ERRa, a potential therapeutic target, is indispensable for the adaptive bioenergetic response to hemodynamic stressors known to cause heart failure. Keywords: Genetic modification, stress response

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed with two samples each of ERRawt and ERRako to compare baseline changes in gene expression.  Validation real-time PCR (n=7) was subsequently performed to characterize expression changes of gene targets identified in microarray and ChIP-chip studies in hearts of ERRa wt and KO mice at baseline and subjected to pressure overload stress.
