TITLE
Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Incorporate Into the Prostate During Regrowth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse prostate stromal cells knocked out for Tgfbr2 were compared to that of the Tgfbr2-flox control.   Elevated chemokine expression in the prostate stroma of a castrate resistant mouse model, Tgfbr2-fspKO, prompted us to determine the role of bone marrow derived cell recruitment to the prostate during regrowth.

DESIGN
Tgfbr2-flox prostate epithelia vs. Tgfbr2-fspKO prostae epithelia. Biological replicates: 3 Tgfbr2-flox mouse prostates pooled, 3 Tgfbr2-fspKO mouse prostate replicates.

PLATFORM
