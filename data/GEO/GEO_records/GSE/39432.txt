TITLE
Embryo and endosperm gene expression profile at ripening stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of embryo and endosperm at 7-42 days after flowering (DAT) was performed to obtain an overall signature of the rice transcriptome during grain development and maturation.

DESIGN
After the onset of pollination, embryo and endosperm samples at 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 42 DAT with three replicates were collected and used for microarray analysis. A total of 36 embryo and endosperm microarray data were obtained.
