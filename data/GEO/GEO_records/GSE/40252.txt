TITLE
Gene expression profile of C. elegans worms when mekk-3 is knocked down by RNAi

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have discovered a novel gene, mekk-3/idr-1, which when knocked down by RNAi dramatically increases life span. In order to understand how this gene works, we performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of control and mekk-3/idr-1 RNAi-grown worms.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of wild type N2 worms on mekk-3/idr-1 RNAi w.r.t to control RNAi worms. Total RNA was isolated from L4 larvae. Two independent biological samples for each RNAi were analyzed.
