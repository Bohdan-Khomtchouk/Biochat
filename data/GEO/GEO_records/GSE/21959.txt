TITLE
Transcriptional response to hypoxia of normal and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory tissues are characterized by low oxigen concentrations (hypoxia). These conditions are very different from that usually present in tissue cultures where transcriptomic profiles of human fibroblasts from inflammatory tissues have been previously analysed. The aim of this study was to characterize the changes on gene expression induced by hypoxia in human synovial fibroblasts. We used microarray expression profiling in paired normoxic and hypoxic cultures of healthy and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (HSF and RASF). Hypoxia induces significant changes on the expression of large groups of genes in both HSF and RASF. The hypoxic and normoxic profiles are also different between both groups. These data demonstrate that hypoxia induces significant changes on gene expression in HSF and RASF and identify differences between RASF and HSF.

DESIGN
Synovial fibroblasts obtained from 6 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RASF) and 6 sex and age matched adult healthy donors (HSF) were used. SF cultures were incubated for 22 hours under normoxic or hypoxic (0.5% O2) conditions. Nine experiments per group were performed, single experiments with three SF lines, and duplicated in other three lines per group. All 18 normoxia-hypoxia experiments (36 microarray data) were used for paired analysis of the changes induced by hypoxia in HSF or RASF.
