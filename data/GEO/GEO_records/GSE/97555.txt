TITLE
Mouse lung tissue transcriptome response to H1N1 and mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for virus titration, transcriptome, bioplex and histopathology analysis of mouse lungs after etoposide treatment and infection with a pandemic H1N1 influenza strain.

DESIGN
Groups of 7-8 week-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with etoposide or vehicle by oral gavage one day before virus, wild-type A/Oklahoma/Vir09-1170038L3/2009(H1N1; 'OK/09'), infection, on day of infection, and all subsequent days post-infection.  Infections were done at 100,000 PFU/mouse for H1N1 strain.  Time points were 0, 3, and 6 days post infection.  There were 5 mice for all infection groups.  Lung samples were collected for virus load and transcriptional analysis.  Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
