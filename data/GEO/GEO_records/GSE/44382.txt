TITLE
Expression data from Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis strains exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSM 10140 ; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04

SUMMARY
Stress survival tactics in bacteria utilize the up- and down-regulation of stress response genes.  In bacteria that lack classical stress response genes for oxidative stress, other cellular systems can be used for cell survival. We used custom microarrays to study the regulation of genes in Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis strains to oxidative stress to elucidate novel stress response mechanisms.

DESIGN
Bifidobacterium cells were grown to late log phase then harvested and exposed to a sub-lethal level of hydrogen peroxide.  Samples were taken at 5 and 20 mins for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Controls were prepared for each time point which recieved no hydrogen peroxide treatment.
