TITLE
The effects of temporally restricted feeding on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporally restricted feeding is known to impact the circadian clock. This dataset shows the effects of temporally restricted feeding on the hepatic transcriptome.

DESIGN
C57/B6 mice were entrained for two weeks to a temporally restricted feeding schedule. Food was made available only between ZT(CT)1 and ZT(CT)9. Mice were then released into constant darkness while food availability was still restricted and liver tissue was collected at the indicated timepoints on the second day in constant darkness. Total RNA was extracted and 5ug were submitted to the standard Affymetrix protocol for amplification, labeling and hybridization.
