TITLE
Real-time based miRNA array for MCF10 derived cell series with different metastatic potentials

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10AT1 (M-II), MCF10CA1h (M-III) and MCF10CA1a.cl1 (M-IV) are a set of human breast cancer cell lines that derived from the same parent cell line MCF10 but display distinct phenotypes in metastatic potential in the form of xenografts in immune-compromised mice. From M-II to M-IV, the metastatic potential is gradually increased. Using a self-designed real-time PCR based miRNA array containing 242 genes, we tested the miRNA expression levels in these cell lines in order to identify metastasis-related miRNAs.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Equal amount total RNA from each cell line was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
