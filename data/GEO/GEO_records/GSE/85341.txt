TITLE
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes stimulate cycling quiescence and early breast cancer dormancy in bone marrow

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transwell cultures were established in 6-well plates with 0.4 micron inserts. Equal amounts (6x10e4) of BCCs and MSCs were added to the outer and inner wells, respectively, in DMEM with 10% exosome-free FCS. After 24 h, the inner wells with BCCs were discarded. The MSCs were washed with PBS and then incubated with DMEM with 2% exosome-free FCS. At 48 h, exosomes were isolated from the MSC media. The exosomes from triplicate wells were added to duplicate na√Øve BCCs at 2.5x105/well of 6-well plates.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. RNA from MSCs-Exosomes were analyzed as indicated in the summary. The PCR was run on the 7300 Real-Time PCR System using the following thermal-cycling parameters: 94 0C for 15 min, 40 cycles at 940 C for 10 sec, 550 C for 30s, 700 C for 30 sec followed by a melting curve analysis.
