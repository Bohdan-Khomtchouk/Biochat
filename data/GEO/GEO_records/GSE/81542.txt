TITLE
Nuclear mRNA quality control is bypassed for rapid export of stress responsive transcripts [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparative analyses of Mex67 and Npl3 binding to mRNA at normal growth condition (25째C) and upon shift to heat stress (30 min, 42째C).

DESIGN
Examination of two biological RNA Co-IP replicates of Mex67, Npl3 and no tag control at 25째C and upon shift to 30 min at 42째C (Heat stress) and subsequent Illumina RNA deep-sequencing
