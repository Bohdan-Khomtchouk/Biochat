TITLE
Skeletal muscle gene expression in WT C57BL/6 versus TLR2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT C57BL/6 and TLR2-/- mice were used in this study. TLR2-/- mice were on a C57BL/6 background and were kindly provided by Dr S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilminton, MA, USA). All the mice used in this study were males and more than 7 weeks old. Animals were kept and bred at Karolinska Institutet animal facility in a specific pathogen-free environment with standard room temperature and a 12-12 hour light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Mice were killed by rapid neck disarticulation and the flexor digitorum brevis muscles were removed.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from flexor digitorum brevis muscle in 7-9 weeks old male TLR2-/- C57BL/6  and WT C57BL/6 littermates (n=4+4)

PLATFORM
GPL23972 [MoGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array [CDF: mogene21st_Mm_ENTREZG_21.0.0]
