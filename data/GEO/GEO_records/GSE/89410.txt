TITLE
High-Throughput Screening of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Cardiotoxicity using Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), despite efficacy as anti-cancer therapies, are associated with cardiovascular side effects ranging from induced arrhythmias to heart failure. We have utilized patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), generated from 11 healthy individuals and 2 patients receiving cancer treatment, to screen FDA-approved TKIs for cardiotoxicities by measuring alterations in cardiomyocyte viability, contractility, electrophysiology, calcium handling, and signaling. With these data, we generated a “cardiac safety index” to assess cardiotoxicities of existing TKIs. Many TKIs with a low cardiac safety index exhibit cardiotoxicity in patients. We also derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) and cardiac fibroblasts (hiPSC-CFs) to examine cell type-specific cardiotoxicities. Using high-throughput screening, we determined that VEGFR2/PDGFR-inhibiting TKIs caused cardiotoxicity in hiPSC-CMs, hiPSC-ECs, and hiPSC-CFs. Using phosphoprotein analysis, we determined that VEGFR2/PDGFR-inhibiting TKIs led to a compensatory increase in cardioprotective insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in hiPSC-CMs. Activating cardioprotective signaling with exogenous insulin or IGF1 improved hiPSC-CM viability during co-treatment with cardiotoxic VEGFR2/PDGFR-inhibiting TKIs. Thus, hiPSC-CMs can be used to screen for cardiovascular toxicities associated with anti-cancer TKIs, correlating with clinical phenotypes. This approach provides unexpected insights, as illustrated by our finding that toxicity can be alleviated via cardioprotective insulin/IGF signaling.
