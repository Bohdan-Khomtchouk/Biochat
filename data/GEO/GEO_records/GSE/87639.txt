TITLE
A Gata2 dependent transcription network regulates progesterone signaling and endometrial function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gata2 dependent genes in mouse uteri were identified by the conditional ablation of Gata2 using the (PR-cre) mouse upon acute progesterone administration.

DESIGN
Mice were ovariectomized at 6 weeks of age. Two weeks later, ovariectomized mice were injected with either vehicle (sesame oil) or progesterone (in sesame oil, 1 mg per mouse in 100 μl) and mice were sacrificed 6 hours after the injection, uterine tissues were snap frozen and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted from uterine tissues using the Qiagen RNAeasy total RNA isolation kit. The RNA was pooled from the uteri of 3 mice per genotype and subject to microarray analysis.
