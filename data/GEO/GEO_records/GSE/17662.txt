TITLE
Modulation of gene expression by rapamycin in hepatic cell lines, H5D and GN5

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Two rat hepatic cell lines, GN5 and H5D, were characterized for the effect of rapamycin on gene expression.  These cells lines are tumorigenic and display intermediate sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin.  The goal of this experiment was to assess the effect of rapamycin on gene expression independent of effects on cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA for each of four experimental groups was prepared and analyzed in triplicate:  GN5, Vehicle Control; GN5, Rapamycin; H5D, Vehicle Control; H5D, Rapamycin
