TITLE
Twist1 knockdown in two gastric cancer-associated fibroblast lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human gastric cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cultures (CAF14 and CAF32) were establised from 2 gastrectomy specimens. Silencing the expression (loss-of-function effect) of Twist1 in CAFs showed candidate target genes regulated by Twist1 and abrogated their tumor-promoting properties.

DESIGN
Experiment design: two gastric CAFs (CAF14 adn CAF32, respectively) were establised from two gastric cancer patients and Twist1 knockdown studies were performed using shRNA.
