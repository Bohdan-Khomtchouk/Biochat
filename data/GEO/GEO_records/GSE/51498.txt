TITLE
Regulation of HSF1-mediated transcriptional programs by PGC-1alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined global gene expression patterns in response to PGC-1 expression in cells derived from liver or muscle. As our study revealed regulation of HSF1 by PGC-1alpha, in some experiments we knocked-down HSF1 using siRNAs in addition to inducing PGC-1alpha expression.

DESIGN
Cells were grown in 24-well plates and adenoviruses encoding either GFP ( " Ad-GFP " ), PGC-1alpha ( " Ad-PGC-1alpha " ) or PGC-1beta ( " Ad-PGC-1beta " ) were directly added to the culture medium. For experiments involving siRNA transfections, cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs 48hr prior to infection with adenoviruses encoding either GFP ( " Ad-GFP " ) or PGC-1alpha ( " Ad-PGC-1alpha " ).
