TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of S. Typhimurium SL1344 parent strain and ΔrpoS and ΔrelAΔspoT and ΔrelAΔspoTΔrpoS mutant strains grown to various optical densities during late-log and stationary phase in LB aerobic batch culture

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
S. Typhimurium SL1344 parental strain and isogenic ΔrpoS, ΔrelAΔspoT and ΔrelAΔspoTΔrpoS strains were grown to OD600=1.0, OD600=2.3, OD600=3.0 and OD600=4.2 in Luria-Bertani medium.

DESIGN
35 samples (parent, ΔrpoS, ppGpp^0 and ΔrelAΔspoTΔrpoS at late-log, early stationary, mid-stationary and late stationary growth phases and 3 biological replicates for each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL13609 SALSA 2 IFR Salmonella 8K Arrays
