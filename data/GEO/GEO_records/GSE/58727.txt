TITLE
Expression data from E18 mouse dorsal telencephalon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurons deficient in both GSK-3 alpha and beta isoforms fail to migrate properly and develop abnormal morphology.  In exploring mechanisms, we found no change in Wnt transcriptional target genes. Verified decrease in GSK-3B exon 2

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from presumptive somatosensory cortices of E18 GSK-3 alpha -/- beta loxp/loxp (control) and GSK-3:Nex conditional mutant embryos.  There were totally 6 samples: 3 control and 3 mutants.
