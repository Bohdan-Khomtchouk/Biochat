TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of microdissected ventromedial hypothalamus in Nkx2-1 f/f vs. Nkx2-1 f/f; Sf1Cre female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microdissected ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) was profiled to identify transcriptional changes after Nkx2-1 ablation in female mice. Total RNA was extracted from conditional mutants (Nkx2-1 f/f; Sf1Cre) and floxed controls (Nkx2-1 f/f) at postnatal day 10 (P10) and profiled using Mouse ref8 v2.0 Illumina chips and reagents (n=4/group).

DESIGN
The tissue profiled is microdissected ventromedial hypothalamus from P10 female mice. Controls and mutants are analyzed in quadruplicate.

PLATFORM
