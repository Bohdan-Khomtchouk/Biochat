TITLE
Identification of potential biomarkers in donor cows for in vitro embryo production by granulosa cells transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study we sequenced RNA of granulosa collected from Holstein cows at oocyte aspiration prior to IVP, to identify candidate genes and biological mechanisms for favourable IVP-related traits in donor cows.

DESIGN
24 RNA-Seq profiles of granulosa cells collected from antral follicles of 24 cows. Each animal was scored for In Vitro Production performances (blastocysts rate, morphology and kinetic scores). Half of the oocytes were inseminated with semen from high genetic merit bulls and half with semen from low genetic merit bulls.
