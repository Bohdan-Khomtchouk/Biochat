TITLE
SMRT compounds abrogate cellular phenotypes of Ataxia Telangiectasia in neural derivatives of patient specific hiPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
gene expression profiling of WT fibroblasts, hiPSCs, and NPCs compared to the same cell types isolated from patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia gene expression profiling was carried out with Affymetrix Hg133 2.0 plus chips

DESIGN
fibroblasts, hiPSCs, hESCs, and NPCs were isolated and compared by gene expression

PLATFORM
