TITLE
Expression data from obese children (boys)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze gene response to a 10-week dietary intervention for weight loss in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of overweight/obese male children.

DESIGN
PBMCs were obtained from 12 overweight/obese boys for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed the microarray analysis at baseline and after a weight loss intervention program in a total of 24 samples. They were distributed by dietary response as high and low responders.
