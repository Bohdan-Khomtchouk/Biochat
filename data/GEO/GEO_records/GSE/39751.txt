TITLE
Human Tissues: pancreatic cancer vs. pancreatic non-tumoral tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of pancreatic tumors comparing to adjacent non-tumoral pancreatic tissue by two strategies. The first strategy implies a traditional microarray assay, while the second involves a previous Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) and then the traditional microarray assay. Goal was to determine differences in gene expression profile in tumor samples by both strategies.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, tumoral vs. non-tumoral tissues. Biological replicates: 6 tumoral replicates, 6 non-tumoral replicates. The same replicates for both strategies.
