TITLE
Overexpression of MXRA7 in murine prostate cancer cell line RM1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine prostate cancer cells RM1 were transfected with a fakery murine MXRA7 cDNA in pcDNA3.1 vector. Controls were RM1 transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector. G418 resistant colonies were obtained, and gene expression profiling was performed using Agilent 4*44K array and dual labeling.

DESIGN
Three triplicates were included for RM1-VE (vechile vector transfected RM1 cell line) and RM1-MXRA7 (MARA7 transfected RM1 cell line) respectively, thus producing three pairs of samples for array, namely MXRA7/VE rep1, rep2 rep3.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
