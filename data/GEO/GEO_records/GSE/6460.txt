TITLE
Human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identity of cells that establish the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME) in human bone marrow (BM), and of skeletal ( " mesenchymal " ) stem cells (SSCs) found in BM stroma, have long remained elusive. We show that MCAM/CD146-expressing, subendothelial cells in human BM stroma are both the self-renewing SSCs and the cells that transfer the HME at heterotopic sites upon transplantation. Establishment and self-renewal of SSCs in developing BM in vivo occurs via specific, dynamic interactions with developing sinusoids. Non-differentiated SSCs residing on the sinusoidal wall, but not differentiated osteoblasts, express Angiopoietin-1 (a pivotal molecule of the HSC " niche " involved in vascular remodeling). Our data reveal the functional relationships between establishment of the HME in vivo, establishment of SSCs in BM sinusoids, and angiogenesis. Keywords: comparative genomics, genetic modification

DESIGN
The series is composed by 7 samples hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. 4 of these samples (A18, A22, A23 e A27) are different clones of mesenchymal stem cells, while the other 3 represent different treatments of one of these clones with specific growth factors.
