TITLE
Transcriptome alteration by ZIC5 knockdown in melanoma cell lines, A375 and SK-MEL-28.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the transcriptome alteration caused by ZIC5 knockdown in melanoma, we performed gene expression microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Human melanoma cell lines, A375 or SK-MEL-28, were transfected with siRNA for ZIC5 or negative control siRNA. After 48h,  total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed.
