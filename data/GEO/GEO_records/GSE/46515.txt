TITLE
Expression data from mouse model using targeted deletion of hepatic RICTOR (Albumin-Cre Rictor LoxP/LoxP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent work using mouse models has revealed that mTORC2, which unlike mTORC1 is not acutely sensitive to rapamycin, plays a key role in the regulation of organismal physiology. The substrates and pathways regulated by mTORC2 are at present relatively unknown Using a mouse model with a targeted deletion of hepatic RICTOR, we investigated the loss of mTORC2 on the murine liver transcriptome

DESIGN
Rictor floxed (RKO) and control mice (n=4 per group) were fasted overnight, refed for 3 hr, then sacrificed. Livers were removed, rinsed in PBS, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted and hybridized to  Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays
