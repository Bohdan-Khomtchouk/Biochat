TITLE
Effects of Ethanol Stress on Gene Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in acclimatization of yeast to non-lethal ethanol stress, S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A was grown separately at 0% and 6.5% (v/v) ethanol, and gene expression profiles were compared using microarray analysis.  A t-test with a p-value of 0.05 was applied for differences in gene expression across unstressed and stressed replicates of W303-1A.  There were 1049 genes with significant differences in expression.  Among the genes that passed the t-test, 46 genes were up-regulated 5-fold and more in ethanol stress and 149 by more than 3-fold.  There were 40 genes down-regulated by more than a factor of 5 and 161 by more than a factor of 3; the remaining genes that passed the t-test had expression level differences lower than 3-fold. GenowizTM bioanalysis results that identify GO categories comprising stress induced (more than 3-fold) genes show the two highest ethanol stress induced categories to be Retrotransposition Nucleocapsid (z-score of 15.69) and Transposition RNA Mediated (z-score of 15.54).  These categories were not reported in previous gene expression studies on ethanol stress (Alexandre et al. 2001, Chandler et al. 2004, Fujita et al. 2004, Hirasawa et al. 2007). Our further investigaition identifies lack of annotation and omission of the genes from the retrotransposition-associated categories in slide printing as possible causes of this inconsistency.

DESIGN
Two conditions: 0% and 6.5 % (v/v) ethanol added to the culture growth medium. One set of triplicates with one dye swap for each condition. Each triplicate was prepared from different biological replicate (i.e. different culture).
