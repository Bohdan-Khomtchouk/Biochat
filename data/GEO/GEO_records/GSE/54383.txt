TITLE
Identification of heavily translated mRNAs in PRR16/Largen-overexpressing cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in the present study was that PRR16/Largen influences mRNA translation to control mammalian cell size. Results provide important information of the effects of PRR16/Largen on translation of particular sets of mRNAs encoding histones, mitochondrial, and vascular transport proteins.

DESIGN
mRNAs obtained from heavy and light polysomes in PRR16/Largen-overexpressing cells subjected to the identification of mRNAs enriched in heavy polysomes compared to control cells.
