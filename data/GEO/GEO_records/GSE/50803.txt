TITLE
Expression of SUDHL-1 cell line treated by ALK inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we compared the effects of ALK inhibitor on the gene expression, activation of cell signaling pathways, and functional properties of cells derived from a patient with Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. we used microarrays to map the genome-wide gene expression patterns in ALK+TCL cells in response to ALK inhibition.

DESIGN
The ALK+TCL Sudhl-1 cell line was treated in triplicates with the ALK inhibitor, CEP-14083, or the compound's solvent for 6 h. The isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed, biotin-labeled, and hybridized to the U133 Plus 2.0 array chips (Affymetrix). Microarray data were normalized using the MAS5 algorithm and analyzed using Partek GS (Partek).
