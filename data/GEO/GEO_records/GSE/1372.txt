TITLE
Pig peri-implantation embryo development transcriptional profiling

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
A novel porcine cDNA microarray, containing PCR products selected for embryonic expression, was used for transcriptional profiling during conceptus development. Total RNA from quadruplicate samples of small spherical (1-5mm), large spherical (6-11mm), tubular (13-45mm), and filamentous ( > 100mm) was extracted, amplified, and converted to 32P labeled target and hybridized to membranes.  Porcine peri-implantation embryo development order is from small spherical to large spherical, then to Tubular, then to filamentous. All this morphological transmission is within two days (day 10 to day 12). In this study, we investigated the gene expression changes by a specifically selected porcine embryo gene array. A number of genes were found to be differentially expressed during those developmental stages and confirmed by quantitative PCR.
