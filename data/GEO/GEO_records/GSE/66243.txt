TITLE
Circadian rhythm in NIH3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of cyclical expressed coding and non-coding genes during the circadian rhythm in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were synchronized for their circadian rhythm and RNA sequencing were performed at several time points along the rhythm. This data was used to identify cyclical expressed genes as well as long intergenic non-coding RNAs.

DESIGN
NIH3T3 cells were synchronized with 100 nM Dexamethasone for 2 hours, then medium was changed to normal culture medium (0h). Every 4 hours cells were harvested, RNA isolated and RNAseq performed.

PLATFORM
