TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of H3K27Me3 in mouse rib chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChiP sequencing analysis for H3K27Me3 in DNA from mouse rib chondrocytes.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K27Me3 in mouse rib chondrocytes after overnight culture.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was performed using Cell Signaling Technology SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnentic Beads) #9005 Sequencing using Next Generation Sequencing (Otogenetics), mapping of reads using DNA Nexus mapper and region calling using Quest software (DNA Nexus)
