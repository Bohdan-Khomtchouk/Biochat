TITLE
Galectin-3 Deficiency Exacerbates Hyperglycemia and the Endothelial Response to Diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses were performed in order to determine the effect of galectin-3 ablation on the endothelial transcriptional response in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Galectin-3-deficient mice (KO) and wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) were fed a high-fat diet (60% fat calories) or standard chow for 8 weeks. CD105+/CD45- endothelial cells were isolated from the aortae and skeletal muscles of these mice by FACS. Whole genome microarray expression profiling revealed greater transcriptional dysregulation in the endothelium of the KO after high-fat feeding compared to WT. Transcripts dysregulated in the KO endothelium after HFD include those involved in glucose uptake and insulin signaling, oxidative stress, vasoregulation, coagulation, and atherogenesis. Real-time PCR confirmed transcriptional downregulation of the glucose transporter, Glut4, and immunofluorescence staining confirmed reduced GLUT4 protein in the endothelium and mudcle of the KO compared to WT. The transcriptional and histological data was consistent with physiological studies showing exacerbated hyperglycemia and coagulation in the KO. These results suggest that galectin-3 serves a protective role against metabolic dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.

DESIGN
Galectin-3-deficient mice (KO) and wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) were fed either a high-fat diet (60% fat calories) or standard chow diet (12% fat calories) for 8 weeks. Three independent experiments were performed.  For each experiment, the aorta and skeletal muscle from 3-4 animals per diet/genotype group were excised and pooled for each tissue. Live, CD105+/CD45- endothelial cells  were isolated from the aortic and muscle suspensions by FACS.
