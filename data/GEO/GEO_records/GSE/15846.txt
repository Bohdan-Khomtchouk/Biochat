TITLE
GBM cell lines derived and propagated according to Cambridge protocol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We screened the gene expression in GBM cell lines cultured under serum-free conditions. We have special interest in genes associated with glial development such as NG2, Olig2 and PDGFRa. This microarray data gave us an idea about the expression of these genes and made the basis for further investigation.

DESIGN
Seven GBM cells were derived from 7 different patients under serum-free conditions according to Cambridge protocol as previously described (Fael Al-Mayhani et al, 2009). The RNA was extracted and its quality was assessed. The samples were sent for microarray screening using Illumina platform. The gene was considered as present when the detection value was greater than 0.99.

PLATFORM
