TITLE
Expression data from innate and conventional CD8+ T cell populations from naïve CXCR3-GFP Reporter mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Innate CD8+ T cells are a heterogeneous population with developmental pathways distinct from conventional CD8+ T cells. Their biology, classification and functions remain incompletely understood. We recently demonstrated the existence of distinct populations of innate CD8+ T cells based on CXCR3 expression. We characterized these subsets through gene expression profiling and identified effector molecules and pathways which mediate their function.

DESIGN
CXCR3+ innate CD8+, CXCR3- innate CD8+  and naïve CD8+ T cell populations were sorted from 3 to 5 CXCR3-GFP Reporter mice. RNA was prepared from these cell populations, the quantity, quality and integrity were confirmed by Nanodrop and Agilent Bioanalyzer before inclusion in the array.
