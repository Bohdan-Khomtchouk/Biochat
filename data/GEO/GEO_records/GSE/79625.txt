TITLE
Overexpression of LMO2 causes aberrant human T-cell development in vivo by three potentially distinct cellular mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LMO2 overexpressing transgenic mouse models suggest an accumulation of immature T-cell progenitors in the thymus as main pre-leukemic event. The effects of LMO2 overexpression on human T-cell development in vivo, however, are unknown. Here we report studies of a humanized mouse model transplanted with LMO2 transduced human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The effects of LMO2 overexpression were confined to the T-cell lineage although initially multipotent cells were transduced. Three  effects of LMO2 on human T-cell development were observed: 1) a block at the DN/ISP stage, 2) an accumulation of CD4+CD8+ double positive CD3- cells and 3) an altered CD8/CD4 ratio with enhanced peripheral T lymphocytes

DESIGN
Single stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1000 pg total RNA using the Ovation Pico WTA System V2 Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc, Leek, The Netherlands) in combination with the Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Biotin labeling and fragmentation was performed and fragmented cDNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix Gene Atlas human U219 arrays.
