TITLE
Expression profiling of Grosmannia clavigera (Gc) under various conditions

ORGANISM
Grosmannia clavigera

SUMMARY
Gc, a Mountain pine beetle associated pathogen, can survive from highly abundant pine chemicals ( e.g terpenes) and use some unflavored compoundâ€™s as carbon source.  using RNA_Seq, we analyzed the transcriptome of Gc when it grew on limonene, mannose  oliver-oil, oleic acid as carbon source, as well as when it survived from high concentration of limonene or heptane. We profiled the expression of some interesting genes ( ABC transporters, P450s)  potentially involved in the tree-pathogen interaction.  An ABC-G group transporter gene (GcABC-G1) was one of the most highly induced genes and characterized as a mono-terpene specific efflux transporter with genetic and molecular tools. RNA- seq also indicated Gc utilize limonene and oleic acid through the same beta-oxidation  pathway. However the degradation of limonene is more complex and multiple pathways contributed to the survival/utilization.

DESIGN
mRNA was extracted from Gc mycelium under various conditions and cDNA libraries were generated for pair-end sequencing. The 70-100bp illumina sequence read was mapping to reference genome and RNA-Seq was carried out in CLC genomic work bench.
