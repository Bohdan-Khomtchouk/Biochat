TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of gemcitabine on human CCC cells in vitro.  And various miRNAs induced by gemcitabine may contribute to tumor regression in vitro.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 2555 human miRNA probes in the cell lines in vitro that were treated with and without gemcitabine.
