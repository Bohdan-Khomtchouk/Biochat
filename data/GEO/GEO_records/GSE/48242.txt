TITLE
The SWI/SNF Complex Regulates the PRDM Protein Hamlet to Ensure Lineage Directionality in Drosophila Neural Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. SWI/SNF complex controls self-renewal and differentiation in stem cell lineages but how this function relates to tumorigenesis is currently unclear. Here, we use Drosophila neuroblasts to demonstrate that the SWI/SNF component Osa (ARID1) prevents tumorigenesis in stem cell lineages by ensuring correct unidirectional lineage progression. Our transcriptome anaysis identifies Ham as a key Osa target gene.

DESIGN
comparison of transcriptomes of wild type Drosophila melanogaster larval type II NB lineages (excluding neurons) and osa RNAi type II lineages containing mainly NB-like cells and INPs
