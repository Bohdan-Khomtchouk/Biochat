TITLE
Expression data of human hypopharyngeal tumor cells (FaDu)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FaDu cells were infected with lentivirus containing sh-luciferase plasmid to compared with cells infected with sh-G9a containing lentivirus. We performed microarray analysis to identify the genes possibly regulated by G9a in FaDu cells

DESIGN
In our study, we found that G9a positively directs the growth adventage of HNSCC cells. Inhibition of G9a induced autophagic cell death. To further indentify the downstream  mechanism, we perform affymetrix microarray to identify the downstream target of G9a in negatively regulation of autophagy.
