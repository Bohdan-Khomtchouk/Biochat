TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Rok-myc and Hbs-myc in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The Rok protein of Bacillus subtilis was identified as a negative regulator of competence development. Here we show that Rok binds to extended areas of the B. subtilis genome that are characterized by a high A+T content and are known or believed to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer, e.g. mobile elements. A deletion of rok results in higher excision of one such element, ICEBs1. The preferential association of Rok with DNA with a high A+T content is also observed in a Gram-negative host, E. coli, and depends on a conserved C-terminal region of the protein. Based on our findings, we propose that Rok is a nucleoid-associated protein that fulfills a function analogous to H-NS, a protein absent from most Gram-positive bacteria.
