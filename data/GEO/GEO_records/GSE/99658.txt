TITLE
Viable RNaseH1 knockout mice show RNaseH1 is essential for R loop processing, mitochondrial and liver function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNAseq we describe transcriptional changes downstream of liver-specific knockout of RNaseH1, including effects on mitochondrial function, fibrosis and cell cycle

DESIGN
We perform RNAseq on mouse livers under conditions of constitutive or inducible knockout of RNaseH1

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
