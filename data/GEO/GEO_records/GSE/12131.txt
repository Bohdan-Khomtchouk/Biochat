TITLE
Transcriptome of Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT)-intoxicated HUVECs monolayers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the variation of transcriptome of HUVECs intoxicated by the lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis at 4 and 8 hours

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions with two biological replicates for the control condition corresponding to untreated HUVEC monolayer. RNA were extracted before labeling and hybridizations on Human U133A Plus 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip

PLATFORM
