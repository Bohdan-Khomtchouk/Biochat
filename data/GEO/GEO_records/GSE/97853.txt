TITLE
DNA methylation profile of model breast cancer cell lines PMC42-ET and PMC42-LA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the reverse process mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is a fundamental biological process that governs embryonic development and patterning. This exquisitely-controlled phenotypic switch between two very different cellular phenotypes is commandeered in a wide range of cancers, and is considered by many to be the initiating molecular event that drives carcinoma metastasis. Because the majority of cancer-related deaths are due to metastatic spread and secondary tumour formation, elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing EMT and MET in metastasis may hold great promise for clinical benefits. Research efforts over the last 20 (?) years have focussed predominantly on identifying individual molecules and cellular signalling cascades that drive EMT/MET. Recently developed high-throughput screening approaches have enabled rapid and comprehensive genome-wide interrogation of the genetic and epigenetic changes associated with cancer to be studied. In this study we have employed Infinium 450K methyl-bead arrays to examine the DNA methylation signatures of a unique pair of isogenic human breast cancer cell lines: The mesenchymal PMC42-ET line and an epithelial-like subline PMC42-LA.

DESIGN
Two cell lines, PMC42-ET and PMC42-LA analysed in duplicate for DNA methylation with EGF treatment or, without (control).
