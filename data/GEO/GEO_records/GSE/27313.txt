TITLE
Expression data from human mesenchymal stem cells treated with Wnt3a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling is upregulated frequently in several cancers, including sarcomas.  Since, there is cell-context dependent variation in the target gene expression, to identify canonical Wnt targets in sarcomas, we used human mesenchymal stem cells.

DESIGN
Human mesenchymal stem cells were treated with 100ng/ml recombinant Wnt3a either 6 hrs or 24 hrs.  Total RNA was extracted from untreated and Wnt3a treated samples using Qiagen's RNA extraction kit.
