TITLE
Microarray Expression Analysis of Circular RNAs in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the expression profile of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) and to provide more reliable biomarkers and new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PDAC. The circRNA expression levels were measured in 20 paracancerous tissues and 20 PDAC tissues using Arraystar Human CircRNA Array Analysis. We identified significantly different expression of circRNAs between the two groups and showed distinguishable circRNAs expression patterns in the samples. The levels and patterns of circRNA expression were significantly different between paracancerous tissue and PDAC tissue. This study evaluated circRNAs expression profiles and their ability to serve as reliable biomarkers and new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PDAC.

DESIGN
Twenty fresh-frozen PDAC samples and twenty paracancerous tissues were collected, and total RNA was extracted. Subsequently, RNA was labeled and hybridized. Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using the R software package.
