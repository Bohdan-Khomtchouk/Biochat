TITLE
To study the molecular mechanism of DNA minor groove binding ligand as a radiaiton modulator

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radiation induced DNA damage initiates a complex series of overlapping responses responsible for the maintenance of genome integrity. The data reports the expression analysis in response to DNA minor groove binding ligand with an emphasis on its ability to afford better protection in cells exposed to ionizing radiation.

DESIGN
Four different types if samples were employed in analysis- Control i.e. untreated cells, 50µM ligand treated cells, 2Gy radiation treated cells, cells treated with 50µM ligand one hour prior to 2 Gy irradiation.

PLATFORM
GPL9355 Ocichip Human 40 K Set (chip A) GPL9356 Ocichip Human 40 K Set (chip B)
