TITLE
YG001: A Usp7-Tip60 pathway regulates early adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
USP7, a dominant DUB activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in mouse adipose tissue, increases Tip60 protein levels, and deubiquitinates Tip60 both in intact cells and in vitro. Treatment with a pan deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor, or knockdown of USP7, decreases adipogenesis. Transcriptome analysis reveals a common set of cell cycle genes to be co-regulated by both Tip60 and USP7. Knock down of either factor results in impaired mitotic clonal expansion, an early step in adipogenesis. These results therefore reveal deubiquitination of a transcriptional coregulator to be a key mechanism in the regulation of early adipogenesis

DESIGN
Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to RNAi-mediated knock down with control(C), USP7(U)- or Tip60(T)-specific oligonucleotides. For this, 4 replicates of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with Amaxa technology. Two days after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS twice and lysed in 0.5ml Trizol (Invitrogen). mRNA expression of Tip60 and USP7 was assessed by qRT-PCR. Amplified cRNA samples were labeled with either cy3 or cy5 and put on microarray together with and oppositely labeled common reference sample consisting of cRNA derived from undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells.
