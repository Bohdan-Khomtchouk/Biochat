TITLE
ChIP-chip from Kc cells with Su(H) antibodies after 30 minutes Notch activation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
During hematopoiesis, Notch regulates both the emergence of stem and progenitor cells and the subsequent cell fate choices and differentiation. To investigate how Notch drives cells to differentiate we have used a genome-wide approach to identify direct Notch targets in Drosophila Kc cells. These data are the results from Su(H) ChIP-Chip experiments to identify genomic regions occupied by Su(H) after Notch activation in Kc cells.

DESIGN
3 replicates of Su(H) ChIP after 30 min. Notch activation..
