TITLE
Gene expression in lungs from male HIV transgenic rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
HIV Tg rats exhibit pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary artery remodeling.  In an effort to begin to understand cell signaling pathways which are altered in lungs from HIV transgenic rats, we used microarray analysis.

DESIGN
n=3 samples of lung tissue from 3 month old male HIV transgenic rat and n=3 samples of lung tissue from 3 month oldmale F344 (control) rat

PLATFORM
