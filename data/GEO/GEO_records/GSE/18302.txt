Deep sequencing of small RNAs in the trasngenic wild type plant and the IWR1-type transcription factor mutant, dms4

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Full title: Deep sequencing of small RNAs in the trasngenic wild type plant (contains trigger and silencer transgenes) and the IWR1-type transcription factor mutant, dms4 RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants requires two RNA polymerase II (PolII)-related RNA polymerases named PolIV and PolV. A genetic screen designed to reveal factors important for RdDM in a developmental context in Arabidopsis identified DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING 4 (DMS4). Unlike other mutants defective in RdDM, dms4 mutants have a pleiotropic developmental phenotype.DMS4 is similar to yeast IWR1, a conserved putative transcription factor that interacts with PolII subunits. In the transgenic system studied, mutations in DMS4 directly or indirectly affect PolIV-dependent secondary siRNAs, PolV-mediated RdDM, PolV-dependent synthesis of intergenic noncoding RNA, and expression of many PolII-driven genes. These data suggest that DMS4 may be a regulatory factor for multiple RNA polymerases, thus explaining its diverse roles in the plant.

DESIGN
Examination of siRNA abundance in the trasngenic wild type plant (contains trigger and silencer transgenes) and the dms4 mutant.
