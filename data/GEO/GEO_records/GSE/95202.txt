TITLE
Ethanol enhances high-salinity stress tolerance by detoxification of reactive oxygen species in Arabidopsis and rice

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To analyze the molecular function of ethanol in salt stress responses in Arabidopsis, we conducted microarray analysis using 4-day-old plants, which were treated with 0.3 % ethanol or water for 24 h, and then treated with or without 100 mM NaCl for 2 h

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted using ethanol-treated and non-treated plants subjected to non-stress and salt-stress condition for 2 h.
