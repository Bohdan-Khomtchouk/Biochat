TITLE
Developing a gene expression model for predicting ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients: a pilot study.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: Identify genes that are differentially expressed between critically ill trauma patients who go on to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) compared to similar patients who do not develop VAP Using gene expression differences, develop a model that predicts which patients are at greater risk of developing VAP.

DESIGN
Prospective observational study, analysis of gene expression in 20 patient samples, 10 that developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, 10 that did not

PLATFORM
GPL201 [HG-Focus] Affymetrix Human HG-Focus Target Array
