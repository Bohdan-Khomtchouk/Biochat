TITLE
Genome wide mapping of PSF binding sites in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified androgen-regulated long non-coding RNA, CTBP1-AS, located in the antisese region of CTBP1 gene. CTBP1-AS activate AR signaling by epigenetically repress AR-associated cofactors such as CTBP1 by interactign with RNA-binding protein PSF and recruiting HDAC complex to the target promoters. In order investigated the PSF target genes, we performed ChIP-seq analysis of PSF binding sites in prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP cells. We identified androgen dependent PSF binding regions in prostate cancer cell genome. We observed PSF bindings around the promoters of androgen repressed genes such as CTBP1, p53 and SMAD3.
