TITLE
C57BL6/J livers exposed to low fat and high fat diet, wild-type vs Cyp1b1 null

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigating the transcriptional changes in mouse livers exposed to low and high fat diets for 11 weeks. Determine what gene changes in the Cyp1b1 null livers may be contributing to prevention of increased adiposity when givin a high fat diet.

DESIGN
Three Comparison experiment. Comparing wild-type low fat vs Cyp1b1 null low fat, wild-type high fat vs Cyp1b1 null high fat and low fat vs high in wild-type mice. Sample size is 3 per group. Limma analysis data provided in Series supplementary file (Normalized log2 ratio of (Cy3/Cy5) representing test group/control group).

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
