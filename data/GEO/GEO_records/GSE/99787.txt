TITLE
Global mRNA translational landscapes in mouse bone-marrow-derived-macrophage-mediated response to LPS (lipopolysaccharide)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ribosome profiling and RNA-seq on mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with 100ng/ml LPS for 0hr, 1hr, 2hrs, 4hrs, 6hrs to obtain global mRNA translational landscapes during this inflammatory response.

DESIGN
Examine transcriptomic and translatomic dynamics in mouse BMDMs' response to LPS treatment. Ribo-seq, RNA-Seq, CLIP-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
