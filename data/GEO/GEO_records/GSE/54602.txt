TITLE
Developmental transcriptome analysis of human erythropoiesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the dynamic, comprehensive transcriptome during human erythroid differentiation in vitro. The erythroid cells at day 4, 8, 11 and 14 differentiation stages were harvested and sequenced by Illumia 72 bp paired-end sequencing format, respectively.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of erythroid cells on differentiation days 4, 8, 11 and 14 and performed mRNA-seq on two biological replicates at each stage.
