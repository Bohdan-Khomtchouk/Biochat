ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for H3K4me3 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM385397..GSM385405]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM386032..GSM386040]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM386088..GSM386096]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM386097..GSM386105]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM386106..GSM386114]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM386115..GSM386123]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila L1 larvae [GSM386125..GSM386133]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila L2 larvae [GSM386996..GSM387004]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Adult Male [GSM418254..GSM418262]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM442287..GSM442292]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Pupae [GSM442293..GSM442301]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Adult Female [GSM442302..GSM442310]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me3 in Drosophila L3 larvae For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
