TITLE
Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana PRR7 regulated clock components and circadian outputs through genome-wide binding sites analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide PRR7 targets by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Lines include prr7-3 and prr7-3 PRR7::HA-PRR7 #151, and we conducted immunoprecipitations using an anti-HA antibody.

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
