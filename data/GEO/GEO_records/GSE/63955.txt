TITLE
Expression data from OMD- or PRELP-knockdown 5637 cells, and OMD- or PRELP-overexpression T-REx 293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We knockdowned OMD and PRELP expression by specific siRNAs in 5637 bladder carcinoma cells and conducted expression profile analysis. We also overexpressed OMD and PRELP in T-REx 293 cells and conducted expression profile analysis.

DESIGN
Specific siRNAs targeting OMD and PRELP or control siRNAs (siEGFP and siFFLuc) were transfected into 5637 cells, total RNA was extracted 24 h after transfection. We also extracted total RNA from control T-Rex 293 cells, CAT-overexpressing T-REx cells, OMD-overexpressing T-REx and PRELP-overexpressing T-REx 293 cells.
