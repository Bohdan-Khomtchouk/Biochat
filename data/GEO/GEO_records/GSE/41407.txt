TITLE
Co-expression of genes with ERG in prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG overexpression is the most frequent molecular alteration in prostate cancer. We analyzed different stages of prostate cancer to identify genes that were coexpressed with ERG overexpression. In primary prostate tumors, it was shown that TDRD1 expression was the strongest correlated gene with ERG overexpression and we suggest TDRD1 as a direct ERG target gene.

DESIGN
6 Prostate cancer cell lines and 11 prostate cancer xenografts are included in this study. Each sample was analyzed once.
