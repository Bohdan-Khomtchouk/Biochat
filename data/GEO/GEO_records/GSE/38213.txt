TITLE
Identification and comparative analysis of microRNAs associated with low-N tolerance in rice genotypes

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Micro-RNA associated with low-N tolerance have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes on the basis of differential expression of miRNA in low-N tolerant and low-N sensitive genotypes of rice. Since, miRNAs emerged as key players in plant responses and adaptation to stress, identification of low-N responsive miRNAs and their targets could help to uncover the molecular mechanisms of N-deficiency tolerance in plants. We used affymetrix based GeneChip miRNA_2.0 Array to detail the global programme of miRNA expression variation in low-N tolerant (IC-547557) and low -N sensitive (Vivek Dhan).
