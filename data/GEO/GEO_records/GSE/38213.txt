TITLE
Identification and comparative analysis of microRNAs associated with low-N tolerance in rice genotypes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Micro-RNA associated with low-N tolerance have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes on the basis of differential expression of miRNA in low-N tolerant and low-N sensitive genotypes of rice. Since, miRNAs emerged as key players in plant responses and adaptation to stress, identification of low-N responsive miRNAs and their targets could help to uncover the molecular mechanisms of N-deficiency tolerance in plants. We used affymetrix based GeneChip miRNA_2.0 Array to detail the global programme of miRNA expression variation in low-N tolerant (IC-547557) and low -N sensitive (Vivek Dhan).

DESIGN
Low-N tolerant and low-N sensitive rice genotypes were grown using the nutrient medium containing  2 mM K2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.3 mM NaH2PO4, 40 µM Fe-EDTA, 9 µM MnCl2, 25 µM Na2MoO4, 20 µM H3BO3, 1.5 µM ZnSO4, and 1.5 µM CuSO4. The nitrogen in the form of NH4NO3 was maintained as 0.01 mM (low-N condition). The pH of the nutrient solutions was adjusted to 6.0 and the solutions were changed every three days.  Twenty-day-old plants were sampled for expression studies of miRNA.
