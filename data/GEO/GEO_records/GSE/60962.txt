TITLE
Alteration of mRNA and microRNA expression profiles in rat muscular type vasculature in early postnatal development [miRNA]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
This study tested the hypothesis that miRNA expression profiles change in the muscular type rat saphenous artery during early postnatal development. To explore this, we performed miRNA microarray analysis on muscular type saphenous arteries of young (10-12 days) and adult (2-3 months) rats.
