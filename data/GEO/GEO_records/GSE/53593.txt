TITLE
Infinium Monkeys: Infinium 450K array for the Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) RRBS-seq

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Infinium 450K is a hybridization array designed for the human genome, but the relative conservation between the macaque and human genomes makes its use in macaques feasible. We used the Infinium450K array to assay twelve Cynomolgus macaque muscle biopsies and compared it to Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) data generated on the same samples.

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies were performed on eleven adult male cynomologus macaques

PLATFORM
