TITLE
Effect of chronic MDPV on striatal gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The bath salt constituent 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is often detected in blood of patient’s presenting at emergency rooms with a psychosis-like syndrome involving agitation, panic, confusion/cognitive impairment, violent behavior, depression, and other adverse behavioral symptoms. The mechanisms underlying MDPV’s behavioral disturbances and its effect on brain gene expression patterns, particularly effects of chronic use on genetic changes in striatum and cortex are unknown. Such changes in gene expression are expected to reflect altered changes in brain function and structure as a consequence of MDPV abuse. A major objective of these experiments is to determine the relationship between repeated MDPV exposure and genes encoding dopaminergic, vascular, central inflammatory markers (e.g., IL6, IL10, IL1β, IFNγ, TNFα), particularly in prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and amygdala.

DESIGN
3 treatment groups: saline, single MDPV/acute, repeated MDPV/chronic (n = 6 per group)
