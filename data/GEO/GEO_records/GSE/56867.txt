TITLE
Functional analysis of KAI1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from mouse EML cell line under Kai1 knockdown or Kai1 overexpressing condition. KAI1 belongs to tetraspanin superfamily and is known as suppressor of tumor metastasis.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in wildtype (WT) and KAI1 knockdown EML cells were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina GAIIx. Examination of mRNA levels in wildtype (WT) and KAI1 overexpressing EML cells were also generated in single set.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
