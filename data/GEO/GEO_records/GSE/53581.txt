TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of fetal liver cells of R26-LSL-KITD816V:Vav-iCre mice related to controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression. The influence of a constitutively activated mutant Kit receptor on gene expression in fetal hematopoietic cells was analyzed. Results provide information of genes and cellular processes that are influenced by Kit signaling.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from embryonic day E13.5 fetal liver of double transgenic R26-LSL-KITD816V:Vav-iCre mice compared to single transgenic controls. R26-LSL-KITD816V mice have been registered with the mouse genome database (MGI:5516508, allele named Gt(ROSA)26sorTM1(GFP-cKIT*)Hsc). Vav-iCre mice have been described by De Boer et al. in 2003.
