TITLE
Conversion of Fibroblasts into  Functional Trophoblast Stem-like Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we demonstrate the generation of stable induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs) from fibroblasts by the transient expression of Gata3, Eomes and Tfap2c.  Transcriptome and methylome analyses and functional assays such as hemorrhagic lesion formation and placenta contribution suggested a high degree of conversion. Careful examination of the reprogramming process indicated that the cells did not go through a transient pluripotent state.

DESIGN
Detect and compare different H2A.X deposition patterns in ES cells,MEFs and iTSC and TS cells, with Illumina HiSeq 2000
