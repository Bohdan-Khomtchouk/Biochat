TITLE
RelA Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) Subunit binding Loci in Promoter Regions of PHM1-31 Myometrial Smooth Muscle Cells (Promoter)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A study to define the binding loci of RelA-containing NF-kappaB dimers in a human myometrial smooth muscle cell line after exposure to TNF.

DESIGN
Monolayers of PHM1-31 cells were exposed to TNF (10ng/ml) for 1 hour or left unstimulated. The Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to recover RelA-bound chromatin or non-specifically bound chromatin with IgG. That chromatin was prepared and used to probe Affymetrix GeneChIP 1.0R  Human Promoter arrays. Three biological replicates of each experiment were conducted. Datasets were subsequently analysed in Partek Genomics Suite V6.6 where baseline was normalised by subtraction of IgG values from conrresponding RelA-immunoprecipitated samples. Control samples immunoprecipitated with RelA were then compared with TNF-stimulated samples immunoprecipitated with RelA.
