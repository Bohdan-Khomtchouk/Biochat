TITLE
Comparison of MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ MEFs response after infection with Rift Valley Fever virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne disease present in several countries of Africa and Middle East. It is caused by RVF virus which can infect both humans and animals. In humans, it leads to various manifestations including hepatitis, encephalitis and death, while in domestic animals it usually causes miscarriage in pregnant females and it is often fatal for the newborn. Not all people or animal infected by the virus present the same disease. Some patients exhibit unapparent or moderate febrile reactions, while others develop severe symptoms. This observation suggests that host genetic factors play a role in controlling the outcome of infection. In this work, we compare the response of two different inbred strains of mice, MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ, to infection with RVF virus. These strains exhibit different profiles of susceptibility to RVF virus infection. Indeed, MBT/Pas mice rapidly develop high viraemia and die soon after infection, while BALB/cByJ mice have a lower viraemia and die later. Interestingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from MBT/Pas foetuses allows higher viral production than BALB/cByJ MEFs. Keywords: expression profiling

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to include ARN samples from MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ MEFs infected with the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus, and their respective mock-infected controls; each one of those in triplicate. Therefore, we have used 12 different samples for the study, divided as follows: 3 samples of RVF virus-infected BALB/cByJ MEFs, 3 samples of mock-infected BALB/cByJ MEFs, 3 samples of RVF virus-infected MBT/Pas MEFs and 3 samples of mock-infected MBT/Pas MEFs. Each RNA was extracted from a different culture well.
