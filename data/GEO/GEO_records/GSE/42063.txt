TITLE
Expression data from neutrophils from wild-type and Jdp2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Jdp2 is a member of the AP-1 family and suppresses histone acetyltransferase activity. We used microarrays to examine the gene expression pattern of neutrophil form Jdp2-/- mice.

DESIGN
Bone marrow CD11b+Ly6Clo Ly6G+ neutrophils form wild-type and Jdp2-/-mice were sorted by FACS, followed by RNA extraction. Affymetrix microarrays were used to analyze the mRNA expression.
