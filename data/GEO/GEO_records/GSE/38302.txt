TITLE
Analysis of gene expression change by gefitinib treatment in gefitinib sensitive PC9 and resistant PC9.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established a gefitinib-resistant cell line (PC-9GR), by serial exposure of gefitinib to PC-9, an originally gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line (PC-9na), for long period.We collected total RNA from both PC-9 and PC-9GR and examined mRNA expression profile, comprehensively.

DESIGN
Gefitinib induced gene expression was measured in human lung cancer cell line was measured at 48 hours after exposure to 1uM Gefitinib.
