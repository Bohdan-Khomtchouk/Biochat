TITLE
Global analysis of off-target genes by GAPDH siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A GAPDH siRNA was overexpressed in HeLa cells and microarray expression profiling was performed to experimentally identify the off-targets of this siRNA at the transcriptome level. Among all predicted siRNA off-targets by MirTarget2, the majority were downregulated by at least 10% (i.e. less than 90% remaining gene expression). Moreover, more than one fifth were downregulated by at least 30%. The gene knockdown data is consistent with previous observations that siRNA off-targets are generally silenced at a more moderate level as compared to silencing of the single intended target

DESIGN
GAPDH siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells, and the unintended off-targets was identified by microarrays 24 hours post transfection.
