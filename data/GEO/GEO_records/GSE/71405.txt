TITLE
Analysis of transcriptomes during cardioac reprogramming by RNA-deep Sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells by overexpressing transcription factors, GATA4, Hand2, Mef2C and Tbx5 (GHMT). A83-01, an inhibitor of ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7 and two microRNA, miR-1 and miR-133 increase the efficiency of cardiac reprogramming. RNA_Seq was performed to anyalyze effects of these factors on gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were prepared from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs); Reprogramming fibroblasts including MEFs transduced with retroviruses encoding GHMT, MEFs transduced with with retroviruses encoding GHMT plus miR-1 and miR-133 (GHMT2m), MEFs transduced with with retroviruses encoding GHMT2m treated with A83-01, at day 7 after viral transduction; and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCMs).
