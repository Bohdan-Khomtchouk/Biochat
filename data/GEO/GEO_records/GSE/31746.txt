TITLE
BJAB Cell Lines Transduced with lentiviral vector pNL-SIN-CMV-AcGFP expressing KSHV miRNAs miR-K1, miR-K12-11, or miR-K4-3p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BJAB cells were infected with pNL-SIN-CMV-AcGFP (see accession number GSE8867 for data) or pNL-SIN-CMV-AcGFP expressing KSHV miR-K1, miR-K12-11 or miR-K4-3p and sorted 48 hours after infection. 12 or 16 days after transduction, cytoplasmic RNA was harvested and gene expression analysis of independent BJAB cell pools was performed using Human Operon v3.0.2 arrays. Each sample was run against Universal Human Reference RNA, Stratagene. The samples listed here were processed in parallel to those with accession number GSE8867, which includes all matched control cell lines.

DESIGN
6 independent B cell pools each expressing KSHV miR-K1, miRK12-11, or miR-K4-3p are included. Matched controls include unmodified BJAB (3 arrays) and cells transducted with parental vector pNL-SIN-CMV-AcGFP (6 replicates).
