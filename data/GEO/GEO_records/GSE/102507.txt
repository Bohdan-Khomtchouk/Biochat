TITLE
Gene expression prpfoling of the pathogen, Nautella italica R11, in response to its macroalagl host

ORGANISM
Nautella italica

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis of bacterial cultures of Nautella italica R11, Wild type strain and a RaiR gene disruption strain in the presence and absence of the red macroalga Delisea pulchra

DESIGN
mRNA sequencing of bacterial cultures collected after exposure to D. pulchra. 3 independent replicates of the WT bacterial strain and 3 independent replicates of RaiR gene disruption mutant bacterial strain were assessed along with triplicate replicates of cultures of each strain which were not exposed that were used as controls

PLATFORM
GPL23896 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Nautella italica)
