TITLE
Comparison of the oxacillin stress response in vraS and vraT mutants

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300

SUMMARY
To determine the role of the second gene in the vra operon (vraT) in the stress response to oxacillin, we compared the oxacillin induction profiles in a vraT deletion strain to that of a vraSR mutant in a USA300 MRSA strain background.

DESIGN
Nonpolar deletion of vraT and insertional inactivation of vraS was constructed in MRSA strain USA300.
