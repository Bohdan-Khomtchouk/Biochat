TITLE
Translatome of developing drosophila t4/t5 neurons in wildtype versus atonal loss of function genotypes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Atonal is a proneural transcription factor expressed in the Drosophila neuroblast cluster known as the inner proliferation center (IPC). The t4/t5 neurons that derived from the IPC require atonal for their normal development. To characterize the role of Atonal in t4/t5 development we have sequenced the translated RNA in t4/t5 neurons in wild type and ato loss of function flies.

DESIGN
To sequence the translated RNA in wild type and ato loss of function t4/t5 neurons we have collected brains from transgenic larvae that in t4/t5 neurons express the ribosomal protein Rbp10Ab tagged with GFP. A 10% of the brain homogenates was used as input, the rest was immunuprecipated with anti-GFP antibodies to isolate t4/t5 ribosomes. The RNA bound to the ribosomes was later purified sonicated and sequenced.
