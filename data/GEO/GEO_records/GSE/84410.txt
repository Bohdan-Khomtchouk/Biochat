TITLE
The KDM5 family is required for activation of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes during adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we have characterized the role of KDM5 family during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Notably, our study represents the first to simultaneously knock down all the KDM5 family members thereby avoiding interference from redundancy between KDM5 subtypes. Using a combination of knockdown and genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses we uncover the underlying mechanisms of the inhibition of adipogenesis as well as basic aspects of KDM5 function.

DESIGN
Genome-wide profiling of KDM5A binding in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiating adipocytes, and profiling of H3K4me3 and gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells depleted for KDM5 family members
