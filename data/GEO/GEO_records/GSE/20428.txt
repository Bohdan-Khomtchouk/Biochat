TITLE
TIF1g and cdc73 ChIP-chip data from K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed small-scale ChIP-chip (chrom 3,21, 22, X and Y) to reveal target locus of TIF1g and cdc73.

DESIGN
DNA fragments pulled down by chromatin immunoprecipitation, amplified and hybridization on Affymetrix tiling arrays.
