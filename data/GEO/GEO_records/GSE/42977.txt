TITLE
Sequential Binary Gene-Ratio Tests Define a Novel Molecular Diagnostic Strategy for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene-expression ratio  technique was used to design a molecular signature to diagnose MPM from among other potentially confounding diagnoses and differentiate the epithelioid from the sarcomatoid histological subtype of MPM.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on 113 specimens including MPMs and a spectrum of tumors and benign tissues comprising the differential diagnosis of MPM.  A sequential combination of binary gene-expression ratio tests was developed to discriminate MPM from other thoracic malignancies .  This method was compared to other bioinformatic tools and this signature was validated  in an independent set of 170 samples.  Functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed probes.
