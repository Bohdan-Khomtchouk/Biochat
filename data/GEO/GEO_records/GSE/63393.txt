TITLE
Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) of cKIT+ sorted cells from 57-137 day old fetal testes and ovaries.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed WGBS analyses on 6 human fetal samples at 53-137 days of development, 4 female and 2 male. We show that methylation reprogramming in the human germline is global yet incomplete with exons, 3â€™UTRs and human-specific transposons remaining methylated.

DESIGN
Whole Genome Bisulfite-Seq of cKIT+ cells analyzed from 4 biological samples for fetal ovaries from 57-113 days of development and 2 samples for fetal testes at 59 and 137 days of development.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
