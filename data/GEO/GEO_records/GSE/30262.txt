TITLE
Suppression of microRNA-125b in response to IPNV infection which lead to TNFα-mediated apoptosis of viral pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is an aquatic virus that causes acute infection in freshwater and marine fish. The stage-specific expression of TNFα regulates Bad/Bid-mediated apoptosis and RIP1/ROS-mediated secondary necrosis in IPNV-infected fish cells.  Using microRNA microarray and real-time quantitative PCR assays, the expression patterns of microRNA were characterized in different replication stages of IPNV or stimulation of LPS.
