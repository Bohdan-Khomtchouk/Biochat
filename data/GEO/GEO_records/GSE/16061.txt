TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of Col-0, se-1, ago1-27 and se-1 35S::MIR156 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of wild type plants and plants with reduced (ago1-27 and se-1) or increased miR156 levels (se-1 p35S:MIR156). Shoot apices were dissected from 20-day-old, short-day grown plants.

DESIGN
Plants are grown in short day for 20 days. Total RNAs from shoot apex are extracted by RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). The probes are labeled with MessageAmp-Biotin Enhanced, single round aRNA amplification kit from Ambion and hybridized to Affy ATH1 array. Each genotype has two replicates.
