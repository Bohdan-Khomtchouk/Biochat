ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to assess the impact of oocyte competence on subsequent fertility. Based on knowledge already accessible in mammals and on bioinformatics tools including the chicken genome sequence, we focused on the expression of genes involved in the processes of fertilization and of early embryo development. A differential kinetic study is performed on INRA lines selected on the basis of their fertility potential in purpose of hopefully access gene markers of fertility performance. We use 4 different hen lines: -   one line of laying hens with 3 different samples: the just ovulated oocyte, the oocyte collected 24 hours before ovulation (F1 stage), and granulosa cells collected at the F1 stage. We could compare different tissue and developmental stages. -   one line of hen with rapid growth speed -   two lines of laying hens For the 3 last lines we used animals with different fertility levels. We collected the oocyte of the largest follicle before ovulation (F1). The aim of the study is to identify genes involved in fertility or early embryo mortality. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison
