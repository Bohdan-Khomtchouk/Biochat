TITLE
High EMT signature score of invasive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells correlates with NFĸB driven colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2/GM-CSF) secretion by neighboring stromal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established co-cultures of invasive or non-invasive NSCLC cell lines and various types of fibroblasts (FBs) to more precisely characterize the molecular mechanism of tumor-stroma crosstalk in lung cancer Differential expression analysis of the respective mono- and co-cultures revealed an upregulation of NFκB-related genes exclusively in co-cultures with Calu-1. Cytokine Array- and ELISA-based characterization of the “cytokine fingerprints” identified CSF2 (GM-CSF), CXCL1, CXCL6, VEGF, IL6, RANTES and IL8 as being specifically upregulated in various co-cultures

DESIGN
66 samples were analyzed. Epithelial Cancer Cell lines (Calu-1, HCI-H1437) and fibroblasts (HDF, WI-38, CAFs, and NFs) were cultivated in monoculture and in co-culture and hybridized on Affymetrix Exon Chips.
