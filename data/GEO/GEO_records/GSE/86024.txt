TITLE
miR-1199-5p and Zeb1: a novel double-negative feedback coordinating EMT and tumour cell invasion (mRNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of miR-1199-5p, miR-200b-3p and miR-429-3p on gene expression profiles during TGFbeta-induced EMT in normal murine mammary gland cells by using the mRNA-sequencing. Our analysis demonstrates that miR-1199-5p and both miR-200 family members share only 6 target genes, indicating that besides regulating Zeb1 expression they exert distinct functions during EMT.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of NMuMG cells transiently overexpressing miR-1199-5p, miR-200b-3p or miR-429-3p and treated with TGFbeta for 4 days

PLATFORM
