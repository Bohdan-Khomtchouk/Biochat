TITLE
Gene expression changes resulting from the stable loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uveal melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with a strong propensity for metastasis, yet little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this metastatic potential. We recently showed that most metastasizing uveal melanomas, which exhibit a class 2 gene expression profile, contain inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1.  The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BAP1 in uveal melanoma progression.  To that end, uveal melanoma cells were studied following stable shRNA-mediated depletion of BAP1.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from three independent uveal melanoma cell lines each stably depleted using shRNA for either BAP1 or the control gene GFP.  Two biological replicates were performed for each cell line.
