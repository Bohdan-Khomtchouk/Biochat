TITLE
ZBTB18 is a repressor of mesenchymal genes in Glioblastoma [BTSC233]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional repressor ZBTB18 was overexpressed in the brain tumor stem cell-like BTSC233 by lentiviral transduction. Three independent transduction were performed (biological replicates) and analyzed by gene expression aray. Gene set enrichemnt analysis (GSEA) showed changes in the expression of mesenchymal signature. A subset of genes was further valiadted by qPCR. These results indicate a role of ZBTB18 as repressor of mesenchymal genes in Glioblastoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from BTSC233 transduced with pCHMWS-EGFP-FLAG ZBTB18 lentiviral vector (three biological replicates).
