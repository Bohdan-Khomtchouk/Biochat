TITLE
ChIP-seq of E4F1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E4F1 is a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger protein of the Gli-Kruppel family that was first identified, more than 30 years ago, as a cellular target of the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A13S (Ad type V), required for transcriptional regulation of adenoviral genes. In order to decipher E4F1 cellular target genes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of endogenous E4F1 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Both input and immunoprecipitated DNA were exhaustively sequenced and mapped on the mouse genome (mm9). Peak detection has been achieved by combining two peak calling algorithms. Intersection of the two E4F1 peak lists on each cell line were considered as E4F1 chromatin bound regions.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of E4F1 binding in mouse embryonic stem cells.
