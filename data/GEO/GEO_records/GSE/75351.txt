TITLE
A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report the locations of accessible/open chromatin as assayed by ATAC-Seq on two zebrafish melanoma cell lines, zcrest 1 and zcrest 2.

DESIGN
ATAC-Seq was performed on two independent zebrafish melanoma cell lines (50K cells per sample), one replicate of each.
