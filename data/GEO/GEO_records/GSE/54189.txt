TITLE
Luteolin attenuates lipid dysregulation and insulin resistance thorough interplay of liver and adipose tissue in diet-induced obese mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of luteolin on lipid metabolism at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that luteolin treatment with obesogenic diet suppressed the hepatic lipogenesis pathways. Conversely, in adipose tissue, luteolin stimulated the lipogenesis pathway and it also simultaneously increased the expression of genes controlling lipolysis and TCA cycle. Results provide important information about the effect on diet-induced obesity and its metabolic complications.

DESIGN
Total RNA of liver and adipose tissues was obtained from normal diet, high-fat diet and luteolin added high-fat diet-fed mice and mRNA expression-associated with lipid metabolism was measured.
