TITLE
Enhanced salt stress tolerance of rice plants expressing a vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit c1 (SaVHAc1) gene from the halophyte grass Spartina alterniflora LÃ¶isel

ORGANISM
Sporobolus alterniflorus

SUMMARY
From the microarray experiment, many of the 43,311 probes were significantly different: 4,287 (9.9 %) between genotypes (WT and SaVHAc1-rice), 6,761 (15.6 %) between environments (saline or non-saline conditions), and 705 (1.6 %) responded differently to the environment depending upon the genotype.  Although a large number of genes showed upregulation in SaVHAc1-rice relative to WT, eighteen genes that showed more than two-fold increase or decrease in transcription in SaVHAc1-rice were considered significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively.  Fourteen genes encoding proteins with either ion transport or metal binding function were significantly upregulated.  The four genes that showed significant down-regulation in SaVHAc1-rice did not have any functional annotation (hypothetical or expressed proteins). Interestingly, none of the other subunits of vATPase was observed as being affected by SaVHAc1.

DESIGN
Two genotypes (transgenic and wildtype), both exposed to two environments (saline and control) for up to 72 hours. Four biological replicates per genotype/environment combination. One sample per array.
