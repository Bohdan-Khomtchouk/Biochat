TITLE
Gene expression in thymic CD4 T cells: effects of Foxp3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data set is comprised of all thymic T cell subsets presented in this manuscript. These include T-N, T-25, T-FN and T-R thymocytes. Keywords: cell type comparison, development

DESIGN
Detailed methods are presented in the manuscript and in the attached Supplementary Information. All RNA samples were derived from cells immediately after isolation from mice.  Note that these samples were amplified and labeled with Affymetrix and Enzo reagents, while peripheral T cell samples were amplified and labeled with Ambion reagents.
