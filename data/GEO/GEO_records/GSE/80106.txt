TITLE
RNA-seq analyses of JMJD3c-MYOD1-induced myogenic cells and human skeletal myotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated the human ES lines, in which the genome-wide reduction of H3K27me3 can be induced by the ectopic expression of catalytic domain of histone demethylase JMJD3 with doxycycline treatment (JMJD3c-hESCs). The overexpression of JMJD3c enhances MYOD1-mediated myogenic differentiation of hESCs. We compared the gene expression patterns of the generated myogenic cells with those of human skeletal myotubes.

DESIGN
Doxycycline-treated JMJD3c-hESCs were differentiated into myogenic cells by MYOD1 overexpression. Human myoblast HSMM cells were differentiated into myotubes with 2% horse serum.
