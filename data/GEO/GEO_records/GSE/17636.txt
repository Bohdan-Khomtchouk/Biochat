TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer cells overexpressing NF1-C2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NF1-C2 suppresses tumorigenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by repressing FoxF1. We used microarray to identify direct targets for NF1-C2.

DESIGN
The human breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-436 were stably transfected with an expression plasmid including NF1-C2. RNA from these cells and wildtype cells were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays (platform GPL570). Three replicates each.

PLATFORM
