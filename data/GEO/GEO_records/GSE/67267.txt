TITLE
NC2 has a role in determining the transcription start site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study we show that disruption of NC2 function by shutting off either of its two protein subunits in yeast provokes an immediate increase in cryptic transcription around and inside any kind of RNA pol II genes.

DESIGN
9 samples total; 3 strains (2 mutants and 1 WT, 3 biological replicates each).
