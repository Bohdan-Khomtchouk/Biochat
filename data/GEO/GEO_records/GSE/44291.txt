TITLE
Overexpression of MtABI3 in transgenic Medicago truncatula roots

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
ABI3 is a B3-domain transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of seed maturation. To identify genes that are regulated by this transcription factor in the model legume Medicago truncatula, Medicago hairy roots were generated using Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed with the genomic sequence of the ABI3 gene of Medicago. Using the Medicago NimbleGen chip, a transciptomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes compared to the GUS expressed control.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GUS versus genomic. Biological replicates: 3 control (35S::GUS), 3 treatment (35S::Genomic ABI3 sequence), independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
