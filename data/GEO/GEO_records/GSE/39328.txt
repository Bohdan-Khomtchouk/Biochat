TITLE
Differential methylation in discrete developmental stages of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis

ORGANISM
Trichinella spiralis

SUMMARY
We present the first study to confirm the existence of  DNA  methylation  in  the  parasitic  nematode  Trichinella  spiralis,  and  we characterize  the  methylomes  of  the  three  life-cycle  stages  of  this  food-borne infectious human pathogen. We observe a drastic increase in DNA methylation during the  transition  from  the  new  born  to  mature  stage,  and  we  further  identify parasitism-related  genes  that  show  changes  in  DNA  methylation  status  between  life cycle stages. We also evaluated differential gene expression among  the three life stages using  Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation status and gene expression status in three life stages (Adult, muscle larvae, newborn larvae) of Trchinella Spiralis using MethylC-seq.
