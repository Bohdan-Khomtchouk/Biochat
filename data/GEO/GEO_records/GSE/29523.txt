TITLE
Expression data from human CD34+ HPC subpopulations transduced with nuclear-trapped AF1q/MLLT11 (A2M)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine the impact of AF1q/MLLT11 on the gene expression profile of CD34+CD45RA-Lin- and CD34+CD45RA+Lin- HPCs isolated from umbilical cord blood CD34+CD45RA-Lin- and CD34+CD45RA+Lin- HPCs correspond respectively to early multipotent and lympho-granulo-macrophagic precursors. A2M is a nuclear mutant-derivative of AF1q/MLLT11

DESIGN
CD34+CD45RA-Lin- and CD34+CD45RA+Lin- HPCs were FACS-sorted, exposed to A2M or control vectors, sorted based on GFP expression, and subjected to global gene expression analysis 72 hrs later.
