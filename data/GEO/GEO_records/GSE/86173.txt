TITLE
Methylation of miRNA encoding genes in NSCLCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene silencing in lung cancer. In this study we identified several tumor specifically methylated miRNA encoding genes in NSCLC patients by methylome profiling.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor and matching non-malignant lung tissue samples from 50 NSCLC patients and genome wide DNA methylation was analyzed using the MeDIP-chip technology as described previously (Weber et al., 2005).
