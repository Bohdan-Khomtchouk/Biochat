TITLE
Expression data from two pair of osteosarcoma sublines with difeerental pulmonary

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis of tumor consists of a complex serias of cascades . Molecular mechanisms needs to be elucidated. We used microarrays to explore the global change of gene expression betwwen two pairs of osteosarcoma sublines screened by different method.

DESIGN
The assay was performed among three pairs of cublines, the first two pairs of sublines comes from the different passage of sublines established with orthotopic transplantation under the established cell line named Sosp-9607 ,the other pair was screened by the tail-vein injection method of commercial avaliable cell line-Saos-2.
