TITLE
Decay profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNAs following oxidative stress and DNA damage

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We subjected yeast to two stresses, oxidative stress, which under current settings induces a fast and transient response in mRNA abundance, and DNA damage, which triggers a slow enduring response. Using microarrays, we performed a transcriptional arrest experiment to measure genome-wide mRNA decay profiles under each condition. Genome-wide decay kinetics in each condition were compared to decay experiments that were performed in a reference condition (only transcription inhibition without an additional stress) to quantify changes in mRNA stability in each condition. We found condition-specific changes in mRNA decay rates and coordination between mRNA production and degradation. In the transient response, most induced genes were surprisingly destabilized, while repressed genes were somewhat stabilized, exhibiting counteraction between production and degradation. This strategy can reconcile high steady-state level with short response time among induced genes. In contrast, the stress that induces the slow response displays the more expected behavior, whereby most induced genes are stabilized, and repressed genes destabilized. Our results show genome-wide interplay between mRNA production and degradation, and that alternative modes of such interplay determine the kinetics of the transcriptome in response to stress.
