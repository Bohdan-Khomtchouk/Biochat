SUMMARY
rs10-01_rrm - quadruple rrm experience - What is the role of the RRM protein family in plants? Plants were grown on soil in controlled environment under LD (16 h light/8 h dark) and the rosette leaves (8-leaf stage seedlings) were collected for RNA preparation. Keywords: normal vs transgenic comparison

DESIGN
