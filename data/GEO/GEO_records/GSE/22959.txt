TITLE
Sequencing of the non-ribosomal transcriptome allows the simultaneous identification of protein-coding and non-protein-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deep Sequencing of protein-coding and non-protein-coding RNAs from mouse differentiated embryonic stem cells and 14.5dpc mouse fetal head

DESIGN
Analysis of Ribominus RNA from mouse differentiated embryonic stem cells and 14.5dpc mouse fetal head There are no processed data files for GSM566806-GSM566811. There are no fastq raw data files for GSM566812 and GSM566813 since these samples are the combined reads from all sequence lanes.
