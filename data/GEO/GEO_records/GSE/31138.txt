TITLE
Identifying novel anti-angiogenic targets in human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression in normal breast blood vessels and breast invasive ductal carinoma blood vessels.

DESIGN
Normal breast sections and IDC breast sections were immunostained for endothelial-specific CD31. Vessels were dissected and captured with laser capture microscopy, and RNA was extracted and analysed on an Affymetrx array chip.  In total, gene expression in blood vessels from 3 normal breast and 3 IDC breast was analysed.
