TITLE
Mithramycin Depletes Sp1 and Activates p53 to Mediate Senescence and Apoptosis of Pleural Mesothelioma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of mithramycin treated cells, xenografts and sp1 depleted cells with p53 overexpression.

DESIGN
MPM cells and xenografts were treated with mithramycin or SP1 depleted/p53 overexpressed MPM cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to see the invitro and invivo effect of mithramycin (pharmacological model) and depletion of SP1 and overexpression of p53 (genetic model).
