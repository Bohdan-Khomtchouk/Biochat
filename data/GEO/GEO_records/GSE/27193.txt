TITLE
Normalization of whole-genome SNP data from acute monocytic leukemia patients for exome sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With the whole genome SNPs array information, we could evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the point mutation we conclude from the  next-generation sequencing data. Furthermore, we could use the true positive mutation as our guidance to exclude the most unreliable single nucleotide variation detected from sequence. After the process, we could promise a very high specificity under minimum loss of sensitivity.

DESIGN
To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of point mutaions detected through the next-generation sequencing data from nine cases of M5 leukemia patients.
