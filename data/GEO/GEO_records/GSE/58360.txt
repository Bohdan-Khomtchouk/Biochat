TITLE
Gene expression changes after loss of C/EBPα in transformed HSCs [CEBPA RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq characterization of gene expression changes 72 hours after genomic excision of Cebpa in murine hematopoietic progenitors from Cebpaf/f;CreER mice transformed by Hoxa9/Meis1. In the presence of tamoxifen (4OHT), Cre-ER localizes to the nucleus of cells allowing for excision of Cebpa and loss of C/EBPα protein levels. Loss of C/EBPα leads to a decrease in cellular proliferation.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression by RNAseq in two conditions in biological replicates.
