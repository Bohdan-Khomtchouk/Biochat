TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans strains TNO2a3, ∆snfA and ∆schA grown on avicel as sole carbon source

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of A. nidulans TNO2a3, ∆snfA and ∆schA strains when grown on complete media (CM) and transferred to minimal media plus avicel as a sole carbon source for 8 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Three conditions: complete media (reference) for 24h, and minimal media plus avicel for 8 and 24 hours. Three strains: TNO2a3, ∆snfA and ∆schA. Three biological repetitions of each timepoint of TNO2a3 and ∆schA, and two for each timepoint of ∆snfA.

PLATFORM
