Differential expression of genes in spinal cord folowing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to identify genes that were differently expressed in mouse spinal cord as a resut of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),  which is a model for demyelinating disease.

DESIGN
