TITLE
Genomewide nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation analysis on normal and prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the nuclosome occupancy and DNA methylation patterns in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostatic cells

DESIGN
Nuclosome occupancy and DNA methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) analysis of two cell lines (LNCaP and PrEC)
