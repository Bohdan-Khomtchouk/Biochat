TITLE
Agilent Chip Data of the Post-Transcriptome of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Rat Model Treated with Acupuncture (Agilent, miRNA, batch 1)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Agilent technology for high-throughput profiling of the post-transcriptome of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rat model induced by collagen type II (CIA),  with acupuncture, Methotrexate, Isofluorane anesthetic and placebo treatments, as well as the healthy control.

DESIGN
The experiment is designed as 5 arms: epidermal needle manipulation (AP/MEC), Methotrexate injection (MTX), Isofluorane anesthetic (ANE, used as anesthesia control) and placebo (PLA, used as control) on CIA induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats, as well as the normal rats (NORA, healthy control). Whole blood sampling was carried out before any therapy in RA (RA_T0) and NORA (NORA_T0) groups, and in the other groups (AP/MEC, MTX,ANE, PLA and NORA) at 1 hour and 34 days after the start of therapeutic treatments.  Finally, 24 total RNA samples (two replicates for each sampling) extracted from 24 blood samples (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC ) were analyzed using Agilent technology (Agilent-031189 unrestricted_Rat_miRNA_v16.0_Microarray).
