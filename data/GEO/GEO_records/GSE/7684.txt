TITLE
Type I interferon signaling is required for activation of the inflammasome during Francisella infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Francisella are pathogenic bacteria whose virulence is linked to their ability to replicate within the host cell cytosol. Entry into the macrophage cytosol activates a host protective multimolecular complex called the inflammasome to release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 and trigger caspase-1 dependent cell death. Here we show that cytosolic Francisella induce a type I interferon (IFN) response that is essential for caspase-1 activation, inflammasome mediated cell death, and release of IL-1 and IL-18.  Extensive type I IFN dependent cell death resulting in macrophage depletion occurs in vivo during Francisella infection. Type I IFN is also necessary for inflammasome activation in response to cytosolic Listeria but not vacuole localized Salmonella or extracellular ATP. These results show the specific connection between type I IFN signaling and inflammasome activation, two sequential events triggered by recognition of cytosolic bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first example of positive regulation of inflammasome activation. This connection underscores the importance of cytosolic recognition of pathogens and highlights how multiple innate immunity pathways interact before commitment to critical host responses.

DESIGN
We analyzed a series of 18 MEEBO arrays on which were hybed RNA randomly amplified from bone marrow derived macrophages infected or not with WT Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida or a the mglA mutant strain GB2.
