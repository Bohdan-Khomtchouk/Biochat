TITLE
MYB87 chimera repressor suppresses longitudinal organ growth with aberrant expressions of cell wall related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Proper cell wall regulation is essential for growth and development in plants. Here we report that the constitutive expression of MYB87 chimera repressor causes the suppressed longitudinal organ elongation in almost all organs. Aberrant transversal growth is also observed in multiple organs which coincide with transversally expanded or swollen cells. Microarray analysis revealed the transcript levels of various primary cell wall related  enes are up- or down-regulated, and those of secondary wall related genes are down- regulated in the chimera repressor plants. These findings  ontribute to the further understanding of complex cell wall regulations and their roles in plant growth and development.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of 35S:MYB87-SRDX and wild-type Arabidopsis seedling were compared.
