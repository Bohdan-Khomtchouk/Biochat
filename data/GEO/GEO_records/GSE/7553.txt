TITLE
Gene Expression Patterns Involved in the Malignant Transformation and Progression of Metastatic Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastatic melanoma is a deadly disease while non-metastatic melanoma and other cutaneous tumor types are usually cured with surgical removal of the primary tumors.  This study evaluated gene expresion to determine if gene expression differences existed which would allow one to identify the metastatic tumors based on the expression of specific genes. Keywords: multiple tissue comparison

DESIGN
Tumor samples were collected from patients with various cutaneous tumors, flash frozen, and then processed for gene exprression analysis using microarrays.  The pool of tissues includes enough metastatic samples and non-metastatic samples to identify a gene expression signature associated with the outgrowth of the metastatic tumor.
