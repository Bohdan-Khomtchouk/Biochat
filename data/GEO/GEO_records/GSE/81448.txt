TITLE
Effects of VEGF-B on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Doxorubicin is a widely used and effective anthracycline chemotherapy drug, which use is limited due to its cardiotoxic side effects. We show that gene therapy with AAV-VEGF-B can inhibit the doxorubicin-induced cardiac atrophy and whole body cachexia.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from myocardium of mice in 3 groups: 1) control (injected with PBS, n= 5), 2) doxorubicin injected alone (Dox, n=5 ), 3) AAV9-VEGF-B administration 7 days before doxorubicin injection (n=5 ). Mice were euthanized 20 hours after doxorubicin or PBS injection.
