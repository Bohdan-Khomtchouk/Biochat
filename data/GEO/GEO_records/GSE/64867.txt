TITLE
RNA-seq in squamous cell carcinoma stem cells in the presence or absence of TGF-beta signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq on purified squamous cell carcinoma stem cells (SCC-SCs) from primary mouse skin tumors transduced with TGF-beta reporter.

DESIGN
SCC-SCs were purified based on cell surface marker expression integrin alpha6 and CD44, after lineage negative selection, and separated by fluorescent TGF-beta reporter expression.
