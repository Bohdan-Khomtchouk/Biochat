TITLE
Discovering miRNA regulatory networks in Holt-Oram Syndrome using a Zebrafish model [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To investigate the complex regulatory networks disrupted in Holt-Oram Syndrome, we characterized genome-widely the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in WT and Tbx5 depleted zebrafish embryos at two development time points, 24 and 48 hpf.

DESIGN
The zebrafish gene Tbx5a was silenced with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide MO-Tbx5a against the TSS of the gene. A MO-CT was used in CT samples. 1,5ng morpholinos were injected into the yolk of 1-cell stage embryos and total RNA extracted from 50 embryos collected at 24 and 48hpf.The Zebrafish  wild-type AB strain line was used.
