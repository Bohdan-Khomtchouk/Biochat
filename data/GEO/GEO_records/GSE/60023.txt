TITLE
Gene expression of mantle cell lymphoma-initiating cells from primary tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we compared the expression of 30215 genes in mantle cell lymphoma-initiating cells (MCL-ICs) with mantle cell lymphoma-non-initiating cells (MCL-non-ICs) and B-cells from healthy donor

DESIGN
Three samples each of MCL-ICs and MCL-non-ICs were isolated from aphresis of 3 mantle cell lymphoma primary patient samples and 2 samples of CD19+ Bcells isolated from buffy coats of healthy donor Microarray include both coding and non-coding transcripts but only mRNA coding transcript were included in this study.
