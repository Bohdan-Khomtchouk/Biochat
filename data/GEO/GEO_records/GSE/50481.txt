TITLE
Specifically-expressed genes of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus involved in the nematodeâ€™s early interaction with pine trees

ORGANISM
Bursaphelenchus xylophilus

SUMMARY
This study compared the different gene expression of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in two growth conditions (growing on Botrytis cinerea and inoculating Pinus thunbergii). The goal was to analyze the specifically-expressed genes of the pine wood nematode involved in the early interaction between B. xylophilus and P. thunbergii and screen the pathogenesis related genes of B. xylophilus.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Growing on Botrytis cinerea  vs. Inoculating Pinus thunbergii . Biological replicates: 3 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL17663 Agilent-042453 Bursaphelenchus xylophilus array [Probe name version]
