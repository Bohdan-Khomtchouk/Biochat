TITLE
Invertible Elements and their association with Small Non-coding RNAs in Neisseria gonorrhoeae

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
We report for the first time movement of Correia Repeat Enclosed Elements, through inversion of the element at its chromosomal location. Analysis of Ion Torrent generated genome sequence data from Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain NCCP11945 passaged for 8 weeks in the laboratory under standard conditions and stress conditions revealed a total of 37 inversions: 24 were exclusively seen in the stressed sample; 7 in the control sample; and the remaining 3 were seen in both samples. These inversions have the capability to alter gene expression in N. gonorrhoeae through the previously  determined activities of the sequence features of these elements. In addition, the locations of predicted non-coding RNAs were investigated to identify potential associations with CREE. Associations varied between strains, as did the number of each element identified. The analysis indicates a role for CREE in disrupting ancestral regulatory networks, including non-coding RNAs.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was used to examine expression changes related to Correia repeats in the strain

PLATFORM
GPL18844 Ion Torrent PGM (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)
