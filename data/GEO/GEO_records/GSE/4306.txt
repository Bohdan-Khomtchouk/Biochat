These are three biological replicates. HeLa cells were crosslinked on separate days. In each case, a matched total from the same crosslinking was produced in parallel. Amplicons were made from each and hybridized onto ENCODE region tiling arrays. Two color arrays were used; ChIP was red, Total was green. Keywords: ChIP-chip
