TITLE
Leaf margins of indeterminate Arabidopsis leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Leaves are flat determinate organs derived from indeterminate shoot apical meristems. The presence of a specific leaf meristem is debated, as anatomical features typical of meristems are not present in leaves. Here we demonstrate that multiple NGATHA (NGA) and CINCINNATA-class-TCP (CIN-TCP) transcription factors act redundantly to suppress activity of a leaf margin meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana, and that their absence confers persistent marginal growth of leaves, cotyledons and floral organs. The marginal meristem is activated by the juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial domains and maintained by WOX homeobox transcription factors, but other margin elaboration genes are dispensable for its maintenance. This genetic framework parallels the morphogenetic program of shoot apical meristems and may represent a relic from an ancestral shoot system from which seed plant leaves evolved.
