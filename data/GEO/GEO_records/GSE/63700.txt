TITLE
Effect of CHKA knockdown on C4-2 cell transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of C4-2 Prostate cancer cell line after 72 hours of knockdown. CHKA is overexpressed in a number of solid tumours, including prostate cancer. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of CHKA in prostate carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
This experiment was designed to understand the regulation of transcriptome by Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) which is an important enzyme in Kennedy pathway. In order to achieve this, the endogenous protein was knocked down using siRNA pool that targets the CHKA mRNA.
