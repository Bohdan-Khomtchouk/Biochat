TITLE
Neutralizing Antibody Mediated Protection Against Mucosal Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Challenge Includes Systemic Clearance of Distal Virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the anatomic sites and mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection.  In particular, to determine whether bNAbs completely block virus at the local portal of entry following mucosal virus challenge.
