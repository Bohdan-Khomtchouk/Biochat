TITLE
Neutralizing Antibody Mediated Protection Against Mucosal Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Challenge Includes Systemic Clearance of Distal Virus

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the anatomic sites and mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection.  In particular, to determine whether bNAbs completely block virus at the local portal of entry following mucosal virus challenge.

DESIGN
We performed comprehensive necropsies following intravaginal SHIV-SF162P3 challenge of rhesus monkeys that had received a fully protective dose of the potent V3 glycan-dependent bNAb PGT121.  This bNAb has been shown to protect robustly against SHIV-SF162P3, SHIV-AD8, and SHIV-DH12
