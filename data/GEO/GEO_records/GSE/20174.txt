TITLE
Mouse Lung Response to Stainless Steel and Mild Steel Welding Fume

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A/J mice are genetically predisposed to spontaneous and/or chemically-induced lung tumors while C57BL/6J (B6) mice are resistant.  This genetic disparity provides a unique scenario to identify molecular mechanisms associated with the lung response to welding fume at the transcriptome level.

DESIGN
Four mice per group were exposed four times by pharyngeal aspiration to 5mg/kg mild steel (MS) fume, stainless steel (SS) fume, or saline vehicle and were necropsied 28 days and 16 weeks after the last exposure.  Whole lung microarray using Illumina Mouse Ref-8 version 1.1 expression beadchips was done.
