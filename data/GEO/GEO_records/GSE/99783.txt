TITLE
Nup153 defines neural identity through cooperative transcriptional control with Sox2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through RNA interference and genome-wide Nup153 binding studies, we found that Nup153 and Sox2 bind and co-regulate hundreds of genes. Furthermore, we found that Nup153 exhibits binding location dependent spatially distinct transcriptional control by differentially regulating expression when bound to the promoter region or to the transcription end site (TES). These results establish Nup153 not only as a novel transcriptional co-regulator of Sox2 but also as a key player in the regulation of cell fate by directly modulating gene expression.

DESIGN
ChIP was performed on neural progenitor cells using antibodies against Nup153, FLAG-Nup153, H3K4Me3, or IgG. ChIPmentation was perfromed  using an antibody against Sox2 on NeuPCs treated with shNup153 or shControl.  RNA-seq was performed on NPCs treated with shNup153 or shControl. Atac-seq was performed on NPCs treated with shNup153 or shControl.
