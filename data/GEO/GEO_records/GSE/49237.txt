TITLE
Analysis of TBR1 downnstream target genes in embryonic forebrains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TBR1 is a forebrain specific T-box transcription factor. Tbr1-/- mice have been characterized by defective axonal projections from cerebral cortex and abnormal neuronal migration of cerebral cortex and amygdala. To investigate how TBR1 regulates neural development, the gene expression profile of Tbr1-/- brains was compared with WT littermates.

DESIGN
Total RNAs purified from forebrains at embryonic day 16.5 were hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
