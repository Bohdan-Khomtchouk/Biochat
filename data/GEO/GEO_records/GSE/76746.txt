TITLE
The Histone Methyltransferases MLL1 and DOT1L Cooperate with Meningioma-1 to Induce AML [Mouse ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To characterize the genome-wide distribution of H3K79me2 in murine MN1 driven myeloid leukemia Methods: We performed Chip-seq for the H3K79me2 in leukemias isolated from moribund mice that had been injected with common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) transduced with MSCV-MN1-GFP Results: H3K79me2 is enriched at key loci that 1. are bound by MN1 in the data set of Heuser et al, (Cancer Cell. 2011 Jul 12;20(1):39-52.), 2. upregulated upon transduction with MN1, and lose expression upon deletion of the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1l. Conclusions: A leukemogenic program in MN1 leukemias is marked by H3K79me2 and dependent on this mark

DESIGN
