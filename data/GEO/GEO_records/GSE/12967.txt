miR-K5 expression and inhibition

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of BJAB cells expressing miR-K5 and BCBL cells treated with miR-K5 inhibitor. To identify host RNA targets of KSHV miRNAs, we took advantage of the observation that RNAs targeted by miRNAs often display small reductions in their steady-state levels, perhaps as a result of their impaired translation. Accordingly, we examined cellular transcript accumulation by array-based expression profiling under four sets of conditions in which KSHV miRNAs were expressed or inhibited. Keywords: Experimental treatment versus control treatment
