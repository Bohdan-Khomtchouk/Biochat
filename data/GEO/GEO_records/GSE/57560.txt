TITLE
Correlation of gene expression with bladder capacity in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome are terms used to describe a heterogenous chronic pelvic and bladder pain disorder of unknown etiology. The goal of this pilot study was to determine if gene expression profiling of bladder biopsy tissue from patients experiencing symptoms could be used to separate the patients based on some clinical parameter.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles in bladder biopsy tissue from patients with: (1) low bladder capacity (defined here as < 400 ml upon hydordistension), (2) normal capacity (â‰¥400 ml), and (3) controls were compared. Gene expression profiles from low bladder capacity tissues differed significantly from normal capacity and control tissue, suggesting gene expression profiling may be a useful tool for better understanding IC disease pathophysiology.
