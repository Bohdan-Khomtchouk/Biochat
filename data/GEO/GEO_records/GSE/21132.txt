TITLE
role of miR-146a on Jurkat T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
screenning the differentially expressed genes of Jurkat-FF3, Jurkat-miR146a, Jurkat-miR146a-sponge cell lines.

DESIGN
To investigate the role of  miR-146a on Jurkat T cells, we screened the differentially expressed genes of Jurkat-FF3 (as control), Jurkat-miR146a (as miR-146a overexpression cell line), Jurkat-miR146a-sponge (as miR-146a knock down cell line).
