TITLE
Olfactory stem cell-mediated regeneration: horizontal basal cell (HBC) lineage [scRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lineage of the horizontal basal cells (HBC) stem cells and their descendants from the olfactory epithelium were profiled by single-cell RNA-Seq to identify differentiated cell types, intermediate stages, transition states, and to infer the lineage trajectories.

DESIGN
Horizontal basal cell (HBC) stem cells from the olfactory epithelium that were either wild-type or mutant for Sox2 were lineage traced, collected by FACS, and profiled by single-cell RNA-seq.  A minimum of two biological replicates were collected for each time-point/experimental condition. A total of 1384 YFP-positive lineage traced cells were used in this analysis. Additional samples from GSE95601 were used in some analyses. Please note that the GSE95601 samples (total 849 samples) were included and re-analyzed in the current study. The processed data files (linked to the current GSE99251 records) include the re-analyzed data of the GSE95601 samples (total 849 samples), and the raw data (for the re-analyzed samples) are available from the corresponding GSE95601 sample records.
