TITLE
Expression data from porcine red and white muscle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In meat animal production, favourable meat traits such as color and, in the pig in particular, tenderness have been found to closely associate with the greater abundance of red or highly oxidative fibres. Red muscles possess higher lipid concentration (intra- and inter-fibre fat) which is associated with more tender and juicy meat. In addition, individuals with muscles that are abundant in oxidative type I fibres are associated with favourable metabolic health, and are less likely to predispose to obesity and insulin resistance. Collectively, understanding the molecular processes that govern the expression of specific fiber types and the phenotypic characteristics of muscles is important in agricultural and medical fields. In this study, a genome-wide investigation of the porcine differential expression between two red (soleus, SE) and white (longissimus dorsi, LD) muscle was conducted using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Array containing oligonucleotides representing approximately 24123 transcripts from 20201 S. scrofa genes

DESIGN
Three meishan gilts from the same litter were slaughtered at the 150 days of age by electrical stunning and exsanguination, in compliance with national regulations applied in commercial slaughtering. Immediately after slaughter, two muscles with different locations, functions, and biochemical properties were sampled: the longissimus at the last rib level, a fast twitch glycolytic muscle involved in voluntary movements of the back, and the deep portion of the SE, a oxydolytic muscle.
