TITLE
Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis is suppressed by the alveolar lineage transcription factors GATA6 and HOPX.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular programs that mediate normal cell differentiation are required for oncogenesis and tumor cell survival in certain cancers. How cell-lineage-restricted genes specifically influence metastasis is poorly defined. In lung cancers, we uncovered a transcriptional program that is preferentially associated with distal airway epithelial differentiation and lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) progression. This program is regulated in part by the lineage transcription factors GATA6 and HOPX. These factors can cooperatively limit the metastatic competence of ADC cells, by modulating overlapping alveolar differentiation and invasogenic target genes. Thus, GATA6 and HOPX are critical nodes in a lineage-selective pathway that directly links effectors of airway epithelial specification to the inhibition of metastasis in the lung ADC subtype.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of human lung Adenocarcinoma PC9 cell lines infected with lentivirus harboring shRNA of control and shRNA of both GATA6 and HOPX were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
