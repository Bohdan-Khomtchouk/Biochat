TITLE
Genome wide analysis of mouse gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in a mouse model of spontaneous GIST.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse GIST tumors at the gene expression level. The purpose of the study was to identify immunomodulatory genes in mouse GIST tumors after in vivo treatment with the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse GIST tumors after in vivo treatment with imatinib or vehicle control injected intraperitoneally.

PLATFORM
GPL13824 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip (Gene version based on MouseWG6_V2_0_R0_11278593_A)
