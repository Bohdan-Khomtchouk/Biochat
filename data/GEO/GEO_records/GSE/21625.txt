TITLE
The novel transcription factor, POPEYE, regulates response to iron deficiency in Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analysis was used to identify direct targets of the transcription factor POPEYE (PYE)

DESIGN
ChIP was performed on ProPYE:PYE:GFP plants and on wt plants as a control. The two samples were amplified and hybridized on Agilent arrays. Dye swap was performed for two biological replicates.
