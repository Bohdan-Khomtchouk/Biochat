TITLE
Intrinsic regenerative potential of murine cochlear supporting cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P3 Math1-nGFP mouse cochlear sensory epithelia, consisting of greater and lesser epithelial ridges (GER & LER) including the organ of Corti with nGFP-positive hair cells, were dissected, dissociated into single cells, and labeled with propidium iodide and  three CD marker antibodies. The cell suspension was subjected to FACS purification. 83.6 ±2.8% of the total input of cells were viable, determined by exclusion of propidium iodide. Only viable cells were collected into 5 distinct populations: GFP+ cells (Samples HC_A-D), GFP−/CD271High (Samples Mac_A-C), as well as GFP−/CD271Low/CD326+/CD146Low (Samples SC_A-B), GFP−/CD271Low/CD326+/CD146Hig (Samples GER_A-B), and GFP−/CD271Low/CD326− (Sample BM_B).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 5 different FACS sorted cell poulations from P3 Math1-nGFP cochlea.
