TITLE
Gene expression profiling reveals a novel regulatory role for Sox21 in mouse trophoblast stem cell differentiation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we introduced Sox21 as a new regulator of trophoblast stem cell (TSC) differentiation. The transcriptome of different cell types were analyzed and compared to identify a TSC gene signature.

DESIGN
In order to identify novel TSC specific genes, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of TSCs, embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice of the same genetic background (129S1/SvImJ).
