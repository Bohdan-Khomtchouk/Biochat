TITLE
Gene expression during early stages of arbuscular mycorrhizal root formation in Medicago truncatula.

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel gene expression during early stages of Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on mycorrhizal root fragments enriched for early fungal infection stages. We used Medicago GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to early stages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and identified genes differentially expressed during these early stages.

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula GFP-HDEL hairy roots (genotypes A17 and DMI3) were grown in vertically-oriented petri dishes, incubated at 26Â°C and inoculated with 8 Gigaspora margarita spores, which were positioned between the lateral roots. G.margarita spores germinated in 2 to 4 days. Hyphopodia were observed after 5-6 days. Root fragments which reacted to the fungal contact were collected and frozen. Non-inoculated control root fragments were harvested at a comparable age.
