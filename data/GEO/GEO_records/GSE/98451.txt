TITLE
Reconstructing Lineage Hierarchies of Mice Uterus Epithelia Development using Single Cell Analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The endometrium layer comprises of luminal and glandular epithelia that both develop from the same simple layer of fetal uterine epithelia. Mechanisms of uterine epithelial progenitor self-renewal and differentiation are unclear. Methods: This study aims to systematically analyze the molecular and cellular mechanisms of uterine epithelia development by single cell RNA-Seq Results: An integrated set of single cell transcriptomic data of uterine epithelial progenitors and their differentiated progenies is provided. Additionally, the unique molecular signatures of these cells, characterized by sequential up-regulation of specific epigenetic and metabolic activities, and activation of unique signaling pathways and transcription factors, were also investigated. Finally, a unique subpopulation of early progenitor, as well as differentiated luminal and glandular lineages were identified. A complex cellular hierarchy of uterine epithelia development was thus delineated. Conclusions: Our study therefore systematically decoded molecular markers and cellular program of uterine epithelia development that would shed lights on uterine developmental biology.

DESIGN
960 single CD326+ mice uterine epithelia from 5 developmental stages (post natal day 0, 7, 14, 28, 56) were isolated, pre-amplified and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500, finally data from 714 single cells were collected

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
