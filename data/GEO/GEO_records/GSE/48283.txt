TITLE
Microarray analysis of bovine oocyte from distinct follicle sizes reveals gradual transcripts accumulation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to compare the transcriptome of the bovine oocyte coming from distinct follicle sizes.

DESIGN
The different follicle sizes ( < 3mm; 3-5mm; 5-8mm and > 8mm) were compared with microarray using a reference design ( < 3mm as a referece) for a total of three comparisons ( < 3mm vs 3-5mm; < 3mm vs 5-8mm; < 3mm vs > 8mm). Overall, 18 hybridizations, corresponding to the three biological replicates (different week of oocyte collection) and three comparisons were done using a dye-swap set-up.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
