TITLE
Feminized behavior and gene expression in the BNST/POA in a novel mouse model of Klinefelter Syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/preoptic area in a mouse model of Klinefelter Syndrome (the Sex Chromosome Trisomy model). The hypothesis tested was that feminization of partner preference was also reflected on a molecular level
