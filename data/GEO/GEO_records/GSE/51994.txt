TITLE
Spatial Regulation of Gene Expression in Articular Cartilage Assessed by Laser Captured Microdissection and Microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used laser capture microdissection to isolate different zones of the articular cartilage from proximal tibiae of 1-week old mice, and used microarray to analyze global gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis corroborated previously known signaling pathways, such as Wnt and Bmp signaling, and implicated novel pathways, such as ephrin and integrin signaling, for spatially associated articular chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. In addition, comparison of the spatial regulation of articular and growth plate cartilage revealed unexpected similarities between the superficial zone of the articular cartilage and the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate.

DESIGN
Collecte five biological replications in three superficial, mid zone and deep zones of Articular Cartilage Assessed by Laser Captured Microdissection and Microarray(Superficial Zone vs Mid Zone vs Deep Zone)
