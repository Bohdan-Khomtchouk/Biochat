TITLE
Functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts from human colon tumors shows specific prognostic gene expression signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor growth and metastasis is controlled by paracrine signaling between cells of the tumor microenvironment and malignant cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are functionally important components of the tumor microenvironment. Although some steps involved in the cross-talk between these cells are known, there is still a lot that is not clear. Thus, the addition of, the consideration of microenvironment in the development of the disease, to the clinical and pathological procedures (currently admitted as the consistent value cancer treatments) could lay the foundations for the development of new treatment strategies to control the disease.

DESIGN
Primary CAF cultures from 15 primary human colon tumors were established Their purity was evaluated by the expression of various epithelial and myofibroblast specific markers Co-culture assays of primary CAFs with different colon tumor cells were performed to evaluate pro-migratory CAF-derived effects on cancer cells CAF gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray to identify deregulated genes in different pro-migratory CAFs
