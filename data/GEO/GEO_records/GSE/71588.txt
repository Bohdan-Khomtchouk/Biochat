TITLE
Regulatory T cells Maintain Lung Function Upon Infectious Damage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis of Treg cell subsets isolated from lungs of Il10GFPFoxp3Thy1.1 mice. Thy1.1+ Treg cells were FACS-sorted into IL-10–IL-18R–, IL-10+IL-18R– and IL10–IL-18R+ populations on day 5 following intranasal infection with 0.5 LD50 PR8-OTI influenza virus.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of each Thy1.1+ Treg cell population (IL-10–IL-18R–, IL-10+IL-18R– and IL10–IL-18R+) from lungs on day 5 following influenza infection from 5 infected mice, sorted into TRIzol LS reagent.

PLATFORM
