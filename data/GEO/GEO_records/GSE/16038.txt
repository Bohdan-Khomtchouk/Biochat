TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling in porcine liver and lymph node tissues during acute pleuropneumoni

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of porcine liver and tracheobronchial lung lymph node tissues were studied to identify genes being significantly affected by bacterial infection of the lungs. Samples were taken from liver and tracheobronchial lung lymph node tissues in pigs experimentally infected with A. pleuropneumoniae, serotype 5b, and from healthy non-inoculated control pigs from the same herd. Samples were investigated for changes in gene expression by means of global cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of samples of liver and lung lymph node tissues from ten pigs challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and from five healthy control pigs was conducted by hybridising all 2x15 samples against a tissue specific common reference consisting of a pool of equal amount of total-RNA from all samples of each tissue type and were balanced with respect to control and challenged animals.
