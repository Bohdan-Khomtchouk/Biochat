TITLE
Global transcript analysis of livers of Lrh-1 K289R knockin mice under refed conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript data from liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) WT and LRH-1 K289R livers from mice fasted for 24h followed by 6h refed. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying hepatic function under refed conditions.

DESIGN
Male mice (n=6) were fasted and then refed, sacrificed at 8 am and livers snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
