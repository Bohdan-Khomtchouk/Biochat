TITLE
Gene expression profiles of various CSB mutant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A new ubiquitination site of CSB was identified and proved to play roles in oxidative stress repair. This study characterizes the gene expression signatures affected by CSB-K991R as compared to wild type and UBD mutant. Using Nimblegen microarray we identified differentially expressed genes in human fibroblasts derived from CS patients as compared to CSB reconstituted cell lines (wild type), also we found the similar gene expression patterns between K991R and UBD mutant derivatives.

DESIGN
The Nimblegen human 12 x 135K gene expression array was used to define gene expression profiles in human fibroblasts either lacking CSB or expressing exogenous CSB wild type or mutants.
