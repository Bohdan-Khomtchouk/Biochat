TITLE
Gene expression profiling of miR27a over-expressing RH36 cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify direct or indirect miR-27a modulated genes, RH36 cells transfected with miR-27a precursors (pre-miR-27a or pre-control), analyzed 48h post-transfection,  were used to perform microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out in ERMS cell line (RH36) transfected with miR-27a or with a negative pre-control. We performed the experiments in triplicate. We used the ‘‘Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray’’ (Agilent), consisting of 41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes, which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes.
