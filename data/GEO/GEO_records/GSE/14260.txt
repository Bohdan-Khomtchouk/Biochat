TITLE
Profiling the target genes for LSD1, MTA1, MTA2, and MTA3 in MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-DSL technology from AVIVA SYSTEMS BIOLOGY to find out the whole genome targets for LSD1, MTA1, MTA2, and MTA3

DESIGN
We analyzed arrays using antibodies against LSD1, MTA1, MTA2, or MTA3 and negative control to acquire the enriched ratio of each gene.
