TITLE
Transcriptional profiling reveals differential changes in the expression of oxytocin and CARTpt Â mRNAs in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum of rats (striatum)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Methamphetamine addiction is mimicked in rats that self-administer the drug and accelerate their intake when given long access to it. Self-administration (SA) models do not include adverse consequences that are necessary to reach a diagnosis of addiction in humans. Here, we studied transcriptional consequences of methamphetamine SA and repeated foot-shocks in rat brain.

DESIGN
Six rats from each of the 3 groups including control, shock resistant, and shock sensitive and three rats from each of 2 groups including saline yoked to shock resistant and saline yoked to shock sensitive were selected based on RNA quality and integrity for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
