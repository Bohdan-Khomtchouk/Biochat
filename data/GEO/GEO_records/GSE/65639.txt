TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of kidney cancer (CustomArray Inc)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways during cancerogenesis.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from malignant tumors were obtained from patients who had undergone surgery. Samples were formain fixed and embedded in paraffin. Tumors were evaluated by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the tumor cell numbers. All tumor samples used in this study contained at least 80% tumor cells.

PLATFORM
GPL19740 CustomArray platform for signaling pathways
