TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Despite its prevalence, the molecular basis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains poorly understood. We recently identified the developmental transcription factor Grhl3 as a potent tumor suppressor of SCC, and demonstrated that targeting of Grhl3 by a miR-21-dependent proto-oncogenic network underpins SCC in humans. Reduced levels of GRHL3 and its target gene PTEN are evident in human skin, and head and neck SCC, associated with increased expression of miR-21, which targets both tumor suppressors. Our data defines the miR-21-GRHL3-PTEN-axis as a critical tumor suppressor pathway in SCC.
