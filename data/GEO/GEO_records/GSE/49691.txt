TITLE
Dissolved and particulate copper exposure induce differing gene expression profiles in a deposit feeding amphipod

ORGANISM
Melita plumulosa

SUMMARY
The southeastern Australian epibenthic amphipod Melita plumulosa was exposed to copper via different routes of exposure for 48 hours.

DESIGN
RNA from exposed animals (10 individuals, pooled) was hybridised against reference RNA from unexposed animals.  Each treatment was replicated 5 times.  Alternate arrays were dye swapped.  Data are presented (exposed/ unexposed).
