TITLE
Expression data from P0 forebrain of wild-type and Elavl3/Elavl4 double knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuronal Elavl-like (nElavl) RNA binding proteins have three paralogs (Elavl2, Elavl3 and Elavl4) in the mouse genome. This family of RNABPs have been implicated in a variety of post-transcriptional RNA processing mechanisms, including regulation of mRNA stability, alternative splicing, and translational regulation. In this study, using mouse exon arrays, we identify significant differences (p < 0.01) in 119 transcripts between wild-type and Elavl3/Elavl4 double knockout forebrain tissue at postnatal day 0.

DESIGN
A total of 10 samples were analyzed.  These samples consisted of 5 littermate pairs of wild-type and Elavl3/Elavl4 double knockout mice.
