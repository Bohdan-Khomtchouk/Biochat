TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in hereditary breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to characterize hereditary breast tumors based on their miRNA expression profiles. To this end, we performed global miRNA expression analysis of more than 800 human miRNA genes   in a large series of 80 FFPE breast tissue samples. The series included 66 hereditary breast primary tumors from 13 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 10 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 43 non-BRCA12 tumors denominated hereafter as BRCAX tumors. In addition we have analyzed 10 sporadic breast carcinomas and 4 normal breast tissues obtained after breast reduction surgery from healthy donors with no family history of breast cancer. To avoid contamination with normal breast tissue, tumoral area on FFPE blocks was marked by a pathologist and macrodissected for subsequent total RNA extraction.
