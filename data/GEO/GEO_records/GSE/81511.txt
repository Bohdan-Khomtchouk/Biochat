TITLE
Glucocorticoid Receptor: MegaTrans Switching Mediates Repression of ERα-Regulated Transcriptional Program [Gro-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying GR-dependent inhibition of ERα-regulated gene activation programs at the global genomic level have been poorly understood. We found the binding of GR in trans on ERα-activated enhancers results in gene and enhancer repression by disassembling the MegaTrans Complex.

DESIGN
All GRO-Seq experiments were designed to understand the effects of different ligands (E2, Dex or combine together) treatments to MCF7 cells, to evaluated the two signal cross-talk.
