SUMMARY
Inbred congenic strain B6.C6.132.54/Vad was created using C57BL/6ByJ background and BALB/cJ donor strains. Flanking background markers at chr. 6: 75.9 Mb (rs4226008, NCBI Mouse Build 36 / dbSNP Build 126) and 122.3 Mb (rs3023093), and limiting donor markers at 81.9 Mb (rs4226024) and at 91.8 Mb (rs3712161) defined the introgressed region. We concluded the segment size must be between 9.9 Mb and 46.4 Mb. In a Quantitative Trait Gene identification study we compared brain (without cerebellum) gene expression between progenitors and congenics. Such comparisons can facilitate identification of cis-regulated genes and to establish genetic control of a complex phenotype whose expression is associated with the introgressed chromosome segment. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: strain comparison
