TITLE
Patterns of changes in DNA global methylation following the treatment with GC/RA and with GC/RA plus AZA/SAHA in MYC amplified and BRG1 mutant lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive characterization of the DNA methylome regulated by the treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) and retinoic acid (RA) alone and combined with AZA/SAHA and the relationship of these features with the status of BRG1 and MYC in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
MYC amplified cell lines and BRG1 mutant cell lines were treated  with glucocorticoids (GC) and retinoic acid (RA) alone and combined with AZA/SAHA and their methylation was then measured
