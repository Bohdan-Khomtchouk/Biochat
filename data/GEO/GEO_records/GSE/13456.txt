TITLE
Comparison between the intestinal developmental process in different sucking phases

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This paper describe the whole genome-wide analysis of differences in postnatal intestinal from 0 day to 21 days of piglets. Using Genome Array，We generated transcriptase profiles of intestine from the Landrace piglets at 0, 3, 8, 14，21 days post natal (dpn). We identified 4014 differentially expressed transcripts during intestinal developing in Landrace piglets. Respectively, the Gene Ontology processes and the time sequence profile analysis of differentially expressed genes were constructed. In the course of growth , the mostly significant enriched GO category of profile  mainly focus on folic acid transport, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, Momolybdopterin cofactor biosynthetic process,The down-regulation genes show the state of malnutritionplay at early growth in pig life.

DESIGN
From the Landrace piglets at 0, 3, 8, 14, and 21 days post natal (dpn). Using GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array，we identified differentially expressed transcripts during intestinal developing in Landrace piglets. Respectively, from these, the Gene Ontology processes and the time sequence profile analysis of differentially expressed genes were constructed.
