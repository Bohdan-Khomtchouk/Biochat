TITLE
Genomic mapping of Six1 binding sites during skeletal myoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, the C2C12 cell line, a model used to study myogenesis and regeneration, was allowed to differentiate from myoblast precursor cells to myotubes. Cells were harvested at 3 different timepoints to perform ChIP-on-Chip of Six1, which is a key muscle regulator. We identified global loci bound by Six1 during skeletal myoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
C2C12 Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into myotubes. Cells at three timepoints were harvested for ChIP-on-Chip, including myoblasts stage,  24h after differentiation and myotubes (96h after differentiation). Myotubes were detached from the undifferentiated myoblast reserve cells using diluted trypsin. 3 independent biological replicates were used for each time point experiment. A microarray set counts 3 arrays (Custom Arrays A, B and C) for a total of approximately 2.9 million probes.
