TITLE
Expression data from rat lung alveolar development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Lung alveolarization is a complex process that involves interactions between several cell types and leads to considerable increase in gas-exchange surface area. The step designated secondary septation includes elastogenesis from interstitial fibroblasts. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of fibroblast gene expression that underly secondary septation, and identified numerous genes that undergo signficant changes in expression Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Rat lung fibroblats were extemporaneously isolated at successive stages of postnatal development that flank the septation period for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates from three different litters were prepared for each time point.
