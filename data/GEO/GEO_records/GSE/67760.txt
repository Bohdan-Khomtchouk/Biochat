TITLE
Expression profile of human lymphatic endothelial cells in the presence or absence of TAZ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to study the transcriptional networks controlled by TAZ in human lymphatic endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Human lymphatic endothelial cells were seeded on plastic coated with 3Âµg/cm2 fibronectin, transfected with control or TAZ siRNAs. RNA were collected 48 hours post-transfection from confluent cells. RNA were amplified and hybridized on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.  The experiment was run twice independently, using each time a different siRNA to knockdown FOXC2, as previously described (Sabine et al, 2012, Dev Cell).
