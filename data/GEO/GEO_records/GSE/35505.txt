TITLE
Developmental characterization of the microRNAs-specific C. elegans Argonautes alg-1 and alg-2

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This study analyzes miRNA association with ALG-1 and ALG-2 in different stages during larval development of C. elegans

DESIGN
Staged animals (L1, L2, L3, L4) - the alg-2 mutant expressing tagged-ALG-2, alg-1 mutant, and wild type controls - were lysed.  ALG-1 IP or ALG-2 (GFP) IP was performed using tags from all four samples at all four timepoints. Small RNAs were released from antibodies and 5' end-labelled with AlexaFluor532. Labelled RNA was hybridized to a custom microRNA microarray platform to quantify miRNA content.
