TITLE
Adaptation of Propionibacterium freudenreichii to the colon environment

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium freudenreichii

SUMMARY
Mechanisms allowing P. freudenreichii adaptation to digestive stresses have been only studied in vitro so far. Our aim was therefore to study P. freudenreichii metabolic adaptation to intra-colonic conditions in situ. We maintained a pure culture of P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA1, contained in a dialysis bag, within the colon of vigilant piglets during 24 hours. A transcriptomic analysis identified the metabolic pathways induced by this environment, in comparison with control propionibacteria maintained in spent culture medium.

DESIGN
12 cutures in a dialysis bag in the colon of piglets during 24H compared to 12 cultures propionibacteria maintained in spent culture medium
