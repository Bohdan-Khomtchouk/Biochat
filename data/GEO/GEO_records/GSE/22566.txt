TITLE
Protein production by Aspergillus oryzae

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae is an important microbial cell factory for industrial production of useful enzymes, such as α-amylase. In order to optimize the industrial enzyme  production process, there is a need to understand fundamental processes underlying protein production, here under how protein production links to metabolism through global regulatory  structures. In this study, two α-amylase-producing strains of A. oryzae, a wild type strain and a transformant strain containing additional copies of the α-amylase gene, were characterized  at a systematic level. Based on integrated analysis of ome-data together with genome-scale metabolic network and flux calculation, we identified key genes, key enzymes, key proteins,  and key metabolites involved in the processes of protein synthesis and secretion, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism that can be the potential targets for improving  industrial protein production. Keywords: Two Aspergillus oryzae strains and two different carbon sources
