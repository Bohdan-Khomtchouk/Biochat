TITLE
Genome analysis of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from different regions of the same chicken

ORGANISM
Campylobacter coli ; Campylobacter jejuni ; Campylobacter jejuni RM1221

SUMMARY
The gut of chicken is mostly colonised with Campylobacter jejuni and with 100 fold less C. coli. The competitive ability of C. coli OR12 over C. jejuni OR1 has been examined in experimental broiler chickens following the observation that C. coli replaced an established C. jejuni intestinal colonisation within commercial chicken flocks reared outdoors (El-Shibiny, A., Connerton, P.L., Connerton, I.F., 2005. Enumeration and diversity of campylobacters and bacteriophages isolated during the rearing cycles of free-range and organic chickens. Applied Environmental Microbiology. 71, 1259-1266).

DESIGN
Five independent DNA preps of C. jejuni RM1221 were labelled with Cy 5 independently and they were mixed well which was used as the control. OR1 and OR12 were labelled with Cy 3 independently and equal concentration of the control and sample DNA were used for hybridisation. Three biological replicates were done for each slide. The supplementary file (linked at the foot of this record) represents the averaged normalised values for each experimental condition (3replicates/experimental condition).
