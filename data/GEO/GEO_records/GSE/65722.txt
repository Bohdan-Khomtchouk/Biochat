TITLE
Rosemary polyphenols induce unfolded protein response and changes in cholesterol metabolism in colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several studies have demonstrated that rosemary polyphenols exert changes in the lipid metabolism in adipose and hepatic cells. However, limited information is available about their effect on the lipids metabolism in cancer cells. To improve our limited knowledge on this issue, a Foodomics approach is applied to study the effects of a polyphenol-enriched supercritical rosemary extract and carnosic acid on the transcriptome and cholesterol metabolism in HT-29 colon cancer cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from HT-29 colon cancer cells untreated or treated with rosemary extract and carnosic acid for 24 hours. Three biological replicates were included in the experiment.
