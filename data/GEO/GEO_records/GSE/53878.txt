TITLE
Localization of histone H3 and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation at the start of pre-meiotic S phase

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip analysis of histone H3 and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in cells induced to undergo synchronous meiosis after growth in nitrogen-rich conditions or after nitrogen depletion.

DESIGN
Comparison of H3 and H3k4Me3 in diploid pat1-114 cells grown in -N and +N conditions.
