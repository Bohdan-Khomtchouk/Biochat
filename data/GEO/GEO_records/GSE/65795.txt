TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of microRNA expression in neonatal cardiovascular progenitors before and after 7 Days of simulated microgravity.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cardiovascular progenitors were isolated from neonatal ( < 1 month old) atrial tissue and cloned by single cell dilution.  MicroRNA expression in neonatal cardiovascular progenitor cell (CPC) clones was compared before and after exposure to simulated microgravity using sabiosciences cell development & differentiation miRNA PCR array.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profiling by RT-PCR,  3 neonatal cardiac progenitor cell clones were run separately and fold changes were then pooled and compared before and after simulated microgravity exposure.
