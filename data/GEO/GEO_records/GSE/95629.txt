TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of β-cat lox(ex3) (Ctrl) mouse and β-cat lox(ex3);Nex-Cre (β-cat overexpression, β-cat Ovp) mouse Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq to sequence the transcriptomes of β-cat lox(ex3) (Ctrl) and β-cat lox(ex3);Nex-Cre (β-cat Ovp) mice, we did not find significant change in the expression level of classical Wnt target genes.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 14-day old β-cat lox(ex3) (Ctrl) and β-cat lox(ex3);Nex-Cre (β-cat Ovp) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq.

PLATFORM
