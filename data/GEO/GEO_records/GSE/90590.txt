TITLE
Induction of SFTPC+ cells from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CPMhigh progenitor cells by forming alveolar organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on P0 SFTPC+ cells, P0 SFTPC- cells and CPMhigh progenitor cells derived form human induced pluripotent stem cells (B2-3 SFTPC-GFP reporter hiPSCs), respectively.

DESIGN
CPMhigh progenitor cells stepwisely induced from hiPSCs were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on day 21. Isolated CPMhigh cells were cocultured with human fetal lung fibroblasts forming alveolar organoids (AOs). P0 SFTPC+ cells and P0 SFTPC- cells were isolated from AOs on Day 35.
