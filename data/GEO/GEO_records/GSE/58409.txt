TITLE
Genomewide analysis of the human p53 transcriptional network unveils a lncRNA tumor suppressor signature (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of high-throughput sequencing to performed the p53 regulated trancriptome in HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with the DNA damage 5FU. To study the direct targets of p53 we performed ChIP-seq to deterrmined the p53 biding sites and associated with the expression levels. With this study we identified the new genomic regions regulated by p53 and with special attention in those regions that are significally expressed by DNA damage and and are non- coding.

DESIGN
HCT116 p53 wt cell transfected with the ASO-SC, ASO lncRNA-1 and ASO unassigned-1 for depletion of this new lncRNAs  and treated with the DNA damage drug 5FU for 12h  were analyzed in the affimetrix platform HTA2.
