TITLE
Deoxynivalenol affects the gene expression of A549 lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deoxynivalenol (DON) is an important Fusarium toxin of concern for food safety. The inhalation of powder contaminated with deoxynivalenol is possible and may cause lung toxicity. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profile of A549 cells treated with 0.2 microg/mL deoxynivalenol by microarray analysis. In total, 16 genes and 5 noncoding RNAs were significantly affected by deoxynivalenol treatment.

DESIGN
4 samples; 2 samples from nontreated cells and other 2 samples from 0.2 microg/mL DON-treated cells for 24 hours
