TITLE
Evasion of Mucosal Defenses During Aeromonas hydrophila Infection of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus puncatus) Skin

ORGANISM
Ictalurus punctatus

SUMMARY
The mucosal surfaces of fish serve as the first-line of defense against the myriad of aquatic pathogens present in the aquatic environment. The immune repertoire functioning at these interfaces is still poorly understood. The skin, in particular, must process signals from several fronts, sensing and integrating environmental, nutritional, social, and health cues. Pathogen invasion can disrupt this delicate homeostasis with profound impacts on signaling throughout the organism. Here, we investigated the transcriptional effects of virulent A. hydrophila infection in channel catfish skin, Ictalurus punctatus. We utilized an 8X60K Agilent microarray to examine gene expression profiles at critical early timepoints following challengeâ€”2 h, 8 h, and 12 h. Expression of a total of 2,168 unique genes was significantly perturbed during at least one timepoint. We observed dysregulation of a number of genes involved in antioxidant, cytoskeletal, immune, junctional, and nervous system pathways.  In particular, A. hydrophila infection rapidly altered a number potentially critical lectins, chemokines, interleukins, and other mucosal factors in a manner predicted to enhance its ability to adhere and invade the catfish host.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. infected skin. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 infected replicates. 3 timepoints.
