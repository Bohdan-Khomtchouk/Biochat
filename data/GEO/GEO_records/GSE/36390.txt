TITLE
Comparison of expression microarray data and somatic mutation signature in primary HCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. We sequenced and analyzed the whole genomes of primary HCCs. To examine the influence of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) on somatic substitution patterns in HCC, we performed expression microarrays analysis and compared gene expression levels and the number of substitutions in 7 HCCs.

DESIGN
Seven primary HCC were analyzed and compared with somatic substituion numbers.
