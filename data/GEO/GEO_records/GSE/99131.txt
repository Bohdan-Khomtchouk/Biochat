TITLE
The role of caveolin-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma arising from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing. However, the molecular feature of this disease is unclear. We aim to identify an important factor in HCC developing from NAFLD (NAFLD-HCC) and to elucidate its function. Methods: Since microarray analysis using resected HCC specimens identified caveolin (CAV) -1 and -2, endocytosis-mediating proteins, as NAFLD-HCC-related genes, CAV mRNA levels in NAFLD-HCC and HCC arising from hepatitis C-infected liver (HCV-HCC) (each n=10) were examined by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation / apoptosis and intracellular lipid composition were assessed in three human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, HLE, and HuH-7) in the absence or presence of extracellular supplementation with fatty acid. The effects of CAV-knockdown were also examined. Results: CAV-1 and -2 mRNA levels were higher in NAFLD-HCC than in HCV-HCC. HLE alone expressed abundant CAV mRNA. All cell lines showed decreased cell proliferation in the presence of saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid and stearic acid). In the presence of mono-unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid: OA), CAV-rich HLE alone proliferated well, although CAV-null HepG2 showed attenuated cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Significant increase of OA-containing triglyceride was observed after OA supplementation in HLE and HepG2. OA-induced increased proliferation in HLE was cancelled by CAV-1-knockdown. OA-including ceramide, a strong apoptosis inducer, was lower in HLE than in HepG2 and CAV-1-knockdown HLE. Conclusions: CAV-1 plays an important role in not only OA uptake but also apoptosis prevention by decreasing OA-containing ceramide. NAFLD-HCC would utilize CAV-1 to survive fatty acid-rich environment.

DESIGN
The aim of this study is to identify an important factor in HCC developing from NAFLD (NAFLD-HCC) and to elucidate its function. Human HCC tissues and the adjacent non-HCC tissues were separately excised from the resected specimens from 3 NAFLD-HCC patients and 3 patients with HCC arising from hepatitis C (HCV-HCC). Samples were snap-frozen with RNA later (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80â„ƒ. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen resected sample using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The intensity and quantity of total RNA was assessed with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The gene expression profile of HCV-HCC and NAFLD-HCC was determined by Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0 ST array.
