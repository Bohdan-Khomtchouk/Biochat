TITLE
Gene Expression Test for Operational Renal Allograft Tolerance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic Analysis of more than 400 patients from multi-center transplant programs and clinical trials provides a non-invasive QPCR based gene expression test for operational renal allograft tolerance

DESIGN
3 group comparison of blood from TOL, CAN and Non-transplant healthy controls (HD) allografts. Biological replicates: 16 TOL, 10 CAN and 5 HC
