SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to globally identify miRNA/siRNA cleavage sites on mRNAs in Arabidopsis wild type and ago1-27 mutant.

DESIGN
Degradome-seq was performed using Arabidopsis wild type and ago1-27 mutant seedlings. Three biological replicates were conducted for each genotype.

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
