TITLE
50K SNP Copy Number Analysis of Ovarian Carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide copy number variation was measured in primary tumours of the ovary, Fallopian tube and peritoneum. A well-defined subset of advanced-stage serous tumors was then used to relate CNV to primary resistance to treatment. Analysis is described in: Etemadmoghadam, D., et al. (2009). " Integrated genome-wide DNA copy number and expression analysis identifies distinct mechanisms of primary chemoresistance in ovarian carcinomas. " Clin Cancer Res 15(4): 1417-27.

DESIGN
118 needle-dissected or whole tumours ( > 80% tumour content) were analysed.
