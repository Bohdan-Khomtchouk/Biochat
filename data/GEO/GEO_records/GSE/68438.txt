TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of cucumber mitogen activated protein kinase cascade genes in various tissues

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
We used Bio-Rad laboratories, lnc. PCR assay panel to analyze expression levels of MAPK genes in various tissues or organs. Cucumber plants of the ‘Jinyan No.4’ cultivar were reared in growth chambers at 28 ± 1 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark and light intensity of 400 μmol m−2 s−1. The roots, leaves, stems, female flower buds (approximately 3 d before anthesis), male flower buds (approximately 1.0 cm in length), and fruits (10 d after pollination) were collected from flowering plants for tissue expression analysis.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to gain insight into the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of 58 MAPK cascade genes in cucumber.
