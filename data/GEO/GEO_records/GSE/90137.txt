TITLE
Identification of potential target neuronal genes of class I histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are believed to have positive effects on neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis in adult brain. However, the downstream targets of class I HDAC inhibitor treatment in neurons are fully unclear. Although class I HDAC inhibitors are thought to broadly promote transcription of many neuronal genes through enhancement of histone acetylation, it is very interesting that the gene set might include as yet unidentified genes that are essential for neuronal survival and function. To identify novel target genes of class I HDAC inhibitor treatment, we screened transcripts of neuronal cultures with microarray using valproate acid.

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide comparison of gene expression in mouse primary cerebral cell culture treated with 1 mM valproate acid relative to DMSO control. n = 1.
