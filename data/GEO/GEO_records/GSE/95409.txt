TITLE
Genomic characterization of murine monocytes reveals C/EBPb dependence of Ly6C-cells [ChIP data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin status of murine blood Ly6C+ and Ly6C- monocytes indicates that both population share K4me3 marks (promoters) while Ly6C- monocytes establish de novo enhancers (K4me1, K4me2) during differentiation

DESIGN
Monocytes were isolated from murine blood with CD115 biotin MACS and subsequently stained. The cells were fixed and afterwards FACS sorted. 20.000-50.000 monocytes were sorted from each population and analyzed for K4me1, K4me2, K4me3 and K27ac in duplicates (except Ly6Cint monocytes)
