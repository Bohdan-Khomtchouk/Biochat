TITLE
CUC2 mutant tissues vs. wild type cuc2-Gnp07_Regeneome_cuc2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp07_regeneome_cuc2 - cuc2 - CUC2 is expressed in meristem. It permits to create organs boundaries. It is also expressed in leave margins. Is there a mecanism meristem like in leave margins? - To compare wt and cuc2 leaf margins. And compare teeth and hollow inside the arabidopsis leaf margin.

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - tissue comparison,wt vs mutant comparison

PLATFORM
