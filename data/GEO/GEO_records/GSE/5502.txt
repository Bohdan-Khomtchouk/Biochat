TITLE
Basal Cell Carcinoma Tumor-derived Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dataset contains samples that are all fibroblast cells that have been cultured from fresh human tissue.  Fibroblasts were derived either from tumor (basal cell carcinoma) or non-tumor (control) tissue.  Samples were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, glutamine, pen/strep and passaged for 4 passages before RNA harvest was performed using Invitrogen FastTrack.  Reference channel RNA is the same for each array in the dataset and is Stratagene Universal Reference RNA.  Hybridizations were performed for 14-18 hours at 65 C.  Scanning was performed using AxonScanner and data were analyzed using GenePix 3.0. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Disease State: Tumor-derived Keywords: Logical Set
