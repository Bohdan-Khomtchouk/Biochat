TITLE
L1CAM knockdown significantly reduces metastasis in a xenograft model of human melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As L1CAM expression is associated with metastasis in melanoma patients, it could be a target for the combination therapies. We investigated the functional role of L1CAM  in melanoma metastasis by the use of a xenograft model of human melanoma in mice using RNAi mediated L1CAM knockdown melanoma cells.

DESIGN
Human melanoma cells (cell lines MeWo and MV3) with (L1CAM) and without (luc) shRNA mediated L1CAM knockdown were transplanted subcutaneously into scid mice. Total RNA was prepared from subcutaneous tumors.
