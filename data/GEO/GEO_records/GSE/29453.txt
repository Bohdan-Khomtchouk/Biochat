TITLE
Expression data from miR-223KO and miR-223WT bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total bone marrow (BM) from miR-223 knockout (mir-223-/-) and wildtype (miR-223+/+) mice 21 was extracted, prestimulated for 2 days. Then, the BM cells were simultaneously cotransduced with MSCV-Hoxa9-pgk-neomycin and a MSCV-Meis1-IRES-YFP by co-cultivation with irradiated (4,000 cGy) viral producers. HoxA9-Meis1 transduced cells were sorted for YFP expression and continuously selected with neomycin (1.4 mg/ml). Processing of the pre-miRNA through Dicer1 generates a miRNA duplex, consisting of a miRNA and miRNA* strand. Despite the general view that miRNA*s have no functional role, we further investigated miRNA* species in 10 deep sequencing libraries from mouse and human tissue. Comparing miRNA/miRNA* ratios across the miRNA sequence libraries revealed that 50% of the investigated miRNA duplexes exhibit a highly dominant strand. Conversely, 10% of miRNA duplexes show a comparable expression of both strands, while the remaining 40% exhibit variable ratios across the examined libraries as exemplified by miR-223/miR-223* in murine and human cell lines. Functional analyses revealed a regulatory role for miR-223* in myeloid progenitor cells, implying an active role for both arms of the miR-223 duplex. This was further underscored by the demonstration that miR-223 and miR-223* target the IGF1R/PIK3 axis and that high miR-223* levels associate with increased overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Thus, we found a supporting role for miR-223* in differentiating myeloid cells in normal as well as the leukemic cell state. The fact that the miR-223 duplex acts through both arms extends the complexity of miRNA-directed gene regulation of this myeloid key miRNA.
