TITLE
Effects of co-culture of  Endothelial Cells with Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study designed to explore the effects of endothelial cell/MSC co-culture on individual gene expression profile of each cell type

DESIGN
4 independent samples from each of 4 groups: MSCs cultured alone; Pulmonary endothelial cells cultured alone; MSCs co-cultured with PECs then FACS separated; PECs co-cultured with MSCs then FACS separated
