TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SATB1 target genes in human T helper cells: ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a global chromatin organizer and a transcription factor induced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) during the early T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of SATB1 in T helper cell differentiation by performing ChIP-on-chip analysis of human cord blood CD4+ T cells cultured in Th1 and Th2 conditions. These results were combined with gene expression profiling results from human differentiating Th cells in which expression of SATB1 was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi).Our results indicate that SATB1 regulates and is bound to sixty genes in primary human CD4+ T cells, including several IL-12 and/or IL-4 regulated factors, suggesting a role in the development or function of Th subtypes.

DESIGN
Cross-linked chromatin obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from cord blood cultured in Th1 and Th2 conditions for 24 h was immunoprecipitated with anti-SATB1 antibody.
