TITLE
Deadenylated versus polyadenylated RNAs in bovine immature oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
RNA separation in function of the poly(A) tail length: A- (A≤50) and A150 (A≥150) from 200 immature oocytes (at the germinal vesicle stage, GV) in quadruplicates

DESIGN
deadenylated and polyadenylated from each four pools of 200 immature oocytes were hybridized with a 2-color microarray design and one replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
