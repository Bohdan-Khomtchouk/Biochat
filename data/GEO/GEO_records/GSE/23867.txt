TITLE
Epigenetic profile of the Plasmodium falciparum intraerythrocytic cycle

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
This experiment characterizes the localisation of H2A.Z, H3K9ac and H3K4me3 in the epigenome of the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum at 4 different stages of intraerythrocytic development.

DESIGN
Examination of H2A.Z, H3K9ac, H3K4me3 and mono-nucleosomal input in 3D7 strain at 4 different stages and H2A in 3D7 strain at 1 stage using native ChIP-seq
