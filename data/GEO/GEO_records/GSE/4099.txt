TITLE
Single stranded DNA formation during S phase in the presence of hydroxyurea in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have developed a method to analyze single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation on a genomic scale by using microarrays.  Using this technique we have assessed the location and the amount of ssDNA in S. cerevisiae during DNA replication.  We have observed that when replication is impeded by hydroxyurea, ssDNA formation can be detected in both wild type and the checkpoint-deficient rad53 cells.  However, while wild type cells showed ssDNA formation at only a subset of origins, rad53 cells formed ssDNA at virtually all known origins.  Moreover, in rad53 cells the ssDNA regions did not expand over time, presumably due to collapsed replication forks.  We also applied this method to map origins in S. pombe, taking advantage of the conserved replication checkpoint function by Cds1, the homolog of Rad53 in S. pombe. Keywords: ssDNA, HU, replication, time course
