TITLE
Discover preclinical biomarkers of hepatotoxicity: Acetaminophen and Carbon tetrachloride

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Preclinical biomarkers useful for identification of idiosyncratic drugs have not been identified.  It is hypothesized that patterns of transcript expression for the hepatotoxicants, including classical and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants, are similar and the patterns differ from those of non-hepatotoxicants. This experiment is part of the biomarkers study, and focus on two clasical hepatotoxicants: Acetaminophen and Carbon tetrachloride. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify liver gene expression changes induced by hepatotoxicants. For the same animal, urinary microRNA profiling were analyzed. APAP and CCl4 both significantly increased the urinary levels of 44 and 28 miRNAs, respectively.  In addition, 10 of the increased miRNAs were in common between APAP and CCl4.  Computational analysis was used to predict target genes of the 10 shared hepatotoxicant-induced miRNAs.  From the same animals, liver gene expression profiling was performed using whole genome microarrays.  Eight putative target genes were found to be significantly altered in the liver of APAP and CCl4 treated animals.

DESIGN
Acetaminophen induced liver gene expression changes in rats (Six to seven week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, provided by the US Food and Drug Administration National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) breeding colonies, were used for the study.) were measured at 6 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days after exposure to doses of 0, 100 and 1250 mg/kg.  Carbon tetrachloride induced liver gene expression changes in rats were measured at 6 hours, 24 hours and 3 days after exposure to doses of 0, 50 and 2000 mg/kg. Each group has at least 4 animals, total of 96 samples.
