TITLE
USU101 gene content determined by array CGH

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
The monkey infecting Helicobacter pylori strain USU101 used in a long term infection of macaques with and without the dietary carcinogen ENNG was analyzed for gene content compared to the sequenced strains 26695 and J99

DESIGN
We performed array CGH using two microarrays to analyze the gene content of the starting strain (USU101) used for the monkey infection experiment (GSE60405). The ENNG information is not relevant.
