TITLE
RNA-seq analysis revealed novel genes and signaling pathway associated with disease resistance to avian influenza virus infection in chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Three-week-old chickens were inoculated with low pathogenic H5N3 AIV and tissues were harvested 4 d pos tinoculation. Four lung cDNA libraries (1 library each for infected and noninfected Leghorn, and infected and noninfected Fayoumi) were prepared and sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyzer II, which yielded a total of 116 million, 75-bp single-end reads.Â 

DESIGN
The objective of this study was to identify genes and signal pathways associated with resistance to AIV infection in 2 genetically distinct highly inbred chicken lines (Fayoumi, relatively resistant to AIV infection, and Leghorn, susceptible to AIV infection).

PLATFORM
GPL9385 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Gallus gallus)
