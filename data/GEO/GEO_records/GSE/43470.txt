TITLE
Genomic landscape of somatic alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer and esophageal cancer are the 2nd and 6th leading causes of cancer death worldwide. We analyzed DNA copy numbers for 73 ESCC (43 SNP5.0 and 30 500K SNP) with the Affymetrix SNP arrays .  Our analyses implicated potential driver mutations involving the following genes: mutations in TP53, BRCA2, NOTCH2, CTNNB1, and LEPREL2; amplification of CCND1, FGF3/4/19, and MYC; and deletion of CDKN2A/B.
