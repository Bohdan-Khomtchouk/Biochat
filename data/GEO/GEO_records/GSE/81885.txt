Impact of Runx3 deficiency on mature CD8 T cell responses [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control and Runx3-deficient CD8 effector T cells

DESIGN
Control mice or those are deficient for Runx3 transcription factors (deleted by CD2-Cre) were crossed to P14 TCR transgene, and naive P14 CD8 T cells were adoptively tranferred into congenic recipient mice followed by infection with LCMV armstrong. Four days later, the donor-derived CD8 effector T cells were sorted for the KLRG1 high and IL-7Ra low phenotype subset. The sorted cells were used for RNAseq analysis.
