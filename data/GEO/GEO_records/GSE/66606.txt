TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Calu-6 lung cancer cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and LAPTM4B-specific siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently characterized the adjacent airway field of cancerization in NSCLC by whole transcriptome expression analysis and demonstrated that lysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta (LAPTM4B) was an elevated field cancerization marker in NSCLCs and in adjacent but not in distant normal-appearing airways. We also found that LAPTM4B was up-regulated in NSCLCs compared to normal lung and promoted anchorage-dependent growth of lung cancer cells. Previous reports suggested that LAPTM4B is activated following metabolic and genotixc stress. The precise role of LAPTM4B in lung cancer cell survival and NSCLC pathogenesis is still elusive.

DESIGN
In the present study we sought to examine how LAPTM4B expression levels impact downstream expression profiles and cell signaling in order to gain better insights into the function of this putative oncogene in lung cancer. Calu-6 lung cancer cells were transfected with SMARTpool (Dharmacon)control/scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting LAPTM4B. Following transfection, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Three independent transfections for each condition were performed representing three biological replicates per condition (total number of samples = 12). RNA interference-mediated knock-down of LAPTM4B in samples was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was profiled using the Human Gene 1.0 ST platform.
