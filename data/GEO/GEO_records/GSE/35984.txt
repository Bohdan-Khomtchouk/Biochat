TITLE
Expression data of one-week-old rice seedlings exposed to Pi-deficient solution for 6, 24, 48, 72 hours

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of one-week-old rice seedlings exposed to Pi-deficient solution for 6, 24, 48, 72 hours were monitored by microarray that contains approximately 60,000 rice clones (Affymetrix GeneChip). The probes were prepared from RNAs isolated from rice seedlings exposed to Pi-deficient solution for 6, 24, 48, 72 hours, respectively, and those non-treated controls. For hybridization, two biological replicates were used to extract RNAs from different batches of plants.

DESIGN
Rice seedlings were exposed to low phosphate for 6h, 24h, 48h and 72 h, respectively. The Pi-inducible and Pi-repressive genes were taken as the expression ratio (treatment relative to control) greater and less than 2-fold, respectively
