TITLE
Identification of preoptic sleep-promoting neurons based on projection target

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus is known to be crucial for sleep generation, but the spatial intermingling of sleep- and wake-promoting neurons makes it difficult to dissect the sleep control circuit. Here we identified a population of POA sleep-promoting neurons based on their projection target. Using a lentivirus for retrograde labeling with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) followed by optogenetic manipulation and recording, we found that the POA GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are both sleep active and sleep promoting. Cell type- and projection-specific rabies tracing revealed the presynaptic inputs to these neurons, including an amygdala GABAergic input that promotes wakefulness. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identified several molecular markers for these neurons, and optogenetic activation of the POA neurons labeled by these markers confirmed their sleep-promoting effects. Together, these findings define a group of sleep-promoting neurons functionally, anatomically, and genetically.
