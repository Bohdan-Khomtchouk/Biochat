TITLE
Characterization of LncRNA BC012900 among long non-coding RNAs differentially expressed in ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this report, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the expression of  ~17000 lncRNAs on 60 colonic samplesin colon tissues from patients with IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious colitis and healthy controls. We also explored the possibility of using cRNAs as biomarkers distinguish active UC from normal.  To investigate the mechanism offunctional role these IBD-associated lncRNAs in the development of IBD, we  then focused on a ncRNA highlyexpressed in the UC-associated lncRNAactive UC, BC012900.  We , to characterized its cellular localization, expression regulation and biological function. We . We found that BC012900 and its adjacent gene, dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) are functionally distinct, with BC012900 modulating. Overexpression of BC012900 resulted in usceptibility  to apoptosis. Our study provides the first evidence that lncRNAs may play potential roles in development and persistence of active UC.

DESIGN
LncRNAs microarray and quantitative RT-PCR were performed on 60 sigmoid biopsies from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and relevant controls.
