TITLE
Stationary phase - ypl230w mutant and wildtype

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type and ypl230w mutant under stationary phase. Cultures were grown to OD600 of 0.27 (Ypl230w mutants) and 0.4 (congenic wild-type; DBY8778), at which point time zero samples were collected.  Samples were further collected at 2 (or 3), 5, 7, 9, and 24 hours. Experimental samples were used to generate Cy5-labeled cDNA probes, whereas mRNA reference pools extracted from cultures of the respective strains grown to early log phase under normal conditions, were used to generate Cy3-labeled cDNA probes.  Cy5- and Cy3-labeled probes were hybridized together to microarrays printed with PCR-amplified fragments, representing 6280 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs. Keywords: time-course
