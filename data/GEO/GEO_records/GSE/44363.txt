TITLE
Transcriptomic modulation by adenosine 2A receptors in normal and endotoxemic myocardium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of venticular myocardium from adenosine 2A receptors (A2AR) knockouts following LPS stimulation. Results provide insight into the molecular components of A2AR mediated protection, but also reveal pathogenetic components of endotoxemic myocarditis as a result of LPS exposure. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic A2AR activity exerts limited transcriptional effects in unstressed heart, modifying G-coupled cAMP/PKA signal paths. LPS-dependent injury and dysfunction is associated with profound up-regulation of inflammatory/immune processes, fibrotic and cell death paths, and NF-kB, Erk/MAPK and JAK/Stat signaling, with shifts in multiple determinants of cardiac contraction and survival. Intrinsic A2AR activity modulates key aspects of these inflammatory responses, involving MAPK, JAK/Stat and NF-kB signaling

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from adenosine 2A receptor knockout or wild-type murine ventricular myocardium that were treated for 24 hours with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (n=4/group).
