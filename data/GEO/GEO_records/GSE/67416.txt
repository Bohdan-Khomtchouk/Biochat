TITLE
Expression data from shROR HT29 and AGS cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide cDNA array from HT29,HT29-shROR,HT29-Mock, AGS, AGS-shROR, AGS-Mock cells We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and  identified significantly changed genes after ROR depletion.

DESIGN
HT29,HT29-shROR, HT29-Mock, AGS, AGS-shROR, AGS-Mock cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
