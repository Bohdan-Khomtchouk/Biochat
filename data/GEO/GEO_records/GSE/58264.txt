TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by light in the fungus Mucor circinelloides

ORGANISM
Mucor circinelloides

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wild-type strain (R7B) of the fungus Mucor circinelloides comparing control mycelia grown for 18 hours in the dark with mycelia grown in the same conditions and illuminated with white light for 20 min. Goal was to identify genes regulated by a pulse of white light.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, light-induced mycelia vs. dark-grown mycelia. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 light-induced replicates.
