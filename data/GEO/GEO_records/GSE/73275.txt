TITLE
The effect of knocking down miR-27b on DIV14 mouse cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of reducing miR-27b levels on genome-wide expression in cortical neurons and identify potential targets of miR-27b, we generated dissociated cortical neuron cultures and treated them with lentivirus to knock down miR-27b.

DESIGN
2 treatment conditions (control lentivirus or lentivirus to knock down miR-27b); 3 neuronal preparations of dissociated mouse cortical neurons; total of 6 samples

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
