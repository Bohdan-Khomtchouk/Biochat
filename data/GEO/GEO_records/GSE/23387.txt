TITLE
Nickel Chloride (NiCl2) effect on human T cells from whole blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated T cells treated with or without nickel chloride. Nickel is the most important contact allergen in the general population of the industrialized world. Results provide insight into the biological effects of nickel on human CD3+ T cells.

DESIGN
We obtained mRNA of purified human CD3+ T cells from 3 different donors that were treated with or without 1000 Î¼M nickel chloride for 1 h and then stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 6 h.
