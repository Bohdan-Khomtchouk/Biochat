TITLE
Gene expression changes by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene in human bulge-derived keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the epidermis, keratinocytes are involved in physical and first-line immune protection of the host. In this work, we analyzed molecular responses after the addition of contact sensitizers, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) using cultured human keratinocytes from the bulge region of a plucked hair follicle (bulge-derived keratinocytes; BDKs) in comparison with neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes NHEK and human monocytic leukemia THP-1. The changes in gene expression by the treatment of DNCB in BDKs were different from those in THP-1. Many genes orchestrating keratinocyte differentiation, which interact TGF-Î² and BMP signaling pathway, were significantly up-regulated in response to DNCB. Keywords: Comparison analysis of gene expression changes by the treatment of DNCB

DESIGN
three cell strains composed of four samples; two BDKs established from different donors, NHEK, and THP-1. One replicate per array.
