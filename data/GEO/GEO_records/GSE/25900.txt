TITLE
Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in mice transduced in utero with feline immunodeficiency virus-based vectors (CGH)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fetal mice (16 days gestation) were administered FIV-based lentiviral viral particles containing the gene encoding EGFP.  Six liver tumors developed in three mice (1 male, 2 females) between the ages of 273 and 484 days, each mouse developed 2 tumors. These tumors and non-tumorous liver tissue from the same animals were harvested and aCGH was performed on genomic DNA extracted from these samples. We were interested in investigating the link between lentiviral integration and chromosomal aberrations.

DESIGN
Two tumors from each mouse (1 male, 2 females) were each compared to non-tumorous tissue surrounding the tumors.
