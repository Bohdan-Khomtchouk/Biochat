TITLE
Analysis of genome wide H3K9me3 levels in control and ORCA knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Origin Recognition Complex Associated (ORCA) associates with repressive chromatin environments. We carried out H3K9me3 ChIP-seq to determine the affect of ORCA's loss on this repressive mark. Towards this end, we cultured U2OS osteosarcoma cells, performed control and ORCA knockdowns using siRNAs and then carried out H3K9me3 ChIP-seq to determine the regions in the genome which get affected upon ORCA knockdown.

DESIGN
Examination of the levels of H3K9me3 in control and ORCA knockdown cells
