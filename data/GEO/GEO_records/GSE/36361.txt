TITLE
Genome-wide maps of PRR5 binding loci in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PRR5 transcription factor acts in the circadian clock system. To elucidate bound genes by PRR5, Chimeric protein FLAG-PRR5-GFP, was expressed under PRR5 promoter in Col-0 (PRR5pro:FLAG-PRR5-GFP/prr5). ChIP was performed using anti-GFP antibody (ab290;Abcam), which was bound to Dynabeads Protein G (100-03D;Life technologies), and ChIP DNA and input DNA were analyzed by Illumina GA II.

DESIGN
ChIP and input sequence reads were compared to find out PRR5 binding sites
