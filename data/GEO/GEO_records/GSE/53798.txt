TITLE
Expression data from malignant human B-cell cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used global gene expression profiles from human B-cell cell lines to generate gene expression signatures for prediction of response to the drugs cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or vincristine. The signatures were validated in two publicly available clinical cohorts.

DESIGN
Global gene expression data combined with dose response experiments for prediction of chemoresistance
