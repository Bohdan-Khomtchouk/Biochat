TITLE
Gene expression in cellular compartments of Aplysia sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Aplysia californica

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling is used to compare ESTs found in cell bodies and processes of Aplysia sensory neurons RNA samples derived from cell bodies or processes of Aplysia single cultured sensory neurons were hybridized to custom Aplysia EST microarrays.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment; four biological replicates for each condition were reciprocally hybridized on each two-color array
