TITLE
Profiling Genome-wide Chromatin Methylation with Engineered Posttranslation Apparatus within Living Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have engineered the chromatin-modifying apparatus and formulated a novel technology, termed Clickable Chromatin Enrichment with parallel DNA sequencing (CliEn-seq), to probe genome-wide chromatin modification within living cells.

DESIGN
Examine (E)-hex-2-en-5-ynylation mediated by engineered G9a Y1154A and GLP1 Y1211A in HEK293T cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
