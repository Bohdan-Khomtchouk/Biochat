TITLE
ThERF1 regulates its target genes via binding a novel cis-acting element in response to salt stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To reveal the regulatory network of ThERF1 in response to abiotic stress, we have employed an Agilent Arabidopsis gene expression microarray to study the expression profile changes between Wild-type and transgenic plants overexpressing ThERF1 under salt stress. A total of 154 and 307 differentially expressed genes with p-value < 0.05 and ≥ 2-fold change were significantly up- and down- regulated in ThERF1-transformed plants under salt stress treatment.

DESIGN
Four-week-old seedlings of Wild-type and ThERF1-transformed Arabidopsis plants treated with 120 mM NaCl for 6 h were immediately harvested for RNA isolation. The Agilent Arabidopsis (V4) gene expression microarray (4× 44K, Design ID: 021169) was employed to compare the gene expression profiles of Wild-type and transgenic plants with three independent biological replicates.
