TITLE
Effect of Rag1 mutation on kidney immune response to Poly I:C

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We used Rag1 mutant fish vs Wild type fish to analyze the kidney transcriptomic modulation and determine how the mutation affects the general gene transcription (without stimuli) in fish, but also the immune response against Poly I:C.

DESIGN
Healthy fish (Wild type and Rag1-/- mutants) were intraperitoneally injected with 10 Î¼g of pure Poly I:C (Sigma) or PBS and kidneys were sampled and pooled at 24 hours post injection.
