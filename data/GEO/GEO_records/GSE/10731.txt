TITLE
Microarray Based Analysis of the Developing Sweet Orange Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Using a custom microarray platform, we examined expression of 366 genes in leaf, two peel tissues, juice sac, and whole fruit during various developmental stages of Washington Navel orange fruit (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck). 366 genes were chosen from Citrus EST libraries by in-silico analysis method. Keywords: time course and tissue comparison

DESIGN
Study to compare gene expression between peel layers and over time as fruit matured. Samples taken from leaf tissue, whole fruit at 24 and 38 days after full bloom (DAFB), and from albedo and flavedo layers of the peel at 80 and 165 DAFB, and flavedo from mature fruit at 220 DAFB. In all cases except one, there were three technical replicates hybridized for each Sample simultaneously.
