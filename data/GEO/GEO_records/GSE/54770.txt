TITLE
Genome-wide Profiling of SRC-2 (NCOA2) binding in mouse prostate [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using genetically engineered mice, overexpressing SRC-2, specifically in the prostate epithelium of PTEN heterozygous mice accelerates PTEN mutation induce tumor progression and develops a metastasis-prone cancer. Here we used ChIP-Seq analysis to identify genome-wide SRC-2 binding sites in mouse prostate.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide SRC-2 binding in mouse prostate by ChIP-seq analysis.  Samples were collected from pooled dorsal-lateral prostates of 7 months old-PTEN flox/+; Rosa26-SRC-2 OE/+ mice.  Flash frozen tissues were then sent to Active Motif, Inc. for chromatin extraction and followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-SRC-2 antibody (A300-346A, Bethyl Lab., Inc.).
