TITLE
Cell cycle promoter tiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discover novel transcriptional units upstream of cell cycle genes Transcription of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within gene regulatory elements can modulate gene activity in response to external stimuli, but the scope and functions of such noncoding transcription are not known.  Here we use an ultra-high density array that tiles the promoters of 56 cell cycle genes to interrogate 108 samples representing diverse perturbations.  We identify 216 transcribed regions that encode putative lncRNAs--many of which have RT-PCR-validated periodic expression during the cell cycle, show altered expression in human cancers, and are regulated in expression by specific oncogenic stimuli, stem cell differentiation, or DNA damage.
