TITLE
IM001: Influenza A/VN/1203/04 infection of C57Bl/6 mouse model - Data from 3 viral doses at 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to perform transcriptomic analysis on C57Bl/6 mice infected with different doses of Influenza A/VN/1203/04 at 4 different days post infection.

DESIGN
Twenty-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected by intranasal instillation of 10^2, 10^3 or 10^4 PFU of VN1203 in 50 Âµl of PBS or mock-infected with PBS alone.  At days 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post-infection, lungs were harvested and total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis.  The experimental design was for 4- 5 mice/time point/dose and 3 time-matched mocks.  However due to survival rate, there are only 3 samples at Day 7 at 10^3 PFU and no day 7 samples at 10^4 PFU.
