TITLE
Response to herbicide treatment in wild type and gcn2 at the transcription and translation level in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of GCN2 in stress response, the total transcript and translation state were compared between Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (ecotype Landsberg erecta)  and gcn2 (Genetrap line GT8359, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)  seedlings with or without herbicide chlorosufuron treatment RNA was fractionated using sucrose gradients into polysomal and nonpolysomal RNAs. We also determined overall total transcript levels.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

DESIGN
wild type and gcn2 mutant were compared in their transcription and translation response to herbicide treatment to identify the  role of GCN2 in stress response and translational regulation. RNA was fractionated using sucrose gradients into nonpolysomal, small polysomal and large polysomal RNAs.   The sucrose gradient fractions and the total RNA were analyzed using Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays (platform  GPL198).
