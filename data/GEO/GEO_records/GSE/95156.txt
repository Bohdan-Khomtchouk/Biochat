TITLE
Pancreatic alpha and beta-cellular clocks have distinct molecular properties and impact on islet hormone secretion and gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a parallel analysis of the molecular properties of α- and β-cell oscillators, using a mouse model expressing three reporter genes: one labeling α-cells, one specific for β-cells, and a third monitoring circadian gene expression. Diurnal transcriptome analysis in separated α- and β-cells revealed that a high number of genes with key roles in islet physiology, including regulators of glucose sensing and hormone secretion, are differentially expressed in these cell types. This study represents the first parallel large-scale circadian in vivo transcriptome analysis in separated α- and β-cells.
