TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer cell lines LNCap (androgen dependent) and DU145 (androgen independent), transfected with Pin1 or control siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pin1 inhibiton exerts anti-oncogenic effects on LNCaP and DU145 cells despite the gene regulation patterns by Pin1 were different in both cells. We investigated how Pin1 modulates the gene expressions in the androgen-dependent as well as the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines

DESIGN
For the knockdown of human Pin1, the siRNAs against Pin1 (Pin1 shRNA-1: 5’-CGGCAACAGCAGCAGUGGUGGCAAA-3’ and Pin1 shRNA-2: 5’-GCCCUGGAGCUGAUCAACGGCUACA-3’) and control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen (Stealth/siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides)
