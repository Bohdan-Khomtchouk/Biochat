TITLE
modENCODE_White Lab: genome-wide ChIP data of H3K27me3 from D.pse_E0-4h on Illumina Genome Analyzer.

ORGANISM
Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains genome-wide binding profile of the factor H3K27me3 from D.pse_E0-4h generated by ChIP and analyzed on Illumina Genome Analyzer. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
A validated dataset is comprised of three biological replicates for ChIP-chip experiments and two replicates for ChIP-seq and meet the modENCODE quality standards. The control sample is the chromatin Input used for ChIP. Factors binding profiles are generated by using specific antibodies for the protein of interest. This submission represents the ChIP-seq component of the study
