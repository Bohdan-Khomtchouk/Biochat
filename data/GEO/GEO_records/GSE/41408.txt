TITLE
Co-expression of genes with ERG in prostate cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG overexpression is the most frequent molecular alteration in prostate cancer. We analyzed different stages of prostate cancer to identify genes that were coexpressed with ERG overexpression. In primary prostate tumors, it was shown that TDRD1 expression was the strongest correlated gene with ERG overexpression and we suggest TDRD1 as a direct ERG target gene.

DESIGN
48 Prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomies were included in this study. These samples contained more than 70% cancer and less than 30% stromal tissue. Each sample was analyzed once.
