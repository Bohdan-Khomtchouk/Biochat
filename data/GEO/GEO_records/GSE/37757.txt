TITLE
Unraveling cell typeâ€“specific and reprogrammable human replication origin signatures associated with G-quadruplex consensus motifs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Short nascent strands purification coupled to next-generation sequencing allowed us to identify replication origins on human genome in an extensive way, by mapping replication origins in 4 different cell types, IMR-90 fibroblasts, hESC H9 cells, iPSC Th Cl-4 cells and HeLa cells. We demonstrated the existence of a cell type-specific reprogrammable signature of the cell identity revealed by specific efficiencies of conserved origin positions and not by the selection of cell-type specific subsets of origins.

DESIGN
4 different cell types were analyzed. For each cell types, 2 different biological replicates of short nascent strands at replication origins were purified. Each SNS sample was sequencing at least one time.

PLATFORM
