TITLE
Expression data from RECA1-overexpressing plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis nuclear RecA homologue RA51D were reported to be involved in plant defense responses. Plant organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplast also have their own RecA homologues. We focused on chloroplast RecA homologue RECA1 because it has been well known that the precursors of phytohormones and secondary metabolites related to plant defense responses are synthesized in chloroplast and recent studies have identified several chloroplastic proteins invoved with plant defense responses. We used microarrays to investigate the global gene expression changes by RECA1.

DESIGN
2-week-old Col-0 and RECA1(at1g79050)-overexpressing plants without any treatments were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Col-0 plants were used as control and T3 RECA1-overexpressing transgenic plants were used in this study.
