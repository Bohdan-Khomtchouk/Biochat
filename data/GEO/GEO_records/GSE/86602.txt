TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between SCD1 knockdown and vector control of Huh7 cells and PLC/PRF/5 cells by RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to search for the downstream target of SCD1

DESIGN
We subjected SCD1 knockdown and vector control of Huh7 cells and PLC/PRF/5 cells to RNA-sequencing, and analyzed the genes that were shown to be differentially expressed between the two groups.
