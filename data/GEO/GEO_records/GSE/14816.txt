TITLE
Immune Response of Immature Dendritic Cells after Infection with Human Cytomegalovirus Strain TB40E

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that TB40E infection of DCs led to changes of the gene expression pattern. A variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL5), TLR3 and genes whose products function downstream of the TLR3 signalling pathway (e.g. IFN-α, IFN-β) were significantly upregulated.

DESIGN
three mock transfected DC vs. three TB40 transfected DCs
