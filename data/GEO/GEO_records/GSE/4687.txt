TITLE
EScell data, composed of normalized log ratio of the differentiated compared to the undifferentiated at 5 points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study of embryonic stem cell mediated neuronal differentiation allows for improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in embryonic neuronal development. We investigated expression profile changes using time course cDNA microarray to identify clues for the signaling network of neuronal differentiation. Keywords: time course, embryonic stem cell

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression microarray data, composed of the fluorescent signal intensity ratio, of the differentiated (Cy5 channel; red) compared to the undifferentiated (Cy3 channel; green) at 5 points in time: we started with a treatment with ATRA (Start), 2 days for neuronal induction (2 after), 0 day after the neuronal induction (0 day), 2 days after the neuronal induction (2 days), 7 days after the neuronal induction (7 days).

PLATFORM
GPL3640 Sookmyung Mouse 10K (EScell)
