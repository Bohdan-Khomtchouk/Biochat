TITLE
Glycogene expression during maturation of human antigen-presenting cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. van Kooyk's laboratory is exploring the function of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), that regulate viral-antigen recognition, DC trafficking and T cell binding--all processes that initiate immunity or tolerance. Essential in this is the recognition of ligands by C-type lectins and the functional consequences of differential terminal glycosylation that may regulate DC function.

DESIGN
In this study, the gene expression profile of glycosylation-related genes is examined in relation to the maturation of human antigen-presenting cells. Two pooled RNA samples, one each from immature and mature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, were prepared and sent to Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
