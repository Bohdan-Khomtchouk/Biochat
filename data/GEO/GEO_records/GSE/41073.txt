TITLE
Synbiotic impact of tagatose on viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG mediated by the phosphotransferase system (PTS)

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG

SUMMARY
The presence of tagatose in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG caused induction of a large number of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism including the phosphotransferase system. In addition, these results indicate the tagatose enhanced the growth of Lactobacillus casei 01 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and their probiotic activities by activating tagatose-associated PTS networks.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG with glucose vs. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG with tagatose. For preparing the total RNA, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG cells were grown at 37Â°C in prebiotic minimum medium supplemented with 2% glucose or tagatose for 24 h.

PLATFORM
GPL16093 Lactobacillus rhanmosus ATCC 53103 4x44K Microarrays
