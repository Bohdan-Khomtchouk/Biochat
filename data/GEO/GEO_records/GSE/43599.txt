TITLE
Posterior Second Heart Field (pSHF) Transcriptomes of Wild-type and Tbx5 Mutant Mouse Embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand Tbx5-Hedgehog molecular networks in the posterior second heart field (pSHF), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with Tbx5-dependent expression changes.  We microdissected the pSHF from E9.5 embryos and compared the Tbx5 mutant samples with than of wild-type using Agilent 4x44k Mouse Whole Genome Arrays (n = 4 WT pools and 4 Tbx5 -/+ pools).

DESIGN
Microdissected pSHF from E9.5 mouse embryos was molecularly verified by real-time PCR.  Tbx5 mutant embryos were compared with wild-type embryos. Four independnet pools of RNAs from each biological group were measured on 1-color Agilent Mouse Whole Genome Arrays (n = 4 WT pools and 4 Tbx5 -/+ pools).

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
