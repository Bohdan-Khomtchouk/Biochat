TITLE
Gene expression signature of gemcitabine resistance in human gastric cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the microarray-based expression profiles of the cells to identify genes associated with gemcitabine resistance

DESIGN
Using a set of parental and gemcitabine resistant cell line, MKN28 and RMKN28, we studied mRNA transcription levels by microarray analysis to see if there are any of the key molecules for development of acquisition of the GEM resistance.
