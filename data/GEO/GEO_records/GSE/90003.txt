TITLE
Mapping nucleolus-associated chromatin interactions by nucleolus-Hi-C reveals repression network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nucleolus plays a key role in organizing global nuclear structure and facilitating gene regulation, but the three dimensional information within the nucleolus associated chromatins are still unknown, so here we development the Nucleolus Hi-C (NHi-C) experimental technique, which combines the nucleolus isolation with Hi-C experiment, and study the interactions within and surrounding nucleolus in human cells with a high resolution. With NHi-C experiment, we report how the nucleolus-associated chromatin regions interact at genome scale, and how these interactions organize the repressive nucleus architecture.

DESIGN
in situ  Hi-C and Nucleolus Hi-C data in human cells to detect the 3D genome information, the detailed information about all files uploaded to GEO for this study are explained in " DataFiles.README "

PLATFORM
