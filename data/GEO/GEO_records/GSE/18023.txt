TITLE
Mice with FIA develop anti-native and anti-in vitro citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial antigen arrays were probed with 1:150 dilutions of plasma derived from SJL mice immunized with fibrinogen emulsified in CFA or with CFA alone.  Autoantibody binding was detected with a Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG/M secondary antibody.  SAM was applied to identify antigens with statistically significant differences in array reactivity between FIA and CFA control plasma (q < 0.01) obtained from mice before boosting. The SAM hits were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and are displayed as a heatmap.  Synovial array profiling of FIA plasma demonstrated autoreactive B-cell responses against peptides representing native fibrinogen, and B-cell epitope spreading resulting in additional targeting of citrullinated fibrinogen in the samples obtained before boosting.

DESIGN
Custom-spotted protein slides were probed with plasma samples from individual mice. Four slides were probed with plasma derived from mice immunized with CFA and six slides were probed with plasma derived from mice immunized with fibrinogen emulsified in CFA.
