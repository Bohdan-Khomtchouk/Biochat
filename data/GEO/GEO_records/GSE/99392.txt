TITLE
PGE2 mediated gene expression changes in human cervical stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cervix represents a formidable structural barrier for successful induction of labor. Approximately 10% of pregnancies undergo induction of cervical ripening and labor with prostaglandin (PG) E2 or PGE analogs, often requiring many hours of hospitalization and monitoring. On the other, preterm cervical ripening in the second trimester predicts preterm birth. The regulatory mechanisms of this paradoxical function of the cervix are unknown. Here, we show that PGE2 utilizes cell-specific EP2 receptor-mediated increases in Ca2+ to dephosphorylate and translocate HDAC4 to the nucleus for repression of 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). The crucial role of 15-PGDH in cervical ripening was confirmed in vivo. Although PGE2 or PGDH inhibitor alone did not alter gestational length, treatment with PGDH inhibitor+PGE2 or metabolism-resistant dimethyl-PGE2 resulted in preterm cervical ripening and delivery in mice. The ability of PGE2 to selectively auto-amplify its own concentrations in stromal cells by signaling transcriptional repression of 15-PGDH elucidates long-sought-after molecular mechanisms that govern prostaglandin action in the cervix. This is the first report detailing unique mechanisms of action in the cervix and serves as a catalyst for (i) the use of PGDH inhibitors to initiate, or amplify low-dose PGE2-mediated cervical ripening, or (ii) EP2 receptor antagonists, HDAC4 inhibitors, and 15-PGDH activators to prevent preterm cervical ripening and preterm birth.
