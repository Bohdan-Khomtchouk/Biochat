TITLE
RNA-seq time-course analysis of the transcriptional dynamics of the two root-infecting fungi Colletotrichum tofieldiae (mutualistic) and Colletotrichum incanum (pathogenic) and their plant host Arabidopsis thaliana during root colonization

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Colletotrichum tofieldiae ; Colletotrichum incanum

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was on the one hand to compare the transcriptional dynamics of mutualistic Colletotrichum tofieldiae and pathogenic Colletotrichum incanum during colonization of Arabidopsis roots and on the other hand also examine the corresponding host responses

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seeds that were either untreated (mock) or inoculated with Colletotrichum tofieldiae (isolate 0861) or Colletotrichum incanum (isolate MAFF230704) were grown in normal (P+) or low (P-) phosphate conditions. Roots (with/without fungal colonization) were collected at 6, 10, 16, and 24 days post inoculation (dpi). Additionally, C. tofieldiae and C. incanum in vitro hyphae were collected after two days growth in liquid Mathurâ€™s medium. For each condition three replicates were obtained.
