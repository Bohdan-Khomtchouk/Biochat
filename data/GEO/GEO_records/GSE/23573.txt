TITLE
B-cell KO mice data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium, and the microbiota. We found that mice lacking B lymphocytes, or lacking IgA, have low intestinal expression of lipid metabolism genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA4, and a consequent decrease in fat absorption in the intestine. The defect disappeared in germ free mice, suggesting that it is dependent on the microbiota; and sequencing analysis of the bacteria showed subtle differences between normal and B-cell deficient mice. Analysis of gene expression of gut biopsies from patients with common variable immunodeficiency and intestinal dysfunction revealed a high similarity to mouse B-cell knockout profiles. These data provide an explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans. This series represents first part of the study including: 1) B-cell KO mice of different strains and their controls 2) germ free B-cell Ko mice and their controls 3) B lymphocytes
