TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver treated with metformin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Optimal treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has not yet been established, particularly for individuals without diabetes. We examined the effects of metformin, commonly used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, on liver pathology in a non-diabetic NASH mouse model.

DESIGN
Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) + high fat (HF) diet with or without 0.1% metformin for 8 weeks.
