TITLE
Profiling of genes related to cross protection and competition for NbTOM1 by HLSV and TMV

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanism under the cross protection between HLSV and TMV, microarray analysis was conducted to examine the transcriptional levels of global host genes during cross protection, using Tobacco Gene Expression Microarray, 4x44k slides. The transcriptional level of some host genes corresponded to accumulation level of TMV. Some host genes were up-regulated only by HLSV.

DESIGN
The gene expression in Nicotiana benthamiana during cross protection was measured at 12 days post HLSV or mock buffer inoculated as well as TMV infected N. benthamiana which pre-inoculated HLSV or mock bufer at 3 dpi (which is equal to 15 dpi by HLSV).
