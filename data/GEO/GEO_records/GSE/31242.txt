TITLE
Fingerprinting the Asterid species using subtracted diversity array reveals novel species-specific sequences.

ORGANISM
asterids

SUMMARY
Asterids is one of the major plant clades comprising of many commercially important medicinal species. One of the major concerns in medicinal plant industry is adulteration/contamination resulting from misidentification of herbal plants. This study reports the construction and validation of a microarray capable of fingerprinting medicinally important species from the Asterids clade.
