TITLE
Gli1-expressing cells form the essential niche for colon stem cells and serve as a reserve Wnt-source in the small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to determine cellular heterogeneity of mesenchymal Gli1-positive cells from colon using single cell RNAse (10xGenomics); Summary: We determined 8 disctinct sub-populations of mesenchymal cells, remaining non-Gli1 epithelial cells formed a distinct separete cluster serving as a internal control of the single cells sequencing procedure

DESIGN
Gli1-tdTomato cells were sorted using FACS (tdTomato positvity), single cell RNA sequencing was perfomed (for details see Degirmenci et al, in prep)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
