TITLE
mRNA expression profile of Tie2 monocytes in limb ischemia patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tie2-expressing monocytes do not appear to effect revascularisation in critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients, despite a large body of evidence demonstrating their pro-angiogenic potential when isolated from control patients. In order to understand what might cause this loss of angiogenic function, we carried out a whole genome microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from Tie2-expressing monocytes from CLI patients and compared that with age-matched control samples.

DESIGN
12 samples in total
