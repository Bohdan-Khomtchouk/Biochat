TITLE
Enhancement of metastasis by spontaneous ploidy doubling of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 bone-metastatic subline 1833 and lung metastatic subline 4175 underwent spontaneous ploidy doubling in culture, i.e. the genome approximately duplicated itself gradually. The modal- and hyper-ploid subpopulations during the ploidy transition were sorted into two separate sublines, 1833-Modal and 1833-Hyper for 1833, 4175-Modal and 4175-Hyper for 4175. Their expresssion patterns were compared to each other as well as to other MDA-MB-231 sublines isolated previously by Kang et al. 2003 and Minn et al. 2005. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
19 cell lines were analyzed, including the parental line MDA-MB-231, modal-ploid sublines 1833-Modal and 4175-Modal, hyper-ploid sublines 1833-Hyper and 4175-Hyper, strongly bone-metastatic lines 1833 (the original subline after short culture), 2274, 2268 and 2269, weakly bone-metastatic lines 2293, 2295 and 2297, strongly lung-metastaic lines 4142, 4173, 4175 (the original subline after short culture) and 4180, and weakly lung-metastatic lines SCP6, SCP21 and SCP26. Single sample for each line.
