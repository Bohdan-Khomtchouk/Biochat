TITLE
Microarray analysis of expressed genes from R. microplus larvae, adult ovary, adult female gut associated with B bovis.

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Babesia bovis exposed tissues:  Three tissues were looked at.  1. Adult Female Gut  2. Adult Ovary  3. Larvae.     In all there are 24 measurements for feature (EST), and 4 measurements per treatment for each of the 6 treatment groups.      The 6 treatment groups are: Gut infected (GI), Gut control (GC), and similarly for Ovary and Larval: OI, OC, LI, LC.  There are 12 chips, each with a spot replicate. **Note:  contact person:  Felix D. Guerrero email:  felix.guerrero@ars.usda.gov Keywords: Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Babesia,  microarrays.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 12 hybridizations were performed.  Expression profiles for 13601 unique ESTs were analyzed.   Uninfected ticks were collected in one batch, as were the infected ticks.  Replicates performed are technical.
