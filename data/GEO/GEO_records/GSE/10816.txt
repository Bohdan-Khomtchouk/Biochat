TITLE
Microarray analysis of expressed genes from R. microplus larvae, adult ovary, adult female gut associated with B bovis.

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Babesia bovis exposed tissues:  Three tissues were looked at.  1. Adult Female Gut  2. Adult Ovary  3. Larvae.     In all there are 24 measurements for feature (EST), and 4 measurements per treatment for each of the 6 treatment groups.      The 6 treatment groups are: Gut infected (GI), Gut control (GC), and similarly for Ovary and Larval: OI, OC, LI, LC.  There are 12 chips, each with a spot replicate. **Note:  contact person:  Felix D. Guerrero email:  felix.guerrero@ars.usda.gov Keywords: Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Babesia,  microarrays.
