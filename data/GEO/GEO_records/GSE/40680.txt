TITLE
The effect of knock-down of neuroblastoma associated lncRNA on transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of functional characterization of neuroblastoma associated lncRNA HOXD-AS1, we performed its knock-down in neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which resulted in modulation of expression levels of a set of genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, the hallmarks of metastatic cancer.

DESIGN
SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA control and two siRNAs targeting lncRNA HOXD-AS1. Two days after transfection total RNA was isolated and hybridized to microarray, each sample was done in four replicas.
