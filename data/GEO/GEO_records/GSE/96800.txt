TITLE
Transcription and chromatin profiling in differentiating THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we profile nascent transcription, RNA polymerase III occupancy, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27ac levels in THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 derived macrophages after 72 hr exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

DESIGN
Biotin-capture of nascent transcription, ChIP-seq against RNA polymerase III subunit RPC4 (POLR3D), histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and MAF1, and ATAC-seq in THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 derived macrophages after 72 hr exposure to PMA.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
