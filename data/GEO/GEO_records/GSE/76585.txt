TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of pediatric B lymphoblastic leukemia with KMT2A rearrangement identifies hypomethylation at enhancer sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 26 pediatric KMT2Ar rearranged ALLs in comparison to 22 previously profiled samples of different non-neoplastic human B-cell precursor populations (GSE45459). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 26 pediatric KMT2Ar rearranged ALLs were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip in comparison to 22 previously profiled samples of different non-neoplastic (benign) human B-cell precursor populations (GSE45459). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used.
