TITLE
Changes in gene expression profiles of circulating B cells after influenza vaccination in healthy human subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Daily sampling of peripheral blood from human subjects vaccinated for influenza was done immediately before vaccination and for 10 days after vaccination. In B cells, 90% of transcriptomic variation in subjects who received influenza vaccine within the previous three years was explained by a single temporal pattern unique to the individual. A common set of 742 genes was strongly correlated with the migration of differentiating plasma cell subtypes.

DESIGN
Five subjects, 11 time points per subject (pre-vaccination and daily for 10 days post-vaccination)
