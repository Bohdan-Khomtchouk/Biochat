TITLE
Bone marrow gene expression profiling of the response to hemorrhage in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Search for transcripts encoding secreted proteins whose expression are highly induced after phlebotomy. This analysis allowed the identification of erythroferrone, a new erythroid factor regulating hepcidin expression and body iron requirements

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profiles 4-9-12-15 and 48 hours after phlebotomy to baseline control mice using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
