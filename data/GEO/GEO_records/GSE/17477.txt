SUMMARY
Investigation of interacting effects of TB and IFN-g on gene expression regulation within human macrophage-like THP-1 cells

DESIGN
To investigate the effect TB infection has on THP-1 macrophage’s response to IFN-g post-infection, in multiple experiments, THP-1 cells were exposed to each of the following four conditions: not treated, IFN-γ treated, M. tuberculosis infected and M. tuberculosis infected then IFN-γ treated.  Total cellular RNA was then extracted.  Recovered RNAs were pre-qualified for reproducibility by comparing qRT-PCR results of IFIT-2 and IP10 between replicate experiments.  Four most reproducible replicate experiments were then selected for genome-wide mRNA abundance assays using Affymetrix microarray-based technology.
