TITLE
Ovarian Cancer and platin resistance: Different methylation in isogenic pairs of sensitive and resistant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of differently methylated regions of CpG islands in 3 pairs of EOC cell lines. Parental and cisplatin resistant cultures from A2780, SKOV3 and HeyA8 were compared for their genome wide methylation pattern.

DESIGN
Comparative hybridisation of enriched, methylated DNA from parental and resistant cells.
