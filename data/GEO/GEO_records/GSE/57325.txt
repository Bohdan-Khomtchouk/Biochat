TITLE
BCLAF1 and its pre-mRNA splicing regulator SRSF10 both regulate tumorigenic capacity of human colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bcl-2-accociated transcription factor 1(BCLAF1) has been shown to be involved in multiple biological processes. Transcript variants encoding different isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing have been found for this gene, but little is known about the mechanisms governing its splicing regulation and whether the misregulation is associated with cancer development. Mechanistic analysis revealed that splicing factor SRSF10 specifically interacts with exon5a and activates its inclusion, as RNAi-mediated knockdown of SRSF10 induced a dramatic skipping of exon5a. To define a comprehensive programm of alternative splicing that is regulated by SRSF10 in RKO cells, we used RNA-seq coupled with a bioinformatic analysis to identify the extensive splicing network regulated by SRSF10 in RKO cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq for control (si-NC) and SRSF10-knockdown (si-SRSF10) human RKO cells
