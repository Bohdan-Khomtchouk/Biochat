TITLE
Cardiac gene expression profiling of neonatal Salvador mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we identified a number of genes whose expression are regulated by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. To disrupt Hippo signaling in the mouse heart, we inactivated the single mammalian Salv ortholog using a Salv conditional null allele and the Nkx2.5 cre allele that directs cardiac cre activity. Total RNA from P8-stage hearts were used for expression profiling.

DESIGN
Genes transcriptionally regulated by the Hippo pathway during cardiogenesis were identifed through expression profiling in Salvador mutant (Salv CKO) neontate hearts. Total RNA from postnatal day 8 (P8)-stage hearts was purified to generate biological replicate samples (2 control and 2 Salv CKO) and generate expression profiles. 3 technical replicates were used for each sample.
