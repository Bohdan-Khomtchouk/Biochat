TITLE
Treatment of C3H/HeJ grafted mice with baricitinib [systemic]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The C3H/HeJ grafted model of alopecia areata was used to determine the efficacy of systemic baricitinib at preventing alopecia or treating established disease. The efficacy of topical baricitinib at treating established alopecia in the C3H/HeJ grafted model was also assessed. Microarrays were performed on skin RNA at week 0 and week 12 after starting treatment in all models.

DESIGN
Baricitinib was administered in systemic form after disease establishment. Skin samples were taken at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks.
