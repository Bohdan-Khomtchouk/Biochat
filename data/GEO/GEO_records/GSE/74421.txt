TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of S. pneumoniae Pn-STP (PhpP) mutants

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We report the mRNA expression profile of Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 2 D39 strain-derived mutant lacking the phpP gene encoding eukaryote-type ser/thr phosphatase .

DESIGN
Measuring transcriptome profiling in D39Î”phpP mutants vs D39-WT pneumococcus wild-type strain

PLATFORM
GPL18183 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Streptococcus pneumoniae)
