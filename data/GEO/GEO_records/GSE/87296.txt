TITLE
cold stress -Impact of cold stress on grapevine inflorescence

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
12plex_vitis_2012_04 - cold stress  - In temperate species, low temperatures adversely affect plant growth and development, constraining spatial expansion and productivity. Cold can trigger adaptive process or lead to alterations in physiological traits when stress intensity exceeds a certain threshold. Grapevine flower development and fruit set are influenced by cold nights in the vineyard. The correct formation of sexual organs and the success of reproduction are dependent upon sugar supply which can be affected by low temperatures. Many pathways of carbon metabolism may be affected by low temperatures however limited information is available about fluctuations in carbon metabolism in inflorescences. - Experiments were performed on inflorescence of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir fruiting cuttings. First, inflorescences at female meiosis were collected the day of the experiment, then cuttings with the inflorescence were placed at 0°C for a 8 h night. Control plants were maintained in a growth chamber for 8 h at 19°C. Inflorescences were collected after 1 h and 8 h of cold. Additional time point was performed 2 h after the end of the cold night by placing the inflorescence at 25°C after the end of the cold night. Control plants were also collected.
