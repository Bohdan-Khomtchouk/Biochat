TITLE
An E2F1-Dependent Gene Expression Program That Determines the Balance Between Proliferation and Cell Death

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
E2F1 has been shown to induce both proliferation and apoptosis. We now show that PI3K/Akt signaling regulates the balance of these events by specifically blocking expression of genes in the E2F1 apoptotic program but not the proliferative program. Keywords: PI3K dependent modulation of E2F1 gene expression measured by Affymetrix gene expression analysis

DESIGN
11 samples total, two replicates each (except Sample 1 which is represented once)

PLATFORM
GPL341 [RAE230A] Affymetrix Rat Expression 230A Array
