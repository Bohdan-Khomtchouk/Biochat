TITLE
Murine hepatocellular carcinoma of AlbLTa/b transgenic mice and age matched C57BL/6 mice - 18 months old.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
aCGH analysis of murine transgenic liver tissues affected with HCC, hybridized with age (18 months) and sex matched C57BL/6 mice.  Moreover, 18months old C57BL/6 livers were hybridized with independent 18 months old C57BL/6 livers for control. Keywords: Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH).

DESIGN
Independent HCC of AlbLTab mice were hybridized with independent C57BL/6 mice.
