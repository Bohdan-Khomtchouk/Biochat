TITLE
Effect of adk1 knock-out mutation on global transcription

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of the variation in intracellular adenylic nucleotides pools due to the absence of the adenylate kinase Adk1p on the global yeast transcriptome. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription on total RNA from cells containing or not Adk1p.
