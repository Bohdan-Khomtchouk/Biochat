TITLE
IRF5 and IRF3 regulate distinct immune programs in plasmacytoid dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analyses of pDCs show that the partitioning of TLR/IRF5 and RLR/IRF3 pathways confers differential gene expression and immune cytokine production in pDCs, linking IRF5 with immune regulatory and proinflammatory gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq profiling of plasmacytoid dendritic cells treated with TLR7/8 agonist R848 vs. vehicle; also PAMP (pU/UC) and controls (xRNA) vs. no RNA

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
