TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of left-sided colitis, pancolitis and ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the inflammatory processes in left-sided colitis, pancolitis, and UC-associated dysplasia at the transcriptional level in colonics biopsies in order to identify potential biomarkers and transcripts of importance for the carcinogenic behaviour of chronic inflammation

DESIGN
Colonic biopsies were obtained from forty-five patients with UC (20 left-sided colitis, 19 pancolitis, and 6 UC-associated dysplasia) and 15 controls. The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 was used
