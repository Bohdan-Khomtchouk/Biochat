TITLE
Identification of a B cell signature associated with renal transplant Tolerance in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, investigators recruited the largest reported cohort of tolerant kidney transplant recipients who maintained their graft after ceasing to take their immunosuppression drug, and compared this cohort to subjects with stable  allograft function while on immunosuppression and healthy non transplated, controls.  Using gene expression studies, they identified genetic markers that are strong candidates for predicting kidney transplant candidates who may benefit from minimization or withdrawl of immunosuppression. Microarrays were used to detect expressed gene profiles of whole-blood total RNA from subjects in the tolerant, standard immunotherapy and healthy control participants

DESIGN
Total of 19 Tolerant (TOL) participants, 27 Standard Immunotherapy (SI) participants, and 12 Healthy Controls (HC)
