TITLE
MicroRNAs differentially expressed in MUC1 overexpressing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if overexpression of MUC1 alters the microRNA profile of pancreatic cancer cells S2.013. Comparison of miRNAs differentially regulated in pancreatic cancer cell line S2.013 with and without MUC1 overexpression.

DESIGN
MiRCURY LNA microarray was used to determine differential microRNA expression in one replicate of S2.013.Neo (control) cells compared to S2.013.MUC1 (experimental) cells.  Confirmation with qRT-PCR was performed on a subset of microRNAs identified as differentially regulated between the two groups.
