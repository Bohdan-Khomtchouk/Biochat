TITLE
Expression data of MED12 full-length and domain deleted construct overexpression and RNAi knockdown in HEK293 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MED12 is an X-chromosome member of the Mediator complex that is a key regulator of tissue specific gene expression and moderates intracellular signaling via multiple developmental pathways.  Sequence variations in the carboxy-terminus of MED12, which contains a PQL and Opa domain, are associated with X-linked mental retardation behavioral syndromes and schizophrenia.  Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) through which MED12 sequence variation in the carboxy-terminus could alter vulnerability to neurodevelomental and neuropsychiatric illnesses is yet unclear. In order to elucidate a better understanding of this process, we examined the role of the MED12 carboxy-terminus in cell cycle and gene expression with full-length and domain deleted overexpression constructs and RNA interference in HEK293 cells.  Our microarray data show a set of genes differentially expressed in the experimental conditions versus the GFP control.  The top 50 most differentially expressed genes in the experimental conditions versus the GFP control also show that MED12 expression level differentially affects stress response and transcriptional regulation pathways. These results are consistent with prior studies showing that MED12 has a key role in determining neuronal cell fate and our theoretical understanding of the biological basis of psychosis.  They also lend further insight upon the pathways through which MED12 exerts its effects upon differentiation and disease pathogenesis, which may one day lead to new approaches to the treatment of MED12-related disorders.

DESIGN
12 samples were analyzed, being comprised of four conditions with three biological replicates.  Comparisons were made between the GFP control to experimental condition (i.e. GFP vs MED12 FL; GFP vs MED12 PQL/Opa; and GFP vs MED12 shRNA 5)
