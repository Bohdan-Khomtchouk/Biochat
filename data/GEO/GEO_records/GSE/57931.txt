TITLE
Identification of genes are regulated by AURKA at transcription level

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: AURKA plays an important role in breast cancer development. Exploring the gene expression profiles regulated by AURKA will facilitate to understand the mechanism which is responsible for AURKA induced breast cancer development.  Results: We found that 350 genes were significantly up-regulated during AURKA overexpression in MCF-10A cells, 346 genes were significantly down-regulated during AURKA overexpression in MCF-10A cells.   Conclusions: Our study indicated that 696 differentially expressed genes might contribute to AURKA induced breast cancer development.

DESIGN
MCF-10A cells overexpressed AURKA or the empty vector were subjected to RNA extraction. The resulted RNA samples were performed RNA-sequencing analyses of gene expression profiles.
