TITLE
Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using mouse models of endometrial tumorigenesis based on two of the most common molecular alterations found in primary human UEC we sought to characterize the transition from CAH to carcinoma to identify clinically useful biomarkers. In order to identify novel candidate genes associated with invasion, global gene expression profiles were compared from uteri with extensive CAH and carcinoma. Keywords: Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from uterine segments with either CAH or invasive carcinoma from  Pten+/-;Mlh1-/- , Pten+/-;Mlh1+/+ and Wild type female mice. The RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430A chip in order to determine changes in global gene expression patterns
