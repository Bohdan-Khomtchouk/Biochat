TITLE
Trichoderma-plant root colonization: escaping early plant defense responses and activation of the antioxidant machinery

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Trichoderma spp. are versatile opportunistic plant symbionts which can colonize the apoplast of plant roots. Microarrays analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana roots inoculated with Trichoderma asperelloides T203, coupled with qPCR analysis of 137 stress-responsive genes and transcription factors, revealed wide gene transcript reprogramming, preceded by a transient repression of the plant immune responses supposedly to allow root colonization. Enhancement in the expression of WRKY18 and 40, which stimulate JA-signaling via suppression of JAZ repressors and negative-regulate the expression of the defense genes FMO1, PAD3 and CYP71A13, was detected in Arabidopsis roots upon Trichoderma colonization. Reduced root colonization was observed in the wrky18/wrky40 double mutant line, while partial phenotypic complementation was achieved by over-expressing WRKY40 in the wrky18 wrky40 background. On the other hand, an increased colonization rate was found in roots of the FMO1 knockout mutant.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Roots treated with Trichoderma vs. Control untreated roots. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 treated replicates. 1 dye-swap.
