TITLE
MicroRNAs related with the metastasis of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. However, the value of microRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) still await investigations. To identify the microRNAs associated with the metastasis of TSCC, we analyzed the transcriptomic difference between metastatic and the non-metastatic TSCC tissue. We identified a set of metastasis-related microRNAs with potential prognostic value.

DESIGN
Using microarray-based technology, we have performed a microRNA expression analysis in 5 pairs of patients with TSCC
