TITLE
RNA transcriptome in Drosophila melanogaster embryos mutant for serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the analysis of the transcriptome in Drosophila embryos with two genotypes (1: wild type, 2: embryos from germline clones of a SHMT mutant (allele X238)) and two developmental stages (1: pre-blastoderm, stage 1 and stage 2, 0–1h after egg lay, 2: late blastoderm/cellularisation stage 5, 1.5–2.5 h after egg lay)

DESIGN
Examination of transcription in two genotypes and two developmental stages

PLATFORM
