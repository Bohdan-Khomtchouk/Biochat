TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in HEECs of eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis compared with control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of endometriosis may result from aberrant angiogenesis that occurs in eutopic endometrium with retrograde menstruation. The difference in gene expression profile between human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) from eutopic endometria of patients with and without endometriosis would be determinant that affects the occurrence of endometriosis. To explore this kind of difference, we performed in vitro culture and identified their endothelial origin, as well as observed growth features of HEECs from the two different origins. Finally we identified the difference in gene expression profile when combined suppression subtractive hybridization(SSH) with genechip and confirmed the results by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The HEECs derived from endometriosis exhibited potent survival ability in vitro compared to that from non-endometriosis. We found that gremlin and fibronectin genes were up-regulated in HEECs derived from eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis when compared with that from patients without endometriosis. Our study implies that enhanced angiogenic capacity of eutopic HEECs may be an independent determinant in endometriotic aberrant angiogenesis in addition to the interaction of exfoliated endometrium and peritoneal environment elements such as activated macrophages and soluble cytokines. Keywords: human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs),endometriosis,differentially expressed genes

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 arrays for HEECs derived from eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis and 5 arrays for HEECs derived from that of patients without endometriosis
