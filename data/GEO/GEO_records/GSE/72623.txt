TITLE
CRLF2 Over-expression is a Poor Prognostic Marker in Children With High Risk T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seventeen T-ALL patients out of 120 (14.2%) presented CRLF2 expression 5 times higher than the median (‘CRLF2-high’) with a significantly inferior 5-y EFS and an increased CIR  compared to CRLF2-low patients.GEP of 15 T-ALL patients with  (‘CRLF2-high’) were compared to 15 CRLF2-low patients. GSEA identified cell cycle deregulating gene sets.

DESIGN
RQ-PCR identified a range of expression of CRLF2 in BM samples of T-ALL patients. GEP was performed on 15 high CRLF2 vs 1 low CRLF2 expressing samples to identify specific deregulated pathways between these two groups.
