TITLE
Runx1- responsive genes in mdx muscles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed  to compare expression pattern of musles taken form two mice strains- mdx and mdx/Runx1f/f, which are double KO carrting a muscle specific ablation of Runx1  using a Myf5-Cre. This comparison revealed the Runx1- responsive gene set in mdx muscles. we could cross this data with prior retrived datd from privous experiments found in this GEO quary, to pinpiont Runx1 target genes in muscle rgeneration

DESIGN
RNA  was extracted form  soleus muscles of 2 months old mice, n=3,4  for mdx and mdx/Runx1f/f, respectively . Differentially expressed genes were discovered using the DeSeq2 software

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
