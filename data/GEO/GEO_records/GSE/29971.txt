TITLE
Prognostic Gene Expression Signature Associated with Two Molecularly Distinct Subtypes of Colorectal Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify prognostic gene expression signatures associated with two molecularly distinct subtypes of colorectal cancer. Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 96 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 arrays. This is a test set for validation of prognostic gene expression signature that was developed from GSE14333. All data were normalized by using the RMA method (affy package in R/Bioconductor).

DESIGN
mRNA from 96 primary colorectal tumor samples were extracted and hybridized to HG-U133Plus 2.0 expression arrays. All data were normalized by using RMA method. This study represents a re-analysis of 96 Samples (listed below) from Series GSE14333. The re-processed data is linked to this record as a supplementary file. The raw data files can be downloaded using the 'Supplementary file' links at the bottom of the Sample records.
