Affymetrix SNP array data for acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples

SUMMARY
BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia is characterized by the deletion of Ikaros. The Philadelphia chromosome, encoding BCR-ABL1, is the defining lesion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed genome-wide analysis of leukemic samples from 23 CML cases and 304 ALL cases, including 43 BCR-ABL1 B-ALL cases. IKZF1 (encoding the transcription factor Ikaros) was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 B-ALL cases, but not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired lesion in lymphoid blast crisis of CML. The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression of a dominant negative Ikaros isoform or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant V(D)J recombination is responsible for the deletions. These findings suggest that genetic lesions resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are a key event in the development of BCR-ABL1 ALL. *** Due to privacy concerns, the primary SNP array data is no longer available with unrestricted access.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the maufacturers directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 100K and 500K SNP arrays was performed for 304 pediatric and adult ALL samples, 23 chronic myeloid leukemia samples, and 36 ALL cell lines. There are also 50 samples from leukemia in remission, which were used as references for copy number inference.
