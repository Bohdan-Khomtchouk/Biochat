TITLE
Overlapping and distinct functions of CstF64 and CstF64τ in mammalian mRNA 3’ processing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Our study of CstF64 and CstF64τ revealed both functional overlap and specificity of these two important mRNA 3’ processing factors and provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of mRNA 3’ processing.

DESIGN
CstF64tau iCLIP-seq in HeLa cells;  direct RNA sequencing (DRS) of control HeLa cells, CstF64tau-RNAi cells and SELEX-seq for RNA control pool, CstF64 and CstF64tau.
