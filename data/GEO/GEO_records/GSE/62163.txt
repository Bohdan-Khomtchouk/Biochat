TITLE
Brassinosteroid-mediated gene expression changes in Arabidipsis during heat stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global analysis of brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated gene expression under abiotic stress identifies BR associated mechanisms of stress tolerance, and new stress-related genes

DESIGN
We used the Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 array to analyze gene expression in a synthetic BR, 24-epibrassinolide (EBR)-treated and untreated Arabidopsis seedlings before, during and after heat stress (HS) treatment. Microarray expression profiles were generated from EBR-treated (E; 1 µM EBR for 21 days) and untreated (C; 0.01% ethanol for 21 days) Arabidopsis seedlings under no-stress (0 h), HS (1 h and 3 h) at 43°C conditions. Additionally, a recovery for 6 h (6 hR) at 22°C after exposure to 3h HS at 43°C was also included
