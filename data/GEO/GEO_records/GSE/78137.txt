TITLE
Activity-dependent transcriptional profiling of basolateral amygdala neurons in response to valence-specific stimuli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activity-dependent transcriptional profiling was performed in the basolateral amygdala in order to identify unique genetic markers for functionally distinct neuronal populations

DESIGN
RNA was pools from from 2 mice per sample, 3 mice per group. RNA from mice that underwent shock and female were compared
