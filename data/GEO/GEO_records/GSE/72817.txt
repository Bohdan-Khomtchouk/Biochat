TITLE
Mytilus galloprovincialis, digestive gland and gill, exposed to Prorocentrum lima, producers of okadaic acid.

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
Differential expression analysis of digestive gland and gill tissues of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum lima), producers of okadaic acid, at a concentration of 200 cells/ml for one day. Each sample consists in total RNA was extracted from pooled tissues of 5 individuals.

DESIGN
Two-color dye-swap direct comparison experiment: exposed vs non-exposed (treated vs control). Biological replicates: two treated replicates and two control replicates per tissue.
