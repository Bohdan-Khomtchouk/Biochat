TITLE
Transcriptional response of yeast cells upon high-level expression of modified GFPs

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome yeast cells expressing modified GFPs were analyzed to elucidate the consequences of growth defect

DESIGN
7 samples were analyzed. In each sample, differently modified GFP is highly expressed. One of them is a empty vector control.

PLATFORM
GPL7542 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Feature Number version)
