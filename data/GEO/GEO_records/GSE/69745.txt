TITLE
Analysis of wheat straw grown Trichoderma reesei gene expression as influenced by L-methionine in the medium

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei QM9414

SUMMARY
Wheat straw grown cultures of T. reesei QM9414 were supplemented with 100 µM L-methionine and  the genome wide gene expression monitored in order to find novel L-Methionine repressible genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from independent duplicate shake flask cultures of T. reesei QM9414 pregrown on pretreated wheat straw. Global gene and analyzed using a 4 chip design where 2 chips each represented cultures with or without exogeneously added 100 µM L- Methionine.
