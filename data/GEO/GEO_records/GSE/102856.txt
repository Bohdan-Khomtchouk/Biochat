TITLE
SENP6 in OCP maintenance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the role of sumoylation/desumoylation pathway in skeletla development and homeostasis, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of primary rib chondrocytes from WT vs.Dermo1-Cre;Senp6f/f mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from Dermo1-Cre;Senp6f/f (Mut) and Senp6f/f (WT) mice (n=2), and used for RNAseq service provided by BGI.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
