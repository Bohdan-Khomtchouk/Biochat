TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of a Pathogenic Response to a Viral Infection in Jamaican Fruit Bats Artibeus jamaicensis Experimentally Infected With Tacaribe Virus

ORGANISM
Artibeus jamaicensis

SUMMARY
Bats are a widespread group of mammals thought to host a variety of viruses and other disease agents. Here we performed RNA-sequencing on Artibeus jamaicensis infected with the New World arenavirus, Tacaribe Virus, to generate an extensive bat transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of Tacaribe Virus infected and uninfected Artibeus jamaicensis bats with a total of 12-pooled samples (kidney, liver, and spleen) with duplicates for each condition was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL21218 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Artibeus jamaicensis)
