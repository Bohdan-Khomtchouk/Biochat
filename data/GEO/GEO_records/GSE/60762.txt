TITLE
Expression data of osteoarthritic and healthy human labrum cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoarthritic cartilage has largely been investigated, however supporting structures as the acetabular labrum are less investigated. In this studies we aimed to identify differences in gene expression between healthy and osteoarthritic labrum cells we used the microarray as a discovery tool to identify possible new targets in hip osteoarthritis pathology

DESIGN
We isolated labrum cells by enzymatic digestion of the acetabular labrum and cultures the cells in for 7 days in a 3D alginate culture systems which gives rise to a stable phenotype.
