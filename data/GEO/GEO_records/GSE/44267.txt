TITLE
Cohesin and CTCF Differentially Affect the Chromatin Architecture and Gene Expression in Human Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences are enriched for binding sites of CTCF and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains.  To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher order chromatin architecture in human cells, we proteolytically cleaved the cohesin complex from interphase chromatin and examined changes in chromosomal organization as well as transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromosomal interactions upon disruption of cohesin complex, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF by RNA interference in these cells not only reduced intra-domain interactions but also increased inter-domain interactions. Further more, distinct groups of genes become mis-regulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute in different ways to chromatin organization and gene regulation.
