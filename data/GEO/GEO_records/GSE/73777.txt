TITLE
Expression data from anti-mycoplasma drugs treated gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Various anti-mycoplasma drugs have different effects on cells growth We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying gastric cancer cells treated with anti-mycoplasma drugs and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Gastric cancer cells treated with anti-mycoplasma drugs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain a disparate impact of gastric cancer cells treated with anti-mycoplasma drugs. To that end, we selected two cell lines of gastric cancer cell, AGS and BGC823, which were treated with four anti-mycoplasma drugs (A2PP, CIP, MYCO1 and MYCO2) separately.
