TITLE
Helicobacter pylori induce miR-155 in T cells in a cAMP-Foxp3 dependant manner

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) colonizes the gastric epithelium as a unique niche in the stomach. Infections commonly occur in childhood and persist lifelong, leading in some cases to adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma. Several studies define mammalian microRNAs as key regulators of the immune system and of carcinogenesis processes. Here, we show Hp infection induces miR-155 expression in epithelial and hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. This induction is mediated by at least two main bacterial virulence factors, the vacuolating toxin (VacA) and the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in an LPS independent manner. Using adenylate cyclases agonists and inhibitor, we demonstrated that the miR-155 microRNA regulatory cascade in Hp infection involves the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the study showed that a knock-down of the Foxp3 transcription factor in T cells abolishes miR-155 expression. Together, these findings are the first demonstration of a direct interconnection between the regulatory T cell development factor Foxp3 and a microRNA. This study supports the link between Hp infection, regulation of cellular immunity, inflammation and cancer development.
