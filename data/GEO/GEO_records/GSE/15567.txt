TITLE
Identification of transcription factor DAF-16 binding sites in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We identified the DNA binding sites of DAF-16 in transgenic line TJ356 (daf-16::gfp) that carries high-copy number daf-16. The expression pattern was examined through fluorescent microscopy. The binding sites were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody and anti-POL II antibody followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
