TITLE
Effects of ursolic acid and tomatidine on skeletal muscle mRNA expression in aged mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For additional details see Ebert et al, Identification and Small Molecule Inhibition of an ATF4-dependent Pathway to Age-related Skeletal Muscle Weakness and Atrophy.

DESIGN
Weight-matched cohorts of 22-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were provided ad libitum access to standard chow (control) or standard chow supplemented with 0.27% ursolic acid (UA) or 0.05% tomatidine (TM) for 2 months.  After the 2 month treatment period, quadriceps femoris muscles were harvested.  mRNA levels in muscles harvested from ursolic acid or tomatidine fed mice were normalized to levels in muscles fed control diet.
