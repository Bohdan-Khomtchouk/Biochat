TITLE
Expression data from cultured human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and cultured human fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer cells express different sets of receptor type tyrosine kinases. These receptor kinases may be activated through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Fibroblasts may modify the biologic properties of surrounding cancer cells through paracrine mechansms. We used microarrays to obtain the global gene expression of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and various esophageal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
A total of 22 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and fibroblasts were analyzed. 4 fibroblasts were obtained from surgically resected human esophagus. Cells were cultured under standard conditions, total  RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
