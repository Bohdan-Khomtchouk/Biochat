TITLE
Expression data from rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The effect of cafeteria (CAF) diet in PBMC gene expression was analyzed in two inbred rat strains the Wistar Kyoto(WKY) and Lewis (LEW) rat PBMCs were isolated following a CAF or standard diet and subjected to whole genome expression analysis

DESIGN
Rats from each strain were either fed with standard chow diet (n=5) or CAF (n=5). After 7 weeks of the indicated diet, rats were fasted for 9 hours, culled and PBMCs isolated from whole blood collected from the abdominal aorta
