TITLE
miRNA expression data from low nitrate culture in leaf and root of maize

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
Nitrate is the major source of nitrogen available for many crop plants and is often the limiting factor for plant growth and agricultural productivity especially for maize. Many studies have been done identifying the transcriptome changes under low nitrate conditions. However, the microRNAs (miRNAs) varied under nitrate limiting conditions in maize has not been reported. MiRNAs play important roles in abiotic stress responses and nutrient deprivation. We used the microarray systems to detect miRNAs responding to the chronic nitrate limiting conditions in maize leaves and roots.
