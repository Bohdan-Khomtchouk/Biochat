TITLE
Seedling transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana HULK mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We produced RNA-seq reads from messenger RNA isolated from aerial seedling tissue for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in the HULK gene family. The read data were generated with biological replication (two replicates). The resulting RNA-seq data provide a resource to assess the function of HULK genes in the control of downstream gene expression in A. thaliana.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA transcript levels in HULK T-DNA mutants (and mutant combinations therein) in Arabidopsis thaliana.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
