TITLE
HEB associates with PRC2 and SMAD2/3 to regulate developmental fates [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the interaction between HEB and PRC2 components in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

DESIGN
We profiled gene expression for biological triplicate shControl- and shHEB-infected ESCs and differentiated embryoid body (EB) in serum-free defined culture system with or without activin treatment

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
