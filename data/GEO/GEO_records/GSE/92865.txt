TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq of Lgr5-eGFP+ intestinal stem cells upon Wnt and R-spondin modulation in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptomic alterations of Lgr5-eGFP+ intestinal stem cells upon Wnt and R-spondin gain-of-function and loss-of-function in vivo

DESIGN
Lgr5-eGFP+ intestinal stem cells were isolated by FACS following in vivo GOF and LOF Wnt and R-spondin.  Mice were treated with intravenous adenovirus encoding agonists and antagonists, then small intestine was harvested from these mice, the tissue was dissociated and cells were collected by FACS.  Sorted Lgr5-eGFP(-) cells and Lgr5-eGFP(+) cells following control Ad Fc treatment were used as controls.  Two technical replicates were generated for each treatment condition. Please note that each mtx (processed data) file is accompanied with 2 files; a list of genes (i.e. mm10_genes.tsv linked as a Series supplementary file) and a list of cell ids (mm10_barcodes.tsv linked to the corresponding sample), which correspond to the rows and columns of the mtx file  (i.e. genes correspond to rows, and barcodes correspond to the columns).
