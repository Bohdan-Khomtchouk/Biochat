TITLE
Expression Profiling of MAP Kinase-Mediated Meiotic Progression in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
A unique allele of MAP kinase, mpk-1(ga111), displays a reversible, temperature-sensitive, tissue-specific defect in progression through meiotic prophase I.  We performed gene expression profiling on mpk-1(ga111) animals at multiple times after shift to permissive temperature to identify candidate downstream effectors of MPK-1 signaling in the germline.  This analysis delineated a cohort of genes whose expression requires MPK-1 (MAP kinase) signaling in germ cells in the pachytene stage of meiosis I. Keywords: Timecourse of C. elegans mpk-1 mutants

DESIGN
We analyzed six timepoints after MAP kinase mpk-1(ga111) mutants were shifted to a temperature permissive for meiotic progression.  Each timepoint was sampled in triplicate.  Control (mpk-1+) animals were sampled in triplicate at the beginning and end of the time series.  All samples were compared to a common reference sample made of a mixture of both control samples.
