TITLE
Bacillus subtilis strains at low-pressure: 5 kPa versus 101 kPa growth

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Comparing the transcriptional responses of Bacillus subtilis strains WN624 and WN1106 at 5 kPa and 101 kPa. WN1106 is a 5 kPa-evolved strain with increased fitness compared to ancestor-WN624 strain at 5 kPa. This experiment probed the difference in response when the strains are grown at 5 kPa.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 5 kPa vs. 101 kPa, for both strains. And two component condition of WN1106 compared to WN624 at either 5 kPa or 101 kPa. 4 pressure comparisons.
