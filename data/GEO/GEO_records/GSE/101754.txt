TITLE
Exploring the gene expression profile upon FXR1 knockdown in H358 cells using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the RNA-seq in control samples and FXR1 knockdown samples, and compared the gene expression profiles to explore the effect of FXR1 knockdown on gene expression. The study was performed in H358 cells. Doxycycline inducible shRNA3 (sh3) was used to knockdown FXR1. Control shRNA (ctrl) samples were used to get rid of the effect of Doxycycline treatment. Both the Doxycycline treament for 3 days (D3) and 5 days (D5) samples were collected. Each sample has three repeats (rep 1, rep 2, and rep 3). The mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina.Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, then mapped to hg19 whole genome using STAR v2.5.3 with parameters --bamRemoveDuplicatesType UniqueIdentical --outSAMmultNmax 1. Raw reads and Reads Per Kilobase per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated using HOMER (PMID: 20513432). Differential gene expression was analyzed using R package DESeq2 using the raw reads.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of control sample and FXR1 knockdown samples of H358 cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina.
