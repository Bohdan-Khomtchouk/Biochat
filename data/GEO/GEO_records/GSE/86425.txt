TITLE
Kidney gene expression profiles from a lupus nephritis mouse model: SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) mice treated with pristane

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the longitudinal gene expression profiles of kidneys from a novel lupus model nephritis: SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) mice treated with pristane. Genes from biological processes such as IFN response, complement, Fc gamma receptors, immune recruitment, innate immune pattern recognition, antibody response and fibrosis,were upregulated in diseased kidneys.

DESIGN
Kidney tissues were collected from mice SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) after pristane treatment at different time points (week 0, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 14) as well as from untreated control mice SNF1 mice. The study includes tissues from at least 8 animal for each condition.
