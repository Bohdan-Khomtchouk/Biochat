TITLE
Plasma circRNA expression profile in systemic lupus erythematosus and its clinical significance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNA and stably conserved in mammalian cells. Although circRNAs have been widely reported in some diseases and tissues, the expression of circRNAs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have yet to be explored. To reveal the implications of circRNAs in SLE, we used Human circRNA Array v2.0 microarrays to measure the expression profiles of circRNAs in plasma of patients with SLE and healthy controls. A total of 4763 circRNAs were detected in plasma of SLE sample, and 112 circRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed in plasma of SLE patients as compared to healthy controls (fold change > 1.5 and P  <  0.05), including 53 up-regulated circRNAs and 59 down-regulated circRNAs. Hsa_circRNA_407176, hsa_circRNA_406567 and hsa_circRNA_001308 were established using Real-time quantitative PCR. These results showed abrrant expression profiles of circRNAs in T cells of SLE patients and revealed their potential role in SLE.

DESIGN
In this study, we determined expression profile of circRNAs in plasma of four SLE patients (S19, S21, S22, S42) and four healthy controls (C1, C2, C4, C5) using Human circRNA Array v2.0 microarray (8×15K, Arraystar).
