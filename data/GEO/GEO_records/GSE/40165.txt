TITLE
Immune correlates of early prednisolone therapy in children and adolescents with dengue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dengue is the most important arboviral infection of humans.  A host pro-inflammatory immune response is widely believed to contribute to the clinical complications that occur in some patients with dengue. Here, immune correlates of early prednisolone therapy were defined in Vietnamese dengue patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial, comparing a three day regimen of high (2mg/kg) or low (0.5mg/kg) dose prednisolone with placebo.  Prednisolone conferred a small change in the whole blood gene expression profile, with 81 transcripts from 64 genes differentially abundant between high-dose prednisolone and placebo treated patients. A prominent theme in the prednisolone gene expression signature was the under-abundance of transcripts from genes associated with T and NK cell cytolytic effector functions. Surprisingly, prednisolone therapy was not associated with attenuation of early-convalescent T cell responses or plasma cytokine levels. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a remarkably benign influence of prednisolone on immune response parameters in dengue patients, and are in line with the trial evidence showing lack of impact on clinical laboratory endpoints and clinical phenotype.

DESIGN
The gene expression microarray assay was conducted on samples from the first 123 consecutive patients (placebo, 40; 0.5mg/kg prednisolone, 42; 2.0mg/kg prednisolone, 41).
