TITLE
Viral and Cellular N6-methyladenosine (m6A) Epitranscriptomes in KSHV Life Cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Tan et al. discovered abundant conserved N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on KSHV transcripts during latent and productive infection in different cell types. They also show that m6A readers YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 mediate KSHV replication, and KSHV optimizes both phases of viral replication by reprograming cellular epitranscriptome to regulate distinct signaling pathways.

DESIGN
m6A epitranscriptome profiles of four uninfected cell types, five latently infected cell types, and three lytic cell types. Each cell type has an immunoprecipitated (IP) and input sample.
