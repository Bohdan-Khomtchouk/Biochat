TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling changes upon knockdown of LKB1 in human glioblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to display differential gene expression profiling changes in two human glioblastoma cells upon knockdow of LKB1 tumor suppressor, by using RNAseq technology.

DESIGN
LKB1 was first silenced in two glioblastoma cells: U87 and T98 by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Total RNA was extracted from duplicated cancers cells transfected with control siRNA and LKB1 specific siRNA at 72h posttransfection for RNAseq analysis. Differentially expressed genes in LKB1-attenuated glioblastoma cells were identified in comparison to that in glioblastoma cells transfected with control siRNA.
