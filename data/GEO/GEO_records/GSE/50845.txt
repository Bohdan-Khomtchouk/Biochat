TITLE
Control vs CRB2 cKO retinas at early postnatal time points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray gene profiling to study the transcriptome of retinas lacking CRB2 during late retinal development. Unexpectedly, the retinas of newborn mice lacking CRB2 showed no changes in the transcriptome during retinal development.

DESIGN
Comparison between Control and CRB2 null retinas at different time points (P0, P3, P6 and P10)

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
