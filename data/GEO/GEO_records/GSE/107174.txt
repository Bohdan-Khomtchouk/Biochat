TITLE
Whole genome RNA-seq analysis of Wild type or Elf4-/- peritoneal macrophages and whole genome RNA-seq analysis of 293T cells transfected with miR-221 or empty vector.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or Elf4-/- peritoneal macrophages were infected with VSV, followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis. 293T cells were transfected with miR-221 or empty vector, followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis. Conclusions:Overexpression of miR-221 in cells facilitated viral infection and  inhibited the production of IFNÎ².

DESIGN
Wild type or Elf4-/- peritoneal macrophages were infected with VSV for 4 hours. Cells were harvested followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis. 293T cells were transfected with miR-221 or empty vector. 6 hours later the cells were were harvested followed by whole genome RNA-seq analysis.
