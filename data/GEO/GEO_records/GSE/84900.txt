TITLE
Differential gene expression on islet transplantation with or without the presence of autologous fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic islet transplantation was performed in the subcutaneous space of diabetic nude mice. In order to promote long survival and function of transplanted islets a plasma-based scaffold was developed in combination with fibroblasts as graft-supporting accesory cells. Gene expression analysis was carried out to evaluate expression differences due to the presence of fibroblast which could explain the long-term glycemic control observed under these circumstances.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islet transplantation was performed with or without the presence of autologous fibroblasts and differences on gene expression was followed during 10 days
