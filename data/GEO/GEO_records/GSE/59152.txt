TITLE
Snf2h and Satb2-dependent chromatin remodeling establishes callosal projection neuron identity through clustered protocadherin gene regulation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse cortex (dorsal telencephalon) analysis from Snf2h cKO-Emx1 mice versus control littermates at birth (P0). P0 mouse cortex, 3 cortices pooled per sample, n=2 per genotype.

DESIGN
Cortex samples at birth (P0) from Snf2h cKO-Emx1 mice and control littermates were analyzed. Three cortices were pooled per sample and there are two replicates per genotype.
