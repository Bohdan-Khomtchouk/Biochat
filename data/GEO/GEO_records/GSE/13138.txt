TITLE
A New Oxidative Sensing and Regulation Pathway Mediated by the MgrA Homologue SarZ in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The S. aureus transcriptome was assessed for strains Newman (wild type) and Newman (sarZ) during both exponential (2hr) and early stationary (5hr) cell growth.

DESIGN
The S. aureus transcriptome was assessed for strains Newman (wild type) and Newman (sarZ) during both exponential (2hr) and early stationary (5hr) cell growth.  The experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate, and RNA samples labeled/hybridized to independent commercially available Affymetrix GeneChips
