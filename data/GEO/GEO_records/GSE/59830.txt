TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of LSD2/H3K4me1 interaction in control and LSD2-knockdowned HepG2 cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis of LSD2-depleted HepG2 cells revealed that many of the target genes were related to lipid metabolism. We found that LSD2 is an important epigenetic regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism.

DESIGN
