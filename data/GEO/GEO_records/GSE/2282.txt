A Lowess curve was fit to the log-intensity versus log-ratio plot. 20.0% of the data was used to calculate the Lowess fit at each point. This curve was used to adjust the control value for each measurement. If the control channel was lower than 10 then 10 was used instead.  Specific samples were normalized to one another:  sample(s) 1-38 were normalized against the median of the control sample(s) 1-38. Each measurement for each gene in those specific samples was divided by the median of that gene's measurements in the corresponding control samples. Keywords: time-course
