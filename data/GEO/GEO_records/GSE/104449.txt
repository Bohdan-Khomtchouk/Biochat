TITLE
Fibrinogen activates BMP signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and inhibits remyelination after vascular damage [Rat_OPC_48h_Fibrinogen]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Determination of the mechanism by which fibrinogen, a central blood coagulation protein, regulates OPC functions and remyelination in the CNS. We used microarrays to determine the genes involved in OPC responses to fibrinogen, which is deposited in the CNS after blood-brain barrier disruption.

DESIGN
Primary rat OPCs were stimulated with fibrinogen for 48 hr and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix microarrays. Three unstimulated and three fibrinogen-stimulated samples were generated.
