TITLE
Expression data from Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell after influenza virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This research focus primarily on the interaction between influenza virus and endothelial cell, then we used microarrays to observe global patterns of gene expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells after influenza virus infection and offer further insight into the interaction between endothelial cells and influenza viruses. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were selected at an early stage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Then, we analysed the selected genes at expression level.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
