TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (18-30 nt) from wild-type and diabetic mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small RNA profiles in the liver of 9-week old wild type and diabetic db/db mice were measured to detect the differentially expressed small RNAs.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of 9-week old wild type (WT) and diabetic db/db mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Genome Analyzer.
