TITLE
Identifying microRNAs targeting WNT/Î²-catenin pathway in end-stage idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome microRNA microarray expression profiling was employed as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs dysregulated in end-stage idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients. Lung tissue from seven IPAH patients and eight failed donor controls were subjected to microarray screening.  Twenty-one miRNAs were identified dyeregulated in IPAH patients compared to controls. In miRNA real-time PCR validation, 22 IPAH patients and 22 control subjects were enrolled, including the 7 IPAH and 8 controls in microarray screening. Expression levels of five miRNAs (let-7a-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-199b-5p, miR-26b-5p and miR-27b-3p) were upregulated in technical validation. Tissue miRNA levels had positive correlation with pulmonary vascular remodeling and hemodynamic changes in IPAH patients compared to controls.

DESIGN
Seven IPAH patients and eight failed donor controls were enrolled. Lung tissue was obatined from lung transplantation.
