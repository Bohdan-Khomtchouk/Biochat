SUMMARY
Overexpression of the Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) occurs  in diverse malignancies, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma  multiforme (GBM) (1). Based on its ability to modulate transcription of key genes implicated  in cell cycle control, DNA repair and cell differentiation, EZH2 is believed to play a crucial  role in tissue-specific stem cell maintenance and tumor development. Here we show that  targeted pharmacologic disruption of EZH2 by the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase  inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), or its specific down-regulation by shRNA, strongly  impairs GBM cancer stem cell self-renewal in vitro and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo.  Using genome-wide expression analysis of DZNep-treated GBM cancer stem cells, we found  the expression of c-myc, recently reported to be essential for GBM cancer stem cells, to be  strongly repressed upon EZH2 depletion. Specific shRNA-mediated down-regulation of  EZH2 in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that  c-myc is a direct target of EZH2 in GBM cancer stem cells. Taken together, our observations  provide evidence that direct transcriptional regulation of c-myc by EZH2 may constitute a  novel mechanism underlying GBM cancer stem cell maintenance and suggest that EZH2 may  be a valuable new therapeutic target for GBM management.

DESIGN
Three samples of cancer stem-cell enriched gliospheres from primary glioblastoma multiforme cell cultures were treated with DZNep. Untreated gliospheres from the same cultures were used as controls.
