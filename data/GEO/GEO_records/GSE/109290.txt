TITLE
GRO-seq analysis of control and senescent BJ and TIG3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used GRO-seq to examine transcriptional activities in BJ and TIG-3 cells under control conditions and after activation of oncogenic RAS_V12 that leads to Oncogene-Induced Senescence (OIS)

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptional changes upon oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in two normal human diploid fibroblast cell lines: BJ and TIG-3

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
