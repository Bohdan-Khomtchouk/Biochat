TITLE
Expression Data from Pten Null Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The tumor stroma is believed to contribute to some of the most malignant characteristics of epithelial tumors.  However, signaling between stromal and tumor cells is complex and remains poorly understood.  Here we show that genetic inactivation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts of mouse mammary glands accelerated the initiation, progression and malignant transformation of mammary epithelial tumors. Global gene expression profiling in mammary stromal cells identified a Pten-specific signature associated with massive extra-cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, innate immune cell infiltraion and increased angiogenesis.  Execution of this transcriptional program was mediated, in part, by the induction, phosphorylation and recruitment of Ets2 to target promoters.  Remarkably, Ets2 inactivation in Pten stroma-deleted tumors was sufficient to decrease tumor growth and progression.  These findings identify the Pten-Ets2 axis as a critical stroma-specific signaling pathway that suppresses mammary epithelial tumors.

DESIGN
Wild type and Pten null primary mammary fibroblasts isolated from 8 week old female mice were cultured, RNA was extracted and Affymetrix gene expression arrays were performed.
