TITLE
Kdm2b maintains murine embryonic stem cell status by recruiting PRC1 complex to CpG islands of lineage genes [Expression profiling]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play important roles in repressing lineage-specific genes and maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, the mechanisms by which PcG proteins are recruited to their targets are largely unknown. Here, we show that the histone demethylase Kdm2b is highly expressed in mESCs and regulated by the pluripotent factors Oct4/Sox2 directly. Depletion of Kdm2b in mESCs causes de-repression of lineage-specific genes and induces early differentiation. The function of Kdm2b depends on its CXXC-ZF domain, which mediates Kdm2bâ€™s genome-wide binding to CpG islands (CGIs). Kdm2b interacts with the core components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and recruits the complex to the CGIs of early lineage-specific genes. Thus, our study not only reveals a novel Oct4/Sox2-Kdm2b-PRC1-CGI regulatory axis and its function in maintaining undifferentiated state of mESCs, but also demonstrates a critical function of Kdm2b in recruiting PRC1 to the CGIs of lineage-specific genes to repress their expression. In this dataset, we include the expression data for control and Kdm2b knockdown mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression in control and Kdm2b knockdown mouse embryonic stem cells using the Affymetrix MoGene-1_0-st-v1 platform.
