TITLE
Transcriptional Responses to Elevated Temperature in Streptococcus agalactiae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
In the transition from recto-vaginal colonizing organism to invasive pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) must adapt to changes in host temperature, including elevated temperatures due to host fever.  To identify genes important to the survival of GBS in response to heat stress, transcriptional profiling was performed using DNA microarray analysis, comparing GBS grown at normal temperature (37˚C) to GBS exposed to elevated temperature (42˚C).

DESIGN
Two separate RNA samples were extracted for each condition.  Three hybridizations were conducted total.

PLATFORM
GPL7689 Streptococcus agalactiae pan microarray (GBS_6) GPL7690 Streptococcus agalactiae pan microarray (GBS_2603_A909_515_1)
