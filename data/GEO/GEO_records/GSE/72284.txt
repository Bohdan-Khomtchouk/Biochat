TITLE
Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array data for a parthenogenetic SMA human embryonic stem cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A diploid 46(XX) human embryonic stem cell (HESC) line affected by Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA) due to homozygosity for a common deletion in the SMN1 gene was derived. By characterizing the methylation status of three different imprinted loci (MEST, SNRPN and H19) and carrying out genome-wide SNP analysis, we provide evidence that this cell line was established from the activation of a mutant haploid oocyte through parthenogenesis, resulting in homozygote diploidization of the entire genome.

DESIGN
Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from tissue culture. Copy number and LOH analysis of the Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array was performed for the SMA HESC line.
