TITLE
Expression profiling of lower-grade diffuse astrocytic glioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diffuse gliomas represent the most prevalent class of primary brain tumor.  Despite significant recent advances in the understanding of glioblastoma (WHO IV), its most malignant subtype, lower-grade (WHO II and III) glioma variants remain comparatively understudied, especially in light of their notably variable clinical behavior.  To examine the foundations of this heterogeneity, we performed multidimensional molecular profiling, including global transcriptional analysis, on 101 lower-grade diffuse astrocytic gliomas collected at our own institution, and validated our findings using publically available gene expression and copy number data from large independent patient cohorts.  We found that IDH mutational status delineated molecularly and clinically distinct glioma subsets, with IDH mutant (IDH mt) tumors exhibiting TP53 mutations, PDGFRA overexpression, and prolonged survival, and IDH wild-type (IDH wt) tumors exhibiting EGFR amplification, PTEN loss, and unfavorable disease outcome.  Furthermore, global expression profiling revealed three robust molecular subclasses within lower-grade diffuse astrocytic gliomas, two of which were predominantly IDH mt and one almost entirely IDH wt.  IDH mt subclasses were distinguished from each other on the basis of TP53 mutations, DNA copy number abnormalities, and links to distinct stages of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ).  This latter finding implicates discrete pools of neuroglial progenitors as cells of origin for the different subclasses of IDH mt tumors.  In summary, we have elucidated molecularly distinct subclasses of lower-grade diffuse astrocytic glioma that dictate clinical behavior and demonstrate fundamental associations with both IDH mutational status and neuroglial developmental stage.
