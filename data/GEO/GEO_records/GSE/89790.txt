TITLE
Transciptome profiling of RNaseIII null cells reconstituted with Drosha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of Drosha reconstitution on the overall transcriptome of RNaseIII null cells.

DESIGN
We utilized CRISPR techology to engineer an RNaseIII null cell line using the NoDice 293T (PMID: 24757167) as the parental cell line. mRNA profiles of RNaseIII null cells were transfected with GFP plus empty plasmid or GFP-Drosha for 3 days.
