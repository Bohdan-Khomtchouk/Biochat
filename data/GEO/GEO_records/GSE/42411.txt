TITLE
Whole-transcriptome analysis identifies re-expression of fetal splice variants in cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy has been well-characterized at the level of transcription. During cardiac hypertrophy, genes normally expressed primarily during fetal heart development are re-expressed, and this fetal gene program is believed to be a critical component of the hypertrophic process. Recently, alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts has been shown to be temporally regulated during heart development, leading us to consider whether fetal patterns of splicing also reappear during hypertrophy.We hypothesized that patterns of alternative splicing occurring during heart development are recapitulated during cardiac hypertrophy. Here we present a whole-transcriptome study of isoform expression during pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy induced by 10 days of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in rats and in developing fetal rat hearts compared to sham-operated adult rat hearts, using high-throughput sequencing of poly(A) tail mRNA.

DESIGN
Quantification of isoform expression in fetal rat hearts, pressure-overloaded rat hearts, and sham-operated rat hearts by Illumina GAIIx in triplicate
