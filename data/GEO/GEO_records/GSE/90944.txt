TITLE
RNA-seq in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells after F. nucleatum treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate whether F. nucleatum plays a role in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis,  RNA-seq analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of F. nucleatum treated HT-29 cell line or not.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells after  F. nucleatum treatment
