TITLE
TfRc Dependent Gene Expression in Embryonic Renal Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the ability of transferrin receptor1 (TfRc) knockout cells to populate different domains of the developing kidney by using a chimeric approach. The TfRc cells developed into all segments of the developing nephron, but there was a relative exclusion from the ureteric bud and a positive bias towards the stromal compartment. Here we conducted a microarray analysis of differential gene expression between TfRc deficient and wild type (wt) cells in chimeric embryonic kidneys derived from embryos created by blastocyst injection of wt blastocysts with TfRc-/- green fluorescent protein-expressing (GFP+) embryonic stem cells. Keywords: cell type comparison, genetic modification, iron signaling

DESIGN
Following blastocyst injection of 3-5 TfRc-/- GFP+ embryonic stem cells in wt blstocysts, we harvested the chimeric kidney at day E15.5 and separated the TfRc-/- GFP+ cell population from wt GFP- cell population by using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Biotinlyated cRNA was prepared from the isolated cells and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) according to standard protocols.
