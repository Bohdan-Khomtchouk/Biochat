TITLE
Global transcriptional profiles of WT and HOIL-1L-/- BMDMs in response to LPS and TNFa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HOIL-1L is an essential member of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), which targets Nemo for linear ubiquitination during NF-kB activation in response to a variety of simuli, including LPS and TNFa treatment. HOIL-1L has also been suggested to function as a transcription factor. Here we analyzed changes in the global transcriptional profiles of primary bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDMs) from WT and HOIL-1L-/- mice upon treatment with NF-kB activating simuli.

DESIGN
BMDMs were differentiated for 1 week and then treated with mock (untreated), 10ng/ml LPS, or 1ng/ml TNFa for 4 hours. RNA was immediately collected and analyzed in biological duplicates by the Agilent 8x60 mouse array.
