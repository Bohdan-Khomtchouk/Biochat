TITLE
Transcription profile in patients with cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine cardiac transcription profile in cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot patients, we collected myocardial samples immediately after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass from cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot patients undergoing corrective surgery. The transcriptional profile of the mRNA in these samples was measured with gene array technology.

DESIGN
Myocardial samples were collected, immediately after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass from cyanotic Tetralogy of Fallot patients undergoing corrective surgery.
