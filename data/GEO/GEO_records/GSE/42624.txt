SUMMARY
Cytogenetic profiles of 50 meningiomas using high-density GeneChip Mapping 500K set and Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array in the tumor tissues and in the peripheral blood of the same patients. A total of two hundred 500k arrays (100 tumor samples and 100 blood samples) and 14 SNP6.0 arrays  (7 tumour samples and 7 peripheral blood samples) were studied  to explore the most common recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (gains and losses) in meningiomas. Our results confirm that del(22q) (52%) and del(1p) (16%) (common deleted regions: 22q11.21-22q13.3. and 1p31.2-p36.33) are the most frequent abnormalities.  Additionally, recurrent monosomy 14 (8%), del(6p) (10%), del(7p) (10%) and del(19p) (6%) were also observed, while copy number variation (CNV) patterns consistent with recurrent chromosome gains, gene amplification was absent or rare. Based on their overall SNP profiles meningiomas could be classified into: i) diploid cases, ii) meningiomas with a single chromosome change (e.g. monosomy 22/del(22q) and iii) tumours with â‰¥2 altered chromosomes.

DESIGN
500K SNP mapping set array and Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array were used to profile 50 meningiomas with matched blood DNA samples. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number abnormality (CNA) profiles were derived from each tumour-blood pair. In seven tumors, both types of arrays were assessed.
