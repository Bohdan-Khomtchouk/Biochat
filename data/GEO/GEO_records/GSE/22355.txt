TITLE
Expression analysis of a respiration-deficient mutant of Zymomonas mobilis

ORGANISM
Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 = ATCC 31821

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole-genome gene expression level changes in RDM-4 strain of Zymomonas mobilis respiration-deficient mutant compared to the wild-type strain. The mutant strains were isolated from the antibiotics-resistant mutants of Z. mobilis ZM6. The RDM strains exhibited much higher ethanol fermentation abilities than the wild-type strain under aerobic conditions. The strains also gained thermotolerance and exhibited higher ethanol productivities at high temperature (39 ÂºC) under both non-aerobic and aerobic conditions compared with the wild-type strain. To evaluate the mechanisms of aerobic fermentation and thermotolerance of the RDM strain, we performed the microarray experiments.
