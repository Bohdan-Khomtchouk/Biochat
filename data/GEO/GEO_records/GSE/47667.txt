TITLE
Expression of CD39 and CD45RO on CD4+CD25hi T cells identifies human na√Øve (G3) and effector Treg (G2), and distinguishes them from activated non-Treg cells (Tresp).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human responder T-cells (Tresp) and 2 lineages of regulatory T cells (Tregs), namely G2 and G3, were isolated by flow sorting based on their immunoreacitivities against specific cell surface markers and their gene expression profiles were interrogated using Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST Arrays

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression profiles between responder T-cells, G2 Tregs and G3 Tregs

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
