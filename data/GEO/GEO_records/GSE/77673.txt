TITLE
Expressions of Cardamine amara, hirsuta and flexuorsa under wet and dry conditions

ORGANISM
Cardamine amara ; Cardamine flexuosa ; Cardamine hirsuta

SUMMARY
To understand allopoyploid speciation into hydrologically fluctuating niches, we observed gene expressions of two parental species and their allotetraploid species under wet and dry conditions

DESIGN
Gene expression of leafs from control, dry and wet conditions over three Caramine species: C. amara, C. hirsuta and C. flexuosa

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
