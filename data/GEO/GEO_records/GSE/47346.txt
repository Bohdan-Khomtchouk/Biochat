TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes due to LBH589 treatment in aromatase inhibitor-resistant tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to validate the utility of a novel pathway algorithm (BD-Func), we test if an LBH589 signature based data from 3 cell lines (GSE36509) in an independent experiment in vivo.

DESIGN
Xenograft tumor treatment (see Kubo et al. 2012; PMID 23160924), microarray gene expression profiling, functional analysis using BD-Func. Mouse xenograft (from MCF-7aro cell line) was treated with exemestane (EXE) or EXE + LBH589.
