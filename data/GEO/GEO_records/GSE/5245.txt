TITLE
Profiling of CD4+ T cells responding to transient or persistent antigen presented by dendritic cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments were done to compare the gene expression profiles in CD4+ T cells responding to antigen presented by dendritic cells transiently or persistently. Some treatments include the activation of the dendritic cells by CD40 engagement. Keywords: immune response

DESIGN
2-4x106 lymph node cells from AND TCR-transgenic animals that expressed the congenic marker CD90.1 were transferred into double-transgenic (Ii-rTA/TIM) recipient animals that expressed the corresponding peptide from moth cytochrome c under a doxycycline-controllable promoter and were FACS-sorted 60 hours later. Recipients expressed the antigen not at all (“ctrl”), transiently (“short”) or throughout the experiment (“long”) due to different doxycycline treatment protocols. A second variable tested was the activation status of the dendritic cells: recipients were either injected by the stimulatory antibody FGK45.5 targeting CD40 (“FGK”) or PBS (“PBS”).
