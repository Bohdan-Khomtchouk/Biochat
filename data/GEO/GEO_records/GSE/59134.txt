TITLE
Assessment of patient-derived tumour xenografts (PDXs) as a discovery tool for cancer epigenomics [methylation profiling by array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA Methylation BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in Osteosarcoma and Colon Cancer PDXs

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from each sample was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation BeadChip.

PLATFORM
