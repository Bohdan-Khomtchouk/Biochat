TITLE
Expression analysis of wildtype (OregonG) and upSET mutant ovaries.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Developmental gene expression results from the orchestrated interplay between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we describe upSET, a transcriptional regulator encoding a SET domaincontaining protein recruited to active and inducible genes in Drosophila. However, unlike other Drosophila SET proteins associated with gene transcription, UpSET is part of an Rpd3/Sin3-containing complex that restricts chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation to promoter regions. In the absence of UpSET, active chromatin marks and chromatin accessibility increase and spread to genic and flanking regions due to destabilization of the histone deacetylase complex. Consistent with this, transcriptional noise increases, as manifest by activation of repetitive elements and off-target genes. Interestingly, upSET mutant flies are female sterile due to upregulation of key components of Notch signaling during oogenesis. Thus UpSET defines a class of metazoan transcriptional regulators required to fine tune transcription by preventing the spread of active chromatin.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate dissections wild-type ovaries and three separate dissections of epic mutant ovaries.  Each chip measures the expression level of 15,473 genes from Drosophila melanogaster with four 60-mer probes per target gene. Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in epic(e00365) mutants, compared to the wild-type strain (OregonG).  The mutation was generated by the insertion of the PBac{WH}CG9007e000365 transposon. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Rincon-Arano H., et al 2012. in Press.
