TITLE
Transcriptional changes associated with woolliness during fruit ripening in Prunus persica

ORGANISM
Prunus persica

SUMMARY
During ripening of fruits stored under low temperatures, a number of physiological alterations which are manifested in a reduction of juice content take place, resulting in the apparition of woolly fruits. Modifications in cell wall structure during the ripening process are proposed to be key to determine the decreasing of juice content in woolly fruits. Under the assumption that changes in relative abundance of genes related to cell wall metabolism would be involved in woolliness development, in this work we present an analysis of the expression of multiple genes, which serves as an approximation to uncover the mechanisms behind this physiological alteration. The expression of 847 genes was examined using macroarrays hybridizations. Membranes were  hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs synthesized from mRNAs of juice and woolly peaches. The results showed that 67.5% of the clones (n = 573) fulfilled all filter criteria and they were selected for sequence analysis. Our analysis indicate that 45% of transcripts which present a consistent expression level in all biological replicates are activated exclusively in juice condition, and only 15% in woolly fruits. In the resting 40% (transcripts common to both conditions,) only 5% presents an abundance increase in woolly samples. Keywords: Analysis of physiological disorder in peaches
