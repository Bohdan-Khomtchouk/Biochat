TITLE
Human monocyte-derived DCs: effect of IL-4 superkines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression induced by IL-4 and IL-4 superkines on CD14+ monocytes cultured in the presence of GM-CSF. Super-4 and KFR signal preferentially through the type I and type II IL-4 receptor, respectively.

DESIGN
Five biological replicates (n=5 healthy donors), four conditions: GM-CSF alone or in combination with IL-4, Super-4 or KFR. Two colors: Cy3 for GM-CSF alone, Cy5 for any combination. Cells were cultured for 6 hours with 50 ng/ml of GM-CSF and 20 ng/ml of IL-4, Super-4 or KFR.
