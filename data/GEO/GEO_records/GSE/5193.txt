TITLE
Neuronal differentiation-associated gene profiling of the CHB50 cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify neuronal differentiation associated gene candidates Keywords: Compared differentiated (-tsTA/+p53 condition) CHB50 cells to proliferating (+tsTA/-p53 condition) CHB50 cells

DESIGN
We compared two, dual labeled, 9K mouse cDNA arrays, where one channel (Ch1) corresponds to the control (proliferation) condition and channel two corresponds to the treatment (differentiation) condition "

PLATFORM
GPL3956 Incyte Genomics Mouse Life Array v1.16 and v1.26
