TITLE
Multi-omics Profiling of Younger Asian Breast Cancers Reveals Distinctive Molecular Signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We observed higher proportions of HER2+ and Luminal B but lower proportions of ER+ and Luminal A subtypes along with lower estrogen receptor (ER) expression in SMC compared to TCGA. Germline pathogenic mutations affecting BRCA1 or BRCA2 were found in 11% of SMC but only 5% of TCGA. TP53 was also more frequently mutated in SMC (48%) than in TCGA (32%).

DESIGN
178 samples (168 tumors, 10 normals) from whole transcriptome sequencing

PLATFORM
