TITLE
RNA expression analysis of lineage-negative marrow progenitors after Cebpa knockdown.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global RNA expression of Cebpa knockdown lineage-negative marrow cells reveals known and potentially novel C/EBPa targets.

DESIGN
Total RNA from lineage-negative marrow progenitors transduced with vector or Cebpa shRNA and cultured under myeloid differentiation condition for 2 days were compared.
