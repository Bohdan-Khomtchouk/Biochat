TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans delta-doa1 mutant

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The Candida albicans delta-doa1 mutant was investigated. This mutant shows lots of phenotypes. Doa1 protein has several WD 40 repeats. Keywords: mutant versus wildtype, comparative expression analysis

DESIGN
The expression of the Candida albicans delta-doa1 mutant was compared with that of the strain CAF2-1. The strains were grown equally as mentioned in the description of each sample. The samples include biological repeat and dye swap. Samples part 1 and 2 are Eurogentec arrays of the batch G300C and part 3 of the batch H210C.
