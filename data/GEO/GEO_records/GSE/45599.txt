TITLE
Mock, latent, and lytic rKSHV.219-infected iSLK cells [Expt3]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of stably infected epithelial cells using a custom tiling microarray. iSLK was infected with rKSHV.219 and selected with puromycin. Mock infected iSLK served as control for iSLK.219. Lytic reactivation of iSLK.219 was induced with 1 ug/mL doxycycline for 48 hours.
