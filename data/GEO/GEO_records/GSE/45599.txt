TITLE
Mock, latent, and lytic rKSHV.219-infected iSLK cells [Expt3]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 8 ; Human herpesvirus 8 strain rKSHV.219

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of stably infected epithelial cells using a custom tiling microarray. iSLK was infected with rKSHV.219 and selected with puromycin. Mock infected iSLK served as control for iSLK.219. Lytic reactivation of iSLK.219 was induced with 1 ug/mL doxycycline for 48 hours.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment: mock infected, latently infected, and lytically induced rKSHV.219-infected iSLK cells.

PLATFORM
