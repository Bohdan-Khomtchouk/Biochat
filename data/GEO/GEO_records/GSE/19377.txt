TITLE
DNA microarrays time course of SKO-infected MEFs treated with Vc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand the global gene expression changes resulting from the addition of vitamin C (Vc) to SKO (sox2, klf4 and oct4)-transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we used microarray to compare the gene expression profile at different time points with or without Vc.

DESIGN
MEFs were infected at Day 0 (D0) with SKO or GFP retroviruses (control), and TRIZOL cell lysates were prepared from D3 of GFP-MEFs, and D3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 of SKO-MEFs, with or without Vc.
