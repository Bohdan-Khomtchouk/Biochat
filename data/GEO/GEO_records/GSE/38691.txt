TITLE
Small RNA transcriptome in the Squalius alburnoides complex

ORGANISM
Squalius alburnoides ; Squalius pyrenaicus

SUMMARY
The Squalius alburnoides complex (Steindachner) is one of the most intricate hybrid polyploid systems known in vertebrates. In this complex, the constant switch of the genome composition in consecutive generations, very frequently involving a change on the ploidy level, promotes repetitive situations of potential genomic shock. Previously in this complex, it was shown that in response to the increase in the genome dosage, triploid hybrids could regulate gene expression to a diploid state. In this work, we compared the small RNA profiles in the different genomic compositions interacting in the complex. Using high-throughput arrays and sequencing technologies, we were able to verify that diploid and triploid hybrids were closely related: they shared most of their sequences and their miRNA expression profiles were highly correlated. However, an overall view indicates an up-regulation of a substantial number of miRNAs in triploids. Also, the global miRNA expression in triploids was higher than predicted from an additive model. These results point to a participation of miRNAs in the cellular functional stability needed when the ploidy change.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed corresponding to 4 genomic constitutions: PAA, PA, AA and PP. For each sample, a library based on 3 individuals of the same genomic constitution was prepared. From each individual, 3 types of tissues were collected for RNA extraction (brain, liver and muscle).
