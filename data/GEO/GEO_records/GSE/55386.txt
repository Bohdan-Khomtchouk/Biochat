TITLE
IL-5-mediated gene expression in LDBM cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of LDBM cells stimulated with IL-5

DESIGN
LDBM cells were stimulated in liquid cultures with SCF and FLT3L to expand progenitors, then stimulated with IL-5 to promote eosinophil differentiation. Cultured LDBM cells were harvested after 4 days and 10 days of IL-5 stimulation.
