TITLE
Pluripotent stem cell disease modeling of GATA6 haploinsufficiency in human pancreatic development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand molecular mechanisms of human pancreatic development associated with GATA6 haploinsufficiency, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize the biological processes affected by GATA6 heterozygous mutation. We identified 542 differential expression genes in the mutants, of which 310 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that top downregulated transcription factors were associated with developmental process.

DESIGN
Examination of two wild-type and two GATA6-/+ HUES8 lines at the PP1 stage using the first-generation pancreatic differentiation protocol

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
