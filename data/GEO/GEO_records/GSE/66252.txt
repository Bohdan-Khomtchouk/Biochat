TITLE
A MYC-driven change in mitochondrial dynamics limits stem cell properties of mammary epithelial cells (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In several developmental lineages, an increase in expression of the MYC proto-oncogene drives the transition from quiescent stem cells to transit amplifying cells. The mechanism by which MYC restricts self-renewal of adult stem cells is unknown. Here, we show that MYC activates a stereotypic transcriptional program of genes involved in protein translation and mitochondrial biogenesis in mammary epithelial cells and indirectly inhibits the YAP/TAZ co-activators that are essential for mammary stem cell self-renewal. We identify a phospholipase of the mitochondrial outer membrane, PLD6, as the mediator of MYC activity. PLD6 mediates a change in the mitochondrial fusion/fission balance that promotes nuclear export of YAP/TAZ in a LATS- and RHO-independent manner. Mouse models and human pathological data confirm that MYC suppresses YAP/TAZ activity in mammary tumors. PLD6 is also required for glutaminolysis, arguing that MYC-dependent changes in mitochondrial dynamics balance cellular energy metabolism with the self-renewal potential of adult stem cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq experiments for MYC-HA (HA-IP) performed in IMEC primary breast epithelial cells. Input-samples were sequenced as controlls.
