TITLE
Embryonic neocortical HuR-immunoprecipitated mRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Forkhead-box domain (Fox) containing family members are known autism spectrum associated genes. Here we show that, within the developing neocortex, the distinct phospho-states of a single RNA-binding protein, Hu antigen R, dictate mRNA translation and are sufficient to define distinct Foxp-characterized subpopulations of neocortical projection neurons. This demonstrates the importance of HuR phospho-states within the framework of the developing brain and further confirms the role of mRNA translation in autism pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Fetal mouse neocortices were dissected, homogenized, and immunoprecipitated with either anti-HuR or IgG control antibodies.  RNA was prepared from the immunoprecipitates and assayed on Affymetrix Mouse Exon microarrays.
