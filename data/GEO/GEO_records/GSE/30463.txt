TITLE
Changes in rice NILs root expression profile in response to drought stress at reproductive stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The current knowledge of drought stress transcriptomes in rice are mostly relying on comparative studies of diverse genetic background under drought. A more reliable approach is to use near-isogenic lines (NILs) with a common genetic background (Donar parent: Aday Sel, Recurrent parent: IR64),  but contrasting levels of resistance to drought stress under initial exposure to water deficit. Here, we examined two pairs of NILs in IR64 background with contrasting drought tolerance. We obtained gene expression profile in roots of rice NILs under different levels of drought stress help to identify genes and mechanisms involved in drought stress.
