TITLE
DCP5, a highly conserved P-body-nucleating protein, regulates multiple small RNA-mediated silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (smRNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) negatively regulate their targets by 1) repressing translation, 2) endonucleolytic RNA cleavage, or 3) DNA methylation resulting in transcriptional silencing. P-body/decapping components are likely required for translational repression, but are not known to function in other posttranscriptional regulatory pathways or to affect smRNA levels. Here, we show that the P-body/decapping protein DCP5 is required for miRNA-mediated translational repression but not cleavage, and to regulate the transcription of specific miRNAs. We find that this protein also affects the abundance of tRNA-derived smRNAs. Significantly, DCP5 is required for the transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation of numerous transposable/repetitive elements and imprinted genes, indicating that it is a novel component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Our results demonstrate that DCP5 and likely the P-body itself are required for multiple smRNA-mediated silencing pathways and provide the first evidence for the spatial separation of translational inhibition and cleavage by miRNAs.
