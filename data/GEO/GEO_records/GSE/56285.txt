TITLE
N-octanoyl dopamine treatment of endothelial cells induces the unfolded protein response and results in hypometabolism and tolerance to hypothermia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N-octanoyl dopamine (NOD), but not dopamine dose dependently induces the UPR. This was also found for other synthetic N-Acyl dopamine derivates (NADD). Induction of the UPR was dependent on the redox activity of NADD and was not caused by selective activation of a particular UPR sensor. UPR induction did not result in cell apoptosis, yet NOD strongly impaired cell proliferation by attenuation of cells in the S-G2/M phase. Long-term treatment of HUVEC with low NOD concentration showed decreased intracellular ATP concentration paralleled with activation of AMPK. These cells were significantly more resistant to cold inflicted injury. N-octanoyl dopamine (NOD) and other synthetic N-Acyl dopamine derivates (NADD), but not dopamine dose dependently induces the UPR. Long-term treatment of HUVEC with low NOD concentration showed decreased intracellular ATP concentration paralleled with activation of AMPK.

DESIGN
Genome wide gene expression profiling, confirmatory qPCR and reporter assays were employed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to validate induction of UPR target genes and UPR sensor activation by NOD
