TITLE
Stochastic genome-nuclear lamina interactions: Modulating roles of Lamin A and BAF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear lamina (NL) is a filamentous layer lining the inner-nuclear-membrane (INM) that aids in the organization of the genome in large domains of low transcriptional activity. Recently, it was shown that the single-cell genome-NL interactions are much more dynamic than previously anticipated, which challenges the concept of the NL as a safe guard for transcriptional repressed genes. Here we discuss the role of the NL in light of these new findings and introduce Lamin A and BAF as potential modulators of LAD positioning

DESIGN
BAF-chromatin and Lamin B2-chromatin interactions were assayed in human HT1080 by DamID on Nimblegen microarrays, with two biological replicates each, that were hybridized in a dye-swap design.
