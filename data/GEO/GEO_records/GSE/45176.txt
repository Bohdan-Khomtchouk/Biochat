TITLE
RNA-seq expression analysis to determine expression profile similarities between fibroblasts, induced endothelial cells from fibroblasts, and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the similarity between human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, induced endothelial cells from fibroblasts, and fibroblasts through RNA-seq expression analysis.  RNA samples from independently induced cultures, plus fibroblast and human dermal microvascular endothelial cultures were converted into individual cDNA libraries using Illumina TruSeq methods and subjected to single-end 50 base-sequence analysis at 20-30 million read depths.

DESIGN
Examination of one fibroblast culture, one human dermal mibrovascular endothelial cell culture, and two induced endothelial cell cultures.
