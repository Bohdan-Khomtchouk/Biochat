TITLE
Transcriptome profile of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages treated with 15d-PGJ2 or 15d-PGJ2-PC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate the alteration of gene expression pattern induced by 15d-PGJ2 or 15d-PGJ2-PC in BMDMs. Method: BMDMs obtained from C57BL/6 mice were treated with 15d-PGJ2, 15d-PGJ2-PC or media control for 6h. Then RNA sequence was generated by using the Illumina system. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 13 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome and identified about 14,500 transcripts in the macrophage mRNAs. Among them, 719 and 286 genes were differentially expressed in 15d-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2-PC group respectively. Conclusions: Deoxy-A2/J2-IsoP-PC are a novel series of oxidation products we identified in atherosclerotic plaques. 15d-PGJ2-PC is a representative compound of these oxidation products we chemically synthesised. Using RNA-seq technology, we provided 15d-PGJ2-PC induced gene expression profile and could contribute to  study the roles of these novel oxidation products in the atherosclerosis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of BMDMs from C57B/L6 mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina.
