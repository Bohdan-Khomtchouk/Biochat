TITLE
small RNA discovery in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces japonicus

SUMMARY
We used massively parallel sequencing to discover and characterize small RNAs (sRNAs) from fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. We found that, unlike in related S. pombe, a substantial fraction of sRNAs maps to transposons, both telomeric and centromeric.

DESIGN
small RNA library from total RNA isolations from Schizosaccharomyces japonicus
