TITLE
Blockade of oncogenic IkappaB kinase activity in ABC DLBCL by small molecule BET protein inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NF-kappaB activity is essential for viability of the malignant cells and is sustained by constitutive activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK) in the cytoplasm. Here, we report an unexpected role for the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins BRD2 and BRD4 in maintaining oncogenic IKK activity in ABC DLBCL. IKK activity was reduced by small molecules targeting BET proteins as well as by genetic knockdown of BRD2 and BRD4 expression, thereby inhibiting downstream NF-kappaB-driven transcriptional programs and killing ABC DLBCL cells. Using a high-throughput platform to screen for drug-drug synergy, we observed that the BET inhibitor JQ1 combined favorably with multiple drugs targeting B cell receptor signaling, one pathway that activates IKK in ABC DLBCL. The BTK kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, which is in clinical development for the treatment of ABC DLBCL, synergized strongly with BET inhibitors in killing ABC DLBCL cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical development of BET protein inhibitors in ABC DLBCL, particularly in combination with other modulators of oncogenic IKK signaling.

DESIGN
For JQ1 time course gene expression profiling, HBL1 and LP1 cells were treated with either DMSO or 100nM JQ1 for 1h, 3h, 8h, and 24h. For shRNA gene expression profiling, HBL1 cells were infected with either a Ctrl shRNA or with shRNA targeting BRD2 or BRD4. Following puromycin selection, shRNA expression was induced for 1 day and 2 days.
