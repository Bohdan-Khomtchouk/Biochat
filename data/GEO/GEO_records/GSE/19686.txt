TITLE
shGFP- and shQK-transduced human Hs683 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify potential QK-regulated mRNAs and linked pathways by comparing the transcriptional profiles of shGFP- and shQK-transduced human Hs683 cells

DESIGN
Hs683 cells infected with shQk-2, shQk-5 and Hs683 cells infected with shGFP as control
