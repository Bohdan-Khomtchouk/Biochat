TITLE
Dissecting primary (translation independent) from secondary (translation dependent) IFN-mediated differential gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH-3T3 cells were pretreated for 15 min with either DMSO (mock) or cycloheximide followed by addition of either mock, 100 U/ml IFNalpha or 100 U/ml IFNgamma for 1h. During the last 30 min, 500 µM 4-thiouridine was added to cell culture medium. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent and nascent RNA was purified as described (Dölken et al. RNA 2008) . Three replicates of nascent RNA were analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 arrays

DESIGN
Primary (translation independent) from secondary (translation dependent) IFN-mediated differential gene expression were studied in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts by studying studying differential gene expression in presence and absence of Cycloheximide (CHX). In addition, the effect of 75 min CHX during the last 30 min of treatment was studied in nascent RNA.
