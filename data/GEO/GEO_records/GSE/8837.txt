TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by the novel Rho GTPase RhoBTB2.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoBTB2 is a novel Rho GTPase that undergoes loss, underexpression and mutation in breast and lung cancer. We have shown that we can mimic loss of RhoBTB2 through siRNA treatment of primary cells. We propose to perform comparative microarray analysis of primary lung cells to establish the identification of the gene targets of RhoBTb2 regulation. Keywords: Effects of siRNA expression

DESIGN
Primary lung cells (NHBE) transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides against cyclophilin or Lamin A/C (controls) were compared to cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides against RhoBTB2. We used two siRNA oligonucleotides against RhoBTB2 (1 and 2) to determine any non-specific effects. Cells expressed the siRNA oligonucleotides for 72 hours before total RNA extraction. 10 samples have been analysed.
