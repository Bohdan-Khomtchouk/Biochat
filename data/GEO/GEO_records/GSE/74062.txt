TITLE
Expression data from mice epididymal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Visceral white adipose tissue is closed correlated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction.  Epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) is considered as typical visceral white adipose tissue. Induction of browning of white adipose tissue improves metabolic dysfunction such as insulin resistance. In contrast to mice subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral fat do not show significant browning under 4°C. However,under physiologically tolerable low temperature visceral adipose tissue can turn brown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in C57Bl/6 mice epididymal adipose tissue exposed to thermoneutral 30°C, 4°C and temperatures lower than 4°C.

DESIGN
Epididymal adipose tissues from mice exposed to 30°C, 4°C, -10°C and -20°C(short for -10°C/-20°C) were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.Temperature exposure last for 5 weeks, counting in the 4°C adaptation for cold groups. Three samples for each temperature were selected.
