TITLE
P. vivax: proof-of-principle global transcription analysis from two wild isolates

ORGANISM
Plasmodium vivax

SUMMARY
The complete genome sequence of the P. vivax Sal-1 strain allowed the design of a first version array representing 1 oligo/2 kb of coding sequences ( ). Here, proof-of-principle experiments using total RNA of parasites obtained from the Sal-1 strain, from P. falciparum and from parasites obtained directly from two human patients are presented. Keywords: expression profiles
