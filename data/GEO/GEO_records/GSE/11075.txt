TITLE
P. vivax: proof-of-principle global transcription analysis from two wild isolates

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum ; Plasmodium vivax

SUMMARY
The complete genome sequence of the P. vivax Sal-1 strain allowed the design of a first version array representing 1 oligo/2 kb of coding sequences ( http://zblab.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/vivax/index.html ). Here, proof-of-principle experiments using total RNA of parasites obtained from the Sal-1 strain, from P. falciparum and from parasites obtained directly from two human patients are presented. Keywords: expression profiles

DESIGN
To determine the extent of cross-hybridization of P. falciparum with P. vivax, and to determine overlaps in expression profiles of the P. vivax Sal1 monkey-adapted strain vs wild isolates, single dual hybridization analyses were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6667 P. vivax exon array v1.0 using oligos designed by Z. Bozdech and  G. Hu
