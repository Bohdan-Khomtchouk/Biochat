TITLE
Activation of SREBP in Alveolar Type II Cells Enhances Lipogenesis Causing Pulmonary Lipotoxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background:  Lung function is dependent upon the precise regulation of the synthesis, storage, and catabolism of tissue and alveolar lipids. Results:  Activation of SREBP (Sterol Response Element Binding Protein) induced lipogenesis in alveolar epithelial cells, causing neutral lipid accumulation, lung inflammation, and tissue remodeling. Conclusions:  The accumulation of neutral lipids in type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages caused lung inflammation, consistent with findings in lipid storage disorders. Significance:  Pulmonary lipotoxicity may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung dysfunction associated with diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic disorders.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcription profiling comparison between doxycycline-exposed SFTPC-rtTAWT/Tg/(tetO)7CMV-CreWT/Tg/Insig1flox/flox/Insig2-/- mice (i.e., Insig1/2∆/∆  ) and Insig1flox/flox/Insig2-/- . Three independent pooled RNA from isolated lung type 2 cells of each genotype were used.
