TITLE
The miRNAome of the postpartum dairy cow liver in negative energy balance

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Negative energy balance (NEB) is an altered metabolic state in high yielding cows that occurs during the first few weeks postpartum when energy demands for lactation and maintenance exceed the energy supply from dietary intake. NEB can, in turn, lead to metabolic disorders and to reduced fertility. Alterations in the expression of more than 700 hepatic genes have previously been reported in a study of NEB in postpartum dairy cows. miRNAs (microRNA) are known to mediate many alterations in gene expression post transcriptionally. To study the hepatic miRNA content of postpartum dairy cows, including their overall abundance and differential expression, in mild NEB (MNEB) and severe NEB (SNEB) short read RNA sequencing was carried out.

DESIGN
A NEB dairy cow model developed previously was used. In this model differential feeding and milking regimes were used to produce two groups of Holstein Friesian cows; MNEB and SNEB. Briefly, MNEB cows were fed ad libitum grass silage with 8 kg/day of a 21% crude protein dairy concentrate and milked once daily. SNEB cows were fed 25 kg/day silage with 4 kg/day concentrate and milked thrice daily. All procedures were carried out under license in accordance with the European Community Directive, 86-609-EC. Cows were slaughtered approximately 14 days postpartum (MNEB; 13.6 ± 0.75, range 11–15; SNEB 14.3 ± 0.56, range 13–16 ) and the entire liver was removed within 15 to 30 min.  Samples weighing approximately 1 g were dissected, rinsed in RNase-free phosphate buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Liver tissue samples from 5 SNEB and 3 MNEB animals were used for miRNA library preparation.
