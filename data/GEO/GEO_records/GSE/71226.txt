TITLE
Expression data from coronary heart disease in Chinese Han people

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genetics, social, cultural and environmental factors pose a great challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease among different racial groups. We aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes involved in coronary heart disease in Chinese Han people as an aid for screening and diagnosing coronary heart disease. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression to identify the differentially gene between the patients with coronary heart disease and healthy people in Chinese Han people

DESIGN
Three patients with coronary heart disease and three healthy people in Chinese Han people were recruited,total RNA of each samples were extracted from peripheral blood to hybridize with Affymetrix microarrays.
