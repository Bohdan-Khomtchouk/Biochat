TITLE
Gene expression in roots of slim1 and the parental line grown +/-S condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants utilize soil sulfate for production of sulfur-containing amino acids that serve as essential dietary sulfur sources for animals. Despite the global nutritional significance of this fundamental metabolic process in nature, transcription factors regulating the plant sulfur assimilation pathways have never been discovered. We isolated sulfur limitation1 (slim1) mutants from Arabidopsis, showing abnormally low expression of SULTR1;2 sulfate transporter, by screening responsiveness of SULTR1;2 promoter-GFP, as an indicator, to sulfur limitation.  SLIM1 encoded an EIL-family transcription factor, EIL3. To clarify the siganificance of SLIM1 function in sulfur responsive gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles in slim1-1, slim1-2 and the parental line under +S and -S conditions. Keywords: comparison of mutant and wild type, sulfur limitation response, nutritional stress response
