TITLE
Identification of genes involved in enhancement of hyperthermia sensitivity by knockdown of BAG3 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyperthermia (HT) treatments in combination with either chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both are used for patients with cancer in various organs. However, the acquisition of thermotolerance in cancer cells due to the increase in cytoprotective proteins attenuates the therapeutic effects of HT. BAG3 (BCL2-associated athanogene 3) is a cytoprotective protein that acts against various stresses including heat stress. Recently, we demonstrated that the inhibition of BAG3 improves cell death sensitivity to HT in cancer cells. However, a detailed molecular mechanism involved in the enhancement of HT sensitivity by BAG3-knockdown (KD) in cancer cells is unclear. In this study, to identify genes involved in the enhancement of HT sensitivity by BAG3-knockdown (KD) in cancer cells, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
Human oral squamous carcinoma cell HSC-3 cells were treated with a combination of HT (at 44°C for 90 min) and siRNA for BAG3 or luciferase. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
