SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of mRNA expression in human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to colorectal cancer cell derived stimuli

DESIGN
Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were seeded at 3x10˄5 cells  in complete EGM2-MV growth medium on PET transwells of 1 µm pore size to form a confluent layer within 24 h and were then cultured for another 24 h in EGM2-MV medium including 5% FCS but no additional growth factor supplements. HT-29 colon carcinoma cells were seeded in the same growth medium at 4x10˄6 per 30 mm well and conditioned supernatant was collected from 24 to 48 h after cell seeding. HMEC cultures in transwells were left untreated or were stimulated by tumor-conditioned medium from the basal (experiment 1) or apical (experiment 2) side for 4 hours prior to isolation of total RNA.
