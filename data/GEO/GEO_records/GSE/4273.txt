TITLE
F8 broiler by Leghorn and broiler by Fayoumi spleen at day 7 and 8 after challenge with SE

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In the two F8 advanced crosses of broiler by Leghorn and broiler by Fayoumi, birds at day 1 were challenged with Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Spleen were collected at day 7 and 8. SE bacterial load in spleen were measured. Based on the bacterial load, birds were divided into high and low SE load groups. Keywords: Salmonella enteritidis challenge

DESIGN
At each line cross and each day time point, three pair comparisons among high SE load, low SE load, and non-SE were used for the loop design, and two biological replicates were used.
