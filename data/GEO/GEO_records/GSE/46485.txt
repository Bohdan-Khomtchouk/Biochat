TITLE
JMJD1C knockdown (H9_CT2_JMJD1C-KD_Microarray_JW)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been recently reported that the pluripotency factor OCT4, the early neural inducing factor NR2F2, and the pluripotency-associated miRNA miR-302 are linked in a regulatory circuitry that critically regulate both pluripotency and neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We show here that JMJD1C, a H3K9 demethylase expressed in undifferentiated hESCs, plays a key role in the regulatory circuitry. hESCs with JMJD1C knockdown (KD) retain the state of self-renewal and pluripotency, but express lower miR-302c than control hESCs. JMJD1C directly binds to the miR-302 promoter in hESCs and reduces H3K9 methylation on the promoter. Upon withdrawal of bFGF (an inhibitor of neural initiation) from a defined culture medium, the KD, but not control, hESCs differentiate into neural progenitors within three days â€“ the fastest ever reported, accompanied by rapid increase of NR2F2 expression. A miR-302c analogue or an inhibitor of H3K9 methylation reduces neural induction from the KD hESCs, whereas a miR-302c inhibitor promotes hESC differentiation. Together, our findings suggest that JMJD1C plays a central role in control of neural differentiation from hESCs, which involves sustained miR-302c expression, and that inhibition of JMJD1C is sufficient to rapidly induce neural progenitors from hESCs in the defined medium depleted of bFGF. This is also the first evidence, to our knowledge, for epigenetic modification of miR-302 in hESCs.

DESIGN
6 human ES cell lines were used in this microarray assay. Each line has two replicates.
