TITLE
Microarray between Normal and SMAR1 overexpression B16F10 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present microarray studies the differential transcription levels of various genes upon overexpression of tumor suppressor protein SMAR1. The results will lead us to potential targets which are either up/downregulated by SMAR1.

DESIGN
