TITLE
Age and diet affect genetically separable secondary injuries that cause acute mortatlity following traumatic brain injury in Drosophia

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in TBI outcomes in Drosophila we compared genome-wide mRNA expression of uninjured and injured flies under both age and diet conditions.

DESIGN
Whole male fly mRNA profiles of 0-7 day and 20-27d old Drosophila line w1118 were generated, with or without injury and under two different dietary conditions.  Experiments were preformed in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
