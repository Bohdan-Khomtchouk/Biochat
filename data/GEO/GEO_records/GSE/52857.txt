TITLE
Expression data in splenic DC subsets in wild type and Xbp1 deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Xbp1 is a major transcription factor in the unfolded protein response. To uncover its function in DCs we generated a conditional KO for Xbp1 in dendritic cells. We here compare the expression of mRNAs in two different splenic DC subpopulations, CD8a and CD11b DCs in both WT and KO mice. Reference: Inositol-requiring enzyme 1-alpha regulates CD8a dendritic cell function via regulated mRNA decay. Osorio et al, Nature Immunology (2014)

DESIGN
Primary DC subsets were isolated and sorted from spleens from 3 different WT or CD11c-cre Xbp-1fl/fl mice. RNA was isolated, converted to cDNA and then hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (GPL6246).
