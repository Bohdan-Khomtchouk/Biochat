SUMMARY
Gene expression of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using double-stranded cDNA followed by bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to AtTILE1 forward array. Study on gene expression polymorphism between arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Van-0. Study on the inheritance of gene expression in reciprocal hybrids. Keywords: cDNA hybridization

DESIGN
Each genotype has four replicates, Single chanel. Total four genotypes (Col, Van, Col female x Van male, Van female x Col male). Total 16 samples.

PLATFORM
