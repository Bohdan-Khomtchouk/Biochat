TITLE
Gene expression of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene expression of Col, Van and reciprocal hybrids using double-stranded cDNA followed by bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to AtTILE1 forward array. Study on gene expression polymorphism between arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Van-0. Study on the inheritance of gene expression in reciprocal hybrids. Keywords: cDNA hybridization
