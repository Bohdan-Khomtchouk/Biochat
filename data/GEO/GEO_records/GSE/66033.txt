TITLE
Essential Role of Sirt2 in Type I Interferon Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide evidence for the essential role of Sirt2 in IFN mediated signaling. Our studies demonstrate that SIRT2 controls expression of key interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate important biological functions, including anti-viral and antineoplastic responses.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from untreated and IFNβ-treated Sirt2+/+ and Sirt2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Cells were treated for 4hours with or without mouse IFNβ (2500 IU/ml).
