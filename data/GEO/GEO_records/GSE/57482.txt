TITLE
Increased expression of BubR1 protects against aneuploidy in aging oocytes and extends reproductive lifespan

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromosome aneuploidy increases in oocytes with maternal age, and is considered the leading cause for the increased incidence of infertility, miscarriage, and birth defects. Using mRNA-Sequencing of oocytes from 12 month old mouse versus 3 month young mouse, we identified a spindle assembly checkpoint gene, BubR1, whose expression was significantly decreased. We employed a mRNA microinjection based approach to increase BubR1 expression in aging oocytes. We find that increased expression of BubR1 protects against aneuploidy and chromosome misalignment in aging oocytes. After in vitro fertilization, the embryos derived from BubR1 increased expression aging oocytes exhibited chromosome stability as robust as those of the young ones. Furthermore, following embryo transfer, these embryos showed greatly improved developmental competency, with comparable levels of full-term development to those of the young ones. These results indicate that the decline in oocyte quality may be reversible and could lead to treatments that prolong female fertility.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of maternal aging on the mRNA expression in the mature oocytes of the female mice. Naturally ovulated mature oocytes (MII stage) were collected from 6 young (3 month) and 6 aging (12 month) female mice (3 oocytes per mice, 18 oocytes for each group).
