TITLE
MiR-511 dependently expressed genes in monoblastic cell line THP1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To experimentally investigate the function of hsa-miR-511-5p in AML monoblasts, we employed miRNA mimic mediated up-regulation of miR-511 in THP1 cells and subsequently analyzed a comprehensive gene expression profile.

DESIGN
4 samples of two independent miRNA mimic experiments were analyzed. THP1 monoblasts were transfected with 30 nM of Ambion Pre-miR miRNA Precursors (hsa-miR-511-5p AM10237 or negative Control #1 AM17110, Life Technologies).
