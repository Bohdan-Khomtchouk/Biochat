TITLE
Human lung MPC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison of gene expression between control versus IPF human lung MPC using human Affy 1.0st chips. This work was funded by grants to S.M. Majka from the NIH R01HL091105 and NIH R01HL11659701. Additional funding was also provided by PPG-5P01HL108800-04 (PI:J. Loyd). Experiments were performed using the University of Colorado Cancer Center Microarray core (NCI P30 CA 46934-14). The project was supported in part by the National Center for Research Resources, Grant UL1 RR024975-01, and is now at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Grant 2 UL1 TR000445-06.

DESIGN
Human lung MPC were isolated from explanted tissue, expanded and characterized as previously published in Marriott et al. 2014. ABCG2(pos) lung mesenchymal stem cells are a novel pericyte subpopulation that contributes to fibrotic remodeling. American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology.C684-C698. 5 controls and 4 IPF cell lines from independent patients were used. RNA was isolated using a Qiagen kit and chips run by the University of Colorado Gene Expression Core facility. Data Analysis was performed by Swapna Menon, AnalyzeDat, India.
