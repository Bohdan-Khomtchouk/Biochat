TITLE
The biphasic Fusarium graminearum transcriptome during symptomless and symptomatic wheat infection

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
The analysis of the Fusarium graminearum transcriptome during symptomless and symptomatic infections of wheat floral tissue at 7 days post infection, to identify the correct spatio-temperol regulation of multiple virulence strategies.

DESIGN
Fusarium graminearum PH-1 was inoculated into the floral cavity of the two florets, of the two spikelets, in the middle of the wheat head. At 7 days post infection the inoculated spikelets and the 7 sequential rachis internodes below the inoculated spikelet were collected. The individual wheat tissues were pooled for ten wheat heads to form a single biological replicate. Non-infected wheat spikelets and rachis was collected as a negative control. Three biological replicate were collected per treatment.
