TITLE
Expression data from WT or p65-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with Toxoplasma gondii.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma strains have been shown to modulate host cell transcription.  We have found a type II Toxoplasma gene, GRA15, which activates the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 transcription factor. We used microarrays to determine how GRA15II modulates host cell transcription, and whether this transcription is dependent on the p65 transcription factor.

DESIGN
WT or p65-/- MEFs were infected with type I (RH), type I GRA15II (RH GRA15II), type II (Pru), or type II GRA15KO (Pru GRA15KO) parasites for 18-24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays.
