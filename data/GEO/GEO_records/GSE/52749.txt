TITLE
Early and late changes in gene and miRNA expression after hepatitis B or C infection in human hepatocyte chimeric mice [serum_miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in gene and microRNA expression 10 days and 8 weeks after infection with hepatitis B and C virus and with or without interferon administration was determined in human hepatocyte chimeric mice.

DESIGN
68 immunodeficient human hepatocyte chimeric mice were allocated into 8 experimental groups. 25 mice were infected with HBV, 22 were infected with HCV, and 21 were reserved as controls. 5 HBV-infected mice and 5 HCV-infected mice were sacrificed at 10 days. Half of the remaining mice were injected with interferon prior to sacrifice, and all mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks. Please note that only 44 serum samples and 51 tissue samples (out of 68 samples) were included in the study due to RNA degradataion and contamination.
