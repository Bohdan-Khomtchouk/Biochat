TITLE
mRNA analysis in different mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The functioning of a specific tissue depends on the expression pattern of the different genes. We used microarrays to compare gene expression across different murine tissues, to get a better understanding in the expression pattern and functioning of the different tissues. With this analysis, we were not only able to identify genes that were specifically expressed in a spicific tissue but, as important, we also identified genes that were specifically repressed in a tissue, compared to al the other analysed tissues.

DESIGN
C57Bl6/j6 (Janvier) mice between 10 and 12 weeks old were used to isolate 22 different tissues. Mainly male mice were used, except for placenta and ovary, where female mice were used. Also the mouse insulinoma cellline MIN6 was analysed in this study. For every tissue, at least 3 biological replicates were used.
