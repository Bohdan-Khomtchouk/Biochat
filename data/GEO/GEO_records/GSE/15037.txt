TITLE
Foxo1 target genes in mouse T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from wild-type and Foxo1-deficient mice were analyzed by global gene expression profiling with Affymetrix array MOE 430 2.0. Results indicate Foxo1 regulates the expression of genes encoding positive regulators of T cell activation, differentiation, homeostasis, cell adhesion, cell migration, and cellular stress responses.

DESIGN
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
