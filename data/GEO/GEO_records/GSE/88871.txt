TITLE
SPOP mutation confers intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in prostate cancer (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors are emerging as promising therapeutics of cancers including prostate cancer.  The E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is implicated in human prostate cancers due to its frequent mutation.  Here we demonstrate that SPOP binds to the BET proteins BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4.  Wild-type SPOP, but not prostate cancer-associated mutants, promotes polyubiquitination and proteasome degradation of BET proteins by recognizing a common degron motif.  BET protein levels are highly elevated in SPOP-mutated prostate cancers in patients.  Expression of cancer-derived SPOP mutants upregulates cholesterol biosynthesis genes and confers resistance to the BET inhibitor in cultured prostate cancer cells and tumors in mice, and this effect can be overcome by the AKT inhibitor.  Our findings reveal BET proteins as proteolytic targets of SPOP and identify deregulated cholesterol biosynthesis as a downstream event of SPOP mutation-mediated tumorigenesis and therapy resistance in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Examination of BRD4 binding  in  SPOP wt and mutation stable cell lines with JQ1 treatment or in the BRD4 overexpression cells.
