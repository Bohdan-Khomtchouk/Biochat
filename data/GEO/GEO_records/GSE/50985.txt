TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of a nickel-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant obtained by evolutionary engineering

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nickel-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant was obtained by evolutionary engineering. The reference strain which was used to select this nickel-resistant mutant could not grow even at 0.5 mM NiCl2 whereas this mutant was shown to be resistant upto 5.3 mM NiCl2 concentration. Whole-genome microarray analysis might be promising to identify the nickel resistance mechanisms in the yeast cells.

DESIGN
The reference Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and the nickel-resistant mutant were grown in minimal medium to an Optical Density (OD600) of 1.00 which correspond to the logarithmic growth phase of the yeast cells. Cultures were harvested and whole RNA isolation was carried out. The experiment was repeated three times.
