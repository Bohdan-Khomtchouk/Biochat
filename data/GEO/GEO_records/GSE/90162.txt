TITLE
The identification of novel genes involved in seed dormancy and after-ripening in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptome of dormant and after-ripened imbibed seeds of different genotypes (Landsberg erecta and the different NILs) to identify dormancy and after-ripening genes that are absolutely required for these traits.

DESIGN
Gene expression in imbibed dormant and after-ripened seeds was compared. For each sample, three replicates were used.
