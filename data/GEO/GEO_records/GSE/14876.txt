TITLE
Requirement for Shh and Fox family genes at different stages in sweat gland development (P5)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sweat glands play a fundamental role in thermal regulation in man, but the molecular mechanism of their development remains unknown. To initiate analyses, we compared the model of Eda mutant Tabby mice, in which sweat glands were not formed, to wild-type mice.  We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles     the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA     sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads. Upon completion of wild-type development, Shh declined to Tabby levels, but Fox family genes remained at elevated levels in mature sweat glands. The results provide a framework for the further analysis of phased downstream regulation of gene action, possibly by a signaling cascade, in response to Eda. Keywords: cell type comparison design,development or differentiation design

DESIGN
To define target genes of Eda during sweat gland development, we  carried out microarray experiments with mouse footpads that from 7  developmental time points including E15.5, E16.5, E17.5, P1, P3, P5 and  8 weeks of wild-type and Tabby mice. This dataset is P5.
