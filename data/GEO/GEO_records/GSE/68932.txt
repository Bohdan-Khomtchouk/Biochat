TITLE
Identity, proliferation capacity, genomic stability and novel senescence markers of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from low volume of human bone marrow (III)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) hold promise for treating diseases for which currently no therapeutic options exist. High quantities of MSCs are needed, requiring extensive cell expansion in long-term culture. However, the fundamental biological properties of MSCs can be altered by culture conditions. In this study, hBM-MSCs were isolated from residual human bone marrow (hBM) material and expanded to clinically relevant numbers at passage 3-4. The cells had normal morphology, proliferation rate, immunophenotype and karyotype. Despite the chromosomal stability, after additional three passages (P6-P7) hBM-MSCs entered senescence state, confirmed by SA-β-galactosidase staining and paralleling the slower proliferation, altered morphology and imunophenotype. qRT-PCR array profiling revealed 33 out of 420 miRNAs significantly (p < 0.05) differentially (≥2 fold) expressed in the late passage cells compared to the early passage cells.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. hBM-MSCs from 3 (1 male and 2 females) adult donors (age 30±7.21 years) were used. Each sample was tested in technical duplicate. 6 samples of early passage (P3-P4) hBM-MSCs were grouped to CONTROL group and 6 samples of late passage (P6-P7) hBM-MSCs were grouped to TEST group. The data were analysed using web-based miScript miRNA PCR Array Data Analysis software (Qiagen)
