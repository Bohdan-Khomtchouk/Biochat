TITLE
Digital Genomic Footprinting by Dnase I of fetal liver derived erythroid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Base-pair level resolution of DNase susceptibility of the native chromatin state. These  maps represent and are dependent upon the nature and the specificity of interaction of the DNA with the regulatory/modulatory proteins binding at specific loci in the genome; thus they represent the native chromatin state of the genome under investigation. The deep sequencing approach has been used to define the footprint landscape of the genome by identifying DNA motifs that interact with known or novel DNA-binding proteins

DESIGN
2 replicates of the erythroid cells were generated and profiled by Dnase I.
