TITLE
MicroRNA profiles discriminate among colon cancer metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our study was to identify a microRNA signature for metastatic CRC that could predict and differentiate metastatic target organ localization.  Normal and cancer tissues of three different groups of CRC patients were analyzed. RNA microarray and TaqMan Array analysis were performed on 66 italian patients with or without lymph nodes and/or liver recurrences. Data obtained with the two assays, were analyzed separately and then intersected to identify a primary CRC metastatic signature. Five differentially expressed microRNAs (hsa-miR-21, -103, -93, -31 and -566) were validated by qRT-PCR on a second group of 16 american metastatic patients. In situ hybridization was performed on the 16 american patients as well as on three distinct commercial tissues microarray (TMA), containing normal adjacent colon, the primary adenocarcinoma, normal and metastatic lymph nodes and liver.  Hsa-microRNA-31,-21,-93, and-103 upregulation together with hsa-miR-566 downregulation defined the CRC metastatic signature, while in situ hybridization data identified a lymphonodal invasion profile.

DESIGN
33 patients had colon cancer with lymph nodes metastasis only (Any T, Any N, M0) and 15 were diagnosed with colon cancer, lymph nodes and liver metastases (Any T, Any N, M1). Separate tumor samples from the primary tumor, the metastatic lymph nodes and the liver metastasis were collected.
