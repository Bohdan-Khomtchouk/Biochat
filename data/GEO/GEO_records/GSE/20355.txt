TITLE
BAC-microarrays aCGH data from 67 Ewing's Sarcoma tumor samples and 16 Ewing's Sarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
67 tumor samples were aCGH profiled in order to obtain frequencies of recurrent copy number alterations intended to posterior correlations with clinical data. 16 cell lines were characterized as well.

DESIGN
Whole genomic DNA from all samples was Cy5 labeled and co-hybridized onto BAC-microarrays along with a Cy3-labeled pool of 100 healthy donors' DNA

PLATFORM
GPL8634 3.7k full genome LUMC BAC array, condensed version
