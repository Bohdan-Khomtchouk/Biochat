TITLE
Expression data from an ASCL1 siRNA experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate whether or not a subtype of adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine nature has poor prognosis, we performed gene expression profiling of an achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1) siRNA experiment.

DESIGN
siRNA againt ASCL1 was transfected into DMS79 cells.
