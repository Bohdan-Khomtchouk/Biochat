TITLE
Identification of Novel NRF2-Regulated Genes by ChIPSeq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular oxidative and electrophilic stress triggers a protective response in mammals regulated by NRF2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived) 2-like; NFE2L2) binding to DNA-regulatory sequences near stress responsive genes. Studies using Nrf2-deficient mice suggest that hundreds of genes may be regulated by NRF2. To identify human NRF2-regulated genes, we conducted ChIP-sequencing experiments in lymphoid cells treated with the dietary isothiocyanate, sulforaphane (SFN) and carried out follow-up biological experiments on candidates. We found 242 high-confidence, NRF2-bound genomic regions and 96% of these regions contained NRF2-regulatory sequence motifs. The majority of binding sites were near potential novel members of the NRF2 pathway. Validation of selected candidate genes using parallel ChIP techniques and in NRF2-silenced cell lines indicated that the expression of about two thirds of the candidates are likely to be directly NRF2-dependent including retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA). NRF2 regulation of RXRAhas implications for response to retinoid treatments and adipogenesis. In mouse 3T3-L1 cells SFN treatment affected Rxra expression early in adipogenesis and knockdown of Nrf2 delayed Rxra expression, both leading to impaired adipogenesis.
