TITLE
Identification of target genes of miR-193b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Searching of target genes of miR-193b by transcriptome assay using 44K Whole Human Genome Microarray system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) resulted in finding of several candidate genes.

DESIGN
To search of targets genes of miR-193b, we performed transcriptome analysis to compare expression profiles between human pancreatic cancer cells, MIA PaCa-2, transfected with precursor of miR-193b and those transfected with a negative control precursor.
