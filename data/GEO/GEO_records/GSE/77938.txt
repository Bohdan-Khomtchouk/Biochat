TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of human keratoconus corneas through RNA sequencing identifies collagen synthesis disruption and downregulation of core elements of TGF-β, Hippo, and Wnt pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand better the factors contributing to keratoconus (KTCN), we used RNA sequencing to perform a transcriptome profile of human KTCN corneas. Over 82% of the genes and almost 75% of the transcripts detected as differentially expressed in KTCN and non-KTCN corneas were confirmed in the replication study using another set of samples. We used these differentially expressed genes to generate a network of KTCN-deregulated genes. We found an extensive disruption of collagen synthesis and maturation pathways, as well as downregulation of the core elements of the TGF-β, Hippo, and Wnt signaling pathways influencing corneal organization. We identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and conducted a computational analysis of their potential functions, and found that lncRNAs regulated the processing and expression of the aforementioned genes. This first comprehensive transcriptome profiling of human KTCN corneas points further to a complex etiology of KTCN.
