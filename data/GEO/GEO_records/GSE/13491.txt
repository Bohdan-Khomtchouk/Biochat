TITLE
Therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in myocardial repair after infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human UCB-MSCs showed donor-specific variation of therapeutic efficacy in improving LV systolic function, reducing infarct area, and preserving wall thickness after MI, even though there were no significant differences in MSC phenotypes. UCB-MSCs (M02) which showed better efficacy had better paracrine activity and unique gene expression profile than others. In DNA microarray, in contrast to M01, M02 showed unique gene expression profiles; up-regulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated apoptotic gene expression.

DESIGN
To evaluate the correlation of gene expression profile and therapeutic efficacy of UCB-MSCs, we selected two UCB-MSCs (M01 and M02) which showed worst and best efficacy, respectively, in improving post-infarction LV remodeling. Under 3 days differentiation condition as described previously, we compared four groups of UCB-MSCs (naïve M01, differentiated M01, naïve M02 and differentiated M02). And, we examined the transcriptome profiles of undifferentiated and differentiated cells using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array covering more than 47,000 human transcripts.
