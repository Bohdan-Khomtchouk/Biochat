TITLE
Therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in myocardial repair after infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human UCB-MSCs showed donor-specific variation of therapeutic efficacy in improving LV systolic function, reducing infarct area, and preserving wall thickness after MI, even though there were no significant differences in MSC phenotypes. UCB-MSCs (M02) which showed better efficacy had better paracrine activity and unique gene expression profile than others. In DNA microarray, in contrast to M01, M02 showed unique gene expression profiles; up-regulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated apoptotic gene expression.
