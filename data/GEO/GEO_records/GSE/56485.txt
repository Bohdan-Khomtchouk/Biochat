E.faecalis regulate immune responses in HCT116 cells

SUMMARY
Colonizing commensal bacteria after birth are required for the proper development of the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that bacterial colonization pattern in neonatal gut affects gut barrier function and immune system maturation. Studies on the development of faecal flora microbiota in infants on various formula feeds showed that the neonatal gut was first colonized with enterococci followed by other flora microbiota such as Bifidobacterium in breast feeding infants. Intriguingly, Bjorksten group Other studies showed that Bbabies who developed allergy were less often colonized with Enterococcus during the first month of life as compared to healthy infants. A lot of Many studies have been done on conducted to elucidate how bifidobacteria or lactobacilli, some of which are considered probiotic, regulate infant gut immunity. However, much fewer studies have been focused on enterococi. In our study, we demonstrate that E. faecalis, isolated from healthy newborns, suppress inflammatory responses activated in vivo and in vitro. We found E. faecalis attenuates proinflammatory cytokine secretions, especially IL-8, through JNK and p38 signaling pathways. This finding shed light on how the first colonizer, E.faecalis, regulate inflammatory responses in the host.
