TITLE
Aire regulates transfer of antigen from mTEC to dendritic cells for induction of thymic tolerance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Aire in thymic selection, we examined the cellular requirements  for generation of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in mice expressing  OVA under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP). Aire-deficiency reduced the  number of mature single positive (SP) OVA-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in the  thymus, independent of OVA expression. Importantly, it also contributed in two way to  OVA-dependent negative selection depending on the T cell type. Aire-dependent  negative selection of OVA-specific CD8 T cells correlated with Aire-regulated  expression of OVA. By contrast, for OVA-specific CD4 T cells, Aire affected tolerance  induction by a mechanism that operated independent of the level of OVA expression,  controlling access of antigen presenting cells to mTEC-expressed OVA. This study  supports the view that one mechanism by which Aire controls thymic negative selection  is by regulating the indirect presentation of mTEC-derived antigens by thymic dendritic  cells. It also indicates that mTEC can mediate tolerance by direct presentation of Aireregulated  antigens to both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from medullary thymic epithelial cells isolated from wildtype and Aire-deficient C57BL/6 mice for comparison of gene expression profiles.
