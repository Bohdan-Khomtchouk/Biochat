TITLE
Gene expression profiles in HepG2 cells treated with the methanol leaf extract of Tamarindus indica (T. indica)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The leaf extract of T. indica had been reported to posses high phenolic content and showed high antioxidant activities. However, scientific data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of the leaf extract are still lacking. In this study, the effects of the leaf extract on the expression of genes in cultured HepG2 cells were investigated using microarray technology. The leaf extract significantly regulated the expression of genes involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were seeded and treated with an IC20 concentration of the methanol leaf extract of T. indica for 24 h. Following this, cells were trypsinized and then preciptated by centrifugation. Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) before total cellular RNA (tcRNA) were extracted from the cells. tcRNA from both untreated and T. indica leaf-treated HepG2 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All experiments were done in triplicate. The microarray analysis was performed on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 S.T Array according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene sets were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the Partek Genomics Suite software to determine significantly expressed genes which was set according to P value less than 0.05 and fold change difference of equal to or greater than 1.5.
