TITLE
In vivo correction of anemia in thalassemic mice by gammaPNA-mediated gene editing with stem cell factor treatment and nanoparticle delivery

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD117+ (c KIT) and CD117- cells were isolated from mouse bone marrow and there gene expression profile was performed to observe up regulation as well as down regulation of genes. It has been noticed that CD117+ cells has many upregaulted DNA repair genes as compare to cd117- population.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CD117+ and CD117-  cells from transgenic mice bone marrow

PLATFORM
