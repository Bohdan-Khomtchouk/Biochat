TITLE
Two upland cotton tree fiber samples from different seasons

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Two fiber tissues harvested 10 days post anthesis from upland cotton trees grown under the same green house conditions except for different seasons of the year were used for RNA extraction. Small RNA molecules under 30 bases were amplified and isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was used directly for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina Genome Analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 35nt sequence tags from sequencing went through data cleaning first, which included getting rid of the low-quality tags and several kinds of contaminants from the 35nt tags. All clean tag sequences with copy numbers were then summarized into a fasta format file.

DESIGN
Fiber samples from different seasons were used for small RNA sequencing and data processing.
