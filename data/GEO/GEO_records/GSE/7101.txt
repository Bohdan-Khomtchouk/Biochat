TITLE
Microarray data from arsenite treated and non-treated G2-synchronized p53(+) and p53(-) fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data from G2-synchronized p53(+) and p53(-) fibroblasts before and after 3 h release from cell cycle blockade in the presence of 5 µM sodium arsenite. Keywords: Gene induction

DESIGN
Cells expressing p53 from a tet-off regulated construct were synchronized in G2 with a two-step procedure using 24 h aphidicolin treatment for initial G1 synchronization and 12 h of Hoechst 33342 to effect a G2 blockade. During Hoechst treatment, tetracycline was added to suppress p53 in half the cultures. Cells were then released into media containing 5 µM sodium arsenite and the appropriate concentration of tetracycline to maintaining p53 expression. mRNAs were collected at 0 h and 3 h after release from G2 synchrony.
