TITLE
DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation profiles were compared between mouse PGCLCs isolated from 6-day culture embryoid bodies, their precursor cells (ESCs, iPSCs, and EpiLCs), and E12.5 in vivo mouse PGCs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in the genomes of mouse E12.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs), primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) isolated from 6-day culture embryoid bodies,  and the precursor pluripotent stem cells [embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)] and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs)

DESIGN
Mouse PGCs and PGCLCs were enriched as SSEA1+/CD61+ double-positive cells by FACS. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse PGCs, PGCLCs, ESCs, iPSCs, and EpiLCs. DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were determined using MBD-seq and hydroxymethylcytosine chemical tagging deep sequencing techniques.
