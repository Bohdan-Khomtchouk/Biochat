TITLE
Digging deeper into the PpsR regulon of Rhodobacter sphaeroides

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
The expression of genes involved in photosystem development in Rhodobacter sphaeroides is dependent upon three major regulatory networks: FnrL, the PrrBA two-component system and the AppA-PpsR pathway. A PrrA- mutant strain of R. sphaeroides is unable to develop under photosynthetic conditions, but when combined with a ppsR mutation, is able to resume growth. In an effort to better characterize the ppsR regulon and to unravel the relationship between the PrrBA and the AppA-PpsR networks, we compared transcriptome profiles from the wild type, PrrA- and PrrA-PpsR- strains under a permissive, common, growth condition: anaerobic-dark-DMSO. Here is stored the microarray data for the PrrA-PpsR- double mutant strain grown under this condition. Keywords: transcriptome profile

DESIGN
Rhodobacter sphaeroides PrrA-PpsR- grown under anaerobic dark DMSO conditions. Sparged with 95% N2, 5% CO2 in sistrom minimal medium A supplemented with final concentration 0.1% YE, 0.5% DMSO. The total RNA from three independent cultures of R. sphaeroides PrrA-PpsR- grown under anaerobic-dark-DMSO conditions was used. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, labeling and hybridization are described elsewhere (Roh et al., 2004).
