TITLE
Tumor-Derived G-CSF Facilitates Neoplastic Growth through a Granulocytic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell-Dependent Mechanism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression studies were performed to determine whether the granulocytic-like MDSC populations from G-CSF treated mice resembled those of tumor-bearing (TB) mice more so than those of the non-tumor-bearing control (i.e., WT) at a molecular level.

DESIGN
Splenic CD11b+Gr-1high cell populations from WT, G-CSF-treated or 4T1-TB mice  were purified in two independent experiments by flow cytometry ( > 98% purity) and subjected to whole genome expression profiling using Illumina microarrays.
