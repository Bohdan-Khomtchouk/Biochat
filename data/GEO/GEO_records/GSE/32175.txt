TITLE
Development of Transcriptomic Biomarker Signature in Human Saliva to Detect Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to profile transcriptomes and discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. Salivary transcriptomic biomarker discovery was performed on 10 lung cancer patients and 10 matched controls. Seven messenger RNA biomarkers were discovered and pre-validated

DESIGN
This study consisted of two phases, including a discovery phase, followed by a pre-validation phase. 10 lung cancer samples and 10 matched control samples were chosen for the biomarker discovery phase. The transscriptomic approach profiled the saliva supernatant samples from 10 lung cancer patients and 10 healthy control subjects using the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Biomarkers identified from the microarray study were first verified using the discovery sample set (10 lung cancer and 10 healthy control).
