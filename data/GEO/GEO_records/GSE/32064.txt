TITLE
Gene expression signatures in GIST-T1 cells transfected with siRNA targeting HOTAIR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the effect of HOTAIR depletion in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells, RNAi-mediated knockdown of HOTAIR was carried out using GIST-T1 cells. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that a number of reported HOTAIR target genes were upregulated by knockdown of HOTAIR.   Moreover, we found that 1424 genes were upregulated by siHOT ( > 2-fold), and Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to “nucleus”, “chromosome” and “membrane-bounded organelle.”

DESIGN
For RNAi-mediated knockdown of HOTAIR, three different Stealth siRNAs against HOTAIR were generated by Invitrogen, after which a mixture of the three was used for transfection.  GIST-T1 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 pmol of Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen) or a Stealth RNAi Negative Control Medium GC (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen).  Total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection.
