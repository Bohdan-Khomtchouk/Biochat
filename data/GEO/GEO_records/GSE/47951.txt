TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the hippocampus of SUMO1 and SUMO2 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mouse lines that express His6-SUMO1 and His6-SUMO2 under the control of the neuron specific Thy1.2 promoter were generated and characterized. The effect of increased levels of SUMO1 and -2 at the level of  gene expression in the hippocampus was studied.

DESIGN
Pooled (left and right) hippocampi were dissected from adult littermate wild-type control (WT1) and SUMO1 and WT2 and SUMO2 transgenic animals (n=3) and subjected to RNA expression analysis.
