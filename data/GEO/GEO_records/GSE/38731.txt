TITLE
Leishmania major: Sir2rp3 overexpressor vs wild-type

ORGANISM
Leishmania

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Leishmania major parasites overexpressing LmSir2rp3 protein compared with wild-type cell line transfected with empty vector in normal growth conditions. Goal of this experiment was to evaluate the possible effect of LmSir2rp3 in the control of gene expression in this protozoan parasite that has a polycistronic transcription.
