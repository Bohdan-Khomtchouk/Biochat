TITLE
Leishmania major: Sir2rp3 overexpressor vs wild-type

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Leishmania major parasites overexpressing LmSir2rp3 protein compared with wild-type cell line transfected with empty vector in normal growth conditions. Goal of this experiment was to evaluate the possible effect of LmSir2rp3 in the control of gene expression in this protozoan parasite that has a polycistronic transcription.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, LmSir2rp3 overexpressor vs. Wild-type cell line bearing empty vector. Biological replicates, 3 LmSir2rp3 overexpressor replicates and 3 wild-type cell line bearing empty-vector

PLATFORM
GPL11330 Agilent custom Leishmania microarray v2
