TITLE
RNA-SEQ on resting (R) and stimulated (S) B cells from several IgH 3'RR mutant models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluated by RNA-seq obveral transcripts in B cells (resting and activated for 2 days with LPS) sorted from several KO mice models devoid of portion or all the IgH 3' Regulatory Region

DESIGN
One RNA-seq point was realized per condition (resting or stimulated) and per genotype. Each point corresponds to a pool of equivalent number of B cells sorted from 4 animals
