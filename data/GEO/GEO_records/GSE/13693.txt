TITLE
Gene expression profiling of normal mouse myeloid cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Normal myeloid lineage cell populations (C57BL/6 mice, aged 4-10 weeks, male or female) with three distinct immunophenotypes were prospectively isolated and characterized. In preparation for FACS sorting, bone marrow cells were separated into c-kit+ and c-kit- fractions using an AutoMACS device. C-kit+ cells were further fractionated based on Gr1 and Mac1 expression, and absence of lineage antigen expression (B220, TER119, CD3, CD4, CD8 and IL7RÎ±), by cell sorting. C-kit+ Gr1+ Mac1lo/- and c-kit+ Gr1+ Mac1+ displayed cytologic features of undifferentiated hematopoietic cells or myeloblasts, whereas c-kit- Gr1+ Mac1+ cells were mature neutrophils.
