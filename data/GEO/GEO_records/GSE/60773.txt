TITLE
miRNA profiling of Macaca mulatta intact colon samples during chronic SIV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study describes differential miRNA expression in intact colon tissue during chronic SIV infection of rhesus macaques. Ten miRNAs were found to be significantly affected by infection, with 7 down-regulated and 3 up-regulated miRNAs. The expression of one upregulated miRNA was further characterized and found to be upregulated in both colonic epithelium and lamain propria cells. Further, its expression positively correlated with colonic inflammation scores and viral loads. Additional studies suggested that its expression was driven in response to oxidative stress induced double stranded DNA damage response  and may play a role in chronic activation of colonic plasma cells.
