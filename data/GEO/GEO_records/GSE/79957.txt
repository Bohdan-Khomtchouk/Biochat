TITLE
Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a primary treatment option for men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. Although many are effectively cured with local therapy alone, these men are by definition at higher risk of adverse pathologic features. It has been shown previously that genomic data can be used to predict tumor aggressiveness. Our objective was to evaluate genomic data and it's relationship to pathological stage and grade in a cohort of men that received no treatment other than radical prostatectomy surgery.

DESIGN
Retrospective case-cohort design for 260 men who underwent RP between 1992 and 2010 at intermediate or high risk and received no additional treatment until the time of metastasis. Participants met the following criteria: (1) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score 3; (2) pathologic Gleason score 7; and (3) post-RP prostate-speciÔ¨Åc antigen nadir < 0.2 ng/ml.
