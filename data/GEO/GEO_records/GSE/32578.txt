TITLE
Characterization of amplification patterns and target genes at chromosome 11q13 in CCND1-amplified sporadic and familial breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amplification of chromosomal region 11q13, containing the cell cycle regulatory gene CCND1, is frequently found in breast cancer and other malignancies. It is associated with the favourable oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumour phenotype, but also with poor prognosis and treatment failure. 11q13 spans almost 14 Mb and contains more than 200 genes and is affected by various patterns of copy number gains, suggesting complex mechanisms and selective pressure during tumour progression. In the present study we used 32k tiling BAC array CGH to analyse 94 CCND1-amplified breast tumours from sporadic, hereditary and familial breast cancers to fine map chromosome 11q13. A set containing 281 CCND1-non-amplified breast tumours was used for comparisons. We used gene expression data to further validate the functional effect of gene amplification. We identified six core regions covering 11q13.1-q14.1 that were amplified in different combinations. The major core contained CCND1, whereas two cores were found proximal of CCND1 and three distal. The majority of the CCND1-amplified tumours were ER-positive and classified as luminal B. Furthermore, we found that CCND1 amplification is associated with a more aggressive phenotype within histological grade 2 tumours and luminal A subtype tumours. Amplification was equally prevalent in familial and sporadic tumours, but strikingly rare in BRCA1- and BRCA2- mutated tumours. We conclude that 11q13 includes many potential target genes in addition to CCND1.

DESIGN
Genomic profiling of 94 CCND1-amplified breast tumors using tiling BAC aCGH. A number of cases were hybridized as replicates or replicate as dye-swaps.
