SUMMARY
Identifying biomarkers predictive for early esophageal cancer detection is critical considering the dismal survival rates.  We investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs), their utility as biomarkers, and their association with survival in esophageal cancer, including Barrett’s associated and sporadic adenocarcinoma (ADC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  MiRNA expression was measured in cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissue pairs collected from 76 US and Japanese patients enrolled in 3 distinct cohorts.  In ADC patients, miR-21, miR-194, miR-293, and miR-223 expression was elevated, while miR-375 and miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous tissue compared to non-cancerous tissue.   Increased levels of miR-192 and miR-194 were observed in Barrett’s associated compared to sporadic ADC cancerous tissue. In SCC patients, miR-21, miR-181b, miR-155, and miR-146b expression was elevated while miR-375 and miR-203 levels were reduced in cancerous tissue compared to non-cancerous tissue.  Significantly, elevated mir-21 expression in non-cancerous tissue was strongly associated with worse prognosis, independent of nodal status and age.  Sample classification using miRNA expression yielded accuracies as high as 86% for diagnosis and 78% for Barrett’s esophagus status.  Our results highlight that miRNAs are deregulated in esophageal carcinogenesis and Barrett’s esophagus, and that their expression is associated with survival in cancer patients.  Sample classification using miRNA expression demonstrates their potential utility as biomarkers for esophageal carcinoma diagnosis.
