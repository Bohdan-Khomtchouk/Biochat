TITLE
Met synergizes with p53 loss to induce mammary tumors that possess features of claudin-low breast cancer (miRNA expression data).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of normal and tumorigenic mouse mammary tissue. Mouse genotypes consist of wildtype, MMTV-Met, MMTV-Met;Trp53fl/+;Cre, and Trp53fl/+;Cre.

DESIGN
One-color design. Samples consist of 2 normal tissues, 7 MMTV-Met tumors, 8 MMTV-Met;Trp53fl/+;Cre tumors, and 8 Trp53;Cre tumors.

PLATFORM
