TITLE
Integrative Genomic and Proteomic Analysis of Prostate Cancer Reveals Signatures of Metastatic Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An integrative analysis of this compendium of proteomic alterations and transcriptomic data was performed revealing only 48-64% concordance between protein and transcript levels. Importantly, differential proteomic alterations between metastatic and clinically localized prostate cancer that mapped concordantly to gene transcripts served as predictors of clinical outcome in prostate cancer as  well as other solid tumors. Keywords: prostate cancer progression

DESIGN
13 individual benign prostate, primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples and 6 pooled samples from benign,primary or metastatic prostate cancer tissues.
