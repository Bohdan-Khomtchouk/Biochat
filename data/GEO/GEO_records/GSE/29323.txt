TITLE
Effects of KLF5 overexpression on renal collecting duct epithelial cell line (mIMCD-3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression changes in renal collecting duct epithelial cells by adenoviral mediated Kr√ºppel like transcription factor 5 (KLF5) overexpression.  KLF5 is a key regulator of static and inflammatory stage in renal collecting duct epithelial cells.  We thought these results provide insights into downstream genes of KLF5 in renal collecting duct epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from adenovirally-mediated KLF5 over expressed cultured mIMCD-3 cells or control adenovirus infected mIMCD-3.  We analyzed these two gene expression profiles after 24 hours after infection.
