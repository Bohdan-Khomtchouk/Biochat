TITLE
Role of smooth muscle cell autophagy in atherosclerosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study of the effect of autophagy inhibition on smooth muscle cell function and atherosclerotic plaque stability

DESIGN
The study searches for differences in gene expression in SMCs from the aorta of mice between two mouse strains (Atg7+/+ SM22α-Cre+ and Atg7F/F SM22α-Cre+). For each strain, two biological replicates were collected. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells from passage 4 untill 10 were used for experiments. Two-color arrays were run, each time comparing a replicate from one strain to a replicate from the other strain. For each array we added a dye swap, giving a total of four arrays.
