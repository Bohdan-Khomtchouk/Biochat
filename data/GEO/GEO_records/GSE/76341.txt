TITLE
RNA-Seq between Proteus mirabilis HI4320 and an rcsB mutant

ORGANISM
Proteus mirabilis

SUMMARY
We report a comparison of the transcriptional profiles between a wild-type P. mirabilis strain and an isogenic rcsB mutant

DESIGN
Three replicate pairs of RNA were analyzed between wild-type HI4320 and an rcsB mutant
