TITLE
Expression data from Leishmania major infected human dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leishmania major infected human dendritic cells (DCs) exhibit a marked induction of IL-12 ultimately promoting a robust Th1-mediated response associated with parasite killing and protective immunity.  In this study, we utilized Affymetrix Genechips to globally assess the host cell genes and pathways associated with L. major infection during early infection (2, 4, 8, and 24 hrs) in human myeloid-derived DCs.  Bioinformatic analyses of the hybridized microarray chips identified 728 genes, represented by 848 unique probe sets, which, when compared to uninfected samples were observed to be significantly differentially expressed by one-way ANOVA.  Altogether, the data provide a genome-wide perspective on the transcriptional influences Leishmania species exert within human DCs during early infection, and provides a platform for further investigations toward functionally characterizing candidate genes of importance to the IL-12 based immune response to infections. In the current study, we further investigate the L. major infected DC transcriptional during early time points after infection via microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The cRNAs for each L. major infected time point (2, 4, 8, 24 hrs) including an uninfected sample (2 hrs), from three individual donors, were extracted and hybridized to 15 individual human HG-U133 Plus2.0 Affymetrix microarray gene chips, whereby each chip represented the expression profile for one donor at a given infection time point.
