TITLE
Transcriptome profile of yeast adapted to the toxic effect of manganese

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis shows that the adaptation of S. cerevisiae yeast cells to the growth at a toxic concentration of manganese ions involves multiple mechanisms, including the activation of transport systems responsible for manganese compartmentalization, the systems of phosphorus transport and polyphosphates accumulation, as well as other transport proteins.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq in control and manganese-adapted yeast cells.

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
