TITLE
RNA-sequencing time course of Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells (HIECs) following knockdown of miR-30bcd using complementary locked nucleic acids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain mechanistic insight into our finding that knockdown of miR-30 in HIECs and Caco-2 cells resulted in increased SOX9 mRNA, but decreased SOX9 protein expression, we performed RNA-sequencing on LNA30bcd-treated HIECs. We found 2440 significantly increased genes and 2651 significantly decreased genes across three time points (24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours post-transfection) relative to mock transfected cells. The up-regulated genes are highly enriched for both predicted miR-30 targets as well as genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of miR-30 also led to significantly reduced IEC proliferation and an increase in markers of enterocyte differentiation.

DESIGN
We evaluate transcriptional changes across time following knockdown of miR-30 family members in HIECs. We include 3 replicates each of Mock and LNA30bcd treated cells at 3 time points, 24H, 48H, and 72H post-transfection.
