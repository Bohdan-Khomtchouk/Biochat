TITLE
Regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression and secretion by LIM and SH3 protein (LASP1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The process of tumor invasion requires degradation of extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes. Cancer cells form protrusive invadopodia, which produce and release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the basement membrane and thereby allowing metastasis. We investigated the effect of LASP1, a newly identified protein in invadopodia, on expression, secretion and activation of MMPs in invasive breast tumor cells. By analyzing and verifying microarray data sets and performing reporter assays, we demonstrate that LASP1 positively modulates the expression of c-Fos and AP-1 activity, and thereby up-regulates expression of MMP1, -3 and -9 in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, zymography assays and Western blot analysis revealed cytosolic LASP1 promotion of MMP vesicle secretion into the extracellular matrix, thus altering the microenvironment during cancer progression. The newly identified role of LASP1 in regulating matrix degradation by affecting MMP transcription and secretion elucidated the migratory potential observed in studies that investigated the upregulation of LASP1 in aggressive cancers.
