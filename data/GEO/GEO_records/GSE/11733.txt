TITLE
Whole genome microarray of the retina reveals a progressive response with increasing duration of diabetes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using the streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes, levels of retinal permeability, caspase activity, and gene expression were examined after 1 and 3 months of diabetes. Gene expression changes were identified by whole genome microarray and confirmed by qPCR in the same set of animals as used in the microarray analyses and subsequently validated in independent sets of animals.  Significantly more and larger magnitude gene expression changes were observed after 3 months than after 1 month of diabetes.
