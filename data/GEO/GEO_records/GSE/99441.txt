TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of deletion of cre1 in T. reesei upon growth on cellulose in light and darkness

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the transcriptome due to the lack of CRE1 in light or darkness.

DESIGN
Strains of this study were grown on Mandels Andreotti Minimal Medium with 1 % w/v microcrystalline cellulose as sole carbon source in constant light or constant darkness for 72 hours; 2 biological replicates were included

PLATFORM
GPL10642 NimbleGen Trichoderma reesei Whole Genome array v 1.0 [090708_Tres_MS_exp]
