TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Hepatitis C virus HCV core transgenic mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HCV core transgenic mice liver comparing nontransgenic mice liver or HCV core transgenic mice liver with various core expression levels.

DESIGN
Exp I: Double transgenic mice DTM with high core vs single transgenic mice STM (triplicate); ExpII: DTM with modest core vs STM (triplicate); ExpIII: DTM with modest core vs DTM with high core (triplicate).

PLATFORM
GPL891 Agilent-011978 Mouse Microarray G4121A (Feature Number version) GPL2881 Agilent-013326 Mouse Oligo Microarray (V2) G4121B (Feature Number version)
