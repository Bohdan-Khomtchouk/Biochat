TITLE
Expression profile of sweat gland label retaining cells (LRCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used the slow cycling property, found in hair follicle stem cells, to look for LRCs in sweat glands as putative stem cells. Gene expression profiling allowed us to determine the common and unique genes expressed in SG LRCs and non-LRCs. This allowed us to probe for the signaling pathways active in this skin appendage as well as determine potential molecular markers of SG LRCs.

DESIGN
Sweat gland label retaining cells (LRCs) and surrounding basal layer cells were isolated from K5TetOffTreH2BGFP mice after a 4 week chase with doxycycline and compared to the basal layer of the sole's epidermis in 2 independent experiments.
