TITLE
A functional genomics predictive network model identifies regulators of inflammatory bowel disease: Ribo-zero RNAseq mouse distal colon DSS Colitis model of genetically engineered mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ribo-zero RNAseq experiments were carried out with mouse distal colon DSS Colitis model of genetically engineered mice. For each mouse line for: Gpsm3 (3% DSS), Aif1 (3% DSS), Nckap1l (Hem1), Dock2 (3% DSS), Dok3 (3.5% DSS) DSS treatment for five days followed by water for 5 days, (7 days for Nckap1l).  Tissue was collected at Day 10 (Day 12 for Nckap1l (HEM1)).
