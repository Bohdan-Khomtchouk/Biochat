TITLE
The organizational effects of testosterone on brain DNA methylome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus domesticus

SUMMARY
Analysis of DNA methylation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/preoptic area and striatum in response to perinatal testosterone exposure. The hypothesis tested was that treatment of females with testosterone on the day of birth would lead to masculinization of the methylome in adulthood.

DESIGN
There were three experimental groups: males, females, and females treated with T on the day of birth. The methylation patterns in each group was determined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Two brain regions and two time points (day 4 and day 60) were surveyed in each group. Each biological replicate is a pool of tissue from three animals.
