TITLE
The Xenopus Primordial Germ Cell Transcriptome: Unexpected Role for sox7 in Early PGC Development

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
XenopusÂ primordial germ cells (PGCs) are determined by the presence of maternally derived germ plasm. Germ plasm components both protect PGCs from somatic differentiation and begin a unique gene expression program. Segregation of the germline from the endodermal lineage occurs during gastrulation and PGCs subsequently initiate zygotic transcription. However, the gene-networks that operate to both preserve the potential for totipotency and promote germline differentiation are poorly understood. Here, we utilized RNA-sequencing analysis to comprehensively interrogate PGC and neighboring endoderm cell RNAs after lineage segregation. We identified 1,865 transcripts enriched in PGCs compared to endoderm cells. Over 50% of maternal, vegetally-enriched transcripts were enriched in the PGC transcriptome, including sox7. PGC-directed sox7 knockdown and over-expression studies revealed an early requirement for sox7 in proper germ plasm localization, zygotic transcription, and PGC number. We identified oct60 as the most highly expressed and enriched OCT3/4 homologue in PGCs. Lastly, we compared the Xenopus PGC transcriptome with human PGC transcripts and showed that 80% of transcripts are conserved, identifying Xenopus as a relevant model system for understanding the gene-networks necessary for human germline development.

DESIGN
