TITLE
Effect of High Fat Diet on gene expression of liver from obesity-prone (C57BL/6J) and obesity-resistant (A/J) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were fed for 2, 10 or 30 days with a normal chow (NC) or a high fat diet (HFD). At each time point, mice were sacrificed and liver samples were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from each sample was further extracted, purified, quality-controled before and after amplification. Cy3-labeled RNA from individual liver sample was co-hybridized with a Cy5-labeled pool of RNA on the mouse 17K microarray. Keywords: diet response, time course, mouse strains
