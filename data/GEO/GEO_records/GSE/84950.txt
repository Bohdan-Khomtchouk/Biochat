TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of hopanoid biosynthetic mutant of Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris

SUMMARY
To understand the role of pentacyclic triterpenoids, we used whole genome microarray expression profiling of wild type and hopanoid deficient mutant. Hopanoid deficiency may leads to weakened structural integrity of cell membrane and may affect the other structures within or spanning cell envelope resulting in impaired lipid ordering which is linked to permeability, fluidity, permeability barrier, ion conductivity, cell potential, cell signalling and lateral segregation. Hopanoids are involved in antibiotic resistance and tolerance to stress, but the precise understanding is lacking. Understanding the role of hopanoids in shaping membrane properties would provide an important step towards bridging this gap.
