TITLE
Transcription profiling of stigmas after pollination and after pollen coat adhesion

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of stigmas was performed to identify molecules functioning in compatible pollination.  Stigmas of A. thaliana Col-0 were collected (i) at 0 min or 15 min after pollination and (ii) before or at 15 min after pollen coat adhesion, and used for microarray analysis. Genes up-regulated after pollination and after pollen coat adhesion were identified. .

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, stigmas at 0 min vs. 15 min after pollination; stigmas before vs. at 15 min after pollen coat adhesion.

PLATFORM
GPL7270 Agilent-012600 Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray G4142A (Probe Name version)
