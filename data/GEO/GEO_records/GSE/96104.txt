TITLE
High throughput quantitative whole transcriptome analysis of individual macrophages 7 days post-pneumonectomy in a B6 CSF1R-GFP mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using fluorescence activated cell sorting, we isolated CD45+, CSF1R-GFP+, F4/80+, Ly6G- mouse lung monocytes and macrophages at 7 days after pneumonectomy procedure. We then used microfluidic single cell RNA-sequencing to transcriptional profile unique myeloid subsets. Using the pneumonectomy dataset, we identified 6 cell groups and 4 gene groups that marked several regenerative macrophage subsets including CCR2+, Ly6C+ monocytes and CD206+, Chil3+ M2-like macrophages.
