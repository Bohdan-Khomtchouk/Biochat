TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of purified polyclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies stimulated human mesangial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis genes which alter after anti-dsDNA antibodies stimulation in human mesangial cells.  The hypothesis is anti-dsDNA antibodies might affected a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene or genes in cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from human mesangial cells (1x10^6 cells) stimulated with anti-dsDNA antibodies (100 Âµg/mL) and normal serum 1:100 for 3 hours compared to non specific polyclonal IgG stimulation as control.
