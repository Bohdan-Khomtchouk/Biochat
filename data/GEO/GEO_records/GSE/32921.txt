TITLE
The effect of zinc limitation on transcriptome expression in Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 comparing zinc-limited culture against zinc-amended culture in M9 minimal media

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, non-zinc treated culture versus zinc sulphate supplemented culture. 3 biological replicates including 3 technical replicates for one of the biological replicate and 2 technical replicates for another biological replicate. Swap-dye experiments were performed
