TITLE
17beta-estradiol (E2)-regulated gene expression across time in estrogen-dependent and estrogen deprivation-resistant MCF-7-derived breast cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A series of MCF-7 variants were previously developed that are either estrogen-dependent for growth (MCF-7:WS8 cells), or resistant to estrogen deprivation and refractory (MCF-7:2A) or sensitive (MCF-7:5C) to E2-induced apoptosis. To identify genes associated with E2-induced apoptosis, estrogen deprivation-resistant/apoptotic-sensitive 5C cells were compared to both estrogen-dependent MCF-7:WS8 and estrogen deprivation/apoptotic-refractory MCF-7:2A cells

DESIGN
Each cell line was treated with 10-9 M E2 or vehicle control over a 96 h time course consisting of 7 time points (2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h) using 6 biological replicates per condition. cRNA probes from individual E2-treated samples were competitively hybridized against time-matched pooled control probes using 2-color Agilent 4x44k human oligonucleotide microarrays.
