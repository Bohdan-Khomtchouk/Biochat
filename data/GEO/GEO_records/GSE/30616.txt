TITLE
[E-MTAB-587] PCR_artifacts

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
WARNING: This library was yield low amount of material and it was over-amplified by PCR. This libraries are used study the robustness of several statitical methods against PCR artifacts. ChIP experiments were performed on Arabidopsis wildtype inflorescences using an antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of SEP3.
