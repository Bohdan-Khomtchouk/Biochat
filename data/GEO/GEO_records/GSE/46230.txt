TITLE
The effect of Neuroserpin expression upon HeLa cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cells were stably transfected using the Tet-OnÂ® Advanced Cell Line system with Wildtype, G392E and Delta Neuroserpin with neuroserpin expression induced with doxycycline.  Gene expression was examined in the absence or presence of 2 ug/ml doxycycline.

DESIGN
Four cell lines were analysed:  Untransfected  Parental Cells; and cells transfected with wild type, G392E and Delta Neuroserpin Mutants.  Each cell line had three replicate samples.
