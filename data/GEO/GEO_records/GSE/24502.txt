TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation analysis in NSCLC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene silencing in lung cancer. In this study we identified a large number of tumor specifically methylated genes in NSCLC patients by methylome profiling.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor and matching non-malignant lung tissue samples from 101 NSCLC patients and genome wide DNA methylation was analyzed using the MeDIP-chip technology as described previously (Weber et al., 2005). Genomic DNA was extracted from NSCLC cell lines and genome wide DNA methylation was analyzed using the MeDIP-chip technology as described previously (Weber et al., 2005).
