TITLE
The transcriptional network for cell cycle regulation in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several compounds were treated on the PC-3 cell line to investigate cell cycle regulation in prostate cancer through gene expression profile data. Our study demonstrated that several compounds induced cell cycle regulation in the CRPC (Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer) cell model.

DESIGN
Compounds (menthol, cineol, geraniol, icilin, linalool) were dissolved in ethanol as a vehicle at 0.1% working concentration and treated in PC-3 cells in triplicate. Vehicle-treated PC-3 cells in triplicate were used as a control.
