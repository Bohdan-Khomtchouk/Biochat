TITLE
Gene expression based analysis of Streptococcus uberis 0140J and vru (sub0144) mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus uberis 0140J

SUMMARY
Comparison of bacterial strains S. uberis 0140J with isogenic mutant (same strain) with lesion 5 basepairs upstream of ATG start codon of the vru or sub0144 gene. Bacteria were grown in stationary culture in THB media at 37C with triplicate samples extracted at early exponential (OD550 =0.42) at late exponential (OD550 =0.75) phases of growth Microarray analysis performed on custom made S. uberis 0140J array containing 3780 features of 60mer oligonucleotides in triplicate with two probes for each individual gene
