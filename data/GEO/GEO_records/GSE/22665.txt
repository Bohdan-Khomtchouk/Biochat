TITLE
Expression data from P. aeruginosa colonizing the Murine GI Tract

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
P. aeruginosa bacteremia in cancer and bone marrow transplant patients transpires when P. aeruginosa colonizes the GI tract and translocates when the host undergoes immunosuppression.  We used microarrays to analyze gene expression when P. aeruginosa transitions from being in the drinking water to when it colonizes the murine GI tract. to analyze gene expression changes in P. aeruginosa as it transitions from living in the drinking water to when it colonizes the murine GI tract.

DESIGN
P. aeruginosa was recovered from the drinking water administered to adult C3H/HeN mice and also from murine cecums, and RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
