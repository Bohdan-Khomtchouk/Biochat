TITLE
Comparison of RNA-Seq and Microarray in Transcriptome Profiling During T Cell Activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples in this study probe the gene expression kinetics in human CCR6+ Th17 memory T cells activated under Th17 condition.  Human CCR6+ Th17 memory T cells were purified from PBMC and gene expression was studied over a time course of 3 days after activation under Th17 condition. RNA from these samples was also profiled using RNA-Seq to compare different transcriptome profiling technologies.

DESIGN
PBMCs were purified from whole blood from a healthy donor. CD4+ cells were isolated by negative selection, followed by CCR6+ purification by positive selection.  Two replicates of 6 time points were taken following stimulation in Th17 polarizing conditions. This submission represents microarray component of study.
