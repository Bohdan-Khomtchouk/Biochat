TITLE
Role of skeletal muscle in motor neuron development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes a cDNA microarray analysis that compared developing mouse MyoD-/- limb musculature (MyoD-dependent, innervated by Lateral Motor Column motor neurons) and Myf5-/- back (epaxial) musculature (Myf5-dependent, innervated by Medial Motor Column motor neurons) to the control and to each other, at embryonic day 13.5 which coincides with the robust programmed cell death of motor neurons and the inability of myogenesis to undergo its normal progression in the absence of Myf5 and MyoD that at this embryonic day cannot substitute for each other. We wanted to see if/how the myogenic program couples with the neurotrophic one, and also to separate Lateral from Medial column trophic requirements, potentially relevant to Motor Neuron Diseases with the predilection for the Lateral column. Several follow-up steps revealed that Kif5c, Stxbp1 and Polb, differentially expressed in the MyoD-/- limb muscle, and Ppargc1a, Glrb and Hoxd10, differentially expressed in the Myf5-/- back muscle, are actually regulators of motor neuron numbers. We propose a series of follow-up experiments and various ways to consider our current data.

DESIGN
Mouse embryos were obtained at E13.5 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
