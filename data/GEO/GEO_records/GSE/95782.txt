TITLE
Differential gene expression of mouse liver samples after poly I:C treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand differential gene expression globally with/without poly I:C treatment on liver cancer mouse model, RNA-seq analysis were examined using diethlynitrosamine-induced Shp2∆H (Shp2F/F:Alb-cre) and Pten∆H (PtenF/F:Alb-cre) mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracts from liver on 1 week and 2 weeks after poly I:C treatment of Shp2 and Pten mice. Group 1: diethlynitrosamine (DEN)-treated Shp2 mice (n=3); Group 2: poly I:C + DEN-treated Shp2 mice (n=3); Group 3: Pten mice (n=3); Group 4: poly I:C + Pten mice (n=3).
