TITLE
OsHAP2E over-expression in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The goal is to know which kinds of gene are affected in rice leaves by OsHAP2E over-expression

DESIGN
Transgenic rice with OsHAP2E driven by CaMV35S promoter was produced by Agrobacterium. The resultant two over-expressed lines were used for rice 44K microarray with two colors.

PLATFORM
