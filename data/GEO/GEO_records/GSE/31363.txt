TITLE
Transcription Factor Binding Sites by Epitope-Tag ChIP-seq from ENCODE/University of Chicago

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Kevin White (Principal Investigator), Subhradip Karmakar (Project Lead), Nick Bild (Data Analyst), Alina Choudhury (Laboratory Technician), Marc Domanus (Sequencing Technician at Argonne National Lab)). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This ENCODE track maps human transcription factor binding sites, genome-wide using second generation massively parallel sequencing. This mapping uses expressed transcription factors as GFP tagged fusion proteins after BAC (Bacterial artificial chromosomes) recombineering. The U. of Chicago and Max Planck Institute (Dresden) pipeline generates recombineered (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) BACs for the production of cell lines or animals that express fusion proteins from epitope tagged transgenes.
