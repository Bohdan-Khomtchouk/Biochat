TITLE
lncRNA expression in leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs between AML and control samples

DESIGN
Total RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells were extracted using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. ArrayStar lncRNA array V3 was performed to detect the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs.

PLATFORM
