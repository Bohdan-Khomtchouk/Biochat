TITLE
CXXC1-mediated Epigenetic Maturation is Crucial for Development Competence of Mouse Oocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through RNA-seq of wildtype and CFP1-deleted GV oocytes of different ages, zygotes and 2-cell embryos and  whole genome bisulfite sequencing of GV oocytes, We show here that CFP1 is responsible for epigenetic maturation in oocytes. Deletion of CFP1 directly decreased histone H3K4 trimethylation and caused global down-regulation of gene expression in oocytes.These genes are involved in cytoplasmic lattice formation, maternal-zygotic transition and epigenetic maturation. Maternal CFP1-deleted oocytes had fewer CPLs in the cytoplasm and the organelles were severely aggregated, which further caused defects in Î±-tubulin polymerization and aneuploidy in meiosis II. The genome was less methylated and methylation of maternal DNA was impaired after CFP1 deletion. Therefore CFP1-deleted oocytes fail to complete epigenetic maturation as well as cytoplasmic maturation and nuclear maturation and unable to gain developmental competence during oogenesis.

DESIGN
GV oocyte, zygote and 2-cell embryonic transcriptome profiles wild type (WT) and CFP1-depleted mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate or triplicate on Illumina platform.
