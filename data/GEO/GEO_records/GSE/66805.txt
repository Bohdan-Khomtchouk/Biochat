TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages with CNI-1493 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of CNI-1493 treatment on M1 and M2 polarized macrophages. The purpose of this microarray is to identify genes that may be differentially expressed in M1 or M2 macrophages after treatment with CNI-1493. CNI-1493 is a known inhibitor of M1 macrophages but details of its molecular mechanism are unknown. The effect of CNI-1493 on M2 macrophages has yet to be explored, but we hypothesize that CNI-1493 treatment will attenuate pro-tumor properties of M2 macrophages. We demonstrate with this array that known macrophage markers are unchanged after treatment with CNI-1493, indicating that CNI-1493 does not change the macrophage phenotype on a transcriptional level. Additionally, no candidate genes to suggest how CNI-1493 may attenuate the pro-tumor effects of M2 macrophages are readily identifiable.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from M1 or M2 macrophages after polarization with GM-CSF (25ng/ml) or M-CSF (25ng/ml) for 7 days, followed by addition of IFN-Î³ (20ng/ml) and LPS (100ng/ml) or IL-4 (40ng/ml) for 18 hours, respectively, from CD14+ human PBMCs, and treated with CNI-1493 (200nM)

PLATFORM
