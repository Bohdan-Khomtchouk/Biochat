TITLE
BL2 cells stimulated with B cell specific paracrine stimuli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data of BL2 Burkitt Lymphoma cell line (controls and samples treated with different B cell specific stimuli)

DESIGN
BL2 cells were cultured in RPMI and stimulated with the respective agents (rhCD40L, rhIL21, rhBAFF, LPS and antiIgM F(ab) fragments) for indicated timepoints. Cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated for gene expression profiling. The experiments were conducted in 2-3 biological replicates.
