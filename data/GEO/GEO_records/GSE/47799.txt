TITLE
Gene signature of the embryonic meniscus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in E16 mouse meniscus, articular cartilage, and cruciate ligaments Limbs were dissected from E16 CD-1 mice. Samples were frozen in OCT and cryosectioned. Meniscus, articular carilage, and cruciate ligament were isolated using laser capture microdissection.  Total RNA was isolated from these tissues, amplified, and gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each tissue type.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from E16 mouse meniscus, articular cartilage, and cruciate ligaments
