TITLE
Quantitative comparison of DNA methylation assays for biomarker development and clinical applications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation data obtained with the Infinium 450k assay. These data were used to support target selection for benchmarking of locus-specific DNA methylation assays

DESIGN
6x2 pairs of matched tumor/normal samples, 2 xenografts, and 4 pairs of treated/untreated leukemia cell lines (KG1 and KG1a)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
