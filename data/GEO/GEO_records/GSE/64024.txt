TITLE
mRNA expression analysis in  glp-4(bn2); let-7(wild-type) and glp-4(bn2); let-7(mn112) animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine mRNA expression levels  glp-4(bn2); let-7(wild-type) and glp-4(bn2); let-7(mn112) animals, RNA was purified from total worms collected at late L4 stage using TRI Reagent (MRC).

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples was analyzed (triplicates of glp-4(bn2); let-7(wild-type) and glp-4(bn2); let-7(mn112) animals respectively)
