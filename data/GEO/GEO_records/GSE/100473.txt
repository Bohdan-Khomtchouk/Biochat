TITLE
Effect of O-GlcNAc transferase deficiency on intestinal epithelial cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
O-GlcNAcylation is the modification of serine and threonine residues with beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on intracellular proteins. To investigate the role of protein O-GlcNAcylation on intestinal homeostasis, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) knockout in mice. The KO mice developed spontanous intestinal inflammation. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing of ileum and colon epithelial cells of wildtype and IEC-OGT KO mice.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from the ileum and colon of 10-week-old wildtype and IEC-OGT KO male mice.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
