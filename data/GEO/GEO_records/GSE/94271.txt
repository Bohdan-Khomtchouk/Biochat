TITLE
Study gene expression of KDR-expressing GL261 tumor associated hematopietic progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Using NGD techinque to profile the gene expression in KDR+ hematopietic progenitor cells (HPC) and KDR- HPC during tumor progression. The goal is to study how KDR signaling within hematopieosis respond to tumor progression by analyzing transcriptome of KDR+ HPC Method: Isolate KDR + HPC and KDR- HPC from late stage GL261 tumor mice, and HPC from non tumor mice. Compare their transcriptomes.by deep sequencing, in triplicate. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Basedl analysis of transcirptome  and expression pattern of 11650 genes, KDR+ HPC resprent a different population compared with KDR- HPC in tumor mice or HPC in non-tumor mice.

DESIGN
GL261 tumor were implanted into KDR-GFP knockin mice, the GFP+ Lin-C-kit+sca-1- bone marrow cells were isolated by flowcytometery, RNA from ~20000 cells were extracted and subjected for sequencing

PLATFORM
