TITLE
To a better understanding of the impact of vine nitrogen status on volatile thiols from plot to transcriptome level

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Purpose: The identification of genes in Sauvignon blanc berries which respond to nitrogen fertilization at (v+28) and at (v+35) and the identification of genes potentially involved in 3SH precursors biosynthesis. Methods: Grape berries mRNA profiles of control vine (C) and vine fertilized with 100 U/ha of nitrogen (Soil N100) at (v+28) and at (v+35) in 2013 and 2014 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate. Results: Genes in Sauvignon blanc berries at 2 stages ((v+28) and (v+35)) which respond to nitrogen supply were identified and genes potentially involved in 3SH precursors synthesis were described.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome of a control Sauvignon blanc vine versus a Sauvignon blanc vine supplied with 100 U/ha of nitrogen added to soil at 2 stages ((v+28) and (v+35)) in 2013 and 2014.
