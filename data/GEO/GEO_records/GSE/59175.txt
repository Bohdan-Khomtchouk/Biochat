TITLE
Genome-wide RNAi screen reveals factors needed at the transition steps of induced reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of step-wise transcriptome changes of reprogrammed cells in different stages during induced reprogramming.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted cells representing four stages of induced reprogramming. The mRNA expression changes among these four sorted cell populations will reveal important transcription signatures for the cell-fate transitions.
