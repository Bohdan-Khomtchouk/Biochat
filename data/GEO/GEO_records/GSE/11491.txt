TITLE
A single SR-like protein, Npl3, promotes pre-mRNA splicing in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mammalian SR proteins are a family of reversibly phosphorylated RNA binding proteins primarily studied for their roles in alternative splicing. While budding yeast lack alternative splicing, they do have three SR-like proteins: Npl3, Gbp2, and Hrb1. However, these have been primarily studied for their roles in mRNA export, leaving their potential roles in splicing largely unexplored. Here we combined high-density genetic interaction profiling and genome-wide splicing-sensitive microarray analysis to demonstrate that a single SR-like protein, Npl3, is required for efficient splicing of a large set of pre-mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We tested the hypothesis that Npl3 promotes splicing by facilitating co-transcriptional recruitment of splicing factors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that mutation of NPL3 reduces the occupancy of U1 and U2 snRNPs at Npl3-stimulated genes. This provides the first evidence that an SR protein can promote recruitment of splicing factors to chromatin.

DESIGN
Splicing-specific microarrays were used to assay changes to splicing in single and double deletion mutants of non-essential SR proteins, in a deletion mutant of a non-essential component of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, and in a double deletion mutant of in an SR protein plus a non-sense mediated decay factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The data includes both samples obtained at the permissive temperature and also shifts to the non-permissive temperature for some mutants, as well as dye-flipped technical replicates.
