TITLE
Genome-wide dynamics of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 during early flower development [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We studied early events of flower formation with a temporal resolution by employing a floral induction  system to drive synchronized flower development from inflorescence meristem-like tissue (Wellmer et al. (2006)). We generated a developmental time series including vegetative leaf tissue, young developing flowers at  zero (t0) and two days after induction of flower development (t2), and fully expanded inflorescences. Although we found  very similar numbers of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 target genes, many genes display quantitative  changes in those marks, especially between different tissue types (e.g. > 60% of target genes change  quantitatively from leaf to t0).

DESIGN
Examination of two different histone marks (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) in four different tissues/developmental stages of Arabidopsis thaliana

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
