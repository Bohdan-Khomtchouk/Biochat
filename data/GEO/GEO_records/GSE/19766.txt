TITLE
Transcriptional responses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - Illumina arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These microarrays were performed for use in a genome-wide scan for LPS-regulated genes in mouse macrophages, in order to construct a list of LPS-regulated genes for detailed interrogation on custom microarrays (see GSE19490 for custom array analysis).

DESIGN
Mouse macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages, BMM) were stimulated with the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, over a time course (0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24h) and analysed in biological duplicate by commercial Illumina microarray.
