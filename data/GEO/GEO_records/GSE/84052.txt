TITLE
RAG1 targeting in the genome is dominated by chromatin interactions mediated by the non-core regions of RAG1 and RAG2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination at antigen receptor loci but also binds to thousands of places outside of these loci.  RAG2 localizes directly to lysine 4 trimethylated histone 3 (H3K4me3) through a PHD finger.  The relative contribution of RAG2-dependent and RAG1-intrinsic mechanisms in determining RAG1 binding patterns is not known.  Through analysis of deep RAG1 ChIP-seq data, we provide a quantitative description of the forces underlying genome-wide targeting of RAG1.  Surprisingly, sequence-specific DNA binding contributes minimally to RAG1 targeting outside of antigen receptor loci.  Instead, RAG1 binding is driven by two distinct modes of interaction with chromatin:  the first is driven by H3K4me3, promoter-focused, and dependent on the RAG2 PHD, and the second is defined by H3K27Ac, enhancer-focused, and dependent on " non-core " portions of RAG1.  Based on this and additional chromatin and genomic features, we formulated a predictive model of RAG1 targeting to the genome.  RAG1 binding sites predicted by our model correlate well with observed patterns of RAG1-mediated breaks in human pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Overall, this study provides an integrative model for RAG1 genome-wide binding and off-target activity, and reveals a novel role for the RAG1 non-core region in RAG1 targeting.
