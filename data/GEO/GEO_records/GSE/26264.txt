TITLE
Genome-wide analysis gene expression of MCF10A cells growing in the presence of EGF or AREG or without EGF or AREG for 24 hrs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results of growing MCF10A cells continuously in serum free media supplemented with EGF (MCF10A) or AREG (MCF10A+AREG) followed by 24 hours of ligand withdrawl and measuring gene expression provides information as to what genes are regulated by AREG and EGF in a normal mammary epithelial cell model

DESIGN
MCF10A cells continuously in serum free media supplemented with 10ng/ml of EGF (MCF10A) or 20ng/ml of AREG (MCF10A+AREG) followed by 24 hours of ligand withdrawl. Total RNA was collected and genome-wide analysis of expression was performed on RNA from each cell line.
