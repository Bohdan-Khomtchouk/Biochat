TITLE
Predator induced gene expression in tadpoles

ORGANISM
Rana pirica

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail. The tadpoles revert to a normal phenotype upon removal of the larval salamander threat.  The objective of the present study was to use our own fabricated tadpole Rana pirica cDNA microarray to profile gene expression patterns during the predation threat.

DESIGN
Experimental design used to produce control, bulgy morph and reversion type tadpoles for the microarray analysis was as follows.  One group of tadpoles was placed with a larval salamander for 4 days to induce formation of the bulgy morph phenotype; the predator was then removed and the tadpoles were allowed to revert to the normal phenotype for 4 days.  This group is termed “8 day out tadpoles”.  A second group of tadpoles was placed with the predator for the full 8 days.  The control group was not exposed to a predator.  Tadpoles from the predator induced groups were sampled at 6 hours, 4 days and 8 days, those from the control group at 0 hour, 4 days, and 8 days.  The comparative design of the microarray analysis was performed as (Exp 6 hours VS Cont 0 hours), (Exp 4 days VS Cont 4 days), (Exp 8 days VS Cont 8 days), and (Exp 8 days-Out VS Exp 8 days), respectively.  These analyses were performed in triplicate with a dye swap experiment. Samples 0hr~8days were as follows. Sample plate (1~3A):Channel 1-Cy5 Experiment,Channel 2-Cy3 Control. Sample plate (1~3B):Channel 1-Cy5 Control, Channel 2-Cy3 Experiment. In case of 8day-out samples were as follows. Sample plate (1~3A):Channel 1-Cy5 8day-out,Channel 2-Cy3 full 8day. Sample plate (1~3B):Channel 1-Cy5 full 8day,Channel 2-Cy3 8day-out.
