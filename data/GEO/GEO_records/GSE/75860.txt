TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic lung epithelial tip progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial tip progenitor cells are an important epithelial progenitor population in the developing lung. At early stages of development they produce SOX2+ bronchiolar progenitor cells. At later stages of embryonic lung development they produce SOX2- alveolar progenitor cells. We purified the tip progenitor cells from early (E11.5, bronchiolar progenitor producing) and late (E17.5, alveolar progenitor producing) stages of mouse lung development and used Affymetrix microarrays to compare their gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Lung epithelial tip progenitor cells were microdissected from E11.5 embryos. Or, they were isolated from E17.5 Id2-CreER; Rosa26R-fGFP embryos by flow cytometry.
