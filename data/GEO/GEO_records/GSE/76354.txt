TITLE
Recurrent rearrangements of the Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domain containing 3 gene (MSANTD3) in salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
By transcriptome (RNAseq) analysis of 3 human acinic cell carcimoma (AcCC) cases, we discovered two novel gene fusions, and further validated recurrent rearrangement of the MSANTD3 gene. By RNAseq of engineered MSANTD3 overexpression in rat salivary epithelial cells (compared to vector control), we identifed elevated expression of genes involved in protein synthesis.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of human acinic cell carcinoma cases was done using FFPE specimens, by rRNA depletion, Illumina Truseq library preparation, and Illumina 75x2 sequencing.  RNAseq of rat salivary epithelial cells overexpressing MSANTD3 (vs. empty vector control) was done by Truseq mRNA library preparation and Illumina 50x1 sequencing.
