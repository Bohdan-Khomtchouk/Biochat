TITLE
Comparison of S. boulardii cells in H2O vs. S. boulardii cells in H2O+HCl

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces sp. 'boulardii'

SUMMARY
We sought to better understand the mechanism of acid-induced cell death in Saccharomyces boulardii--a probiotic yeast routinely used to prevent and treat gastrointestinal disorders. To do this we generated microarray gene expression profiles of S. boulardii cells cultured in an acidic environment.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed. One replicate per array.
