TITLE
Gene expression in FACS sorted virus-specific CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Defective HBV-specific CD8+ T cells are believed to contribute to a chronic stage of the disease. To increase the understanding of the defective HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response, gene expression in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were compared with that in HCV- and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
Tetramer specific CD8+ T cells from chronic HBV or HCV-infected patients and one healthy individual were sorted by flow cytometry. Cells not specific for the particular tetramer were included as controls. Cells were frozen until use. RNA was extracted and then amplified and converted to cDNA before hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.

GPL19100 [HG-U219] Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array [CDF: Brainarray HGU219_Hs_ENTREZG_15.1.0]
