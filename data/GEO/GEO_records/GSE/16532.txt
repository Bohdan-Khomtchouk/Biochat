TITLE
Endometrial gene expression analysis at the time of embryo implantation in women with unexplained infertility

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the endometrial gene expression profile in women with unexplained infertility in comparison to fertile controls at the time of embryo implantation in order to find potential informative markers of uterine receptivity, and further, to identify the molecular mechanisms related to infertility.

DESIGN
High-density, oligonucleotide gene arrays, comprising 44,000 gene targets, were used to define the endometrial gene expression profile in infertile (n = 4) and fertile (n = 5) women during the mid-secretory phase (LH +7).
