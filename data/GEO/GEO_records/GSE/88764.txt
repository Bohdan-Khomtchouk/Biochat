TITLE
RNA sequencing of the urethral epithelial progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We will use micro-dissection to isolate cells from the embryonic mouse cloaca, and perform RNA-Seq analysis to identify molecular markers of the region of the cloaca that will give rise to the urethral epithelium.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from LCM dissected tissue originating from the dorsal and ventral regions of the embryonic day 10.5 and 13.5 cloaca. The long terms goal is to develop a transcriptional atlas for the developing genital tubercle and associated urethra

PLATFORM
