TITLE
Gene expression profile of a S. cerevisiae strain deleted in CSN5/RRI1 gene (systematic name YDL216C)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein complex which regulates the Cullin-RING family of ubiquitin ligases and carries out a deneddylase activity that resides in subunit 5 (CSN5). The budding yeast CSN is biochemically active and deletion mutants of each of its subunits exhibit deficiency in deneddylation of cullins, although the biological context of this activity is still unknown in this organism. To further characterize CSN function in budding yeast, we present here a transcriptomic analysis of a S. cerevisiae strain deleted in CSN5/RRI1 gene (hereafter referred to as CSN5), coding for the only canonical subunit of the complex. We show that Csn5 is involved in the modulation of the genes controlling aminoacid and lipid metabolism, and especially ergosterol biosynthesis. These alterations in gene expression correlate with the lower ergosterol levels and increased intracellular zinc content which we observed in csn5 null mutant cells.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates, csn5 deleted strain vs. isogenic wild-type strain W303
