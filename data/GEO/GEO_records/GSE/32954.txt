TITLE
Expression analysis of Aspergillus nidulans AN1599 (PbcR) overexpression mutant

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Aspergillus nidulans AN1599 (PbcR) overexpression mutant, compared to the FGSC A4 wild-type strain. Overexpression of the Zn(II)2Cys6 â€“type transcription factor, AN1599.4 (PbcR, pimaradiene biosynthetic cluster regulator), activates a secondary metabolite gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans. Activation of the pathway in Aspergillus nidulans lead to a production of ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene.

DESIGN
12x135K array of two separate cultures of FGSC A4 and two separate cultures of oe:AN1599(PbcR) with three separate RNA extractions from each culture. Each 135K array measures expression level of 10,546 genes with 6 probes/transcript. In addition, the array format contains tiling probes for 36 longer transcripts. All probes are in duplicates, giving the total number of 137,562 probes per array.
