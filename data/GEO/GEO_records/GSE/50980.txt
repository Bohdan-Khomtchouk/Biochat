TITLE
miR-483 overexpression in human sarcoma cell line MHH-ES-1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA abnormalities are increasingly relevent to cancer development, We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon miR-483 overexpression in sarcoma cell line MHH-ES-1.

DESIGN
MHH-ES-1 cells were transfected with miR-483-5p, -3p or scrambled control mimics and then harvested 48 hours after to isolate total RNAs using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was converted to cRNA probes using the BioArray High Yield Transcript Labeling Kit (ENZO diagnostics), and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip human HG-U133ver2+ 3â€™-mRNA expression microarray chips using protocol EukGEs2v4 on the GeneChip Fluidic Station.
