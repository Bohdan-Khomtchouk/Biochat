TITLE
Modeling human brain evolution using induced pluripotent stem cells: comparative analysis of neuronal development in humans and chimpanzees

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding evolutionary mechanisms underlying expansion and reorganization of the human brain represents an important aspect in analyzing the emergence of cognitive abilities typical of our species. Comparative analyses of neuronal phenotypes in closest living relatives (Pan troglodytes; the common chimpanzee) can shed the light into changes in neuronal morphology compared to the last common ancestor (LCA), opening possibilities for analyses of the timing of their appearance, and the role of evolutionary mechanisms favoring a particular type of information processing in humans. Here, we use induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to model neural progenitor cell migration and early development of cortical pyramidal neurons in humans and chimpanzees. In addition, we provide morphological characterization of the early stages of neuronal development in human and chimpanzee transplanted cells, and examine the role of developmental mechanisms previously proposed for the evolutionary expansions of the human brain on the early development of pyramidal neurons in the two species. The strategy proposed here lay down the basis for further comparative analysis between human and non-human primates and opens new avenues for understanding cognitive capability and neurological disease susceptibility differences between species.

DESIGN
PolyA RNA-Seq profiling of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons differentiated from human and chimpanzee iPSCs.
