TITLE
Chromatin context and ncRNA highlight physiological targets of MECP2 in brain.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of chromatin and sequence context and RNA highlighting MeCP2 function in the genome

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data uses 2 libraries for each sample comprising a bound and input reference, RNA-seq data uses MeCP2 null sample compared with 2 wild type replicate samples, Methylminer-seq data uses 1 high methylation sample and 1 low methylation sample, RNA-immunoprecipitated data uses 3 replicate samples.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
