TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Flowering time is a complex trait regulated by many genes that are integrated in different genetic pathways. Different genetic screenings carried out during the past decades have revealed an intrincated genetic regulatory network governing this trait. Efforts aimed at improving our understanding of how such genetic pathways respond to genetic and enviromental cues are needed. We used microarray to identify groups of up and down-regulated genes in an early flowering mutant, suppressor of gigantea (gis5).

DESIGN
gis5 and WT (Columbia, Col) 10 days-old seedlings were used for RNA extraction and hibridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Seedlings were grown on MS salts medium plates under continuos light at 23Â°C. We chose this particular light condition in order to avoid circadian clock effects on the global pattern of gene expression at this developmental stage.
