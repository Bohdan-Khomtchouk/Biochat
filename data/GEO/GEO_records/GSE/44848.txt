TITLE
Type I IFN signaling promotes local inflammation in pulmonary tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The critical role of type I IFN (IFN I ) in viral disease is thoroughly documented while their function in bacterial infection remains ambiguous. General interest in biological functions of IFN I in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection was raised by the identification of a distinct IFN I gene expression signature in tuberculosis (TB) patients. Here we demonstrate that TB-susceptible mice lacking the receptor for IFN I (IFNAR1) were protected from death upon aerogenic infection with Mtb. Increased survival was accompanied by reduced bacterial burden and ameliorated lung pathology as well as diminished production of proinflammatory IL-1?, among other cytokines. IFNAR1 signaling did not affect T cell responses, but markedly altered migration of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils to the lung during pulmonary TB. This process was orchestrated by presence of IFNAR1 in both immune and tissue-resident radioresistant cells. IFNAR1-driven TB susceptibility was initiated by CXCL5/CXCL1-driven accumulation of neutrophils into alveoli and subsequently a distinct compartmentalization of Mtb in lung phagocytes. We conclude that IFN I alters early innate events at the site of Mtb invasion leading to unleashed inflammation. Hence, our data furnish a mechanistic explanation for the detrimental role of IFN I in pulmonary TB.
