TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Histone Methylation and RNAP2 in Human Jurkat cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three transcriptional states can be defined by histone modifications and RNA polymerase II enriched at promoters and across the body of genes.  To gain insight into the active, poised and silent genes in human T-ALL cells, two antibodies against RNAP2, and  antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K79me2, and H3K27me3 were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq).

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing.  ChIP was performed using an antibody against RNAP2, H3K4me3, H3K79me2, and H3K27me3 using whole cell extract (WCE) as a background control.  ChIP was performed using a two antibody against hypophosphorylated forms of RNAP2 in two biological replicates. All other ChIPs were done in biological replicates with a single lane of sequencing.
