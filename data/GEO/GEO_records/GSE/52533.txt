TITLE
Direct sequencing of polyadenylation sites in fission yeast S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We sequenced the 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts among total RNA in fission yeast wildtype and rdp1âˆ† cells and mapped the 3'-most nucleotide prior to polyadenylation. We find that mRNA-coding open reading frames have a low number of polyadenylation sites with most of the reads, whereas pericentromeric dg and dh repeats have a high number of polyadenylation sites throughout the transcribed region, mapping to both strands.
