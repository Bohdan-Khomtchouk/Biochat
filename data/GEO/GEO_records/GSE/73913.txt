TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of chromatin loci bound by DDX5 in cultured T helper 17 cell [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to identify chromatin loci bound by DDX5 in cultured T helper 17 cell in wildtype and DDX5 deficient background. Methods: ChIP-seq profiles of 48hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells from wild-type mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HighSeq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped by Bowtie2.0. Results: DDX5 were found to be enriched on a subset of previously characterized RORgt occupied sites on the chromatin. Conclusions: Our study suggest that a subset of RORgt occupied regions were co-bound by DDX5.

DESIGN
DDX5-associated-DNA profiles of 48hr in vitro cultured Th17 from wild type (WT) and DDX5 T cell specific conditional knockout mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HighSeq
