TITLE
Circadian regulation of gene expression in the SCN (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a circadian RNA expression profile of the mammalian biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in C57/BL6 mice, at 2-hour resolution using microarrays, and at 6-hour resolution using RNA-seq.Â 

DESIGN
8 samples total covering 8 time points, with no replicates. SCN samples from mouse brains collected every 6 hours for 2 days (8 samples total).
