TITLE
Gene expression profiles regulated by PLD1-E2F1 axis in two Wnt-relevant colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
1. To identify potential effectors responsible for anti-tumorigenesis by targeting PLD1, we performed microarray in two Wnt-relevant colon cancer cells and analyzed transcriptional profile of genes that were differently expressed by inhibition and knockdown of PLD1 2. We also investigated potential downstream effectors of PLD1-E2F1 axis using microarray analysis in PLD1 and E2F1-depleted CRC cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated DLD1 and HCT116 cells in shCTRL (Vehicle), shCTRL-PLD1-Inh, shPLD1, or shPLD1/shE2F1 groups under 1% serum condition for 36 hours, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
