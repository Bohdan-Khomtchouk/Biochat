SUMMARY
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a lymphoma characterized by aberrant activation of CCND1/cyclin D1 followed by sequential genetic abnormalities. Genomic abnormalities in MCL have been extensively examined by classical cytogenetics and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization techniques, pointing out a number of alterations in genomic regions that correlate with the neoplastic phenotype and survival. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphism genomic microarrays (SNP-chip) have been developed and used for analysis of cancer genomics. This technique allows detection of genomic changes with higher resolution, including loss of heterozygosity without changes of gene dosage, so-called acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD). As a result of the analysis, known alterations were confirmed by SNP arrays, including deletion of INK4A/ARF, duplication/amplification of MYC, deletion of ATM, and deletion of TP53. We also identified a duplication/amplification that occurred at 13q involving oncogenic microRNA, miR17-92. We found other genomic abnormalities, including duplication/amplification of cyclin D1, del(1p), del(6q), dup(3q) and dup(18q). Our SNP-chip analysis detected these abnormalities at high resolution, allowing us to narrow the size of the commonly deleted regions, including 1p and 6q. Our SNP-chip analysis detected a number of aUPD sites, including whole chromosome 9 aUPD and 9p aUPD. We also found an MCL case with 19p, leading to homozygous deletion of TNFSF genes. keyword: SNP-chip; Kawmata_MCL

DESIGN
To identify oncogenic lesions in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), we performed a genome-wide analysis of primary MCL samples using high-density SNP arrays (Affymetrix GeneChip).
