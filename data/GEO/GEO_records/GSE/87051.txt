TITLE
Transcriptome and gene/transcript expression profiling in melan-a cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The melan-a cell line is derived from immortalized mouse melanocytes obtained from Ink4a-ARF-/- mice. RNA-seq was performed to assess the global nature of transcript and gene expression profiles in melan-a cells. These RNA-seq data, along with separate ChIP-seq performed in melan-a cells (GSE38498), were used to correlate gene expression patterns with the presence or absence of transcription factors of interest.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from three bioreplicate melan-a cell lines. These gene expression profiles were determined from RNA-seq performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Three lanes of sequencing were done for each bioreplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
