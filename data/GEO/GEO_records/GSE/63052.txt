TITLE
The involvement of body appearance in influencing the biofilm formation by Escherichia coli K-12 through RodZ

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Fifty five genes were induced or reduced (2.5-fold) by the absence of rodZ genes Among them, curli production-, cell division-, and biofilm-associated genes as well as phage-related genes were regulated by the RodZ, significantly

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, BW25113 WT/pCA24N vs. rodZ/pCA24N vs. rodZ/pCA24N-RodZ. For preparing the total RNA, each cells were grown at 37Â°C upto OD600=0.5 and then keep growing with 1 mM IPTG for additional 6 h

PLATFORM
GPL19391 Mycroarray Escherichia coli K12_substr_MG1655  3x20K Microarrays
