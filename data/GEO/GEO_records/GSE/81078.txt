TITLE
Expression Profiling In Chromosome 1 substitution lines derived from Chinese wild mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes in liver tissue whose expression is under genetic and high fat diet induced regulation  in three Chromosome 1 substitution lines derived from Chinese wild mice (B6-Chr1SJ (SJ), B6-Chr1KM (KM), and B6-Chr1HZ (HZ)) and one donor strain C57B/LJ(B6) We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in three chromosome 1 substitution lines and one donor strain which fed with control or high fat diet.

DESIGN
Male mice were first maintained on a chow diet (M01-F25, Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd, China) for 8 weeks, then fed with 10% fat diet (D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, U.S.A.) until sacrifice at 20 weeks of age.Liver tissues were collected and total RNAs were immediately extracted.RNA from two mice were pooled and assayed on one Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Assay 1.0 chip.
