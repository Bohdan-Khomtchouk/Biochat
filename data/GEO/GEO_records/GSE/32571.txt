TITLE
Gene signatures in prostate cancer linked to the Gleason score

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of novel oncogenic and druggable targets in patient subgroups with poor prognosis may help to develop corresponding targeted therapy approaches. Microarray data analyses of 59 prostate cancer and 39 benign tissue samples revealed major transcriptional differences. More than 5.000 genes were identified to be differentially expressed between matched tumor and benign samples. In the prostate cancer samples we identified 144 differentially expressed associated with Gleason pattern.

DESIGN
Illumina microarray experiments were done from of 59 prostate cancer and 39 matched benign tissue samples. We analyzed for differentially expressed genes between tumor and benign tissues, and between tumors with  higher Gleason patter (4+3 and higher) against lower Gleason patter (3+4 and lower).
