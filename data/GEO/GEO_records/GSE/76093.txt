TITLE
RNAseq analysis of two independent stains of C57BL/6J-Plat-/- mice and wild-type C57BL/6J.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability to generate defined null mutations in mice revolutionized the analysis of gene function in mammals. However, gene-deficient mice generated by using 129-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells may carry large segments of 129 DNA, even when extensively backcrossed to reference strains, such as C57BL/6J, and this may confound interpretation of experiments performed in these mice. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), encoded by the PLAT gene, is a fibrinolytic serine protease that is widely expressed in the brain. A large number of neurological abnormalities have been reported in tPA-deficient mice. The studies here compare genes differentially expressed in the brains of Plat-/- mice from two independent Plat-/- mouse derivations to wild-type C57BL/6J mice. One strain denoted “Old” was constructed in ES cells from a 129 mouse and backcrossed extensively to C57BL/6J, and one denoted “New” Plat-/- mouse was constructed using zinc finger nucleases directly in the C57BL/6J-Plat-/- mouse strain. We identify a significant set of genes that are differentially expressed in the brains of Old Plat-/- mice that preferentially cluster in the vicinity of Plat on chromosome 8, apparently linked to more than 20 Mbp of DNA flanking Plat being of 129 origin. No such clustering is seen in the New Plat-/- mice.

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome profiling of the cerebral cortex of wild-type control C57BL/6J mice and two independent Plat-/- mice strains on the C57BL/6J background.
