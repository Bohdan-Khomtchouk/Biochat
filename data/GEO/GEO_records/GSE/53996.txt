TITLE
Effects of high-fat induced obesity on gene expression in mouse kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression in the 20-week remnant kidneys of uninephrectomized mice fed either a chow or a high fat diet was compared with kidney tissue from the corresponding sham groups. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying effects of high-fat induced obesity on gene expression in mouse kidney.

DESIGN
Male C57/BJ mice aged 6 weeks were randomly assigned to uninephrectomy (UNX) or sham procedures and fed with a high fat diet or control chow diet. All mice were sacrificed under anesthesia 20 weeks after surgery and kidneys were harvested. 3-4 total RNA samples per group were analyzed and gene expression was compared between groups.
