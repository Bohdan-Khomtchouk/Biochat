TITLE
Gene expression-signatures for non-small cell lung cancer patients with different EGFR muational status.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify a plasma miRNA panel that could help to separate NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR, plasma samples of 3 EGFR19DEL, 3 EGFRp.L858R, and 3 EGFRWT patients with NSCLC and 4 HCs were selected for Agilent miRNA microarray analysis to detect differences in the expression levels of circulating miRNAs (n = 2,568) between the above cohorts.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, plasma samples of 3 EGFR19DEL, 3 EGFRp.L858R, and 3 EGFRWT patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC and 4 HCs were selected for the Agilent microRNA array expression profiles with a total of 2.568 unique miRNAs. The significantly dysregulated miRNAs between the above cohorts were then validated by qRT-PCR.
