TITLE
Cell cycle motif decoy oligos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-stranded oligos listed below (and the corresponding reverse compliment) were synthesized and annealed: E2F: CTAGATTTCCCGCGGATC (decoy); CTAGACTCTGCTCGGATC (scrambled) KTGGYRSGAA: CTAGATTCCCGCCAAGGATC (decoy); CTAGACAGCTACTCCGGATC (scrambled) TGCGCANK: CTAGACATGCGCAGGATC (decoy); CTAGATCACAGGCGGATC (scrambled) CCAATNNSNNNGCG: CTAGACGCCCTCCGATTGGGGATC (decoy); CTAGATGCACGCTCGGTCCGGATC (scrambled) ACTWSNACTNY: CTAGAGGAGTTGTAGTGGATC (decoy); CTAGAGATAGTGTGTGGGATC (scrambled) HeLa cells were propagated in DMEM (Invitrogen) plus 10% FBS and transfected with 0.5 uM of double-stranded DNA. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from HeLa cells 2 d after transfection of the indicated decoy oligo or scrambled oligo in duplicate. RNA was amplified using the Ambion Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA kit. For each motif, decoy oligo transfected samples (labeled with Cy5) and the corresponding scrambled oligo transfected samples (labeled with Cy3) were competitively hybridized to HEEBO microarrays as described ( http://www.microarray.org/sfgf/heebo.do ).
