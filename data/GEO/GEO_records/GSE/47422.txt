TITLE
Expression data from TFIIA-non-cleavable mouse fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During embryogenesis, development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) occurs in the fetal liver and involves coordinate programs of transcription. Taspase1, a highly conserved threonine protease, directly cleaves and regulates the TFIIA families of transcription factors. We discovered that loss of Taspase1 (Tasp1-/-) or non-cleavage of TFIIAα−β (TFIIAα-βnc/nc) leads to a severe fetal liver developmental retardation that is associated with impaired HSC self-renewal and loss of HSC quiescence. We used microarray to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which TFIIA regulates fetal liver hematopoiesis, and expression of targets of HoxA9 was found to be altered by gene set enrichment analyses.

DESIGN
Embryonic day 14.5 fetal liver HSCs (defined as Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+cells) of wild-type (n = 4) and TFIIAα-βnc/nc (n = 3) were analyzed.
