TITLE
Functional opsin retrogene in nocturnal moth

ORGANISM
Helicoverpa armigera

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from first instar larvae, fifth instar larvae and adults using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from 20 µl total RNA using Oligo (dT) magnetic beads and then was broken into short fragments (about 200bp) in the presence of fragmentation buffer at 94 °C for 5 min. The mRNA samples were used to construct the cDNA libray with mRNA-Seq assay, which was performed by Novogene (Beijing, China).The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 or HiSeq4000 (Illumina) in paired-end mode, creating reads with a length of 101 bp (HiSeq2000) or 151 bp (HiSeq4000).
