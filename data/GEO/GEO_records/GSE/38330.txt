TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Human Pediatric Astrocytomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of grades II, II and iV pediatric astrocytomas. Results used to straify tumors into molecular subclasses representative of adult tumors. The mesenchymal subtype is associated with high expression of immune response-related genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression of grade II, III and IV pediatric astrocytomas, 24 individual tumor samples were profiled
