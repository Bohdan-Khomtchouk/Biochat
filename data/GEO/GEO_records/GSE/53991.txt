TITLE
tRNA level in HeLa, CFBE41o- and primary HBE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of overall tRNA level between HeLa, cystic fibrosis (CF) bronichal epithelial (CFBE41o-) cells and primary CF patient derived human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, estimation of absolute HeLa tRNA levels.

DESIGN
HeLa, CFBE41o- and primary HBE cells were compared to HEK cells, No. Biological repeats: 4, HeLa vs. HEK; 3, CFBE41o- vs. HEK; 4, primary HBE vs. HEK, 4, HEK vs. HEK, HeLa absolute levels, 2
