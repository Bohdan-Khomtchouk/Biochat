TITLE
Comparison of murine colonic mucosal gene expression between postanatal day 90 (P90) to postnatal day 30 (P30)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of murine colonic mucosal gene expression between postanatal day 90 (P90) to postnatal day 30 (P30) by whole genomic expression microarray. Gene expression profiling of colonic mucosal DNA between P90 and P30 mice. Agilent Technologies two-color labelling kit and genomic hybridization protocol was utilized.

DESIGN
4 independent P90 to P30 comparisons were performed as follows. RNA (0.4ug) samples were processed and labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Quick Amp labelling kit, two color, Agilent technologies)  and 4 independent P90 to P30 comparisons were done on Agilent tecnologies 4x44k whole genomic expression microarray G2519F, Amadid:014868)

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
