TITLE
Gene expression profile in rice developing caryopsis exposed to high temperature

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To summarize the impact of high temperature on rice grain filling, we performed the rice 44k oligo microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from developing caryopses ripened under 33˚C/28˚C (high temperature) and 25˚C/20˚C (Control), and subjected to 44k oligo-DNA microarray with 3 biological replicates.
