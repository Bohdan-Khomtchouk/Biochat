TITLE
High-throughput sequencing reveals microRNAs in response to heat stress in head kidney of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Purpose:Our data significantly advance understanding of heat stress regulatory mechanism of miRNA in the head kidney of rainbow trout Methods:miRNAs of rainbow trout were involved in heat stress were identified by high-throughput sequencing of six small RNA libraries of the kidney tissues under control (18℃) and heat-treated (24℃) conditions Results:high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs responsive to heat stress. We obtained 41,991,119 and 43,882,123 raw reads and 39,756,736  and 42,538,331 clean reads from under control (18℃) and heat-treated (24℃) .A total of 392 conserved miRNAs and 989 novel miRNAs were identified, of which 78 miRNAs were expressed in different response to heat stress. In addition to, including 393 negative correlation miRNA-target gene pairs Conclusions:through high-throughput sequencing of the six libraries from head kidney tissue of rainbow trout, the expression level of miRNA has significant changes after heat stress.
