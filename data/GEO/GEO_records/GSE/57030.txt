TITLE
Expression data from WT and Snail1 knockout (KO) embryonic endothelial cells (ECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Snail1 is a master factor of epithelial to mesenchymal transitioin (EMT), however, its role in embryonic vascular development is largely undefined. We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression between cultured WT and Snai1 KO embyronic ECs.

DESIGN
ECs isolated from E10.5 Snail1f/f embryos were infected with adeno-Î²Gal or -Cre to generate WT and Snail1 KO ECs. RNA were collected for Affymetrix microarrays.
