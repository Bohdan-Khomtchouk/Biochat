TITLE
Developmental transcriptional profiling of Triticeae reproductive development

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Despite their importance, there remains a paucity of large scale expression-based studies of reproductive development in the species belonging to the Triticeae.  As a first step to address this deficiency, a gene expression atlas of triticale reproductive development was generated using the 55K Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Wheat Genome Array. The global transcriptional profiles of the anther/pollen, ovary and stigma were analyzed at concurrent developmental stages and co-regulated as well as preferentially expressed genes were identified.  Data analysis revealed both novel and conserved regulatory factors underlying Triticeae floral development and function.
