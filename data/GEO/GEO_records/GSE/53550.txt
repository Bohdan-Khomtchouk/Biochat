TITLE
HUVEC with/without VEGF-A treatment in 3D matrigel or 2D monoculture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To profile changes in gene expression in human endothelial cells in response to VEGF-A165 and phenotypic changes during vascular network formation in vitro

DESIGN
16 samples of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were analysized, four distinct biological samples were used in each condition. The four conditions included: VEGF treatment in Matrigel culture, Mock treatment in Matrigel culture, VEGF treatment in 2D monolayer, and mock treatment in 2D monolayer.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
