TITLE
Transcriptome wide target profiling for miR-199a-5p and miR-424-3p.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome Identification of  direct targets of miR-199a-5p and miR-424-3p using biotinylated pull-downs found that both miRNAs are likely to have a role in the cell cycle.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with biotinylated miRNAs (either miR-199a-5p or miR-424-3p). The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and compared to the input control.
