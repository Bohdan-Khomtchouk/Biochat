TITLE
RNA seq_A375 gSMARCB1 +  A549 etoposide, Aurora kinases inhibitors treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the senescence gene signatures in the cells, which were  genetic SMARCB1 depleted or treated with aurora kinase inhibitors or etoposide, we performed next generation RNA sequencing on these cell, and 'FRIDMAN_SENESCENCE_UP' geneset was used to determine the enrichment of senescence-related genes. The RNA sequencing results include (1) A375 cells and SMARCB1 depleted counterparts. (2) A549 cells and aurora kinase inhibitor (Alisertib, barasertib or tozasertib) or etoposide treated counterparts.

DESIGN
RNA seq data of A375_gSMARCB1 +  A549_etoposide, Aurora kinases inhibitors treated, to check senescence gene expression signature one replicate of A375 cells parental V.S SMARCB1 KO (by CRISPR) + duplicates of A549 parental V.S etoposide, or 3 indepdent aurora kinase inhibitors (MLN8237/Alisertib, VX680/Tozasertib, AZD1132/Barasertib)
