TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in HEK293T cells after NDV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mammals have highly evolved receptors for sensing invading viral pathogens. RLRs comprise of one such family of receptors involved in sensing RNA viruses. The antiviral signaling cascade is tightly regulatedd by various post transcriptional modifications however the post transcriptional regulation by microRNAs is not well understood. We performed miRNA profiling to identify miRNAs induced by virus infections with potential role in regulating RLR signaling cascade.

DESIGN
We infected HEK293T cells with NDV-LasoTa strain for 6h. Total small RNA was isolated and hybridised on the Affymetrix miRNA Gene Chip 4.0. We sought to identify novel miRNAs targeting the antiviral signaling.
