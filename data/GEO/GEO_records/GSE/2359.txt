TITLE
Sorted wing disc proneural cluster cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of M4-GFP wing imaginal disc cells was used to recover a purified population of the cells that comprise the “proneural clusters” from which sensory organ precursors of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) arise.  Whole-genome microarray analysis and in situ hybridization was then used to identify and verify a set of genes that are preferentially expressed in proneural cluster cells.  Genes in this set encode proteins with a diverse array of implied functions, and loss-of-function analysis of two candidate genes shows that they are indeed required for normal PNS development.
