TITLE
Escherichia coli RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare gene expression data for a well known model organism (Escherichia coli) using different technologies (NGS here,  microarray from GSE48776).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Wild Type and two Mutant Strains (ydcR (b1439) MUTANT and yjiR (b4340) MUTANT), growth in minimal medium, were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina MiSeq.
