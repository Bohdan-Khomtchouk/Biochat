TITLE
Gene expression from aged and young dorsal root ganglia after nerve injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sciatic nerve crush was performed on cohorts of 2-month and 24-month old animals. Resulting gene-expression data were generated from dorsal root ganglia 5 days after injury compared to na√Øve animals. Results show differences in intrinsic growth responses with normal aging.

DESIGN
Total RNA taken from L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia 5 days after injury 2-month and 24-month old animals at either day 0 or day 5 after sciatic nerve crush injury.
