TITLE
Circadian transcriptional profile of Synechococcus without KaiC phosphorylation cycling

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, essentially all promoter activities are under the control of the circadian clock in continuous light (LL) conditions. Here, we employed high-density oligonucleotide arrays to investigate comprehensive profiles of genome-wide Synechococcus gene expression in the kaiCEE mutant strains in which the KaiC phosphorylation cycling is abolished under LL.. In the kaiCEE mutant strain more than 23% of transcripts significantly oscillated with a period of about 48 h. 409 cyclic genes were shared with the wild type strains.

DESIGN
kaiCEE mutant strain was analyzed under continuous light (LL) using Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip CustomExpress Arrays) representing predicted 2,515 protein-coding genes on the genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, which can be used also to the almost homologous strain, S. elongatus PCC 7942: a single experiment in kaiCEE mutant under LL from hour 8 to 96 in LL timecourse data (8~96 hours under continuous light) from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (kaiCEE mutant) strains
