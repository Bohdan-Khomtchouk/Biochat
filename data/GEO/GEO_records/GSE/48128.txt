TITLE
Regulation of transcription by MLL2 complex and MLL complexes-associated protein AKAP95

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation is widely associated with gene activation, direct evidence for its causal role in transcription, through specific MLL family members, is scarce. Here we have purified a human MLL2 (Kmt2b) complex that is highly active in H3K4 methylation and chromatin transcription in a cell-free system. This effect requires SAM and intact H3K4, establishing a direct and causal role for MLL2-mediated H3K4 methylation in transcription. We then show that human AKAP95, a chromatin-associated protein, is physically and functionally associated with the Dpy-30-MLL complexes  and directly enhances their methyltransferase activity. Ectopic AKAP95 stimulates expression of a chromosomal reporter in synergy with MLL1 or MLL2, whereas AKAP95 depletion impairs retinoic acid-mediated gene induction in embryonic stem cells. These results demonstrate an important role for AKAP95 in regulating histone methylation and gene expression, particularly during cell fate transitions.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from control or knockdown cells before and after RA-mediated differentiation were subjected to Illumina microarray analyses. The complete dataset containing non_normalized, median-normalized and expression ratio (relative to Scramble shRNA, undifferentiated data) is linked below as a supplementary file [complete_data.txt].
