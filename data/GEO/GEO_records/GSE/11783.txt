TITLE
Gene expression profile of bladder tissue of patients with ulcerative interstitial cystitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interstitial cystitis (IC), a chronic bladder disease with an increasing incidence, is diagnosed using subjective symptoms in combination with cystoscopic and histological evidence. The ultimate goal is the development of a diagnostic assay for IC on a molecular level. By cystoscopic examination, IC can be classified into an ulcerative and a non-ulcerative subtype. To better understand this debilitating disease on a molecular level, a comparative gene expression profile of bladder biopsies from patients with ulcerative IC and control patients has been performed. Candidate marker genes for ulcerative IC were identified.
