TITLE
Differentially expression profiling in a brain metastasis of a papillary thyroid carcinoma and its technical replicate vs. non-brain metastatic papillary thyroid carcinomas,  and primary brain tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment: Establishment of expression profiles in a brain metastasis from a PTC (RNA processing and hybridization to Affymetrix microarray done twice to yield a technical replicate), in non-brain metastatic, stage III and IV PTCs, and primary brain tumors. Biostatistics analysis identified genes and biofunctions related to the brain metastatic PTC.

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from tumor specimens and RNA with an RIN > 5 was processed using the recommended processing kits and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. The CEL files were quantile-normalized and ANOVA was applied to generate differentially expressed probe sets. Probe sets that were significantly associated with the brain metastasis were subjected to biofunctional analysis.
