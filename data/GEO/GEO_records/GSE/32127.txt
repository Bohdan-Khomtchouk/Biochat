TITLE
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, control vs. Kashin-Beck Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: To investigate the differences between the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal controls and patients with Kashin-Beck disease (KBD).  Methods: Twenty KBD patients and 12 normal subjects were selected from a KBD-endemic area and divided into four pairs of KBD vs. control (KBD, n=5 per pair; control, n=3 per pair). RNAs were respectively isolated from KBD PBMCs and normal PBMCs. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. KBD PBM cells. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 KBD replicates.
