TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana: trans-2-hexenal-treated seedlings versus control seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with trans-2-hexenal, highlighting to the physiological function of plant volatile chemicals by observing early response of gene expressions in Arabidopsis seedlings.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, trans-2-hexenal-treated seedlings vs. control seedlings. Biological replicates:2 control replicates, 2 trans-2-hexenal-treated.
