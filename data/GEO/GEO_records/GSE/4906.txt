TITLE
Comparing control and TGF-beta treated cord blood-derived human mast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cord blood-derived stem cells were in vitro cultured in the presence of 40 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml IL6 and 2 microM lysophosphatidic acid for 5 week. Then mast cells were magnetically isolated and further cultured for 4 days in the presence or absence of 2 ng/ml TGF-betaI. Total RNA was isolated and processed according to the Agilent Low-input RNA Linear Amplification Kit and microarray hybridization protocol. Keywords: Agilent Whole Human Genome, dual channel, LogRatio values are log(10) values

DESIGN
5 biological replicates from 5 donors and one technical replicate (dye-swap)

PLATFORM
GPL1708 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Feature Number version)
