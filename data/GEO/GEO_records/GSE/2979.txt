TITLE
Entamoeba plus Caco2 cells

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite which causes colitis and liver abscesses.  Using a genomic DNA microarray consisting of 1.6 - 2.0 kb genomic inserts we have generated a transcriptional profile of 1,971 unique parasite transcripts.  The arrays in this experiment set were used to (1) estimate relative transcript abundance for Entamoeba histolytica (HM-1:IMSS) trophozoites in mid-logarithmic growth and (2) to examine changes in the transcriptional profile of Entamoeba histolytica when the parasite interacts with colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2).  A time course was used such that RNA was isolated from ameba alone and ameba + Caco-2 cells at 3hrs, 6hrs and 9hrs corresponding to 10%, 50% and 90% cell monolayer destruction.  At least two biological experiments and three replicates were used for each time point. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Keywords: time_series_design
