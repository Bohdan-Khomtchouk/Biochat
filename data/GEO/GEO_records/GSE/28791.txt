TITLE
rilkit-eqtl analysis (random pair design). Tools to optimize the use of RIL populations for natural diversity studies and QTL cloning

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp07_rilkit - rilkit-eqtl analysis (random pair design). To provide quantitative geneticists studying natural variation in our RIL populations with information and resources necessary to speed up QTL cloning and candidate genes identification. This articulates around the creation of two major resources and their integration into databases to make the information accessible to users: A. Whole transcriptome survey, B. Production of complementary material. Comparison of 164 Cvi/Col(8RV) Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) and 164 Bur/Col (20RV) RILs.

DESIGN
162 dye-swaps. Genotype and ecotype comparison.

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
