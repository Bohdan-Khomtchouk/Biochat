TITLE
Primary human epithelial cells exposed to coarse, fine and ultrafine particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize global gene expression in human airway epithelial cells and identify cellular pathways associated with coarse, fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) exposures.  Ambient PM was collected in 3 different size fractions from Chapel Hill air, particles were extracted from foam or filter matrices and lyophilized.  Human primary airway epithelial cells were exposed to particles at 250Î¼g/ml or vehicle control for 6h in culture.  Following exposure, RNA was isolated and hybridized to human HG U133A affymetrix chips. Keywords: particle treatment

DESIGN
Human primary epithelial cells were exposed to coarse, fine, ultrafine PM or vehicle control in culture for 6h.  Three biological replicates for each treatment (coarse, fine, ultrafine, control) were conducted at (250ug/ml).  12 Affymetrix chips (HG U133A) were used.
