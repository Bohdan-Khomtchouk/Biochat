TITLE
TGF-β inhibitors stimulate red blood cell production by enhancing self-renewal of BFU-E erythroid progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Erythroid progenitor BFU-Es are so-named based on their ability to generate in methylcellulose culture large colonies of erythroid cells that consist of “bursts” of smaller erythroid colonies derived from the later CFU-E Epo- dependent progenitors. “Early” BFU-E cells forming large BFU-E colonies presumably have higher capacities for self-renewal than do those forming small BFU-E colonies. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this heterogeneity, we conducted single cell transcriptome analysis on BFU-E cells purified from mouse embryos. Our analyses showed that there are two principal subgroups of mouse BFU-E cells and that the type III TGFβ receptor (TβRIII) is a potential marker that distinguishes “early” and “late” BFU-Es.  Expression of TβRIII is correlated with that of GATA1, a gene encoding an erythroid transcription factor induced during the BFU-E to CFU-E transition. The mouse and human BFU-E sub populations (TßRIII10%lo) expressing the 10% lowest amount of surface TβRIII are indeed enriched for early BFU-Es, and are significantly more responsive to glucocorticoid stimulation, which promotes BFU-E self-renewal, as compared to the total BFU-E population. The TßRIII10%lo BFU-E subpopulation presumably represents earlier BFU-Es with maximal capacity for self-renewal. Consistent with this notion, signaling by the TGFβ receptor kinases RI and RII increases during the transition from early (TßRIII10%lo) to late  (TßRIII10%hi) BFU-Es and then decreases in CFU-E cells. Blocking TGF-β signaling by receptor kinase inhibitors increase TßRIII10%lo BFU-E cell self-renewal and increases total erythroblast production, suggesting the use of this type of drug in treating Epo unresponsive anemias.
