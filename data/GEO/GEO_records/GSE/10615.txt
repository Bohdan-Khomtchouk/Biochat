SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptome profiles of the two principal histological variants of malignant germ cell tumor that occur in childhood Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Here, we analyzed the global gene expression profiles of 27 pediatric MGCTs from the two principal histologies (18 yolk sac tumors [YSTs] and 9 seminomas).
