TITLE
The histone H3K9 demethylase KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic genes BNIP3 and BNIP3L

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We isolated and sequenced the shRNA region of a pSM2 retroviral plasmid to identify which shRNAs were enriched in MCF10A cells grown in detached conditions versus the same MCF10A cells that were grown under normal, attached conditions.

DESIGN
Comparison of the ratio of shRNA sequences between cells grown under normal conditions versus cells grown in detached conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL21715 Illumina Genome Analyzer (synthetic construct)
