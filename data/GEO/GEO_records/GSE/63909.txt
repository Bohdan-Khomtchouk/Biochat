TITLE
Microarray analysis of Wild-type vs. Brpf1-deficient P4 mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from three pairs of wild-type and Brpf1-deficient mouse brains (the dorsal cortex part) at postnatal day 4 for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The cDNA samples were then labeled and mixed for hybridization with one array. The data from three arrays were obtained and used for bioinformatic analysis.
