TITLE
Gene expression variation in lymphocyte subpopulations in response to low dose of ionizing radiations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphocytes are the standard cell of a majority of biodosimetry approaches because of their availability and radiosensitivity. But progresses remain to be performed to bring down the minimum threshold of dose sensitivity. To find a lymphocyte subtype able to respond to low doses of ionizing radiation, we examined gene expression variations in different lymphocyte subpopulations using the microarray technology. Blood samples were independently exposed to 0, 0.05 and 0.5 Gray of ionizing radiations. Three and 24 hours after exposure, CD56+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were negatively isolated. RNA from each condition was competitively hybridized on oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: Dose response, stress response, cell type comparison

DESIGN
We characterized genes whose expression level was affected following exposure to Î³ rays by carrying out genome-wide expression profiling on each lymphocyte subpopulation. Total blood samples were collected from 5 healthy male donors. Each sample was splitted into three parts which were exposed respectively to 0 Gy (sham-irradiated), 0.05 Gy and 0.5 Gy of ionizing radiations. Lymphocytes subpopulations were sorted 3 and 24 hours after irradiation. RNA was prepared from each cell type and amplified. The amino-allyl amplified RNAs were labeled and independently hybridized to the array. RNA from MNC obtained from 20 independent healthy donors constituted the reference group for competitive oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. According to our criteria of quality, we considered a total of 114 microarrays
