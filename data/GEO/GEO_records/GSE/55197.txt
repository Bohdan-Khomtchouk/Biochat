TITLE
The P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome recorded under 14 different experimental conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional profile of P.aeruginosa PA14 grown under 14 different environmental conditions. These included conditions of growth within biofilms, at various temperatures, osmolarities and phosphate concentrations, under anaerobic conditions, attached to a surface and conditions encountered within the eukaryotic host. We found that > 30% of the PA14 genome was differentially regulated at least under one of the 14 environmental conditions (referred to as the adaptive transcriptome). Most of the genes were also differentially regulated upon sigma factor hyper expression and/or inactivation (GEO accession number GSE54999) and many of those belonged to primary alternative sigma factor regulons.

DESIGN
The samples of P. aeruginosa PA14 wild type strain were cultivated under 14 different experimental conditions and were analyzed by RNA-seq. For each condition, at least two biological replicates were generated Please note that PA14 is our standard lab strain used for all generated data in this records. There is no mutation introduced for any of those experiments, and thus, the descriptions only highlight the growth conditions.
