TITLE
Expression data from rice panicles of osmads1 mutant and wild type

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsMADS1 in rice is an important transcription factor in controlling flower development, not only in flower organs development, but also in floral meristem determinacy. Early flower panicle we used is a high expression stage for OsMADS1. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying functions of OsMADS1 in rice flower development.

DESIGN
Rice panicles in length of 2 mm and 5-7 mm were collectecd for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.Rice panicles in length of 2 mm is the stage for the initiation of inner floral organ development and in length of 5-7 mm is the late stages for floral organ development.Though comparing the microarray data of osmads1 and wild-type (control) at these two stages, we can find the functions of OsMADS1 in the early and late flower development stages. Three biological repeats were used. And totally 12 samples were analyzed.
