TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha factor cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cell cycle microarray to identify global trancription profile. Keywords: cell cycle time course

DESIGN
Cells were synchronized with alpha factor and sampled every 10 min across 2 cell cycles. A total of 13 samples were analyzed. No replicates were included. cDNA of the cell cycle samples were labelled with Cy5. For Cy3 labelling, asynchronous yeast population was used.
