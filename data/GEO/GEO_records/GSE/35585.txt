SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Scott Tenenbaum ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). The RNA binding protein (RBP) associated mRNA sequencing track (RIP-Seq) is produced as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project ( ). This track displays transcriptional fragments associated with RBP in cell lines ( ) K562 and GM12878, using Ribonomic profiling via Illumina SBS. In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However, it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns. These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Seq profiling. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
