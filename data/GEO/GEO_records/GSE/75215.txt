TITLE
RNA deep sequencing to compare genome-wide differences between PRMT5/knockdown and control AML cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the pro-leukemic activities of PRMT5 in AML partly via modulating the transcription of key genes. The goal of this experiment is to confirm the changes observed in expression of genes targeted by PRMT5 activities. RNA Deep sequencing was employed to validate and reproduce the changes measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTâ€“PCR) techniques.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from MV4-11 cell line (FLT3-ITD AML) following PRMT5 knockdown using specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to compare gene expression pattern between PRMT5/Knockdown and control (control: MV4-11 cells transduced with scramble control).
