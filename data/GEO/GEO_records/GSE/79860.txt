TITLE
A switch from neuronal network development to maintenance during postnatal development of rat prefrontal cortex

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To unravel the gene expression changes during postnatal prefrontal cortex development,  RNA-seq was performed in the rat medial prefrontal cortex at five time points from early life to adulthood (postnatal day 8, 14, 21, 35 and 70) and differential expression of protein-coding genes, lincRNAs and alternative exons was analyzed. A switch from neuronal network development to maintenance during postnatal rat prefrontal cortex development was shown.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between 5 different developmental time points (postnatal day 8, 14, 21, 35 and 70) in medial prefrontal cortex of Wistar rats. 5 samples per time point.
