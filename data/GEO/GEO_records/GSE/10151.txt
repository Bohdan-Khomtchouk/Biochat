TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of Medicago truncatula and Glycine max Using Tiling Microarrays

ORGANISM
Glycine max ; Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the subseries listed below.

DESIGN
Both the barrel medic and soybean tiling arrays were produced on the Maskless Array Synthesizer platform. Briefly, tiling-paths consisting of 36-mer oligonucleotides offset by five nucleotides were designed to represent both DNA strands of the selected barrel medic and soybean genome sequence. Probes were synthesized at a feature-density of 390,000 probes per array in a “chess board” design. Microarray production and storage were carried out. Total RNA and mRNA were sequentially isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, respectively. mRNA from different organ types was reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo(dT)18 and random nonamer primers, during which amino-allyl-modified dUTP (aa-dUTP) was incoporated. The aa-dUTP decorated cDNA was fluorescent labeled by conjugating the monofunctional Cy3 dye (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) to the amino-allyl functional groups in the cDNA. Two μg dye-labeled targets were used for hybridization.
