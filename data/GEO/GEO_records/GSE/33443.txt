TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in response to tomato leaves extract treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed to evaluate the global gene expression profiles of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with tomato leaves extract (TLE) in 1 hr and 48 hrs of treatment. Several of genes with p < 0.05 and fold-change cut-off < 2.00 from human genome had significantly changed after the treatments. Its showed the greatest roles in cancer cells growth and were found either to be down-regulated or up-regulated in cells after the treatment.TLE gave significant expression effects towards several genes such as CRYAB, PIM1, BTG1, CYR61, HIF1A, CEBP-beta, TXNIP, THBS1, HMG1L1 and HIST2H3D genes. These results demonstrate the potent activity of TLE as an anti-cancer agent.
