TITLE
Profile of mRNAs associated with Ago (Argonaute) 1 in normoxic and hypoxic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Messenger RNAs that are bound to Ago1 is to be transcriptionally or translational suppressed. Therefore the changes in Ago1-associated transcripts indicate the changes of suppression of these genes. We used microarrays to detail changes of mRNA transcripts that are associated with Ago1 in endothelial cells under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells pooled from 8 different sources were subjected to normoxia (21% oxygen, Nx) or hypoxia (2% hypoxia, Hx) for 24 hr. Ago1 was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-human Ago1 using a lysis buffer containing 0.1% NP-40. The associated RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
