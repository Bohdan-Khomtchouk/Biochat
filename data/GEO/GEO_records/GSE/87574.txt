TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Propionibacterium freudenreichii strains associated with different anti-inflammatory properties.

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium freudenreichii

SUMMARY
Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a dairy starter, reaches a population close to 10^9 propionibacteria per gram of Swiss-type cheese at the time of consumption. Also consumed as a probiotic, it revealed strain-dependent anti-inflammatory properties mediated by proteins inducing IL-10 in leukocytes. Here, strains with varied anti-inflammatory potentials were compared in terms of transcriptome profiles.

DESIGN
Eight strains were analyzed in one growth condition. After visual quality check based on the distribution of probe intensities, most strains were represented by 2 biological replicates (1 biological replicate for one strain, and 3 biological replicates for two strains).
