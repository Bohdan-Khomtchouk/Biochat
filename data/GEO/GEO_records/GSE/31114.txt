TITLE
Dynamics of intercellular and extracellular miRNAs in HUVECs co-cultured with K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18-22 nucleotides), non-coding RNAs that suppress the translation of target mRNAs by binding to their 3` untranslated region, and regulate gene networks, helping to control cell function and phenotype. Recently, the existence of extracellular miRNAs enclosed in exosomes has raised the possibility that they play an important role in cell-cell communication. The goals of this study were to elucidate whether or not miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and works functionally active in the recipient cells. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of a leukemia cell line (K562) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using a non-contact co-culture system, and assess the expression profiles of intercellular and extracellular miRNAs in HUVECs and K562 cells using Taqman MicroRNA Array v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). We compared the miRNA expression profiles between 1) K562 cells or HUVECs; 2) intercellular and extracellular; 3) mono-culture medium and co-culture medium.

DESIGN
K562 cells and HUVECs were non-contact co-cultures using Transwell (Corning, pore size: 0.45µm) for 24 hr. The culture medium was collected and filtered through a 0.45 µm PVDF filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The intercellular and extracellular RNAs were isolated from K562 cells, HUVECs and each culture medium using the mirVana PARIS kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The expression profile was determined using the Human Taqman MicroRNA Arrays A (Applied Biosystems). QRT-PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT thermal cycler. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles at 92°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min.
