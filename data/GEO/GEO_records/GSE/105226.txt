TITLE
microRNA expression profile of the SVF of visWAT under β3-adrenegic stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microRNA expression analysis to identify which microRNAs are expressed in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of visceral white adipose tissue (visWAT) to identify of microRNA expression patterns are changed upon  CL-316,243 treatment Agilent mouse miRNA microarray (Cat. No. G4872A-046065, Agilent Technologies) was performed on the SVF of visWAT of 8-week-old C57/BL6 mice treated with CL 316243 or Vehicle (PBS) for three days. Isolated miRNA and total RNA was used for array analysis by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation. Normalization and analysis for differentially expressed genes were performed using robust multi-array analysis and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) via R statistical software packages “oligo” and “samr”.  Several up- and downregulated microRNAs could be identified and were further varified with qPCR and compared with mRNA expression levels of their main targets.

DESIGN
The microRNA profile of SVFs of 3-day CL-316,243 treated visWAT was compared to buffer treated controls.
