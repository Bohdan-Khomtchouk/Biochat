TITLE
Genomic landscape of the developing kidney upon conditional and time-dependent knockout of Wt1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are characterizing global expression in the whole kidney at developmental stage E18.5, where we have used three Cre strains that result in knock out Wt1 in different cell types during renal development. Here the purpose is to identify the developmental stage at which the loss of Wt1 impacts kidney development, specifically in the context of a degree of disruption capable of ending in pediatric kidney cancers.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from whole kidneys of E18.5 mouse embryos following a variety of conditional knockouts of Wt1, plus appropriate control animals.
