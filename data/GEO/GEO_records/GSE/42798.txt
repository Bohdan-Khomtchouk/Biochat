TITLE
Haloarcula hispanica wild-type strain cultured in different media: MG vs 168

ORGANISM
Haloarcula hispanica

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloarcula hispanica wild-type strain cultured in different media comparing MG medium with 168 medium. H. hispanica wild-type strain can accumulate PHBV in MG medium, while can not in 168 medium. Goal was to explore the PHA biosynthesis and its impact on central metabolism in H. hispanica.

DESIGN
Total RNA from MG and 168 were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 8*15K Haloarcula hispanica genome array genechips, representing about 3800 genes.
