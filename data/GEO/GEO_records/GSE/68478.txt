TITLE
Expression data from multiple strains of Francisella

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S4 ; Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS ; Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida U112 ; Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica OR96246

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression profiles of strains of Francisella to identify virulence factors We used custom microarrays to detail the global gene expression of four strains of Francisella (Schu4, LVS, OR960246, U112) and identified distinct classes of differentially expressed genes during this process.

DESIGN
All the strains of Francisella were grown to optical density of 0.6 in a chemical defined medium and their expression profiles were compared. The comparative gene expression analyses of the strains of Francisella are reported in PMID 27537327. The manuscript detailing the comparative intergenic expression of the strains of Francisella is under preparation.
