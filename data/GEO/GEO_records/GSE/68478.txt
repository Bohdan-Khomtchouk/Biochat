TITLE
Expression data from multiple strains of Francisella

ORGANISM
Francisella

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression profiles of strains of Francisella to identify virulence factors We used custom microarrays to detail the global gene expression of four strains of Francisella (Schu4, LVS, OR960246, U112) and identified distinct classes of differentially expressed genes during this process.
