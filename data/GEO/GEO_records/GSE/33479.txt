TITLE
Molecular characterisation of the multistep process of lung squamous carcinogenesis by gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We comprehensively characterized the gene expression alterations occurring during squamous lung cancer development. Fresh frozen human bronchial biopsies (N=122) at successive morphological stages of lung squamous carcinogenesis were obtained by fluorescence bronchoscopy and analyzed using gene expression microarrays.
