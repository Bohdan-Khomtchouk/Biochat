TITLE
Maize cytolines provide key nuclear genes that are under the control of retrograde signaling pathways in plants

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
By comparing data from the three cytolines (two cytoplsm donors and one nucleus donor) we identified key nuclear genes whose expression is modulated through the retrograde signaling pathways.

DESIGN
One-color microarray study was performed to measure differences in gene expression between maize cytolines TC208(cytTC316), TC208(cytW633) and their nucleus donor line TC208. Three biological replicates for each genotype were used.
