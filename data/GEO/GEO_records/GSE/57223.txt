TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in rat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat model of ARDS was induced by saline lavage and mechanical ventilation. miRNA from rat lungs were used for dual color DNA microarray hybridization with 3DNA 50 kit version 2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, CON vs. ARDS lung tissues. replicates: 6 control, 6 ARDS. One replicate per array.
