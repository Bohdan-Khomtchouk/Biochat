TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of mouse uterus during embryo implantation by SAGE

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine differential gene expression profile in mouse uterus on day 5 of pregnancy between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites. There are 104,520 tags sequenced and acquired, 51,306 for non-implantation site, and 53,214 for implantation site. Keywords: Implantation, Uterus, Differential gene expression,

DESIGN
Implantation sites and inter-implantation sites were isolated from the mouse uteri on day 5 of pregnancy from at least 20 mice.  Implantation sites were identified by tail-vein injection of 0.1 ml of 1% Chicago blue 5 min before sample collection. SAGE analysis was used to examine differential gene expression in mouse uterus during embryo implantation.
