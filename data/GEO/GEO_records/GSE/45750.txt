TITLE
Genome wide analysis of differential gene expression of PFKFB3 under- or overexpression upon inhibition or activation of notch signaling in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles upon PFKFB3 under- or overexpression during inhibition or activation of notch signaling. With this experiment we aimed to identify whether alterations in PFKFB3 could influence the expression pattern of angiogenic genes in conditions that favor a tip- or stalk cell gene signature.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected of human umbilical vein endothelial cells either under- or overexpressing PFKFB3 and/ or have inhibited or activated notch signaling respectively. Cells were harvested 48h after manipulation of PFKFB3 and notch levels.
