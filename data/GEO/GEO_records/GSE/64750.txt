TITLE
Lung expression data from highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infected and uninfected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Susceptible and Resistant mouse strain, e.g. DBA/2J and C57BL/6J respectively, were inoculated with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus (A/Hong Kong/213/2003) for 72 hours. Differences in expression were analyzed and use to identify candidate genes and pathways that contributed to the difference in H5N1 pathogenesis in these two strains. Recombinant inbred BXD strains are derived from the DBA/2J and C57BL/6 parent and were used to identify genetic loci associated with resistant to H5N1 infection.

DESIGN
Female 6-8 weeks old animals were inoculated with H5N1 virus or not and 72 hours later the lungs were obtained and immediately homogenized in Trizol. The extracted RNA was submitted for Affymetrix Gene expression arrays. Differences in gene-expression were determined and used to identify candidate genes and pathways that are important for disease severity and susceptiblity to H5N1 virus.
