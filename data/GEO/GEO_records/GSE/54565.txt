TITLE
Expression data from human brain anterior cingulate cortex - including control samples and samples with major depression disorders (32 samples MD1_ACC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous illness with a mostly uncharacterized pathology. Large scale gene expression (transcriptome) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for single nucleotide polymorphisms have generated a considerable amount of gene- and disease-related information, but heterogeneity and various sources of noise have limited the discovery of disease mechanisms. As systematic dataset integration is becoming essential, we developed methods and performed meta-clustering of gene coexpression links in 11 transcriptome studies from postmortem brains of human subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and non-psychiatric control subjects. We next sought enrichment in the top 50 meta-analyzed coexpression modules for genes otherwise identified by GWAS for various sets of disorders. One coexpression module of 88 genes was consistently and significantly associated with GWAS for MDD, other neuropsychiatric disorders and brain functions, and for medical illnesses with elevated clinical risk of depression, but not for other diseases (See publication for details).

DESIGN
32 total samples in 16 pairs were analyzed in postmortem tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex.
