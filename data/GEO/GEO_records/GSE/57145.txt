TITLE
Micro-array analysis of WT and AtISWI in callus formation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant regeneration could be achieved via formation of a pluripotent cell mass termed callus, nature of which is a group of fast-dividing root primordium cells. However, mechanisms that strictly control the stem cell fate transition in regeneration of callus remain elusive. Here we show that the Arabidopsis ISWI type chromatin remodelers specifically promote the second-step cell fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium cells in the leaf-to-callus transition.

DESIGN
Leaf explants cultured in CIM from Col-0 or chr11-1 chr17-1 at time 0 and 8 days after culture (8 DAC) were used for RNA preparation. Microarray was performed using the AffymetrixGeneChip system. Three independent experiments were performed.
