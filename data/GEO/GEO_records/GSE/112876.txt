TITLE
Cell specific response to IFNg

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report cell specific responses to IFNg in 11 different peripheral immunocyte populations in the mouse. These cells represent the core ImmGen immunocyte lineage panel. Profiles from these were used to analyze cell specific responses to IFNg. In general a core set of ISG transcripts are induced in all cells. Smaller sets of ISGs were induced in a cell specific manner. In particular, splenic granulocytes and dendritic cells show restriced indcution of sets of ISGs.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 10,000U IFNg according to time course profile. Splenocytes/Peritoneal lavage suspensions were stained in multicolor antibody panels that were used to distinguish 11 different immunocyte populations (Immgen 11 cell set). These cells were sorted by FACS directly into TriZo and gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
