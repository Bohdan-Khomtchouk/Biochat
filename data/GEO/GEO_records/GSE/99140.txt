TITLE
Expression data from the human neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y treated with okadaic acid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Okadaic acid (OA) is a widely distributed marine toxin produced by several phytoplank-tonic species and responsible for diarrheic shellﬁsh poisoning in humans. At the molecular level OA is a speciﬁc inhibitor of several types of serine/threonine protein phosphatases.However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in OA-induced cytotoxicity are not well understood. In the present study, we applied a toxicogenomic approach to investigate the effects of OA on gene expression in  the human neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y.

DESIGN
The SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 0 nM (C0), 20 nM(C1) and 60 nM (C2) OA for 12 h, and three biological replicates for each concentration.
