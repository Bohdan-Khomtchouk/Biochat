Host plant driven transcriptome plasticity in the salivary glands of the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni)

ORGANISM
Trichoplusia ni

SUMMARY
We report on the transcriptome differences in the salivary glands of cabbage looper larvae fed on different diets

DESIGN
cabbage looper larvae were reared on cabbage, tomato, and artificial diet. Transcriptome of salivary glands were characterized and compared
