SUMMARY
Basal-like carcinoma is a subtype of breast cancer that is characterized by poor prognosis and high intratumor heterogeneity. Using a basal-like breast epithelial line, we have identified two anti-correlated gene-expression programs that arise among single extracellular matrix (ECM)-attached cells during organotypic 3D culture. The first program contains TGFBR3, a high-affinity receptor for transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and other related ligands. The second program contains the JUND transcription factor together with the basal-like marker, KRT5. By disrupting the TGFBR3 and JUND programs individually, we reveal an important circuit for 3D morphogenesis that is wired together by four negative-feedback loops. Computational modeling of this circuit showed that it could exhibit damped, antiphase oscillations when excited with small impulses of TGFβ-like ligand. We directly visualize the circuit's spontaneous dynamics in organotypic cultures by using live-cell imaging with engineered pathway reporters. Importantly, we show that the essence of the JUND-TGFBR3 expression circuit holds true in early basal-like tumors that heterogeneously express KRT5. Correlated JUND-KRT5 expression depends critically on contact with stromal ECM and local expression of tenascin C. This work illustrates how complex tumor heterogeneities can be deconstructed into intrinsic single-cell expression circuits that are modulated by the microenvironment. Gene expression analysis of outer ECM-attached vs. inner cells of MCF10A-5E clones grown in organotypic 3D culture at day 6.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from ~50 outer ECM-attached cells and ~50 inner cells, each separately microdissected from 8 micron sections of MCF10A structures at day 6 of morphogenesis. Total RNA was amplified in quadruplicate, and hybridized to HumanRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina).
