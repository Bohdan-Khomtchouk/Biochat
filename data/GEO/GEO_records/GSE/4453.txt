Androgen receptor coregulators baseline comparisons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LNCaP cells are an established androgen receptor expressing prostate carcinoma cell line. Human foreskin fibroblasts also expressing the androgen receptor were obtained from phenotypic normal male individuals. Cells were cultured either at confluency leading to G0 cell cycle state or while they were proliferating. Cells were either untreated, or treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or ethanol (ETOH) which also served as the solvent for the DHT. All experimental RNA samples derived from the untreated or treated cell lines were hybridized on cDNA arrays against a common reference. This reference was composed out of common reference CRG (50%) and out of fibroblast RNA (50%). This reference is also called " mixed reference " in the description of the 26 individual experiments. A strain or line experiment design type assays differences between multiple strains, cultivars, serovars, isolates, lines from organisms of a single species. Compound Based Treatment: dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or ethanol (ETOH = solvent) Cell Line: genital fibroblast cell line or prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCaP) Culture Synchrony: Go or proliferation Keywords: strain_or_line_design
