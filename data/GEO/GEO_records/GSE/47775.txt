TITLE
Piriformospora indica on Arabidopsis and barley root material

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Broad-host root endophytes establish long-term interactions with a large variety of plants, thereby playing a significant role in natural and managed ecosystems and in evolution of land plants. To exploit plants as living substrates and to establish a compatible interaction with morphologically and biochemically extremely different hosts, endophytes must respond and adapt to different plant signals and host metabolic states. Here we identified host-adapted colonization strategies and host-specific effector candidates of the mutualistic root endophyte Piriformospora indica by a global investigation of fungal transcriptional responses to barley and Arabidopsis at different symbiotic stages. Additionally we examined the role played by nitrogen in these two diverse associations. Cytological studies and colonization analyses of a barley mutant and fungal RNAi strains show that distinct physiological and metabolic signals regulate host-specific lifestyle in P. indica. This is the foundation for exploring how distinct fungal and host symbiosis determinants modulate biotrophy in one host and saprotrophy in another host and, ultimately, gives hints into the mechanisms underlying host adaptation in root symbioses.
