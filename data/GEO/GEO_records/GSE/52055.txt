TITLE
miRNAs expression of soleus response to simulated microgravity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of gravisensitive miRNAs expression in rat soleus muscle exposed to 7 and 14 days of Hindlimb suspension (HS) simulated microgravity. Microgravity causes muscle atrophy possibly due to muscle wasting overtake regeneration. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle atrophy. The expression of 23 out of 174 miRNAs was found to change at least 2-fold of 7 and/or 14 days of TS. By using real-time PCR assays, we verified the microarray data using some of the expected genes.

DESIGN
The tissue was collected from Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks of age) subjected to 7, 14days of TS. miRNA expression profile was determined in three groups: control (CN), TS for 7 days (TS-7), and TS for 14 days (TS-14).Three miRNA microarray chips were analyzed for mixture of four samples of each of the three groups.
