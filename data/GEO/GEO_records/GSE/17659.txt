TITLE
Experiment 2: Pou5f1 and Sox2 overexpression experiments with or without protein synthesis inhibition

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Pou5f1 and Sox2 overexpression experiments with and without protein synthesis inhibitor were performed to investigate direct transcriptional targets of Pou5f1 and Sox2

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological triplicates.  Cy3 and Cy5 chnnels were splitted in Genedata Analyst software, quantile normalised and used for independent comparisons.
