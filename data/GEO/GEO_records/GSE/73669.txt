TITLE
ATFS-1 regulates a broad protective transcriptional program

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We previously identified a number of genes which were differentially expressed during mitochondrial stress in an ATFS-1-dependent manner using an atfs-1 loss-of-function mutant allele . To complement the findings from our previous microarray, we compared the transcript profiles from wild-type and atfs-1(et18) gain-of-function worms (which have constitutively active ATFS-1) in the absence of mitochondrial stress. We used microarrays to identify genes regulated by ATFS-1 using a gain-of-function allele of atfs-1.

DESIGN
RNA samples were prepared from wild-type (N2) and atfs-1(et18) (et18) worms fed E. coli OP50. Worms were synchronized by bleaching, raised on solid culture and harvested at the L4 stage. Each experiment was performed in triplicate indicated as 1,2 and 3.
