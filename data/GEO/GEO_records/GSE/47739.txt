TITLE
Gene expression of hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) treated with H2O2 to induce senescence relative to control untreated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify a transcriptional signature of oxidative stress induced senescence in a hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) by globally assessing differential gene expression after treatment with 0.5mM of H2O2 for 60 minutes, compared to nontreated cells as a control.

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide comparison of gene expression and identified genes that are differentially expressed in senescent HepG2 cells relative to untreated cells, 4 biological replicates per condition
