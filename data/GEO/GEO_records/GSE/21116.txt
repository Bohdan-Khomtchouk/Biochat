TITLE
Transcriptome changes in soybean seeds resulting from RNAi suppression of seed storage proteins

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We report the changes in transcriptome that results from RNAi suppression of 7S and 11S storage protein synthesis in soybean seeds, Proteomic results show that other proteins compensate for the storage protein shortfall. The transcriptome analysis show numerous changes result from suppressing storage proteins but compensating proteins are accumulated without parallel changes in the protein's transcription.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples prepared from midmaturation wildtype and storage protein RNAi (SP-) soybeans were used to produce cDNA that was subjected to Illumina sequencing. The resulting sequences were assembled and analyzed to characterize the changes in transcriptome that results from suppressing storage protein synthesis/accumulation.
