TITLE
miRNA expression in aging skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts were isolated from healthy skin, donors were young, middlege and old. We used Affymetrix miRNA microarrays to detail the global expression of miRNAs.

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts were isolated from healthy skin, donnors were young, middlege and old and kept in culture for a short time in order to avoid scenescence.
