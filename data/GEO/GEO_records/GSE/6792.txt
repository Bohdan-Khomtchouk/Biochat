TITLE
Expression profile of mature normal PB neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional patterns of mature normal PB neutrophils (granulocytes) was examined and used as a control against which the transcriptional programs of cultured granulocytes and granulocytic cells lines can be compared. Keywords: Peripheral blood neutrophils
