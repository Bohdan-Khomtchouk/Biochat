TITLE
Expression profile of mature normal PB neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional patterns of mature normal PB neutrophils (granulocytes) was examined and used as a control against which the transcriptional programs of cultured granulocytes and granulocytic cells lines can be compared. Keywords: Peripheral blood neutrophils

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from peripheral blood neutrophils.  Three biological replicate experiments were analyzed and approximately 67% of the samples were technically replicated.  Hybridizations were performed in a reference design with all samples labeled with Cy3 and a reference RNA pool labeled with Cy5.
