TITLE
WTv.AOXantisense

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Leaf transcriptome comparison of untransformed Col-0 Arabidopsis plants with plants transformed to be anti-sense for AtAOX1a (alternative oxidase).  Two “bio-replicates” were sampled, for a total of four microarray chips—Col-0 and anti-sense leaf tissue from a first planting (samples GSM45208 and GSM45231, respectively), and from a second planting made one week later (samples GSM45209 and GSM45278, respectively).  See sample descriptions for growth conditions and microarray procedure. Keywords = alternative oxidase Keywords = plant mitochondria Keywords = respiration Keywords = leaves Keywords: repeat sample
