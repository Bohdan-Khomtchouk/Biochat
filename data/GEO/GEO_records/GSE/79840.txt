TITLE
shRNA cassette sequencing from disomic and trisomic fibroblasts cultured in the presence of shRNA kinome library for 14 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kinome-wide shRNA screen to identify kinases differentially required for survival of cells disomic and trisomic for chromosome 21

DESIGN
Cells were transduced in triplicate and propagated for 14 days to allow for enrichement or depletion of shRNAs from the population
