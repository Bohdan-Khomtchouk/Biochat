TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of snap-frozen primary papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and normal thyroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify de-regulated miRNAs in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To this aim miRNA expression profiles of PTCs and normal thyroid samples were compared. Tissue specimens were selected  by an expert pathologist. Details about the histological type of tumor samples are provided.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles for 19 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas and 5 normal thyroids were generated using Agilent microarray platform.
