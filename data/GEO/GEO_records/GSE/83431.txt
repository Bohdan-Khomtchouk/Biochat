TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of aged Drosophila photoreceptors

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to globally characterize the transcript levels of genes in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons during aging. Using transcriptome profiling of isolated photoreceptor nuclei we analyzed the changes in gene expression that occur during aging over 5 time-points from 10 to 40 days post-eclosion and identified sets of genes with both up-regulated and down-regulated expression.

DESIGN
Method: RNA extracted from photoreceptor nuclei of flies aged from 10 to 40 days was used to generate cDNA libraries using NuGen Ovation Drosophila RNA seq system. Samples were sequenced using  Illumina HiSeq2500 next generation sequencer (five different age time points and three biological replicates per time point).
