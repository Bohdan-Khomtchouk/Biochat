TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in tumor ovarian surface epithelial cells with different p53 status

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The impact of specific p53 mutations on ovarian tumor development and response to therapeutic treatment remain limited.  Here, using transgenic mouse models of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we demonstrated that the Trp53R172H mutation promotes EOC progression compared to wild-type p53, but with different consequences between heterozygous and homozygous mutation status. EOC expressing heterozygous Trp53R172H mutation has enhanced responsiveness to steroid hormones and at late stage developed mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. These findings open new realms for exploring the interaction between p53 and steroid receptor, and the allelic status of p53 in EOC development and treatment.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression and molecular signatures of tumor OSE cells with different p53 status.
