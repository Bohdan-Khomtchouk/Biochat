TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between virus-susceptible and -resistant rice lines (TW16-1263 and -1029)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines TW16-1263 and TW16-1029 were developed from the cross between TN1 (recurrent parent susceptible to rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)) and Utri Merah (donor parent resistant to RTSV). TW16-1263 is susceptible to RTSV, whereas TW16-1029 is resistant to RTSV. In order to identify genes which are constitutively differentially expressed between TW16-1263 and TW16-1029, the gene expression in the two lines were compared at three different conditions (healthy, green leafhopper (GLH)-inoculated, and RTSV-inoculated). Keywords: Constitutive differential expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 14-day old plants of TW16-1263 and TW16-1029 at three different conditions (healthy, GLH-inoculated, and RTSV-inoculated). The levels of gene expression in the two lines of the same condition were compared by microarray. Each experiment was repeated twice.
