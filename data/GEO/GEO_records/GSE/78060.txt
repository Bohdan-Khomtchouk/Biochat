TITLE
A gene expression profiling to predict recurrence of advanced tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC): Discovery and external validation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Though several approaches for improving therapy have been carried out, the prognoses of TSCC patients still remains poor. Furthermore, biological markers, which are able to distinguish patients at high risk of recurrence has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we identified and validated the 30-specific genes for predicting TSCC patiens prognosis. In addition, the gene expression profiling data was successfully converted to protein expression profiling data.

DESIGN
Global gene expression analysis was performed on 26 clinicopathologically homogeneous advanced TSCC tissue samples using cDNA microarray. We then identified 30-predictive genes associated with recurrence and created formula to predict the individual patientsâ€™ prognosis. The validation study to examine whether the genes expression pattern enable to predict prognosis was perfomerd in another publicly available three cohorts of microarray data set.
