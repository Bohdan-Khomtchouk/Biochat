TITLE
A Comparative Analysis of the Transcriptome of Hypoxia and Inflammation in Swan 71 Human Trophophoblast Cells: Its Implications in Preeclampsia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemical hypoxia by CoCl2 treatment and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced distinct changes in the transcriptome of Swan 71 human trophoblasts.

DESIGN
Not Paired. Samples were treated with control treatments (PBS) as well as with CoCl2, IL-1β, and TNFα.
