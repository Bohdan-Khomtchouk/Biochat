TITLE
Genome-wide binding of Cyclin G in Drosophila melanogaster third instar larva wing imaginal discs.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We describe here the genome-wide binding sites of Cyclin G in Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs from third instar female larvae. We used a transgenic line expressing a version Cyclin G deleted of the PEST domain (the 25 COOH-terminal amin-acids) and tagged by Myc under the control of the daugterless-Gal4 ubiquitous driver.

DESIGN
Genomic binding sites of Myc-CycGÎ”P in Drosophila melanogaster  third instar larvae wing imaginal discs
