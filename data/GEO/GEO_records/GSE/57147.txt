TITLE
DNA-damage induced differentiation of leukemic cells as an anti-cancer barrier

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (Kmt2d) is required for stem cell activity and an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring the MLL-AF9 oncogene. MLL4 exerts its function by regulating transcriptional programs associated with the anti-oxidant response.

DESIGN
The role of Mll4 (Kmt2d) in regulating the transcriptome of primary and transformed hematopoietic stem cells was studied.
