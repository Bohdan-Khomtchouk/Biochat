TITLE
Spatial transcriptomic analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana - Botrytis cinerea interaction

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A 10 ul drop of B. cinerea spores prepared in half-strength commercial grape juice was placed in the middle of detached Arabidopsis leaves. A cock-borer of 6 mm diameter was used to harvest leaf discs starting from the edge of the lesion (close, 0-6 mm) and the edge of the first disc (away, 6-12 mm) 48 hr after inoculation. Control plants were inoculated with a 10 ul drop of half-strength commercial grape juice with no spores.

DESIGN
Three Biological replicates were done of which the third replicate was a dye-swap. In total 12 samples were analyzed. Each array constituted one replicate making six arrays for the whole experiment.
