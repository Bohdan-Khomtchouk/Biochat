TITLE
Expression comparison of mutant EGFR-driven gliomas with relapse tumors upon mutant EGFR ablation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the roles of oncogenic EGFR signaling in gliomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we generated a novel glioma mouse model driven by inducible expression of a mutant EGFR (EGFR*). Genetic suppression of EGFR* induction led to significant tumor regression and prolonged survival. But in spite of the initial response, the tumors relapsed invariably and propagated independent of EGFR*. We used microarrys to directly compare geen expression of control and relapse tumors and identified gene sets specifically activated in relapse tumors.

DESIGN
Control and relasped glioma samples upon mutant EGFR extinction were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
