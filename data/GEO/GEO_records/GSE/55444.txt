TITLE
G2/M transition for stabilizing mouse haploid ESCs: Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profiles between haploid ESCs and diploid ESCs, we examined the gene expression profile using DNA microarray analysis using G1 phase cells collected by FACS.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments were performed at each cell type (haploid or diploid).
