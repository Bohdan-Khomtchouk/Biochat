SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_4967 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Kevin White. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The White Lab is aiming to map the association of all the Transcription Factors (TF) on the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. One technique that we use for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) utilizing an Illumina next generation sequencing platform. The data generated by ChIP-seq experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested TF. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
