TITLE
Deeply conserved gene-regulatory functions of carboxy-terminal domains in dictyostelid C-module-binding factors

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We describe the gene expression pattern of a Dictyostelium discoideum mutant depleted in the C-module-binding factor (CbfA) and autonomous gene-regulatory activities of CbfA carboxy-terminal domains (CbfA-CTDs)

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in growing cells of a CbfA mutant compared to wild-type

PLATFORM
GPL15643 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Dictyostelium discoideum)
