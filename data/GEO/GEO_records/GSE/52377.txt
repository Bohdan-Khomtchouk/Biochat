TITLE
Differential expression of mature miRNAs in P19 cells during neuronal differentiation and by Rbfox3 depletion.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate whether Rbfox3 could alter the expression level of miRNAs during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, we performed miRNA microarray analysis using the RNAs extracted from untreated (undifferentiated) P19-GFP, RA-treated (neuronally differentiated) P19-GFP, or RA-treated P19-T2 cells.

DESIGN
Total 9 samples were analyzed. We compared expression levels of P19-GFP (-) vs P19-GFP (+) vs P19-T2 (+) to identify miRNAs which had changes in expression levels with p < 0.01. From this  miRNA list, we compared among P19-GFP (-) vs P19-GFP (+) vs P19-T2 (+) to identify the miRNAs which appeared to correlate with Rbfox3 expression.
