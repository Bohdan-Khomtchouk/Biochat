TITLE
mRNA samples in Allele Specific Expression study

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Col-0 and Van-0 total RNA were mixed at 1:1. Total RNA also extracted from F1 hybrid samples from Col x Van and Van x Col. PolyA RNA were purified and double-strand cDNA were synthesized, followed by bioprime random labeling. A total of 16ug labelled products were hybridized to AtSNPtile1. cis regulatory effect was identified as allele specific expression in F1 hybrids. Composite trans regulatory effect was detected as deviation between parental expression and F1 hybrids expression.

DESIGN
Each sample type has four replicates. Single chanel. Three sample types (Col and Van RNA 1:1 mixture, Col x Van F1 hybrids, Van x Col F1 hybrids). Total 12 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL8655 Arabidopsis thaliana SNP-tiling array AtSNPtile ver. 1
