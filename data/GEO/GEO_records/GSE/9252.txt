TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Human Endometrial Endothelial Cells Exposed to o,p'-DDT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The endocrine disrupting chemical o,p'-DDT can affect reproductive organs, tissues and cells in several species. Treatment of human endometrial endothelial cells (HEEC) with 50 ÂµM o,p'-DDT decreased the cell proliferation compared to the control. Microarray analyses revealed that o,p'-DDT affected biological processes such as the cell cycle, cell division, defence response and lipid and steroid metabolism, in cellular components such as the plasma membrane and chromosomes, with molecular functions involved in signalling, receptor and cytokine activity, confirming the results of the proliferation assay. The present study supports our previous findings of decreased proliferation and increased cell death in response to o,p'-DDT, and may offer important clues in the deduction of the mechanisms of action of o,p'-DDT. Keywords: Exposure analysis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, o,p'-DDT-exposed vs. control HEEC, and individual control vs control pool. Biological replicates: 5 HEEC cultures, independently grown, exposed and harvested. One replicate per array. Dye-swaps for exposed and reference samples between replicates. variable = Exposure: o,p'-DDT-treated: Indiv1 s1 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv2 s19 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv3 s37 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv4 s55 op-DDT Cy5, Indiv5 s73 op-DDT Cy5 variable = Exposure: control: Indiv1 s2 control Cy5, Indiv2 s20 control Cy5, Indiv3 s38 control Cy5, Indiv4 s56 control Cy3, Indiv5 s74 control Cy3 variable = Exposure: individual control: Indiv1 s17 control Cy3, Indiv2 s35 control Cy5, Indiv3 s53 control Cy3, Indiv4 s71 control Cy5, Indiv5 s89 control Cy3 variable = Exposure: control pool: Pooled control s18/36/54/72/90 Cy5, Pooled control s18/36/54/72/90 Cy3, Pooled control s18/36/54/72/90 Cy5, Pooled control s18/36/54/72/90 Cy3, Pooled control s18/36/54/72/90 Cy5 repeat = Biological replicate: Indiv1 s1 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv1 s2 control Cy5, Indiv1 s17 control Cy3, sample 18 in Pooled control repeat = Biological replicate: Indiv2 s19 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv2 s20 control Cy5, Indiv2 s35 control Cy5, sample 36 in Pooled control repeat = Biological replicate: Indiv3 s37 op-DDT Cy3, Indiv3 s38 control Cy5, Indiv3 s53 control Cy3, sample 54 in Pooled control repeat = Biological replicate: Indiv4 s55 op-DDT Cy5, Indiv4 s56 control Cy3, Indiv4 s71 control Cy5, sample 72 in Pooled control repeat = Biological replicate: Indiv5 s73 op-DDT Cy5, Indiv5 s74 control Cy3, Indiv5 s89 control Cy3, sample 90 in Pooled control
