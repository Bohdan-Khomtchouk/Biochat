TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of epidermal gene expression from Presenilin (1 & 2)-null, RBPjk-null and wild-type litter mates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression in Psen-null and RBPjk-null epidermal keratinocytes. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that canonical Notch signals could be present at the beginning of epidermal stratification (E13.5) in the RBPj-null epidermis. If an early signal was preserved by epigenetic memory, E18.5 RBPj-null epidermis would resemble the wild-type at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 3xRBPj-null and 3xPsen-null epidermis at E18.5 and compared to wild-type (3xRBPjwt & 3xPsenwt) epidermis from littermates.
