TITLE
Mouse iPSC: shNT versus shCtip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Copy variation number of iPSCs reprogrammed in presence (shNT) or abscence of Ctip protein (shCtip). This study shows genetic variations generated by CtIP abscence during Reprogramming process.

DESIGN
2 biological clones obtained of several pool reprogramming procedures. Clones were validated for Ctip expression.
