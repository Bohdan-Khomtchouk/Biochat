TITLE
Expression data from transgenic mice (3 mo) inducibly expressing human alpha1-antitrypsin in the liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the classical form of α1antitrypsin deficiency a mutant protein accumulates in a polymerized form in the ER of liver cells causing liver damage and carcinogenesis by a  gain-of-toxic function mechanism. Recent studies have indicated that the accumulation of mutant α1antitrypsin Z in the ER specifically activates the autophagic response but not the  unfolded protein response and that autophagy plays a critical role in disposal of insoluble α1antitrypsin Z. In this study, we used genomic analysis of the liver in a novel transgenic mouse  model with inducible expression to screen for changes in gene expression that would potentially define how the liver responds to accumulation of this mutant protein.
