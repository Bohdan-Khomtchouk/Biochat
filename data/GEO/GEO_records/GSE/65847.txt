TITLE
Selective coregulator function for different steroid receptors and restriction of steroid receptor chromatin occupancy by Hic-5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigate the relationship between GR and Hic5 and identify classes of genes that respond differently when cells are induced with hormone and when Hic5 is knocked down.

DESIGN
GR ChIP-seq with and without depletion of Hic5

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
