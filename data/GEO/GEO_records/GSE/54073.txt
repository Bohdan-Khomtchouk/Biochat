TITLE
Gene expression microarray data of bone marrow derived macrophages using GM-CSF(GM-BMMs) co-cultured with E0771 breast tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E-FABP is dominately expressed in macrophages/dendritic cells. Thus E-FABP may play a siginificant role in their immune response to tumor insult. We treated mouse GM-BMMs of different genotype with E0771 breast cancer cells. Then we investigate the global gene expression in these GM-BMMs in response to tumor treatment.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells were collected from na√Øve C57BL/6 and E-FABP knockout mice of 6~8 week old. GM-BMMs were derived using GM-CSF (in RPMI1640 with 5%FBS) for 7 days before tumor treatment. After 18hr tumor teatment, GM-BMM total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to mouse mRNA Gene expression by Affymetrix microarray.
