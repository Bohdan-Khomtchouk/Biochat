TITLE
Gene expression profiles of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes in tumor tissues, several human cancer tissues (hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
A total of nine pairs of primary hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples and adjacent normal mucosa were obtained from patients who underwent tumor resection at Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan). A total of seven pairs of primary maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma samples and adjacent normal mucosa were obtained from patients who underwent tumor resection at Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan). A total of five pairs of renal cell carcinoma samples and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from patients who underwent tumor resection at Kagoshima University Hospital (Kagoshima, Japan). The Ethics Committee of Chiba University and the Bioethics Committee of Kagoshima University approved our study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for use of their tissue samples and clinical data. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C until use.
