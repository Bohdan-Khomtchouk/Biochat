TITLE
Transciptome profile of neonatal small intestinal CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The intestine harbors more immune cells then the rest of the body together in order to maintain a state of tolerance towards the microbiota as well as food antigen on one side and recognition and immune response to invading pathogens on the other side. At birth the intestine transitions from a sterile organ to a highly exposed environment. At the same time the murine adaptive immune system starts to form and newly generated T and B cells home to the intestine. The present study aims to understand the function of CD4 T cells in the neonatal small intestine (SI). For that the transcriptional profiles of CD4 T cells isolated from the SI of 6- and 11-days-old neonates were compared to their counterparts in mLN and thymus as well as to adult CD4 T cells from the lamina propria (LP) and Peyers patches (PP).

DESIGN
4 true biological replicates in single color mode were analyzed in each group.
