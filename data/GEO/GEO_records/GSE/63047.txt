TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in rice leaves inoculated with a virulent strain of Xanthomonas oryzae and its mutant deficient in typeIII secretion system.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in rice leaves near the inoculated site of Xanthomonas oryzae and its typeIII secretion mutant were examined.

DESIGN
Rice plants (cv Nippnbare, 42 days old) were clip-inoculated with a virulent strain of Xanthomonas oryzae and its â–³hrcV mutant.  At each time points, leaf segments were excised below the clipped site (3 to 5 mm in length) and gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray.
