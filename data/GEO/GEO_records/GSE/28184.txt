TITLE
Expression data from normal murine mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG stimulated with TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-beta is one of the most important cytokines that induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this dataset, we examined TGF-beta induced changes in gene and exon level expression.

DESIGN
Core probesets of two samples were analyzed. NMuMG cells were stimulated with TGF-beta for 24 h or left untreated.
