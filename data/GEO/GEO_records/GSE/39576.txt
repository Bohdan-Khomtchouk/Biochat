TITLE
Effects of breaking up prolonged sitting on skeletal muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breaking up prolonged sitting has been shown to be beneficially associated with cardio-metabolic risk markers in both observational and intervention studies. We aimed to define the acute transcriptional events induced in skeletal muscle by breaks in sedentary time. Overweight/obese adults participated in a randomized three-period, three-treatment cross-over trial in an acute setting (5 hours): seated position with no activity, seated with 2-minute bouts of light- or moderate-intensity treadmill walking every 20 minutes. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained in 8 of the 19 participants after each treatment and gene expression examined using microarrays validated with real-time qPCR.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from vastus lateralis at the 3 different experimental condition
