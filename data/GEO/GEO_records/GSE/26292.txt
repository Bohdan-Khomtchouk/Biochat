TITLE
Gene expression of human cancer cells co-cultured with mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts after series of cross co-culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brain metastases are highly resistant to chemotherapy. Brain metastases are surrounded and infiltrated by activated astrocytes. To examine the genes whose expression is associated with chemo-resistance of brain-metastasized cancer cells, gene expression data were collected and analyzed from breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells co-cultured with astrocytes. Fibroblast cells were used as control.

DESIGN
Human lung cancer cell PC14 was co-cultured with mouse astrocytes or fibroblasts for two rounds. Total RNAs were extracted from co-cultured cells and hybridized to human microarray.
