TITLE
Human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL37 effect on human neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated keratinocytes or differentiated keratinocytes stimulated with or without human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) LL37. Results provide insight into the biological effects of CAMP on human keratinocytes.

DESIGN
NHEKs were divided into two groups; low calcium (0.05 mM) and high calcium condition (1.6 mM). Then keratinocytes were stimulated with human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL37 at 0, 2.56, and 7.68 Î¼M for 12 h to 24 h.
