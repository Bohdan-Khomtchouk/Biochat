TITLE
Expression data from embryonic day 15.5 atrioventricular canal regions were isolated from Scx-/- and Scx+/+ mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Our lab has previously shown that Scleraxis (Scx) is require for proper valve development in vivo. In order to fully explore gene networks regulated by Scx during the vital stages of valve remodeling , high throughput RNA-squencing was performed. Results:There were a total of 18,810 genes were detected. A total of 864 genes were differentially expressed Scx null AVC regions: 645 being upregulated and 217 downregulated.

DESIGN
In this data set, we include expression data from atrioventricular canal (AVC) regions from Scx null and wild-type littermate controls at embryonic day 15.5.  A total of 6 samples were analyzed; 3 valve regions from E15.5 Scx-/- mice, and 3 from E15.5 Scx+/+ wild-type littermate controls. Differential expression read counts are ranked based on p-value ( < 0.05).
