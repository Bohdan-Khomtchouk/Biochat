TITLE
Chronic heat stress gene expression in mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was done to know the transcritional changes occuring in mice liver in response to chronic heat stress at 34*c for a period of two weeks. Keywords: Chronic heat stress response on liver gene expression.

DESIGN
The microarray study was done in Reference design. We used a in-house Rat-specific oligonucleotide microarray containing 1400 liver specific genes. Heat stress (HS) group had 6 mice, while thermoneutral group had 7 mice. Each microarray hybridization was done in using a reference design in which experimental sample was hybridized against a mouse reference RNA. For each biological sample, two or three technical replicates hybridizations were done out of which one hybridization was in swap dye design to detect dye specific bias.
