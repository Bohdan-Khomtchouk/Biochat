TITLE
Effects of psychological stress on gene expression in the mouse rectum.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using isolation stress model, we showed that goblet cell-dependent mucosal barrier functions in the mouse rectum was more vulnerable to stress than the colon. We also found that isolation stress specifically stimulated IL-18 production only in the rectum. Furthermore, the crucial role of IL-18 in the stress response of the mouse rectum was confirmed using IL-18 knockout mice. Microarray analysis was used to assess the stress response and to identify responsible genes for the vulnerability of the mouse rectum to isolation stress.
