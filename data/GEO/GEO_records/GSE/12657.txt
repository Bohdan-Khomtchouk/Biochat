TITLE
Expression data from human glioma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine the gene expression profile of different types of glioma Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Histologically identified glioma-subtypes were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (HG-U95A)

PLATFORM
GPL8300 [HG_U95Av2] Affymetrix Human Genome U95 Version 2 Array
