TITLE
Systems analysis of the Merck Ad5/HIV vaccine reveals robust induction of a core innate immune gene network: in vivo analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we applied a systems approach to define human innate immune signatures following MRKAd5/HIV immunization and to analyze the effects of pre-existing Ad5 immunity. We defined the global early immune response to MRKAd5/HIV by profiling the PBMC transcriptomes from seven Ad5Neg individuals pre- and post-vaccination in vivo. Since the Step Study results suggested a deleterious effect of pre-existing Ad5 nAb on vaccine immunogenicity, we examined the vaccine-induced transcriptional responses from two Ad5Med and one Ad5Low individual

DESIGN
50 total samples were analyzed.   This includes 5 time points post vaccination with MRKAd5/HIV for 10 independent human subjects.  The time points were 0hr, 6hrs, 24hrs, 72hrs, and 168hrs. Seven of the subjects did not have pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine vector (Ad5Neg).  One subject had low level pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine vector (Ad5Low).  Two subjects had moderate level pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine vector (Ad5Low).
