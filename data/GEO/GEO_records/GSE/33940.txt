TITLE
Gene expression in the mitochondrial syndrome of coenzyme Q deficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Coenzyme Q10 deficiency syndrome includes a clinically heterogeneous group of mitochondrial diseases characterized by low content of CoQ10 in tissues. The only currently available treatment is supplementation with CoQ10, which improves the clinical phenotype in some patients but does not reverse established damage. Incubation with CoQ10 restored respiration and apoptotic pathways but did not affect lipid metabolism, cell growth, and undifferentiated phenotype presented by CoQ10 deficient cells. We conclude that the mitochondrial dysfunction caused byCoQ10 deficiency induces a stable survival adaptation of somatic cells from patients, thus explaining their incomplete recovery after treatment.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expresion of human dermal fibroblast from healthy people (group 1) with fibroblast from diferent patient diagnosed with the human syndrome of coenzyme Q10 deficiency, which were treated (group 3) or not (group 2) with coenzyme Q10 to recovery ATP levels.
