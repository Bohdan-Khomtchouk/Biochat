TITLE
Identification of the hemogenic endothelial progenitor and its direct precursor in human pluripotent stem cell differentiation cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hemogenic endothelium (HE) is the source of HSCs in the developing embryo. In this study we have identified the hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their precursors originating from differentiated H1 cells on OP9 stromal cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of  hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their precursors originating from differentiated H1 cells on OP9 stromal cells.
