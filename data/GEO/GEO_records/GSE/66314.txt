TITLE
Gene expression profiling of fibroblasts harboring POC1A mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
POC1A encodes a WD repeat protein localizing to centrioles and spindle poles and associated with Short stature, onychodysplasia, facial dysmorphism and hypotrichosis (SOFT) syndrome (OMIM #614813). In our study, we reported on two patients with primordial dwarfism (PD) from the same family. We utilized Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in the patients to screen all PD related genes and to define putative novel candidate genes. A novel homozygous p.T120A missense mutation was detected in POC1A, a known causative gene of SOFT syndrome, and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. To confirm the pathogenicity of the detected mutation, primary fibroblast cultures obtained from the patients and a control individual were used. Gene expression profiles of the fibroblast cultures were taken.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression arrays on fibroblasts cultured from patients with SOFT syndrome and POC1A mutation and compared their expression profiles to that of control fibroblast cells.
