TITLE
Comparison of wt, krt18+/- and krt18-/- non-tumorous liver tissues at the age of 12 and 18 months [aCGH]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the different genotypes of non-tumorous mouse livers in 3 different ages revealed more genetic alterations in Krt18-/- and Krt18+/- compared to wt livers. This speaks in favor of a higher genomic instability being causally related to K-deficiency and aging, even at a preneoplastic stage.

DESIGN
Wild type healthy liver tissue vs. healthy krt18+/- / healthy krt18-/- at the age of 12 and 18 months

PLATFORM
GPL21806 Agilent-028916 Mouse 8x60k CGH [Feature number version]
