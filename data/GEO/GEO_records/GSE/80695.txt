TITLE
Whole genome analysis of iron oxide nanoparticles treated mensenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the cellular effect of iron oxide nanoparticles on MSC, we performed gene expression microarray assay to explore more intensive molecular basis.

DESIGN
Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal were treated by iron oxide nanoparticles at final concentration 100 Î¼g/mL for 7 days, then gene expression microarray analysis were employed.
