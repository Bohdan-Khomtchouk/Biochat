TITLE
Digital Gene Expression (DGE) of thyroid hormone (T3)-responsive genes in C17.2 cells stably transfected with thyroid hormone receptors alpha and beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tagged versions of thyroid hormone receptors alpha (TRa) and beta (TRb) were stably transfected in two C17.2 cell lines, C17.2a and C17.2b, respectively. Cells were treated with 10-7 M T3 for 6, 12 or 24h or left untreated. We performed DGE by sequencing all polyA RNA according to a SAGE-derived method. Differential gene expression after T3 treatment was computed and the T3 responses induced by the two receptors were compared. We could conclude that, in a similar environment, target genes are only partially shared and that a significant proportion show receptor preference and even selectivity.

DESIGN
Examination of thyroid hormone target genes over time in two cell lines (C17.2a, C17.2b), each expressing one of the thyroid hormone receptors (alpha, beta).
