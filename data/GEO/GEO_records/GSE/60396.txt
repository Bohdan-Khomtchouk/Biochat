TITLE
Effect of BRCA1 heterozygous mutation on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate whether carriers of BRCA1 heterozygous mutation show altered gene expression profiles, we used a whole genome microarray expression profiling of a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) harboring either mutated or WT BRCA1 (control). We were especially interested whether we find differences in gene expression between carriers of missense versus truncating mutation in BRCA1 gene.

DESIGN
We evaluated gene expression of a panel of 21 non-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Among them, 6 LCLs with WT BRCA1, 5 LCLs carrying missense mutation in BRCA1, and 10 LCLs harboring truncating mutation in BRCA1 were included in this study.
