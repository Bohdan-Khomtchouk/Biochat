SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Richard Sandstrom mailto:sull@u.washington.edu ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project. This track displays maps of genome-wide binding of the CTCF transcription factor in different cell lines using ChIP-seq high-throughput sequencing For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed in nuclei lysis buffer, and the chromatin was sheared to 200-500 bp fragments using Fisher Dismembrator (model 500). Sheared chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with specific polyclonal antibodies at 4 degrees C with gentle rotation. Antibody-chromatin complexes were washed and eluted. The cross linking in immunoprecipitated DNA was reversed and treated with RNase-A. Following proteinase K treatment, the DNA fragments were purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. 20-50 ng of ChIP DNA was end-repaired, adenine ligated to Illumina adapters was added, and then a Solexa library was made for sequencing. ChIP-seq affinity is directly reflected in raw tag density (Raw Signal), which is shown in the track as density of tags mapping within a 150 bp sliding window (at a 20 bp step across the genome). ChIP-seq affinity zones (HotSpots) were identified using the HotSpot algorithm described in Sabo et al. (2004). 1.0% false discovery rate thresholds (FDR 0.01) were computed for each cell type by applying the HotSpot algorithm to an equivalent number of random uniquely mapping 36mers. ChIP-seq affinity (Peaks) were identified as signal peaks within FDR 1.0% hypersensitive zones using a peak-finding algorithm.
