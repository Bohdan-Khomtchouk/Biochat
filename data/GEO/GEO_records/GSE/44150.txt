TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Rattus norvegicus Embryonic Stem Cells by RNA-Sequencing

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to establish a rat embryonic stem cell transcriptome, mRNA from rESC cell line DAc8, the first male germline competent rat ESC line to be described and the first to be used to generate a knockout rat model was characterized using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis.Â 

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of RRRC#464 DA-EC8/Rrrc cell line  were sequenced with  50bp paired end reads using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL14844 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Rattus norvegicus)
