TITLE
Profiling fibrotic lung in TGFb1-Tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing TGFb1 in a lung-specific manner display airway inflammation and fibrosis, phenotypes relevant to human COPD and asthma. This model system provides a platform for identifying and validating genes/pathways involved in these disease pathogeneses.

DESIGN
The TGFb1-Tg mice lung profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the lung of TGFb1-Tg mice compared to the corresponding wild type controls.
