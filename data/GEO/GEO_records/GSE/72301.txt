TITLE
Expression data of CNS T cells during EAE

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the absence of NR4A2 in T cells mice do not develop early acute EAE, but only a late chronic disease.  We examined the mechanism by which NR4A2 can control the pathogencity of T cells in CNS autoimmune disease. To determine how NR4A2 is involved is involved in T cell pathology, we examined expression profiles of T cells during early and late diease in the presence or genetic CD4-specific absence of NR4A2.

DESIGN
T cells infiltrating CNS tissues were isolated at peal acute EAE (D18) or during late,chronic EAE (D32).  RNA expression was then analysed by genechip to determine the influence of NR4A2 in T cells on these disease stages
