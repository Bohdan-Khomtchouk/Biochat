TITLE
Sigma factor B (sigB) response to stress conditions (0.05% SDS and 5mM Diamide)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
The numerous sigma factors present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are indicative of adaptability to different environmental conditions. In this report we describe the sigma factor B (sigB) regulon and the phenotypes of a MTB sigB mutant strain exposed to different stresses like SDS and Diamide. This experiment set compares expression profiles between H37Rv wild type and H37Rv sigB null mutant as well as under different stress conditions. Both H37Rv wild type and H37Rv sigB null mutants were treated with either 0.05% SDS or 5mM Diamide for 60 min and their expression profiles were compared with untreated wild type or mutant controls.
