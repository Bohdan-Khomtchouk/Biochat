TITLE
Whole-genome expression analysis of melanoma tumor biopsies from a population-based cohort.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles in metastatic melanoma to validate prognostic signatures.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen melanoma tumors and genome-wide expression profiling was performed using Illlumina Human HT-12V4.0 BeadChip arrays by standard methods. After removal of replicate samples there were 214 unique melanoma samples left.
