TITLE
Transcription analysis of E. coli O157:H7 when exposed to sodium benzoate

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Sodium benzoate is a widely used food antimicrobial in drinks and fruit juices. A microarray study was conducted to determine the transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to 0.5% (w/v) sodium benzoate.  Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 grown in 150 ml Luria-Bertani broth (LB) was exposed to 0 (control) and 0.5% sodium benzoate. Each treatment was duplicated and sampled at 0 (immediately after exposure), 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed with E. coli 2.0 Gene Chips.
