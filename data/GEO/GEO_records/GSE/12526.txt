TITLE
Gene expression from CEPH-Utah,CHB+JPT, and YRI individuals to examine gene expression correlation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine gene expression levels in individuals from different populations (cephgp, chb, jpt, yri). The chb and jpt populations are combined in the analysis.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression levels in 295 lymphoblastoid cell lines representing 4  ethnically-distinct populations.  For some cell lines, RNA extracts were hybridized twice, representing technical replicates. For these cell lines, we take the average signal intensity as a measure of relative abundance of a gene.
