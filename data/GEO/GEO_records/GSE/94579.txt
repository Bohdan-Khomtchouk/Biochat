SUMMARY
J14 ES cells differentiated into MGE-like cells. Three groups of single-cell preparations were analyzed: ES cells (undifferentiated), differentiated cells (unsorted, of which less than 10% are GFP+) and GFP+ differentiated cells. These are specified in the " group " sample characteristic, with values " ES " , " Unsorted " and " GFP+ " respectively. The " SAMPLE_ID " sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech. The ID of this project in Genentech's ExpressionPlot database is PRJ0007904
