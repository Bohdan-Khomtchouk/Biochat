TITLE
Expression data from mouse preimplantation cloned embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptiome analysis is an excellent approach to understand the mechanism underlying nuclear reprogramming in somatic-cell-cloned embryos. Analysis of the transcriptomic data from the oocyte to blastocyst stage revealed that specific genes were inappropriately reprogrammed at each stage. Sertoli cell-cloned embryos appear to develop normally because the progression of incorrect reprogramming is concealed throughout development. The time-lapse gene expression profiles provide valuable information for understanding reprogramming in SCNT embryos.

DESIGN
Single mouse oocyte (MII metaphase), in vitro fertilized embryo (replicates = 3 / each stage) and Sertoli cell cloned embryo (replicates = 5 / each stage) from 1-cell stage to blastocyst stage (16, 32, 48, 62, 72, 84 hours after sperm addition or activation) was used for total RNA extraction. Totally 51 Affymetrix microarrays were used in the experiment.
