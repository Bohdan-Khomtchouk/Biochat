TITLE
BATF3siRNA induced gene expression changes in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the effect of BATF3 silecing on gene expression in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428.

DESIGN
L428 cells were treated with BATF3siRNA (Silencer® Select s195280 BATF3 siRNA, Catalog number: 4392420) and control siRNA (Silencer® Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA, ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number: 4390843) in triplicates and their gene expresson profiles were obtained using Affymetrix PrimeView human gene expression array.

PLATFORM
GPL16043 GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (with External spike-in RNAs)
