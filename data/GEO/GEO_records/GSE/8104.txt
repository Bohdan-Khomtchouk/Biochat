TITLE
Primary macrophage response to L. monocytogenes and bacteria-derived ligands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of macrophages (of various genetic backgrounds) infected with L. monocytogenes or transfected with purified ligands Keywords: Timecourse, cell type comparison, bacteria strain comparison, drug comparison, ligand comparison.

DESIGN
Timecourse experiment in different genetic backgrounds, with both WT and mutant bacteria, and with different combinations of purified ligands.  Multiple biological replicates (see array names), with one replicate per array.
