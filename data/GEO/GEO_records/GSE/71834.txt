TITLE
Quantification of RNA editing in MEF cells of different genetic backgrounds with and without interferon treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of mmPCR-seq to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We quantified RNA editing at 557 different loci using a microfluidic multiplex PCR method coupled with deep sequencing.

DESIGN
RT-PCR amplification of 557 loci from 6 MEF lines with and without interferon treatment to quantify RNA editing levels.

PLATFORM
GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
