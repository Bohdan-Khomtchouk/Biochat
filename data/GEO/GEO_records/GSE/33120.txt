TITLE
Functional characterisation of SVP by a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing approach

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
SVP is a key MADS-box transcription factor for Arabidopsis development since it acts both during vegetative and reproductive phases where it plays different roles probably by interacting with different partners to regulate specific sets of target genes. In fact, whereas SVP functions as a repressor of floral transition during the vegetative phase, it works as floral meristem gene during reproductive phase. We studied the behavior of SVP during two distinct developmental phases: the vegetative and reproductive phase. The aim of these studies is to identify subsets of genes that are directly bound by SVP by means of ChIP sequencing (Illumina Solexa Sequencing) approach during the two distinct phases of development.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and inflorescences were selected at successive stages of early development for chromatin extraction and subsequent immunoprecipitation using GFP antibody. The identification of genome wide binding sites of SVP using the ChIP-SEQ approach were performed in the vegetative phase using pSVP::SVP-GFP svp-41 and wild-type seedlings grown for 2 weeks in Short Day (SD) conditions (8 h light/16 h dark); for the reproductive phase we used wild-type and pSVP::SVP-GFP svp-41 inflorescences grown for 2 weeks in SD conditions and then moved in (LD) conditions (16 h light/16 h dark). The inflorescences were collected at 2 weeks after bolting.
