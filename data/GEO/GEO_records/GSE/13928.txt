TITLE
The contributions of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we present a statistically rigorous approach to quantifying microarray expression data that allows the relative effects of multiple classes of treatment to be compared and incorporates analytical methods that are common to quantitative genetics. From the magnitude of gene effects and contributions of variance components, we find that gene expression in adult flies is affected most strongly by sex, less so by genotype and only weakly by age (for 1-  and 6-wk flies); in addition, sex-genotype interactions may be present for as much as 10% of the Drosophila transcriptome. This interpretation is compromised to some extent by statistical issues relating to power and experimental design. Nevertheless, we show that changes in expression as small as 1.2 fold can be highly significant. Genotypic contributions to transcriptional variance may be of a similar magnitude to those relating to some quantitative phenotypes and should be considered when assessing the significance of experimental treatments.

DESIGN
The experimental design consisted of 24 cDNA microarrays, 6 for each combination of 2  genotypes (Oregon R and Samarkand) and the 2 sexes, involving 48 separate labeling reactions. We directly contrasted two time points, 1-wk and 6-wk adult flies, on each microarray. The dyes Cy3 and Cy5 were flipped for two of the six replicates of each genotype and sex combination. A common reference sample was not used. In total, we spotted 4,256 clones, representing a third of the genome, two-thirds of which were verified by resequencing before printing. We excluded 325 clones from the analysis because no consistent expression above background was detected.
