TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mice BMDCs treated with Nitidine Chloride or vehicle following LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nitidine Chloride(NC) were found to enhance IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated Bone-marrow dendritic cells(BMDCs ) ,while at the same time inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production, such as TNF- α and IL-6. BMDCs were treated with NC or vehicle following LPS stimulation to find out the influence of NC on BMDCs that regulate cytokines expression. This study indicated that NC regulate numerous gene expression, thus influence IL-10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines production in LPS-treated BMDCs.

DESIGN
We produced the gene expression profiles of mice BMDCs in four groups. BMDCs were incubated with vehicle or the of NC for 12 h and then stimulated with vehicle or LPS 1 μg/ml for 12 h.
