TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis pvip1 pvip2 seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Early establishment of the apical-basal axis is prerequesite for correct embryonic development in Arabidopsis. The hypophysis is derived from the basal cell of the early embryo and is indispensible for root development; it gives rise to the root quiescent center and the central columella. Arabidopsis pvip1 pvip2 mutants show defects in embryonic root development and give rise to rootless seedlings. We used microarrays to study the gene regulation of rootless mutant embryos in comparison with wild type. Keywords: Mutant comparison

DESIGN
Arabidopsis pvip1 pvip2 mutant and Col-0 wild type seedlings (10 days after germination) were compared using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Roots of wild type seedlings were removed and the vestigial hypocotyl of mutants was cut to control for wounding effects.
