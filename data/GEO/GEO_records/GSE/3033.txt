TITLE
Evalutation of the effect of ethanol upon gene expression in adult Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This experiment was intended to determine if topical exposure to ethanol led to significant changes in gene expression in adult Drosophila melanogaster.   It was determined that topical exposure to ethanol did not lead to a strong differential expression of genes in Drosophila after 4 hours. Keywords: Ethanol response, stress response

DESIGN
The effect of topical treatment with 99% ethanol was compared to the effect of a water treatment which was used as a control and the differential expression between these two treatments was assessed four hours after treatment. Two biological replicates of each treatment were compared for a total of two microarray hybridizations
