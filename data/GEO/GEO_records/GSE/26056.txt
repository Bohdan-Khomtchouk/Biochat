TITLE
Expression data from lateral nasal gland of male B6, 129/Sv and Cyp2g1-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In male Cyp2g1-null mice, the lateral nasal gland, one of the largest anterior glands in the nasal cavity, was found to be protected from acetaminophen toxicity. The goal of this study was to identify the genes that are involved in the mechanisms, especially those genes functional in drug metabolism, clearance and post-activation events.

DESIGN
Lateral nasal gland from 2-3-month-old male mice were dissected from each strain of mouse (B6, 129/Sv and Cyp2g1-null). Both B6 and 129/Sv are used as control mice because the Cyp2g1-null mice are on the mixed genetic background. Glands from 10 mice of each strain were pooled for RNA preparaion for one chip. There are totally 9 chips including 2 for 129/Sv, four for B6 and 3 for Cyp2g1-null mice, respectively.
