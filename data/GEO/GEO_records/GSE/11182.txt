TITLE
Steptoe x Morex seedling leaf comparison

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
This study was to collect expression level polymorphism (ELP) data for the barley genotypes Steptoe and Morex, parents of a widely used North American mapping population.  Primarily, the data collected will show the amount of variation between these genotypes in seedling leaves grown in a greenhouse at the same time, with replications on three separate dates. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger P. Wise(Head of Lab) and Stacy Barkeloo are the original contributors of this experimental data.  PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of them .  The equivalent experiment is 'BB16' at PLEXdb. Keywords: genotype
