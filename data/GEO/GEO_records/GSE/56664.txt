TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of genes regulated by SGE1 in Fusarium verticillioides

ORGANISM
Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome expression changes induced by SGE1 30 minutes after induction of SGE1 expression in an SGE1 mutant strain of Fusarium verticillioides.  Comparison between wild-type, SGE1 overexpression mutant GMTcp-272 (xlnp:SGE1 in SGE1 mutant background) and sge1 mutant in liquid medium (18 hrs) after induction with xylose.  SGE1 plays a role in pathogenicity and synthesis of secondary metabolism.

DESIGN
In this study, total RNA recovered from nine cultures of F. verticillioides (wild-type, sge1 mutant and SGE1 overexpression mutant GMTcp-272, in triplicate) 30 minutes after the addition of xylose was used to identify genes regulated by SGE1.
