TITLE
TaqMan Human miRNA array profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 differentiated macrophages cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially regulated miRNA candidates in H37Rv infected THP-1 cells were analysed with respect to uninfected THP-1 reference samples. THP-1 cells are monocytes differentiated to macrophages after treatment with PMA for 48 hrs. Total RNA was isolated from infected THP-1 cells after 24 hrs of infection, cDNA was synthesized for TLDA real time PCR reaction using TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit and Megaplex Human Pool A and Pool B stem loop RT primers (version 3.0) as per manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Further real time reaction was performed on QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) by using cDNA (without pre-amplification) on TLDA card A and card B (version 3.0).

DESIGN
miRNA profile was obtained after Real Time PCR analyses using TLDA card from total RNA sample of H37Rv infected THP-1 macrophages (Treated) with respect to uninfected reference sample (Untreated).
