TITLE
Characterization of novel ovarian tumor cell lines that retain the phenotype of primary tumors [SNP]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The inability to establish stable cell lines from the vast majority of human tumors has limited the use of in vitro models to study human cancer. Currently available tumor cell lines fail to represent the biological diversity of human tumors. We have developed a cell culture medium that enabled us to routinely establish cell lines from diverse subtypes of ovarian tumors. Importantly, the twenty-five ovarian tumor cell lines described here retain the genomic landscape, histopathology, and molecular features of the original tumors. Furthermore, the molecular profile and drug response of these cell lines correlated with distinct groups of primary tumors with different outcomes. Thus, tumor cell lines derived using this methodology represent a significantly improved new platform to study human tumor biology and treatment.

DESIGN
41 samples were analyzed in singlicate. DNA was extracted from 16 OCI cell lines and the 16 uncultured tumor tissue samples from which they were derived.  DNA was also extracted from 9 standard ovarian cancer cell lines.
