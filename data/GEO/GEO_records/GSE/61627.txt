TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Mst1/2 deleted bronchiolar epithelial cells from adult mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mst1 and Mst2 were conditionally deleted from non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells in the mature lung.  Bronchiolar epithelial cells from control and Mst1/2 deleted mice were isolated by cell sorting and used for RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Scgb1a1-rtTA/tetO-Cre/Mst1;2-flx/flx (Mst1/2 D/D) mice were generated to conditionally delete Mst1 and Mst2 from non-ciliated, secretory bronchiolar epithelial cells.  Adult mice were maintained on doxycycline food for 16 days to induce deletion of Mst1/2.  Lin-/CD326+/CD24-intermediate cells were isolated by fluorescence cell sorting to enrich for the targeted airway epithelial cells.  mRNA isolated from Lin-/CD326+/CD24-intermediate cells from control and Mst1/2 D/D mice was pooled and analyzed by RNA-seq to identify transcriptional changes following deletion of Mst1 and Mst2 from mature lung bronchiolar epithelial cells.
