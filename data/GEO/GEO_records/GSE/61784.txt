TITLE
Gene expression profile in DRG neurons over-expressing NRG1 type III intracellular domain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In DRG neurons NRG1 type III intacellular domain (ICD) moves to the nucleus upon contact with Schwann cells. We aimed to investigate genes up/down regulated by ICD.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA from DRG neurons over-expressing ICD comparing it to RNA from wild-type DRG neurons and RNA from DRG neurons over-expressing EGFP. We used 4 biological replicates and two technical replicates for each condition.
