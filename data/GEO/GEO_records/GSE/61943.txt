TITLE
Expression of miRNAs in human colorectal carcinoma cells upon autophagy induction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression profile of miRNAs during the response of human colon cancer cells (HT29s) to 5-FU treatment and nutrient starvation was examined using miRNA microarray analysis. Combining with the following real time PCR and bioinformatics analysis, the physiological importance of the miRNA-autophagy interconnection is far more likely to be elucidated.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, autophagy induction was confirmed in both 5-FU-treated HT29 cells and nutrient-starved HT29 cells. These cells were used to acquire expression profiles of all human miRNAs annotated in miRBase 18.0
