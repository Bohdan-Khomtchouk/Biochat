TITLE
Liver tissue from hormone treated C57BL/6J mice versus pool C57BL/6J mice of chow diet Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the expression traits in animals of inbred strain C57BL/6J, treated with gonadal hormones. (N=40, 20 males and 20 females).

DESIGN
Liver tissue from the hormone treated group consists of 40 female and male C57BL/6J mice fed a chow diet containing 4% fat (Ralston-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) until 8 weeks of age and then were gonadectomized at 8 weeks of life, implanted with hormone pellets at 12 weeks, and sacrificed at 14 weeks.  Male and female mice of the hormone treated groups received subcutaneous implants of either 0.5 mg estradiol (E2) pellet (plasma yield of 300 picogram/ml) or a 5 mg dihydrotestosterone (DHT) pellet (plasma yield of 1-2 nanogram/ml), designed to release over 21 days, (Innovative Research of America, 17B-estradiol: Cat. No. E-121 0.5mg/pellet, 5a-dihydrotestosterone: Cat. No. A-16).  Control mice were treated with the placebo pellet (Innovative Research of America, placebo: Cat. No. C-111).  At 14 weeks mice were sacrificed, after a 12-hour fast, Liver tissue were dissected and flash frozen in LN2 and stored at -80Â°C.  All sample were compared to a common pool created from equal portions of RNA from each of the samples. Keywords=hormone treated Mouse liver Tissue
