TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines (SK-MES, MDA-MB-231, MKN and 786-O)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer and renal cancer) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (SK-MES, MDA-MB-231, MKN and 786-O) were treated with miRNAs (miR-451a, 99a-5p, 99a-3p, 148a-5p and 148a-3p), siRNAs (si-SDC3 and si-SERPINH1).
