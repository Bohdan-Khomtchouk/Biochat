TITLE
Expression data from spleen and lymph node conventional CD11c+ Dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spleen and lymph node dendritic cells have a differential capacity do induce and retain iTreg cells. Therefore we performed a comparative analysis of the dendritic cells derived from these two compartments to identify the responsible genes

DESIGN
CD11c+ conventional dendritic cells were facs sorted from spleens and lymph nodes of BALB/c animals for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetreix microarray
