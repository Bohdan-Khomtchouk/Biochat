TITLE
RBFOX1 Splicing and Transcriptional Regulation in Neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to identify the RBFOX1 splicing network at a genome-wide level in primary human neural stem cells during differentiation. We observe that RBFOX1 regulates a large set of alternative splicing events implicated in neurogenesis and cell maintenance. Subsequent alterations in gene expression define an additional transcriptional network regulated by RBFOX1 involved in neurodevelopmental pathways remarkably parallel to those affected by splicing.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing at a 75bp single-end read scale was performed using polyA-enriched RNA from 5 biological replicates of primary human neural progenitor cell lines generated by lentiviral-mediated knockdown of GFP (control) or RBFOX1 and differentiated for 4 weeks.
