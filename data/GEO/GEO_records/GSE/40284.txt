TITLE
Gene expression data of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre CD150+ CD48- lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ LT-HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We discovered that mice that lack Lsd1 in hematopoietic cells were exhibited increased frequencies of CD150+ CD48- lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ LT-HSCs, but completely lacked the lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1- myeloid progenitor compartment. To determine the genes altered by Lsd1-loss, CD150+ CD48- lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ LT-HSCs from Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre mice were FACS-purified to be analyzed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Primary CD150+ CD48- lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ LT-HSCs were isolated by FACS-sorting, from the bone marrow of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl Mx1Cre animals, one week after the final p(I:C) dose. Total RNA from three biological replicates per genotype was extracted with the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN), treated with DNaseI, reverse transcribed. RNA extracted from CD150+ CD48- lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ cells was amplified with the Ovation Pico WTA RNA Amplification System 2 (NuGEN Technologies). Single-stranded cDNA amplification products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and labeled with the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN).   The Biotin-labeled cDNA was used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array platform.
