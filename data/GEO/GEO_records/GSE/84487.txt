TITLE
Vicious circle of LSD1 and TGF β1 promotes EMT of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vicious circle of some key proteins is critical in the process of tumor development. Nevertheless, the mechanism of how the epigenetic modifiers are involved in was seldom reported and has not been clearly illustrated. We found the expression of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), the first identified histone lysine demethylase, is positively correlated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF β1) in gastric cancer tissues and can be promoted by TGF β1 activated (p-EKR)-(NF-κB)-p300 signaling pathway, which resulted in the progression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human gastric cancer cells. On the other hand, abrogation of LSD1 leads to the down regulation of TGF β1 as well as the EMT. But in benign cells, this circle was blocked by TGF β1 induced inactivation of ERK, which suggested the distinct roles of TGF β1 against LSD1 in gastric cancer cells and benign cells. This vicious cycle may illustrate a novel mechanism for EMT in gastric cancer mediate by TGF β1 and LSD1 but not in benign cells and may serve as a new strategy for the prevention of EMT for gastric cancer.

DESIGN
Nuclear extracts prepared from MGC803 cells stably expressing Lenti-CAS9-sgRNA-puro for LSD1 or empty vector were used in immunoprecipitation reactions with antibodies against H3K4me2 and H3K9me2. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequencing was performed on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
