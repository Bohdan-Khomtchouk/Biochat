TITLE
Gene expression profiling in MCF7 cell lines under hypoxia and reoxygenation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Study hypoxia and reoxygenation induced changes in genome-wide gene expression Methods: Using the MCF7 breast epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line as a model, we studied epigenomic reprogramming as a function of fluctuating oxygen tension. To this end, we performed a transcriptomics analysis in MCF7 cells subjected to changes in oxygenation (i.e. acute hypoxia, chronic hypoxia, reoxygenation). Results: Global downregulation upon hypoxia; partial restore on reoxygenation. Conclusions: Our data show that oxygen availability dynamically regulates gene transcription.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcriptomics analysis was performed on the Affymetrix Hugene STv1 microarray platform.
