TITLE
Effect of embryonic and maternal genotype on foetal growth in rabbit

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of maternal and embryonic genotype of two lines of rabbit selected by growth rate (line R) and litter size at weaning (line A) on foetal and placental growth. Embryos were recovered at 48 h of gestation from line R (46) and line A (40) donors and transferred to nulliparous recipient does (26 R and 24 A). Each recipient doe received six embryos into one oviduct from line R and six embryos form line A into the other. Laparoscopy was performed at day 14 to determine implantation rate. Recipient females were slaughter at day 14, 24 and 30 (12, 24, 14, respectively) to determine the number of live fetuses and the weight of live foetuses, foetal placenta and maternal placenta. To analyze endocrine levels, blood serum was collected from 14 females at 14, 21 and 28 days of gestation. A transcriptome analysis was performed to search for differences between foetal placentas at day 14 and 24 of development. Foetal survival at Days 14, 24 and 30, and weight at Day 14 was higher for line A embryos, being the weight higher for AA genotype (0.29±0.01g vs. 0.19±0.01g ,for RR genotype). Only the R embryonic genotype showed higher foetal weight at Day 30 (53.4 ± 1.74 vs. 48.5 ± 1.81, for line R and line A foetuses). However, foetal and maternal placentas were higher for RR genotype on Day 24 and 30. No differences in foetal placenta at transcriptome level were found. Additionally, both progesterone and IGF-I levels were similar between lines. In conclusion, line R presented reproductive troubles, with higher gestational losses at embryonary level at Day 14 and 24, and uterine environment problems at least at last part of gestation which reduced survival rate of A line foetuses.

DESIGN
Embryos were recovered at 48 h of gestation from line R and line A donors and transferred to nulliparous recipient does. Recipient females were slaughter at Day 14 and 24, and a transcriptomic comparison analysis was performed from foetal placenta tissue.
