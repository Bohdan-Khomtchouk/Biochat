TITLE
Expression data from Daudi cells stimulated with anti-CD40 and/or IL-4 for 6 hr with or without AICAR-pretreatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the action of AICAR on the transcriptome response to CD40-ligation and IL-4 stimulation in Daudi cells. Keywords: gene expression array-based, response to anti-CD40 and/or IL-4 with or without AICAR

DESIGN
3 replicates for each treatment
