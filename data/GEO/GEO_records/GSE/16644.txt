TITLE
Transcript abundance comparison between uninfected DCs and DCs housing L. amazonensis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the modulation of gene expression of mouse BMDCs in the presence of living intracellular Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes

DESIGN
Dendritic cells were generated in vitro from bone marrow progenitors. Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes were purified from mouse cutaneous lesions and were added to DC cultures. After 24h, and following a sorting procedure, only BMDCs housing living amastigotes were selected for total RNA extraction.
