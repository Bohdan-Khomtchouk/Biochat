TITLE
Mytilus edulis blue mussel larval development Control vs. Fatty acid diet deficiency

ORGANISM
Mytilus edulis

SUMMARY
Blue mussel larvae were fed, in a first group, a balanced diet of essential fatty acids (EFAs) provided by a cocktail diet (COC) from three algal species. Larvae were cultured in three separate tanks from hatching, 0 day post-fertilization (DPF) until 42 DPF. Treated larvae were fed a deficient diet (Tiso) that contains low levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), two EFAs necessary for larval development, performance, and survival. The goal is to identify coordinated patterns of gene expression and understand their predictive function in relation to growth and mortality during early developmental stages of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. In order to understand the mechanisms by which growth and survival drive an organism to the full range of its adaptation, we de novo assembled of the mussel transcriptome during early development using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, then designed customized microarrays targeting every developmental stage, which encompass major transitions in tissue organization of the fast-evolved blue mussel

DESIGN
Two experimental conditions, COC and Tiso diets. Biological replicates 3 culture replicate per stage of development for 5 stages of development. Eggs and trocophore larvae did not undertake treatments
