TITLE
RAW264.7 cells: RANKL vs Bone Metastasis Tumor Cell Condidtioned Media

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of differential miRNA expression in mouse RAW264.7 preosteoclast cells comparing control untreated cells with RAW264.7 cells treated for 6 days. Treatment conditiones tested included 50ng/mL RANKL or indicated bone metastasis tumor cell conditioned media from 4T1, 4T1.2, TSU-PR1, and TSU-PR1-B2 cell lines.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control cells vs. treated cells.
