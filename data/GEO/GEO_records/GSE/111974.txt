TITLE
Endometrial Tissue RNA expression in Recurrent Implantation Failure vs. Conrol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify altered biological processes in the endometrium that may be potential markers of receptive endometrium. RNA expression profiling of the endometrium during the window of implantation was performed in patients with Recurrent Implantation Failure (RIF) versus fertile controls.

DESIGN
24 patients with RIF treated at the IVF clinic and 24 fertile control patients recruited from the gynecology clinic of Istanbul University School of Medicine during 2014-2015 were involved in this prospective cohort study. RIF was determined as failure of pregnancy in ≥ 3 consecutive IVF cycles with ≥1 transfer(s) of good quality embryo in each cycle. Exclusion criteria for this group were active pelvic infections, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, uterine anomalies, endometriosis, karyotype anomalies in one or both partners. Fertile control patients had a history of at least one live birth with no associated comorbidities.
