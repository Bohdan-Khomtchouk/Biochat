TITLE
Transcriptional program for induced delta cell on day10

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Direct lineage conversion of adult cells is a promising approach for regenerative medicine.  A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific subtypes of cells, closely related cells with distinct properties.  The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes:  insulin+ β-cells, glucagon+ α-cells, and somatostatin+ δ-cells.  We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprogram pancreatic acinar cells to β-cells.  We now show that acinar cells can be converted to δ-like and α-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively.  Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming.  Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells at the onset of reprogramming in addition to promoting δ-specification.  Mafa and Pdx1 suppress δ-specification in α- and β-cell formation.  These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo.
