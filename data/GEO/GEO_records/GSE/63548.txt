TITLE
Expression profiling of lymph nodes in tuberculosis patients reveal inflammatory milieu at site of infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extrapulmonary manifestations constitute 15-20% of tuberculosis cases, with lymph node as the most common site. Understanding of disease etiology is limited due to the lack of understanding patientsâ€™ infected tissue milieu. This study was designed to perform global transcriptome analysis of lymph node tissues from healthy individuals and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected lymph nodes of patients to decipher the local response of infected tissue.

DESIGN
This study was designed to elucidate gene expression signatures in the event of Lymph Node Tuberculosis. Total RNA was extracted from lymph node tissue samples of LNTB patients in BSL3 facility and together with healthy lymph node RNA samples (commercially purchased) their global transcriptome profiling was performed using Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 expression beadchip.

PLATFORM
