TITLE
Striatal gene expression profile of the YAC 128 mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Yeast Artificial Chomosome (YAC) 128 model of Huntington's disease shows substantial deficits in motor, learning and memory tasks and alterations in its transcriptional profile. We examined the changes in the transcriptional profile in the YAC 128 mouse model of HD at 6, 12, and 18 weeks

DESIGN
Brain striatal tissue from Wild Type and YAC 128 mice were sampled at the three age groups
