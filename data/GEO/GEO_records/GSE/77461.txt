TITLE
R-spondin 1 and noggin facilitate expansion of resident stem cells from non-damaged gallbladders.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pioneering studies within the last few years have allowed the in vitro expansion of tissue-specific adult stem cells from a variety of endoderm-derived organs, including the stomach, small intestine and colon. Here we derived organoids from mouse gallbladder tissue (gallbladder organoids), from mouse liver (including the extrahepatic biliary ducts and gallbladder; liver organoids) and from mouse small intestine tissue (intestinal organoids). RNA was prepared from these organoids and used to assay expression of 21,258 genes using Affymetrix gene expression arrays. RNA was also prepared from mouse gallbladder, liver and small intestine tissues and used to assay gene expression in these tissues. Finally, gallbladder organoids were induced to differentiate by removing R-spondin 1 and noggin from the culture media and subjected to gene expression array analysis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from mouse gallbladder organoids, differentiated gallbladder organoids, liver organoids, small intestine organoids, gallbladder tissue, liver tissue and small intestine tissue and then used for hybridization of Affymetrix gene expression microarrays.
