TITLE
Gene expression profiles of gliomas in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we have performed expression analysis using paired FF-FFPE glioma samples. We show that expression data from FFPE glioma material is concordant with expression data from matched FF tissue, and can be used for molecular profiling in gliomas.

DESIGN
In this study we have performed expression analysis using 55 paired FF-FFPE glioma samples (HU133 plus 2.0 arrays (FF) and Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (FFPE)). The most informative probe sets were selected based on variance This Series contains the FFPE data only.  FF data set was previously submitted (GSE16011).

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
