TITLE
Gene expression at skin wound sites of WT and FoxO1+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine molecular mechanisms of faster skin wound healing under decreasing FoxO1 protein expression, we performed microarray analysis on 3 days skin wounded samples from FoxO1+/- and WT mice.

DESIGN
Skin wound-induced gene expression in WT and FoxO1+/- mice were measured on 3 days after injury. Three independent experiments were performed at each mouse.
