TITLE
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of mouse fetal livers from different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed marker-free single-cell RNA-Seq to characterize comprehensive transcriptional profiles of 507 cells from seven stages between embryonic day 11.5 and postnatal day 2.5 during mouse liver development. Our data demonstrated the existence of two types of stem/progenitor cells with distinct molecular patterns during liver development. Both types of cells exhibit heterogeneity of transcriptional program within each cell population, suggesting they be in distinct status of self-renewal, cell proliferation and different sub-stages of differentiation and maturation. In general, our data depicting the dynamic trajectories with transcriptional profiles at single-cell resolution during mouse liver development provides insights into the fate decision and transcriptional control of self-renewal, differentiation and maturation of liver stem/progenitor cells.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of 507 single cells from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5 and P2.5 mouse livers were analyzed in this study. ERCC Spike-ins were included in each sample as control. For E11.5 stage, we analyzed 70 single cells from one embryonic mouse (pooled sibling livers); for E12.5 stage, we analyzed 2 biological replicates (2 embryonic mouse), with 83 single cells from replicate 1 and 17 single cells from replicate 2; for E13.5 stage, we analyzed 71 single cells from one embryonic mouse; for E14.5 stage, we analyzed 2 biological replicates, with 75 single cells from replicate 1 and 24 single cells from replicate 2; for E16.5 stage, we analyzed 2 biological replicates, with 56 single cells from replicate 1 and 22 single cells from replicate 2; for E18.5 stage, we analyzed 2 biological replicates, with 39 single cells from replicate 1 and 19 single cells from replicate 2; for P2.5 stage, we analyzed 2 biological replicates, with 21 single cells from replicate 1 and 10 single cells from replicate 2. All single cell samples were processed on the microfluidic system.
