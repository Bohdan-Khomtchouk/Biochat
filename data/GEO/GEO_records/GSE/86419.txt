TITLE
Analysis of Pol II position in asynchronous, G1- or G2/M-arrested cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We sequenced RNA Pol II Flag pulldowns  (NET-seq) from five samples of W303 bar1D (asynchronous, alpha-Factor arrested, nocodazole arrested or transformed with a pGAL1 multicopy plasmid carrying either no ORF or the SEN1 ORF)
