TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zinc finger protein ZBTB20 plays a critical role in regulating insulin expression from islet beta-cells by orchestrating their gene expression profile. We used microarrays to investigate the target gene of ZBTB20 in mouse pancreatic beta-cells.

DESIGN
Adult mouse islets were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify the target genes of transcription factor ZBTB20 in beta-cells. To that end, we isolated the islets from adult beta cell-specific ZBTB20 knockout and their littermate control mice.
