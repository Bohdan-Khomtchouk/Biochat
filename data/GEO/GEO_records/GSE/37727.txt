TITLE
Primitive erythropoiesis is regulated by miR-126 via non-hematopoietic Vcam-1+ cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using classical overexpression/knockout studies, we find that miR-126 regulates the duration of the primitive erythroid program, and confirm this in embryonic miR-126-/- yolk sacs.
