TITLE
C. Elegans expression: toxic vs. adequate vs. low selenium

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis in C. Elegans grown in axenic media with low to toxic selenium concentrations We performed Affymetrix micorarray-based transcriptional profiling on wild-type C. Elegans Bristol N2 grown in low Se axenic media supplemented with five concentrations of selenium, from low to toxic, and harvested at the L4-larva stage.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared for hybridization to Affy microarrays from synchronized cultures of wild-type C. elegans seeded in low Se axenic media, supplemented with graded 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM Se added as sodium selenite, and harvested at the L4-larva stage (1 culture/sample per Se concentgration).
