TITLE
Tolerance to acetic acid is improved by mutations of the TATA-binding protein gene

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify genes responsible for the enhanced tolerance, the transcriptome profile of one acetic acid-tolerant strain was compared with that of a control strain.

DESIGN
RNAseq analysis of acetic acid-tolerant strain and control strain.
