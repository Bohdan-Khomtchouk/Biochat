TITLE
Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of HBV promoters using CAGE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We provide a comprehensive map of transcription start sites (TSSs) for HBV at single nucleotide resolution using CAGE.

DESIGN
Expression profiles using CAGE for HepG2.2.15 (3 replicates), primary human hepatocytes (3 replicates),  HepAD38 (2 replicates) and mouse liver tranduced with AAV-HBV (3 replicates)
