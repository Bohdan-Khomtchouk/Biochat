TITLE
Potato virus Y infection hinders potato defence response and renders plants more vulnerable to Colorado potato beetle attack

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
In the present study molecular interactions between potato plants, Colorado potato beetle (CPB) larvae and Potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN) were investigated by analyzing gene expression in potato leaves.

DESIGN
mRNA samples of secondary PVYNTN-infected (CPB_PVY) and healthy potato plants (CPB_H) cultivar Igor and of RNAi coi1-silenced (CPB_coi1) and non-transformed (CPB_NT) potato plants cultivar Desiree collected 24 h post CPB infestation and respective control non-infested samples (CONT_PVY, CONT_H, CONT_coi1, CONT_NT).

PLATFORM
