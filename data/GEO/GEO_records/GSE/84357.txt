TITLE
RNA-seq of Asxl2 KO LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of Asxl2 KO LSK cells to that of Asxl2 wild-type cells. We found substantial number of genes are differentially expressed in Asxl2 KO cells.

DESIGN
LSK mRNA profiles of Asxl2-/- mice and Asxl2wt/wt (WT)  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
