TITLE
DNA 5-methylcytosine in Paramecium

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
5-methyl-cytosine DNA methylation regulates gene expression and developmental programming in a broad range of eukaryotes. However, its presence and potential roles in ciliates, complex single-celled eukaryotes with germline-somatic genome specialization via nuclear dimorphism, are largely uncharted. While canonical cytosine methyltransferases have not been discovered in published ciliate genomes, recent studies performed in the stichotrichous ciliate Oxytricha trifallax suggest de novo cytosine methylation during macronuclear development. In this study, we applied bisfulfite genome sequencing, DNA mass spectrometry and antibody-based fluorescence detection to investigate the presence of DNA methylation in Paramecium tetraurelia. While the antibody-based methods suggest cytosine methylation, DNA mass spectrometry and bisulfite sequencing reveal that levels are actually below the limit of detection. Our results suggest that Paramecium does not utilize 5-methyl-cytosine DNA methylation as an integral part of its epigenetic arsenal.

DESIGN
We performed bisulfite conversion and Illumina DNA sequencing on 3 samples: one from vegetative cells, one from starved vegetative cells, and one from cells undergoing macronuclear development.

PLATFORM
GPL24715 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Paramecium tetraurelia)
