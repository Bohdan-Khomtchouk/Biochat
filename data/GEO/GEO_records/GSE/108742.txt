TITLE
Silencing of PFKFB4 in Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the crucial role of PFKFB4 in glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) survival, gene expression microarray-based transcriptome analysis was conducted on GSCs transduced for 4 days with PFKFB4 shRNA compared with GSCs transduced with shNT.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates in GSCs from 3 different patients. shNT was used as a control.
