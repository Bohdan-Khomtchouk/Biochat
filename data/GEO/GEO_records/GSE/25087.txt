TITLE
Human Fetal and Adult Peripheral Naïve CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared differences in fetal and adult T cells by performing whole genome profiling on sort-purified T cells (naïve CD4+ and Treg cells) from human fetal specimens (18-22 gestational weeks) and adult specimens (age 25-40 years old). Fetal and Adult Naïve CD4+ T cells phenotype: CD3+CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+CD27+, Fetal and Adult CD4+CD25+ Treg phenotype: CD3+CD4+CD25bright

DESIGN
Four different groups were analyzed: Fetal Naïve CD4+ T cells, Adult Naïve CD4+ T cells, Fetal Treg cells, Adult Treg cells.  For each group three independent donors were analyzed.
