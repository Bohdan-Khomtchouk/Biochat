TITLE
Expression data of yeast genes treated with rapamycin and compound CID 3528206

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Compound CID 3538206 inhibits yeast TORC1 activity and functionally mimic rapamycin. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression with the treatment of  CID 3528206 and rapamycin.
