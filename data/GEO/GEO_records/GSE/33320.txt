TITLE
Expression data of yeast genes treated with rapamycin and compound CID 3528206

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Compound CID 3538206 inhibits yeast TORC1 activity and functionally mimic rapamycin. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression with the treatment of  CID 3528206 and rapamycin.

DESIGN
BY4741 yeast cells were treated with1% DMSO, 20 uM CID 3528206 and 200 nM rapamycin in duplicate for 3hrs. RNA extracted and labeled to probe yeast gene arrays
