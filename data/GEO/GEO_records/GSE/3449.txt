TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for FOS on Human Hela S3 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOS ChIP-chip performed on Human Hela S3 Cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts).  Goal was to identify FOS-binding sites. Keywords = Transcription Factor Binding, FOS, ChIP-chip, Human, Genome Tiling Arrays Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin or total genomic DNA was hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array containing overlapping 50 nt oligonucleotide probes.  Samples are three biological replicates.
