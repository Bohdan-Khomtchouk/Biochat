TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on HepG2 cells exposed to amorphous Silica Nanoparticles (SiO2-NP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to amorphous Silica nanoparticles on Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments using HepG2 cells exposed to  for 24h. We used whole genome microarrays to screen for global changed in HepG2 transcription profiles and with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
24h SiO2-NP (100 mg/L) exposed HepG2 cells were used for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
