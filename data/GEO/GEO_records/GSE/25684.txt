TITLE
[E-MTAB-131] Estrogen Receptor alpha estrogen-responsive binding sites in MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with two polyclonal anti-ERalpha antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminus of the protein, with or without estrogen treatment for 45 minutes of MCF-7 cells, and the immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced with the Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer.
