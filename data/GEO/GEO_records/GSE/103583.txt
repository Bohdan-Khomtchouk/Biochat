TITLE
RNAseq on WT and Meteor KO Embryonic Stem Cells and day3 differentiated cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have demonstrated that Meteor KO cells are associated with a global transcriptional reprogramming associated to a block of Mesendoderm specification. Meteor KO cells loses their developmental competence for Mesendoderm specification in pluripotency and are redirected to a neuroectoderm fate.
