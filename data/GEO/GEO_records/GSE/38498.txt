TITLE
ChIP-seq for EP300 and H3K4me1 in the mouse melanocyte cell line melan-a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-seq for p300 and H3K4me1, we identified 2,489 putative melanocyte enhancer loci in the mouse genome. We demonstrated that these putative enhancers are evolutionarily constrained, enriched for sequence motifs predicted to bind key melanocyte transcription factors, located near genes relevant to melanocyte biology, and capable of driving reporter gene expression with high frequency in cultured melanocytes and in melanocytes of transgenic zebrafish.
