TITLE
Expression data from treatment of actinomycin D and triptolide on MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from treatment of actinomycin D (2.5uM) and triptolide (500 nM) on MCF7 cells for 2, 4 and 6 hours. We used microarrays to explore the mechanism of triptolide action.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with actinomycin D or triptolide for 2, 4 and 6 hours, RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Data were normalized by RMA.
