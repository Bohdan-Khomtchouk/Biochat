TITLE
Influence of alkyl-phospholipids on the gene expression profile of immortalized keratinocytes HaCaT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
New alkyl-phospholipids (APLs) that are structurally derived from the platelet-activating factor are promising candidates for anticancer treatment. After the incorporation into cell membranes, APLs are able to interfere with a wide variety of key enzymes implicated in cell growth, motility, invasion and apoptosis. Besides the prototype edelfosine, we presented a novel group of APLs, glycosidated phospholipids that efficiently inhibit cell proliferation. Two members of this group, Ino-C2-PAF and Glc-PAF, display high efficacy and low cytotoxicity in immortalized non-tumorigenic skin keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. However, the influence of APLs on the transcription of the whole genome is still unknown. Here, using Agilent cDNA microarray technology, we compared global gene expression profiles of HaCaT cells treated with edelfosine, Ino-C2-PAF or Glc-PAF with the profile of control cells.

DESIGN
The influence of APLs on the transcriptional profile of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) was analyzed treating HaCaT cells with respectively 5 ÂµM Ino-C2-PAF, Glc-PAF and edelfosine for 24 h. Control cells were left untreated. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition.
