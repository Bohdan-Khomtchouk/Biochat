TITLE
miRNA profiling in osteosarcoma: a cell line based approach with correlation to gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found various genes involved in differentiation (RGMB, LRRC17), cell cycle control (Cyclin E1) and apoptosis (LIMA1, CAMK2N1) were found to be deregulated in osteosarcoma cell lines, most likely due to altered miRNA expression patterns. Our findings indicate a crucial impact of deregulated miRNAs with consecutive changes in gene expression in osteosarcomas that strongly suggests pathogenetic and potentially therapeutic implications.

DESIGN
We investigated seven well-established osteosarcoma cell lines for genome wide miRNA expression (miRBase version 15.0) and integrated our findings with gene expression -------------------------- This represents the mRNA component of the study
