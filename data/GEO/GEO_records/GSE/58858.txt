TITLE
Myc mild overexpression in the heart in a mosaic fashion induces matabolic changes and triggers hipertrophic protection pathways without a pathological phenotype

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently, it was described that mammalian cells are able to eliminate those with relative lower Myc levels in the epiblast through cell competition. We have described that cardiomyocytes during heart development are also able to complete eliminating cells with lower Myc levels. We have also shown that adult cardiomyocytes respond in the same way over long periods of time when cell competition is induced by overexpressing Myc in a mosaic fashion. We therefore have developed an RNASeq assay to further understand the mechanism of elimination of WT cells and the effect of mild Myc overexpression in cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
Myc overexpression in a mosaic fashion in adult cardiomyocytes, 2 hearts were analyzed and two wild type littermates were used as controls
