TITLE
The crystal structure of the NHL domain in complex with RNA reveals the molecular basis of Drosophila Brain tumor-mediated gene regulation

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Here, we analyze the RNA-binding preferences of several NHL containing RNA-binding proteins (BRAT, NCL-1, TRIM71, WECH, LIN-41, TRIM56, and MEI-P26) using RNAcompete.

DESIGN
In the RNAcompete assay, purified GST-tagged RNA-binding protein is incubated with an excess of RNA pool and bound RNA from individual pulldown experiments are directly labeled and hybridized to a custom Agilent 244K microarray.
