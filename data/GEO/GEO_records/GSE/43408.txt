TITLE
Quantitative Different Analysis of antimicrobial peptide LL37 expressed in E.coli Top 10 under aerobic and anaerobic condition.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We reported the transcriptional profiles of E.coli expressing antimicrobial peptide LL37 under stress response condition.

DESIGN
4 samples, two groups, one group is under aerobic condition, the other group is under anaerobic condition.  One of samples is E.coli which expressed LL37 as induction in each group, another sample is E.coli with no LL37 expression in vivo as control in each group.

PLATFORM
