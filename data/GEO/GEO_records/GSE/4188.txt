TITLE
Drosophila whole testis gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Whole testes were dissected from adult males.  RNA from five or six biological replicates were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Drosophila Genechip 1 arrays.  Comparisons between the bgcn- and Os+bgcn- groups allowed for the identification of stem cell genes. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
5 bgcn-, 6 Os+bgcn-, and 5 wild-type biological replicates were analyzed.
