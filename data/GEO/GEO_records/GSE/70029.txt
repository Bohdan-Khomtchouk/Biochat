TITLE
ChIP-Seq experiment to analyse Zip1 localisation in the Ctf19c mutants during meiotic prophase.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to confirm whether Ctf19c mutants affect Zip1 localisation during meiotic prophase. To do so, diploid S. cerevisiae SK1 cells were constructed containing ndt80-d to arrest cells in prophase. Cells were allowed to sporulate in sporulation media for 5 hours after which formaldehyde was added to the cultures and cells were fixed for 2hr. Samples were then processed according to the standard lab ChIP-Seq protocol (with 3 times 30cycles of 30sec of sonication)
