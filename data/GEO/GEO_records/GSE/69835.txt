TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of BRC+, BRC-, DRC+ and DRC- FACS-sorted samples

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus str. Newman

SUMMARY
BRcells and DRcells show distinct transcriptomic profiles. We assessed transcriptome changes, by deep-sequencing, of different subpopulations of Staphylococcus aureus strain Newman from multicellular aggregates.

DESIGN
Transcriptmic profiles of [Pica-yfp and Ppsma-yfp labeled-strains samples belonging to high and low-fluorescence populations sorted by FACS] were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
