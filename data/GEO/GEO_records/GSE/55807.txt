TITLE
RNA-Seq of ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Analyses of circulating tumor cells (CTC) cultured from blood of patients with cancer may allow individualized testing for susceptibility to therapeutic regimens.  We established ex vivo cultures of CTCs from six patients with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and performed RNA-Seq on those cultures.
