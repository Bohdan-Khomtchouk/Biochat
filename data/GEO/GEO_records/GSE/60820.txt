TITLE
Expression of cell cycle related-genes after early cerebral ischemia in a mouse thrombotic stroke model: a transcriptomic coexpression analysis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of cell cycle related-genes after early cerebral ischemia in a mouse thrombotic stroke model: a transcriptomic coexpression analysis.

DESIGN
Cerebral ischemia was perfomed on Swiss male mice. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed by FeCl3 application on the intact dura mater. Mice were sacrified at 6 hours post-occlusion. Five independent experiments were performed.
