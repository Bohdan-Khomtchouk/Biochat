TITLE
Cell-type specific postnatal developmental expression data from mouse cerebellar Purkinje and Stellate/Basket cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The assembly of neural circuits involves multiple sequential steps such as the specification of cell types, their migration to proper brain locations, morphological and physiological differentiation, and the formation and maturation of synaptic connections. This intricate and often prolonged process is guided by elaborate genetic mechanisms that regulate each developmental event.  Evidence from numerous systems suggests that each cell type, once specified, is endowed with a genetic program that directs its subsequent development.  This cell intrinsic program unfolds in respond to, and is regulated by, extrinsic signals, including cell-cell and synaptic interactions. To a large extent, the execution of this genetic program is achieved by the expression of specific sets of genes that support distinct developmental processes.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the developmental progression of gene expression in synaptic partners of neurons may provide a basis for exploring the genetic mechanisms regulating circuit assembly. Here we examined the developmental gene expression profiles in well defined cell types in a stereotyped microcircuit of the cerebellar cortex.

DESIGN
Manually sorted pure populations of Purkinje cells and Stellate/Basket cells, 3 biological replicates, from Gad67-GFP bac-transgenic (G42) mice were profiled during postnatal developmental stages P3, P7, P14, P21, P28, P35 and P56 using Affymetrix MOE430.2 expression array
