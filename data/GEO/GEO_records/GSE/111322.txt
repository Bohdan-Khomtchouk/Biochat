TITLE
Macrophage microRNA-150 promotes pathological angiogenesis as seen in age-related macular degeneration: part II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified that microRNA-150 is upregulated in aged macrophages of diverse origins and therefore may mechanistically skew them towards a disease-promoting phenotype. The purpose of this experiment was to identify how the murine transcriptome changes with microRNA-150 overexpression.

DESIGN
We prepared 12 samples (N=6/group; microRNA-150_overexpression versus negative control). Quality control revealed improper fragmentation of one sample, which we omitted from further analysis. This sample has not been included in these records.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
