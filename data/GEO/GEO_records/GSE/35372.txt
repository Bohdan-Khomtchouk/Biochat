TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of HL60 cells and its alpha particle-resistant derivative RA11, gamma resistant-derivative RG8, and vincristine resistant-derivative RV+ at baseline and following 8Gy gamma IR and ~2Gy alpha IR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify genes that were differentially expressed in radiation-sensitive, na√Øve HL60 cells, and the derivatives created in our laboratory as indicated in the 'sample title'.  We wanted to identify genes that were differentially expressed both before and after ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, from both a single dose of gamma rays and a single dose of alpha particles, at 4h following IR exposure.  The data were used to identify genes that could be driving radioresistance in each respective cell line.

DESIGN
The four cell lines, HL60, RA11, RG8, and RV+ were all analyzed at control (0Gy) radiation dose, 8Gy gamma rays, and ~2Gy alpha particles.  Samples were collected from each cell line, for each dose, 4h following radiation exposure.  The samples were collected from three independent experiments from three consecutive days in cell culture.
