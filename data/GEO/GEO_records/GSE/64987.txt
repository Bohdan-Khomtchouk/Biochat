TITLE
Extra-coding RNAs regulate neuronal DNA methylation and long-term memory formation [MBD-seq]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This dataset contains whole-genome MBD (methylbinding domain) sequencing results from cortical neuronal cultures and serves as the basis for characterization of DNA methylation profiles from neuronal systems.

DESIGN
This experiment contains three sequencing datasets from 2 biological samples. Two datasets originate from samples that underwent MBD-capture prior to whole-genome sequencing. A third dataset contains non-MBD-captured genomic DNA as a control.

PLATFORM
