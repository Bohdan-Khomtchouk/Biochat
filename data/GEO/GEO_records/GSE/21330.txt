TITLE
expression profile of prostate basal epithelial cells relative to luminal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present the results of a microarray analysis in which we compare gene expression in CFP+ basal and CFP- luminal epithelia cell populations derived from whole prostates of CK5/CFP adult mice. Several genes that have previously been identified as potential stem cell markers in stem cells from various organs are over-expressed in CFP+ cells relative to CFP- cells.

DESIGN
We isolated prostate epithelial cells from CK5/CFP transgenic mouse. We sorted out CFP+ basal cells and CFP- luminal cells and got gene expression list that is up-regulated in basal epithelial populations.
