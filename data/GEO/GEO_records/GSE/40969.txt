TITLE
Molecular profiling of activated neurons by phosphorylated ribosome capture [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that phosphorylated ribosomes can be immunoprecipitated from mouse brain homogenates, resulting in enrichment of transcripts expressed in activated neurons.

DESIGN
Mice were either injected with a concentrated salt solution or vehicle, hypothalami dissected, and phosphorylated ribosomes immunoprecipitated. RNA was sequenced from the input and IP for each condition (4 samples total).

PLATFORM
