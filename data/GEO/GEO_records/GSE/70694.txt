TITLE
Cas9 gRNA engineering for selectable genome editing, activation and repression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq after Cas9-gRNA transfection with different length gRNAs

DESIGN
we performed PolyA Selection and RNA-Seq on cells transfected with dCas9-VPR and a gRNA of each length (20nt, 16nt, or 14nt) targeting ACTC1, MIAT, or HBG1/2

PLATFORM
