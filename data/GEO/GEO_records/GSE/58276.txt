TITLE
Identification of long non-coding RNAs as prognostic indicators of astrocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed and play a key role in tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine the lncRNA expression profile in astrocytoma patients and to assess the potential clinical value of the findings.  Methods: The global lncRNA expression profile in astrocytoma was measured by lncRNA microarray. Next, the differentially expressed lncRNAs were validated using a Taqman probe-based quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay in 130 astrocytoma and 60 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples, which were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. Finally, the correlation of the lncRNA levels with survival of the astrocytoma patients was estimated by performing a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.  Results: After a two-phase selection and validation process, 7 lncRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples compared to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the potential of the 7-lncRNA profile to differentiate between tumors and NAT samples. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found that the low expression of XLOC_005285 and XLOC_010967 and the high expression of HIT000260843.11 were significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors.

DESIGN
The lncRNA expression profiles of 3 astrocytoma tissues and 3 normal adjacent tissues  were studied by microarray.
