TITLE
Genome-wide strategies identify molecular niches regulated by connective tissue-associated transcription factors [ChIP-seq Histones]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the regulatory cascades involved in connective tissue differentiation, we selected five zinc finger transcription factors - OSR1, OSR2, EGR1, KLF2 and KLF4 - based on their expression patterns and/or known involvement in the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into connective tissue subtypes. We combined RNA-seq with ChIP-seq profiling in chick limb cells following overexpression of individual transcription factors. We identified a set of common genes regulated by all five transcription factors, which constitutes a connective tissue core expression set. This common core was enriched in genes associated with axon guidance and myofibroblast signature. In addition, each of the transcription factors regulated a different set of extracellular matrix components and signalling molecules, which define local molecular niches important for connective tissue development and function.

DESIGN
Histone modification occupancy profiling of mesenchymal cells extracted from limb buds of E4.5 chick embryos.
