SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on tail bud stage morphants and stage-matched control injected embryos in order to determine any global gene expression changes occurring as a result of defbl1 knockdown.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates per treatment on single dye Agilent Array

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
