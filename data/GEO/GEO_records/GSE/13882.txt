TITLE
Derriere targets in Xenopus posterior mesoderm

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Left-right axis determination is a fundamental and conserved developmental process, with consequences for human pathology. At the molecular level, this process requires at least two centers of nodal-type TGFbeta signals: the first center, containing nodal/Xn Microarrays were used to determine differences in gene expression in posterior mesoderm of Xenopus embryos.  We compared controls and Derriere depleted embryos. Keywords: loss of function
