TITLE
Derriere targets in Xenopus posterior mesoderm

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Left-right axis determination is a fundamental and conserved developmental process, with consequences for human pathology. At the molecular level, this process requires at least two centers of nodal-type TGFbeta signals: the first center, containing nodal/Xn Microarrays were used to determine differences in gene expression in posterior mesoderm of Xenopus embryos.  We compared controls and Derriere depleted embryos. Keywords: loss of function

DESIGN
Microarrays were used to determine differences in gene expression in posterior mesoderm of Xenopus embryos.  We compared controls and embryos depleted of Derriere protein using MO oligonucleotides.
