TITLE
Identification of miR-203 Regulated Genes During Sendai Virus Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine gene expression changes during Sendai virus infection as the result of expression or inhibition of miR-203 in A549 cells.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiling experiment was performed with 4 groups (mock infected, Sendai virus infected, Sendai virus infeceted in the presence of exogenous miR-203, and Sendai virus infected in the presence of miR-203 inhibitor) with 3 biological replicates for each group.  Total RNA was purified from A549 cells that were mock infected or infected with Sendai virus (Cantell strain, 5pfu/cell) alone or in the presence of miR-203 mimic or inhibitor for 10 hours.
