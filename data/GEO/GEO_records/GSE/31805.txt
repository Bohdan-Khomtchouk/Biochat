TITLE
Global transcriptomics of enterotoxigenic E. coli strain E24377A

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O139:H28 str. E24377A

SUMMARY
ETEC is an important human pathogen.  Although the mechanism of diarrhea is known in ETEC, the regulatory networks are less understood.  This study was conducted to understand the global expression of ETEC isolate E24377A under different growth and environmental conditions.

DESIGN
ETEC E24377A was grown in LB or LB+bile salts (3% w/v).   For each condition, three biological replicates were combined into a single sample.
