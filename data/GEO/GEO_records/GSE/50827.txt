TITLE
ICGC Pancreas: Genomewide DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (gene expression of 103 samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset includes gene expression data from 103 primary tumour samples. 86 samples from this dataset have already been deposited into GEO (GSE36924), and has been duplicated here since the data has been processed differently. This data is also available through the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) Data Portal ( http://dcc/icgc.org ), under the project code: Pancreatic Cancer (QCMG, AU). Access to the restricted clinical data must be made through the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office ( http://www.icgc.org/daco ).

DESIGN
This dataset contains gene expression array data from 103 primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples. All samples have 1 biological replicate. These data have corresponding methylation 450K array data (GSE49149).
