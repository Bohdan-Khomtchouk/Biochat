TITLE
Glutamine deprivation in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the effects of glutamine deprivation on cell physiology we performed global analysis of gene expression in response to glutamine deprivation. U2OS cells were subjected to glutamine deprivation for 24h followed by RNA extraction and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
U2OS cells were plated overnight followed by treatment for 24h with glutamine-containing and glutamine-depleted media. Three biological replicates were assayed for each condition.
