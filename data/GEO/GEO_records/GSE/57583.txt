TITLE
Gene expression in hippocampal sub-fields of 6.1 month old rTg4510 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to assess the gene expression patterns in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the rTg4510 mouse line at 6.1 months of age. This line harbors a repressible mutant human Tau transgene under the Camk2a promoter. Both mice with just the tet-Transactivator alone and no transgenes ('double negative') were used as comparison groups.

DESIGN
Cellular layers of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) from 5 or 6 mice per genotype at age 6.1 months were laser capture dissected, RNA was isolated, and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays performed.
