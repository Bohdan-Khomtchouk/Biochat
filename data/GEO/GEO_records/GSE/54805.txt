TITLE
Age-dependent gene and protein expression following transection of neonatal spinal cord of Monodelphis domestica (South American Grey Short-tailed opossum)

ORGANISM
Monodelphis domestica

SUMMARY
In the present study we investigated the genome and the proteome in the segment of cord rostral to the site of injury following a complete spinal cord transection in opossums at an age when axonal growth across a lesion and substantially normal locomotor development occur (postnatal day 7, P7) and compared this with an older age when no axon growth can be seen, but nevertheless a demonstrable body weight-bearing locomotion is present (P28, Wheaton et al, 2011).

DESIGN
7 RNA-seq samples, consisting of 2 biological replicates of controls at day 8, 1 control sample at day 29, and 2 biological replicates each from injured animals at days 8 and 29.

PLATFORM
GPL17258 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Monodelphis domestica)
