TITLE
Mapping of nucleolus-associated chromosomal domains during replicative senescence.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nucleolus-associated DNA was isolated from cross-linked proliferating and senescent IMR90 human fibroblasts and hybridized against genomic (1) or non-nucleolar (2) DNA to map nucleolus-associated chromosomal domains.

DESIGN
Comparison of nucleolus-associated DNA from proliferating IMR90 cells to senescent IMR90 cells.
