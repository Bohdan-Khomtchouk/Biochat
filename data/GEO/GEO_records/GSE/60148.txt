TITLE
Role of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in modulating gene expression in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate if milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) enclosing the dairy fat influence peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression. This study was a 8-week single-blind, randomized, controlled isocaloric trial with two parallel groups including overweight (mean BMI: 28) adult  women (n=30). All subjects consumed 40 g dairy fat per day either as cream (MFGM diet) or as butter oil (control diet). MFGM diet and control diet showed differential responses in plasma cholesterol. Absolute differences in gene expression were calculated for each gene in each subject, comparing after with before the intervention. These absolute differences in gene expression were compared between intervention groups with T-test and with Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). 19 genes were significantly different regulated by the two diets with a FDR of 23%. Most of thechanges in gene expression correlated with changes in blood lipids.

DESIGN
Patients were examined in the morning after 12 h's fasting. Whole blood was obtained before (W0) and after completion (W8) of the dietary intervention for isolation of PBMCs and RNA extraction. From total RNA we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and then washed, stained and scanned the slides using standardised protocols (Affymetrix Inc.). Signicance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was use to compare the difference in gene expression between groups.
