TITLE
Integrative genomics analysis of genes with biallelic loss and its relation to the expression of mRNA and micro-RNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic instability plays an important role in human cancers.  We previously characterized genomic instability in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) in terms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number (CN) changes in tumors. In the current study we focus on biallelic loss and its relation to expression of mRNA and miRNA in ESCC using results from 500K SNP, mRNA, and miRNA arrays in 30 cases from a high-risk region of China.
