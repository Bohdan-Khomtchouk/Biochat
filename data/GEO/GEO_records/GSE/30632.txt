TITLE
Identification of Hoxb1b regulated genes in zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Microarrays containing the Compgen/Sigma-Genosys XEBLIB96 oligo set (which represents about 12,500 unique genes) was used to identify 100 genes up-regulated more than 2-fold by hoxb1b in zebrafish embryos

DESIGN
Fertilized zebrafish embryos were injected with hoxb1+meis3 mRNA or meis3 mRNA alone and raised to 14 hpf followed by dissection of the anterior 1/3 of the embryo to identify genes ectopically induced by Hoxb1b.
