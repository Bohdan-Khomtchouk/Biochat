TITLE
Drosophila CNS mitochondrial dysfunction with Ras/MAPK inhibition microarray

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction causes biophysical, metabolic and signalling changes that alter homeostasis and reprogram cells. We used a Drosophila model in which TFAM is overexpressed in the nervous system with or without Ras/MAPK pathway inhibition, by knock-down of the ETS transcription factor pointed, to investigate the how mitochondrial dysfunction and Ras/MAPK signalling affect the transcriptome. We used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression in cases of mitochondrial dysfunction in the CNS with or without Ras/MAPK pathway inhibition by knock-down of pointed.

DESIGN
RNA was purified from the late third instar larval CNS from control larvae, or larvae over-expressing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in post-mitotic neurons using the neuron specific driver nSyb-Gal4, or larvae over-expressing TFAM in combination with knock-down of pointed.  Three replicates are included for the control and 4 for TFAM overexpression and TFAM overexpression combined with pointed knock-down.
