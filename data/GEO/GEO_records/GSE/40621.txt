TITLE
CINCINNATA Controls Surface Curvature of Antirrhinum Leaf by Coordinated and Direct Activation of Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mutations in the CINCINNATA gene in Antirrhinum and its orthologues in Arabidopsis cause negative surface curvature in leaves due to excess marginal growth. CIN-like genes code for TCP transcription factors and are expressed in a broad zone of a growing leaf somewhat distal to the proliferation zone. Although a few TCP targets are known, the role of CIN-like TCP genes in regulating leaf curvature has remained unclear. We have compared the global transcription profile of wild type and cincinnata mutant to identify its targets. By combining DNA-protein interaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA in situ hybridization, we show that CIN maintains surface flatness by regulating signaling or level of major plant hormones. CIN promotes cytokinin signaling directly and GA level indirectly, in accelerating maturity in leaf cells along the tip-to-base direction. In addition, CIN suppresses auxin signaling more at the margin than centre by establishing a margin-to-medial expression gradient of a homologue of the auxin suppressor IAA3. Our results uncover an underlying mechanism in a developing leaf that controls maturity of leaf and its surface curvature. Considering the conservation of CIN-like genes and their function in leaf morphogenesis in multiple plant species, it is likely that such mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.
