TITLE
Gene expression profiles of MCF-7-derived models of endocrine-resistant breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A are two in vitro models of Estrogen Receptor alpha positive (ER+) estrogen deprivation-resistant breast cancer. Both cell lines grow robustly in the absence of estrogen [PMID:1301400, PMID:7780972].  MCF-7:PF is an in vitro model of antihormone resistant breast cancer that exhibits the characteristics of acquired tamoxifen resistance [PMID:24183378] The goal of this study was to compare basal levels of gene expression during exponential phase of growth in MCF-7-derived models of endocrine resistance, relative to their isogenic parental cells

DESIGN
All cell lines were cultured in their respective replete medium. During exponential phase of growth, cells were harvested and total RNA prepared. To compare basal levels of gene expression in MCF-7-derivative cell lines, Cy3-labeled cRNA probes were prepared from each individual isolate harvested from MCF-7:5C, MCF-7:2A, MCF-7:PF and MCF-7:WS8 (including biological replicates where indicated) and co-hybridized with Cy5-labeled cRNA reference probe prepared from untreated MCF-7 parental cells,  to Agilent 4x44K dual colour oligonucleotide microarrays.
