TITLE
ATM kinase inhibition in glial cells activates the innate immune response and causes neurodegeneration in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of ATM loss on gene expression to identify causes of neurodegeneration.  ATM levels were reduced ubiquitously via the temperature-sensitive ATM^8 allele, or via tissue-specific RNAi of ATM (ATMi) using the Gal4/UAS expression system in neurons (Elav-GAL4 and ElavC155-GAL4) or glial cells (Repo-GAL4).

DESIGN
A 20-chip study using total RNA representing 2 replicates of 3 control genotypes (ATM^8/+, Repo-GAL4, and ElavC155-GAL4) and 3 experimental genotypes (ATM^8/ATM^8, Repo-ATMi, ElavC155-ATMi), and 4 replicates each of a control (Elav-GAL4) and experimental (Elav-ATMi) genotype
