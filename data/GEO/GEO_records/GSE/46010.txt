TITLE
The gene expression change of RNF31 depletion in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNF31 is atypical E3 ligase, which is highly expressed in human breast cancers. In order to understand the effect of RNF31 depletion effect in breast cancers, we knocked down the expression of RNF31 in MCF-7 cells. We aim to find the significantly changed pathways and cell biology behavior.

DESIGN
100uM RNF31 siRNA was applied to transfect the MCF-7 cells, while 100uM siControl was used as the control. Cells were cultured in DMEM red medium with 10% of FBS. Seventy two hours of post transfection, the total RNA was extracted to perform RNA expression analysis.
