TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of Lactobacillus reuteri in sourdough fermentation.

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the transcriptional response of the human isolate L. reuteri ATCC 55730 during sourdough fermentation by using whole-genome microarrays. Significant changes of mRNA levels were found for 101 genes involved in diverse cellular processes, e.g., carbohydrate and energy metabolism, cell envelope biosynthesis, exopolysaccharide production, stress responses, signal transduction and cobalamin biosynthesis. Our results evidence extensive changes of the organism’s gene expression to the growth in sourdough as compared to the growth in chemically defined medium, and thus allowed us to uncover pathways involved in the adaptation of L. reuteri to the ecological niche of sourdough. An impact of several genes of L. reuteri for effective growth in sourdough was shown by implementation of mutant strains in sourdough fermentation. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular fundamentals of L. reuteri’s ecological competitiveness, and provides a basis for further exploration of genetic traits involved in adaptation to the food and/or intestinal environment. Keywords: environment-specific gene expression, sourdough fermentation, chemically defined medium, dye swap
