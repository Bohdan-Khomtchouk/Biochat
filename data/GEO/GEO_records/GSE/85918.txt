TITLE
APOL1 renal-risk variants induce mitochondrial dysfunction (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate pathways whereby apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) G1 and G2 variants facilitate kidney disease in African Americans, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were used to establish doxycycline-inducible (Tet-on) cell lines stably expressing reference APOL1 G0 and its G1 and G2 renal-risk variants. Illumina human HT-12-v4 arrays and Affymetrix HTA 2.0 arrays were employed to generate global gene expression data with doxycycline induction. Significantly altered pathways identified through bioinformatics involved mitochondrial function; results were validated using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and functional assays.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles were performed on HEK293 Tet-on G0, G1, G2 and empty vector cells with and without Dox induction using Illumina human HT-12 v4 arrays. Another independent gene expression array system, Affymetrix HTA 2.0, was used to verify the results of Illumina arrays. Pair-wise and pattern-based analyses were applied to detect the mostly impacted pathways due to overexpression and by APOL1 genotypes.
