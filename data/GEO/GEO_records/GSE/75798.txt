TITLE
expression profiles in the chicken PSM differentiation at Stage 12HH chicken embryo

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To examine global gene expression profile of chicken early paraxial mesoderm differentiation, we microdissected stage 12HH chicken PSM regions into 20 pieces (10 pieces both left-right PSM), including the tail bud, the PSM and somites. We create microarray series using these fragments.

DESIGN
Duplicated 10 fragmented tissues from stage 12 chicken PSM regions. contributor: IGBMC microarray facility

PLATFORM
GPL3213 [Chicken] Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array
