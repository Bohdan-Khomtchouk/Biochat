TITLE
newly transcribed RNA (nt-RNA) for IFN alpha and gamma time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from NIH-3T3 cells treated with mock, 100 U/ml IFN alpha or 100 U/ml gamma for 1 or 3h on nt-RNA labeled for 30-60 min at different times of interferon treatment Differential gene expression caused by IFN alpha or gamma was analyzed in newly transcribed RNA (nt-RNA) of NIH-3T3 cells treated for 1 or 3 h. RNA was labeled for 30 to 60 min and separated from total cellular RNA (tc-RNA) following Trizol RNA preparation and thiol-specific biotinylation We used microarrays to analyze the effects of IFNalpha and gamma treatment in newly transcribed RNA (nt-RNA) Keywords: time course
