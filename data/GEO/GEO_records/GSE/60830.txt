TITLE
p63+/Krt5+ Distal Airway Stem Cells are Essential for Lung Regeneration (transplanted and damaged)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The possibility of lung regeneration has been long discounted due to the irreversible nature of chronic lung diseases.  However, patients who sustain massive loss of lung tissue during acute infections often recover full pulmonary function.  Correspondingly, we previously demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection and implicated p63+Krt5+ distal airway stem cells, or DASCp63/Krt5, in this process.  We show here that rare, preexisting DASCp63/K5 undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza and lineage-trace to nascent alveoli assembled at sites of interstitial inflammation.  We also show that the ablation of DASCp63/Krt5 in vivo prevents the regeneration of lung tissue following influenza leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange.  Finally, we demonstrate that exogenously cloned and propagated DASCp63/Krt5 readily contribute to lung regeneration following transplantation.  The transplanted DASC ameliorated influenza-induced lung injury. These data suggest that DASCp63/K5 are required for lung regeneration and may have therapeutic utility in acute and chronic lung diseases.

DESIGN
Transplanted DASC cells incorporated into damaged host lung were laser capture microdissected and analyzed. Duplicate mice were included. We used the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform
