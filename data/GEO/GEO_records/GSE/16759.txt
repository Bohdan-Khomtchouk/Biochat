TITLE
mRNA and  miRNA expression in parietal lobe cortex in Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we jointly profiled mRNA and miRNA expression to determine the role of miRNAs in AD, and whether the levels of miRNAs are related to those of target mRNAs. We found a bias towards positive correlation between levels of miRNAs and those of their targets.

DESIGN
We profiled parietal lobe tissue from 4 AD patients and 4 age-matched controls.
