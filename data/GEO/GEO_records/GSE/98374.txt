TITLE
Gene expression analysis of S. mutans wild type and lmrB mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
We used whole-genome microarrays to identify the global transcriptional changes upon lmrB deletion and also to investigate the molecular function of lmrB product

DESIGN
S. mutans wild type cells and lmrB mutant cells at mid-log phase were collected for microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL23120 Agilent-033229 Streptococcus mutans whole-genome 15k array (Probe name version)
