TITLE
Confirmation of the gene expression pattern in Mxi1-deficient mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For final aim to completes network map between gene that is concerned in cystogenesis, verifies meaning genes connected with cyst formation analyzing gene pattern in Mxi1 KO mouse that have phenotype of polycystic kidney disease. Monitoring meaning genes through microarray analysis, and confirm the function of these genes. Also, find pathway including meaning genes and new pathway related with PKD. Completes network map concerned in cystogenesis through integrates knowing pathway and predicting pathway. Develope diagnostic of cyst disease and cure target through such completed network map, and wish to clear new role of cyst formation connection gene through in vivo model and examine closely control system of cyst formation mechanism. Keywords: Cystogenesis

DESIGN
Use 1 mouse at each experiment and control. Indirect labeling of 10g cRNA, using bacterial control mRNA.
