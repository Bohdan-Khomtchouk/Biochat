TITLE
Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP: sequencing data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied 4-thiouridine to cultured cells expressing the FLAG/HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) followed by UV 365 nm irradiation. The crosslinked RNA-protein complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the covalently bound RNA was partially digested with RNase T1 and radiolabeled. The radiolabeled RNPs were subsequenctly separated by SDS-PAGE, the crosslinked RNA segments recovered and converted into a cDNA library and sequenced.

DESIGN
RBPs were UV-crosslinked to their RNA targets containing 4-thiouridine. The RNA segments were recovered after immunoprecipitation and seqeunced by Solexa.
