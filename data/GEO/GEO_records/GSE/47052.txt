TITLE
COUP-TFII regulates human endometrial stromal genes involved in inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although the function of COUP-TFII in uterine decidualization has been described in mice, its role in the human uterus remains unknown.To interrogate the role of COUP-TFII in human endometrial function, we utilized a siRNA-mediated loss of function approach in primary human endometrial stromal cells.

DESIGN
Primary human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), coup-TFII siRNA group and control group Two group comparison
