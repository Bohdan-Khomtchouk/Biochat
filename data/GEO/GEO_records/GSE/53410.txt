TITLE
Identification of alternative splicing events regulated by the splicing factor SRSF1 using data from exon-junction microarray technologies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis to identify genome-wide differential alternative splicing events in A549 cells in which the levels of the gene SRSF1 were down-regulated with a specific siRNA

DESIGN
9 samples from three independent experiments using A549 cells transfected with lipofectamine alone, scramble siRNA or SRSF1 siRNA

PLATFORM
GPL18080 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [hjay.r1 version]
