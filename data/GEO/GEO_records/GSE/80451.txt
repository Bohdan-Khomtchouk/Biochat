TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of E. coli REL4536 grown aerobically and anaerobically

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis using RNA-Seq of E. coli REL4536 grown aerobically and anaerobically was undertaken to investigate the activities of various DNA replication and repair pathways involved in maintaining genome integrity, and to assess if their expression is consistent with observed patterns of mutation in the aerobic and anaerobic environments. Consistent with mutation rate and spectra observations, genes for recombination repair, associated with SVs, were generally up-regulated during anaerobic growth.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of 3 aerobically grown cultures of  E. coli REL4536 and 2 anaerobically grown cultures E. coli REL4536.

PLATFORM
