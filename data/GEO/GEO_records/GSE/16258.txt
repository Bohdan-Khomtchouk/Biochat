TITLE
A Top2 and Hmo1-mediated genome architectural pathway preventing chromosome fragility.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Specialized topoisomerases solve the topological constraints arising when replication forks encounter transcription. We have investigated Top2 contribution in S phase transcription.  Specifically in S phase, Top2 binds intergenic regions close to transcribed genes without influencing their transcription. The Top2-bound loci exhibit low nucleosome density and accumulate yH2A when Top2 is defective. These intergenic loci associate with the HMG-protein Hmo1 throughout the cell cycle and are refractory to the histone variant Htz1. In top2 mutants, Hmo1 is deleterious and accumulates at pericentromeric regions in G2/M. Our data indicate that Top2 is dispensable for transcription and that Hmo1 and Top2 bind in the proximity of genes transcribed in S phase suppressing chromosome fragility at the M-G1 transition. We propose that an Hmo1-dependent epigenetic signature together with Top2 mediate a S-phasen architectural pathway controlling replicon dynamics when forks encounter transcriptionto preserve genome integrity.

DESIGN
The Chip on chip analysis was carried out as described (Bermejo et al., 2007; Katou et al., 2006; Katou et al., 2003), employing anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) anti-PK SV5-Pk1 antibody (AbD Serotec) and anti-Î³H2A antibodies (a gift from Alain Verreault). Labelled probes were hybridized to Affymetrix S.cerevisiae whole genome tiling R arrays and processed with TAS software Rev 1.1.
