TITLE
Gene expression profiling of continuous growth hormone infused (cGH) adult male mouse liver by RNA-seq analysis of rRNA-depleted liver RNA. [G137_G138]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
rRNA-depleted RNA isolated from livers of intact male and female mice and from male mice treated with a continuous infusion of growth hormone for either 10 hr or 1 days was analyzed by RNA-seq

DESIGN
Liver RNA was isolated from 8 week old male mice treated with a continuous GH infusion (cGH) for either 10 hours or 1 day. Sham pump males served as a control. RNA-seq data are compared to untreated adult females to identify genes that show sex differences in liver expression and also respond to cGH. RNA samples were pooled to make 3 biological replicates per condition comprised of 2-4 individuals each.
