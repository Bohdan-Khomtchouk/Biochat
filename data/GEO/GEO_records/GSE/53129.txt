TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of chic embryos forebrain lacking Notch signalling

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The generation of diverse neuronal types and subtypes from multipotent progenitors during development is crucial for assembling functional neural circuits in the adult central nervous system. It is well known that Notch signalling pathway through the inhibition of proneural genes is a key regulator of neurogenesis in the vertebrate central nervous system. However, its role during hypothalamus formation along with its downstream effectors remains poorly defined. Here, we have transiently blocked Notch activity in chick embryos and used global gene expression analysis to provide evidence that Notch signalling modulates the generation of neurons in the early developing hypothalamus by lateral inhibition. Most importantly, we have taken advantage of this model to identify novel targets of Notch signalling, such as Tagln3 and Chga, which were expressed in hypothalamic neuronal nuclei. This data gives essential advances into the early generation of neurons in the hypothalamus. We demonstrate that inhibition of Notch signalling during early development of the hypothalamus enhances expression of several new markers. These genes must be considered as important new targets of the Notch/proneural network.

DESIGN
Four sets of samples were used for analysing transcriptome changes in DAPT treated chicl embryos. The rostral part of the head (including the anterior forebrain, optic vesicles and overlying tissue) was collected from control embryos and DAPT-treated embryos at stage HH13.
