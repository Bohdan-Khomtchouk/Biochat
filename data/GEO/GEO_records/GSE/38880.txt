TITLE
Subtherapeutic antibiotics alter the murine colonic microbiome and early life adiposity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early life exposure to antibiotics alters the gut microbiome. These alterations lead to changes in metabolic homeostasis and an increase in host adiposity. We used microarrays to identify metabolic genes that may be up- or down-regulated secondary to antibiotic exposure. Low dose antibiotics have been widely used as growth promoters in the agricultural industry since the 1950â€™s, yet the mechanisms for this effect are unclear.  Because antimicrobial agents of different classes and varying activity are effective across several vertebrate species, we hypothesized that such subtherapeutic administration alters the population structure of the gut microbiome as well as its metabolic capabilities.  We generated a model of adiposity by giving subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy (STAT) to young mice and evaluated changes in the composition and capabilities of the gut microbiome.  STAT administration increased adiposity in young mice and altered hormones related to metabolism. We observed substantial taxonomic changes in the microbiome, changes in copies of key genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), increases in colonic SCFA levels, and alterations in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of lipids and cholesterol. In this model, we demonstrate the alteration of early life murine metabolic homeostasis through antibiotic manipulation.

DESIGN
C57BL6 mice were divided into low-dose penicillin or control groups. Given antibiotics via drinking water after weaning. Sacrificed and liver sections collected for RNA extraction.
