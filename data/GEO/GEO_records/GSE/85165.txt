TITLE
Identification of PTBPs RNA binding sites in mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PTBP1 and PTBP2 are RNA-binding proteins that control RNA processings, including alternative pre-mRNA splicing. The sequential down-regulation of the two proteins is necessary for neuronal maturation. However, their binding substrates in neural tissues have not been examined.

DESIGN
Use modified version of iCLIP-seq protocols to identify RNA elements crosslinked to either flag-PTBP1 or PTBP2 in vivo in the mouse cerebral cortex.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
