TITLE
Expression data of A375 melanoma cells after DMSO or MLN4924 +/- Nutlin treatment for 26 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine the change in gene expression of genes involved in the p53 pathway after siRNA knock down of p53, CDT1 or BRCA1 A375 cells were grown, transfected with siRNA, incubated for 48hrs, then incubated for another 26hrs in the presence of either 0.065% DMSO as control, 650nM MLN4924, 5uM Nutlin or 100nM Daunorubicin. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix HG-U133Plus 2.0 arrays were performed.

DESIGN
12 conditions in triplicate for a total of 42 samples

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
