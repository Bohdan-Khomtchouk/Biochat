TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for 4 days of waterlogging stress in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To study the transcriptional changes in waterlogging stress 30 day old Arabidopsis plants were subjected to 4 days of waterlogging stress.  We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that behave diferentially to the stress. The information could be used to generate transgenic lines that are resistant to waterlogging stress and can be applied to other closely related species to compromise the crop yeild loss. The transgenic lines contain waterlogging-inducible AP2 family of transcription factor.
