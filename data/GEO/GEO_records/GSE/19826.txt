TITLE
Expression data from gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression between Chinese gastric cancer and its adjacent noncancer tissues and identified some key differential expression genes in cancer. Gene expression profiling is a valuable tool for identifying differentially expressed genes in studies of gastric cancer. However, it remains difficult to assign biological significance to the vast number of genes. There is an increasing awareness of gene expression profile as an important part of the contextual molecular network at play in cancer initiation and progression. The key pathways or genes might be the target for our clinical curement.

DESIGN
This study analysed the transcriptional profiles commonly activated at different stages of gastric cancers using an integrated approach combining gene expression profiling of 12 adjacent normal/tumor-matched gastric tissues to form a gene regulatory coexpression map. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of cancer tissues at each TNM stage in order to increase the accurateness of expression profiles.In addition we performed this test in 3 normal tissues in order to get data for further study.
