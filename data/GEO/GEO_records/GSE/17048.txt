TITLE
Multiple Sclerosis Blood Cell mRNA Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured mRNA expression for all known genes in whole blood from 144 individuals, 99 with MS (43 PPMS, 36 RRMS and 20 SPMS). Analysis of gene expression and genotype in these individuals has indicated the dominant genetic association with T cell regulation is matched by the dominant pattern of dysregulation of T cell gene expression in MS and its clinical subtypes.

DESIGN
Whole blood mRNA expression was compared between different types of MS and age-matched healthy control to identify differentially expressed genes between them. The supplementary file 'GSE17048_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM426595-GSM426738.
