TITLE
Expression analyses of nanos(RNAi) and control(RNAi) Schmidtea mediterranea

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in nanos(RNAi) Schmidtea mediterranea, compared to control animals. nanos(RNAi) animals are devoid of germ cells The samples analyzed in this study are further described in Wang, Y., Stary, JM., Wilhelm, JE. and Newmark, PA. 2010.

DESIGN
A eight chip study using total RNA recovered from asexual nanos(RNAi), asexual control, juvenile sexual nanos(RNAi), and juvenile sexual control animals.  Each chip measures the expression level of 16,797 ESTs from S. mediterranea with 10 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.
