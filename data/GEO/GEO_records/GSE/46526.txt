TITLE
The effects of apigenin on microRNA expression levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The changes of mature microRNA expression levels after apigenin treatment on Huh7 cells were determined.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells were treated with 10microM apigenin for 24hr and the changes of global mature microRNA expression levels were determined.
