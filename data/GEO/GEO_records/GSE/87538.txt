TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of Brucella suis 1330 wild-type and DregA mutant

ORGANISM
Brucella suis 1330

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a B. suis 1330 regA mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. The two-component system RegBA of Brucella suis plays a central role in the control of respiratory systems adapted to oxygen deficiency. The mutant strain  is affected in long-term persistence in  vitro (this study) and in chronic infection in vivo (Abdou, E et al. 2013, Infect.Immun. 81: 2053-61). Using an original “in vitro model of persistence”, we compare large-scale transcriptome of the wild-type and ∆regA strains to identify the RegA-regulon potentially involved in the set-up of the persistence state.

DESIGN
six microarrays were hybridized with (ds)cDNAs prepared from total RNA recovered from three independent cultures of the wild-type and DregA B. suis strains. Each array measures the expression level of 3,271 genes from B. suis 1330 with nineteen 60-mer probes per gene, in three replicates.
