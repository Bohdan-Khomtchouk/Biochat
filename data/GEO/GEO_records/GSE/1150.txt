SUMMARY
In order to identify the genes involved in LIF/gp130 self-renewal response, we analyzed the transcriptome of Gs2 ES cells induced to differentiate upon LIF withdrawal for 16h, 24h and 48h (LIF16, LIF24 and LIF48 respectively)and compared them to that of undifferentiated ES Gs2 cells continuously maintained in the presence of LIF. Since this cell line also carry a tetracycline regulatable dominant negative form of Stat3 (Stat3F, all the experiment was done in the presence of Tetracycline (tet ON) to avoid Stat3F expression. Keywords: time-course
