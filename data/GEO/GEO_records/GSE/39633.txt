TITLE
Chitin oligosaccharide-responsive genes in suspension-cultured rice cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a molecular pattern for the recognition of potential pathogens in the innate immune systems of both plants and animals. In plants, chitin oligosaccharides have been known to induce various defense responses in a wide range of plant cells including both monocots and dicots. We identified chitine oligosaccharide-responsive genes in suspension-cultured rice cells 1-12 h after treatment using rice 44k microarray.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharide for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h was compared with that in untreated control using two-color method with two biological replicates.
