TITLE
Comparison of Control and Tim-Fbl gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes affected in our model of PANK defficiency we profiled fly heads of female flies control or expressing fumble RNAi by the use of the tim-gal4 driver

DESIGN
Female fly heads of the indicated strains were collected at 2 different circadian timepoints, RNA extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1322 [Drosophila_2] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array
