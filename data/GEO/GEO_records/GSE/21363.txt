TITLE
Gene expression during SMC cord morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SMCs must undergo specialzed patterning during blood vessel stabilization. We used microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes as smooth muscle cells were induced to assemble into a network of elongated cords.

DESIGN
Two time points (Day 0 and Day 8) and three biological replicates for each, using Affymetrix HGU133A and HGU133B arrays for each sample.
