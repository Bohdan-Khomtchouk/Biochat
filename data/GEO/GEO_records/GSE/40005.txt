TITLE
Genome-wide methylation profile of head and neck squamous cell carcioma (HNSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and HNSCC blood samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in serum samples. Samples included 12 cancer-free healthy controls, and 12 HNSCC cases.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 24 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
