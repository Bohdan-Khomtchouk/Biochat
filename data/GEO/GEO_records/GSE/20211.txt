ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[original title] LMP-420: a novel purine nucleoside analogue with potent cytotoxic effects for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and minimal toxicity for normal hematopoietic cells. LMP-420 induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis to CLL cells in vitro without any negative effects to normal immune cells. This gene expression experiment compares CLL cells treated with LMP-420 versus media alone to investigate the mechanism of action of LMP-420.

DESIGN
CLL cells from 13 patients were treated with LMP-420 or media for 24 hours, then RNA was extracted and assayed on U133Plus2 GeneChips.
