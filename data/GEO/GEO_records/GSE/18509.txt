TITLE
miR-193b represses cell proliferation and regulates cyclin D1 in melanoma: benign nevi and metastatic melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cutaneous melanoma is an increasingly common form of skin cancer. The molecular mechanisms regulating melanoma progression are not completely understood. We speculated that specific miRNAs may be involved in melanoma development. We compared the miRNA expression profiles of benign nevi and metastatic melanomas. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated a distinct miRNA expression pattern in metastatic melanomas compared to nevi. We identified miRNAs that were differentially expressed in melanoma. Notably, miR-193b was significantly down-regulated in the melanoma tissue examined. Using functional studies we demonstrated that over-expression of miR-193b significantly reduced melanoma cell proliferation, and arrested cell at G1 phase. Further gene expression analysis revealed that miR-193b regulated targets involved in cell cycle. Cyclin D1 was down-regulated by miR-193b at both  the mRNA and protein level. This is the first study to show that the miR-193b may reduce cell proliferation by directly repressing cyclin D1. Overall, our study suggests that miRNAs are dysregulated in metastatic melanoma, and that miR-193b may play an important role in melanoma.

DESIGN
8 benign nevi and 8 metastatic melanoma tissue samples were profiled by Agilent MicroRNA Microarray (V1.5).
