TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae histone H2A mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The N-terminal tail of histone H2A shows evolutionary changes that parallel genome size and aid chromatin compaction. As genome size increases, so does the number of arginines. In contrast, serines corellate with small genomes. Examples for such changes are arginine in position 11 and serine in position 15. To test if these residues affect mRNA levels, we analysed gene expression profiles of S.cerevisiae strains containing either WT or mutant H2A.

DESIGN
Yeast strains have endogenous histone H2A genes deleted and express plasmid born WT or mutant H2A. PolyA RNA of these strains was analyzed by single channel microarray hybridization. Three WT biological replicates provide the control. Two biological  replicates of each of the mutants containing either R11, K11, carrying a deletion in S15 and the double mutant carrying both the deletion of S15 and an insertion of R11 are analysed.
