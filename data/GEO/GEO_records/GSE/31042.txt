TITLE
Expression data of mouse hematopoietic cells, Nr4a1/3 wild type and double mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor suppression by NR4A1 and NR4A3, and show a cell intrinsic essential function in maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. In the absence of Nr4a1/3, HSC lost quiescence, became highly proliferative leukemia-stem cell (LSC) that transplanted AML to recipient mice. We further revealed that loss of NR4A1/3 leads to deregulated expression of the key cell cycle regulator Cdkn1c (P57), c-Myc oncogene, and glucose metabolic genes leading to enhanced aerobic glycolysis or ‘Warburg effect’ in LSCs. Reintroduction of Nr4a1 in LSCs restored HSC quiescence, and reversed Nr4a1/3 deficiency induced P57 suppression and c-Myc overexpression. Collectively, we identify an essential role of Nr4a1/3 in coordinately regulating cell cycle entry and glucose metabolism to prevent uncontrolled stem cell proliferation and AML transformation. These results have major implications for designing therapeutic strategies in AML.

DESIGN
To identify NR4A-dependent molecular signaling pathways that may control HSC homeostasis, we performed genome-wide transcript profiling of Lin-Sca1+ (LS) cells from WT and DKO mice. For Affymetrix analysis, we generated three independent pools of RNA from sorted LS cells from 10-20 WT or DKO (2- to 3-week-old) mice per sample.
