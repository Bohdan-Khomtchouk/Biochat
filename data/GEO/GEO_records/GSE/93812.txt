TITLE
LuCaP prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts reflect the molecular heterogeneity of advanced disease and serve as models for evaluating cancer therapeutics [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to advance our understanding of prostate cancer biology and identify new effective treatments we have established and characterized multiple advanced prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts that mimic well the disease in patients.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile 24 early and late passage LuCaP PCa xenograft lines. RNA was amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines. Custom Agilent 415K whole human CGH microarrays were used to profile 33 LuCaP PCa xenograft lines.  Genomic DNA from tumors was hybridized against a pool of reference normal male DNA.
