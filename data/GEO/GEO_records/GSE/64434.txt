TITLE
Rescue of CD8+ T cell vaccine memory in mice following sublethal g radiation exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In two disparate models, we show that rapid revaccination following sublethal gamma radiation exposure rescues memory CD8+ T cell Responses.

DESIGN
To investigate the mechanism of rescue we performed RNA microarray analyses to identify whether there was a genetic “signature” of rescue.  mRNA was obtained from whole spleens 6 hrs after revaccination with LM-DActA at D1 and D4 PI for RNA microarray analysis
