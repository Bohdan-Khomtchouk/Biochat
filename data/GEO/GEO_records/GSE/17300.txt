TITLE
Overexpression of USF1 in HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of USF1 in HEK293T cells in vitro to ascertain the genes downstream of USF1. Will identify direct targets as well as indirect targets of USF1. Keywords: Overexpression of transcription factor to determine downstream targets.

DESIGN
Cloned USF1 from cDNA and transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. Total RNA collected 48 hours after transfection. Empty vector used as control. Expression of USF1 was validated using western blot, and qRT-PCR was used to validate differential expression.
