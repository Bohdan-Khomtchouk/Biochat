TITLE
TCAB1ï¼šA Potential Target for Diagnosis and Therapy in Head and Neck Cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies indicated TCAB1, also known as WRAP53, had oncogenic feature in a certain extend. However, there is none direct study on the function of TCAB1 in tumorigenesis and development of head and neck cancers. First of all, we verified the function of TCAB1 in head and neck cancers. Knockdown TCAB1 would inhibit cell proliferation in Vitro as well as in Vivo, meanwhile, depletion TCAB1 would decrease the invasion potential of OSCC Cal-27 cells. cDNA microarray analysis showed many pathways and factors associated with occurrence and development of carcinomas were implicated in this process. Our study indicated TCAB1 might be a potential target for prognosis and therapy in head and neck cancers.

DESIGN
Immunohistochemistry assay and western blot showed TCAB1 was overexpressed in clinical nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head and neck cell lines. Depletion endogenous TCAB1 by shRNA lentivirus in Cal-27 would verify the function of TCAB1 in cells proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, cDNA microarray was performed to detect some pathways or factors involved in the process.
