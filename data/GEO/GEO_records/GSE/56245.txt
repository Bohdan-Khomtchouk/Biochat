TITLE
Effect of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea ployphenol, on estrogen regulated genes in breast cancer cell line MCF7.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major green tea polyphenol, has been a subject of global interest as a potential chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic supplement for breast cancer. While on one hand epidemiological studies suggest inverse correlation between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk, investigations using cell culture and animal models of breast carcinogenesis on the other hand have demonstrated antiproliferative, antitumor, anti-invasive and anti-metastatic properties of EGCG. Mechanism of how EGCG affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and cell cycle by affecting the function of a wide range of molecular targets have also been studied. However, the question as to how EGCG impacts on estrogen responsive genes has not been addressed. This issue is of relevance to our notion of EGCG as a potential chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer, which is estrogen dependent in majority of the newly diagnosed cases. Here, using the estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells as a model, we have examined the effect of EGCG on the estrogen regulated genes.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with vehicle (Ethanol) or EGCG in the presence or absence of estrogen for 24hrs. Total RNA was extracted; Cy3 labeled cRNA was hybridized to Genotypic Technology designed Custom Human Whole Genome 8x60k Microarray (Agilent-027114). Median signal intensities were used for the analysis. After background subtraction (normexp) and normalization (quantile) differentially expressed genes were identified using linear models.
