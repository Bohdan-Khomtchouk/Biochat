TITLE
Recurrent alterations of TNFAIP3 (A20) in T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a novel recurrent genetic lesion in T-LGL. Mutations of the tumour suppressor gene TNFAIP3 causing amino-acid exchanges or protein truncations were seen in 3/39 cases (8%).

DESIGN
RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2500) of 5 index patients with paired tumor and non-tumor samples.
