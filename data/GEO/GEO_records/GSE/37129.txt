TITLE
mTOR inhibitors synergistically induce regression, reversal of gene expression and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mTOR-allosteric inhibitor, RAD001, in combination with a PI3K/mTOR ATP-site competitive inhibitor, BEZ235, causes gene reprogramming, autophagy and tumor regression, in a mouse model approximating human HCC with poor prognosis, leading to an investigator Phase 1B-2 clinical trial.

DESIGN
Comparative study of total RNA obtained from normal and tumor liver tissue under RAD001, BEZ235, or RAD001 + BEZ235.
