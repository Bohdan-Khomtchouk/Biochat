TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq of mouse cerebral cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have applied a recently developed, highly accurate and sensitive single-cell RNA-seq method (STRT/C1) to perform a molecular census of two regions of the mouse cerebral cortex: the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus CA1.

DESIGN
We isolated cells fresh from somatosensory cortex (S1) and hippocampus CA1 area of juvenile (P22 - P32) CD1 mice, 33 males and 34 females. Cells were collected without selection, except that 116 cells were obtained by FACS from 5HT3a-BACEGFP transgenic mice. A total of 76 Fluidigm C1 runs were performed, each attempting 96 cell captures and resulting in 3005 high-quality single-cell cDNAs, containing Unique Molecular Identifiers allowing counting of individual mRNA molecules, even after PCR amplification.
