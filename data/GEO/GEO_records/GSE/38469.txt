TITLE
RpfF-dependent regulon of Xylella fastidiosa

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c

SUMMARY
Xylella fastidiosa regulates traits important to both virulence of grape as well as colonization of sharpshooter vectors via its production of a fatty acid signal molecule known as DSF whose production is dependent on rpfF.  While X. fastidiosa rpfF mutants exhibit increased virulence to plants they are unable to be spread from plant to plant by insect vectors.  To gain more insight into the traits that contribute to these processes, a DNA microarray for this species was designed and utilized to determine the RpfF-dependent regulon by transcriptional profiling.  A total of 447 genes whose expression was significantly different between the wild type and an rpfF mutant (FDR < 0.05) were identified when cells were grown in PW liquid medium. Among them, 165 genes were down-regulated in the rpfF mutant compared to the wild type strain whereas 282 genes were over-expressed.  RpfF function was required for regulation of eleven regulatory and sigma factors including rpfE, yybA, PD1177, glnB, rpfG, PD0954, PD0199, PD2050, colR, rpoH, and rpoD.  In general, RpfF is required for regulation of genes involved in attachment and biofilm formation, enhancing expression of hemagglutinin genes hxfA and hxfB and suppressing most type IV pili and gum genes.  A large number of other RpfF-dependent genes that might contribute to virulence or insect colonization were also identified such as those encoding hemolysin, colicin V, as well as genes with unknown functions.
