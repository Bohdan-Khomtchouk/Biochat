TITLE
Gene expression in early phases of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Little is known about the genes involved in the initial cyst formation and disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). To uncover the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms of ADPKD, we analyzed 4-point time-series DNA microarrays from Pkd1L3/L3 mice to generate high-resolution gene expression profiles at different stages of disease progression. We found different characteristic gene expression signatures in the kidneys of Pkd1L3/L3 mice compared to age-matched controls during the initial phase of the disease. By postnatal week 1, the Pkd1L3/L3 kidney already had a distinctive gene expression pattern considerably different from the corresponding normal controls.  The genes differentially expressed, either induced or repressed, in ADPKD are important in immune defense, cell structure and motility, cellular proliferation, apoptosis and metabolic processes, and include members of three pathways (Wnt, Notch, and BMP) involved in morphogenetic signaling. Further analysis of the gene expression profiles from the early stage of cystogenesis to end stage disease identified a possible gene network involved in the pathogenesis of  ADPKD.

DESIGN
A total of 13 microarray data sets were generated with RNA samples from age-matched control and disease littermates at the four time points, with at least three biological replicates for each time point (PNW1, n = 3; PNW2, n = 4; PNW3, n = 3; PNW3.5, n = 3). 13 2-color experiments including: 3 replicates of: Wt mice vs. Pkd1L3/L3 mice at PNW 1 4 replicates of: Wt mice vs. Pkd1L3/L3 mice at PNW 2 3 replicates of: Wt mice vs. Pkd1L3/L3 mice at PNW 3 3 replicates of: Wt mice vs. Pkd1L3/L3 mice at PNW 3.5
