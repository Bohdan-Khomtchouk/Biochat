TITLE
Radiation Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis as a Model of Progressive Fibrosis: Contributions of DNA Damage, Inflammatory Response and Cellular Senescence Genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Utilizing an established model of Radiation Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis, low input RNA sequencing was performed on whole lung cell suspensions obtained from 12.5 Gy thorax only radiation treated C57BL/6J mice and compareed to 0 Gy (Sham irradiation) age matched controls

DESIGN
Differential expression of gene transcripts identified in pooled samples of RNA obtained from 3 mice per time point and un-irradiated controls were examined at 24 hrs, 1, 4, 12, and 32 weeks post radition treatment  during the onset and progression of pulmonary fibrosis which were then compared to genes identified in literature as bieng associated with DNA damage, inflammatory response, cellular senescence and pulmonary fibrosis
