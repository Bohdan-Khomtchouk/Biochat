TITLE
Transcriptional reprogramming of engineered cellobiose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to cellobiose revealed by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot metabolize cellobiose in nature. Here, S. cerevisiae was engineered to achieve cellobiose utilization by introducing both a cellodextrin transporter gene (cdt-1) and an intracellular Î²-glucosidase gene (gh1-1) from Neurospora crassa. We sequenced mRNA from anaerobic exponential cultures of engineered S. cerevisiae grown on cellobiose or glucose as a single carbon source in biological triplicate. Differences in gene expression between cellobiose and glucose metabolism revealed by RNA deep sequencing indicated that cellobiose metabolism induced mitochondrial activation and reduced amino acid biosynthesis under fermentation conditions.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in cellobiose-grown and glucose-grown cells of engineered cellobiose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Genome Analyzer-II. We sequenced 3 samples from cellobiose-grown cells and 3 samples from glucose-grown cells and identified differential expressions in the cellobiose versus glucose fermentations by using mRNA levels of glucose-grown cells as a reference.
