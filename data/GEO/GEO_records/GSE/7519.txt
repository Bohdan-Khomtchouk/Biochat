TITLE
Vibrio cholerae: Wild type El Tor biotype versus crp mutant

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of an El Tor biotype crp mutant The virulent V. cholerae El Tor Ogawa strain C7258 (Peru isolate 1991) and an isogenic deletion mutant (WL7258) lacking DNA sequences encoding the cAMP receptor protein were grown in LB medium to optical density at 600 nm of 1.5. The cultures were chilled in ice, cells quickly collected by centrifugation and total RNA imediately extracted. RNAwas extracted and purified using the Trizol plus RNA purification system (Invitrogen) followed RNEasy miniElute cleanup (Qiagen). RNA samples were conserved at - 80 C and used within a week. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
4 replicates

PLATFORM
GPL5085 TIGR PFGRC Vibrio cholerae 19K v2 array designed primarily based on strain El Tor N16961 (condensed table)
