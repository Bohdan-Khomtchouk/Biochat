TITLE
ERK Oscillation-Dependent Gene Expression Patterns and Deregulation By The Stress-Response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies were undertaken to determine whether oscillatory behavior in the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway results in unique gene regulation patterns.  Microarray analysis was performed on three subcloned populations of human keratinocytes with distinct ERK signaling/oscillation phenotypes. Microarray analysis identified 45 genes that overlapped between 2 subclones with oscillation phenotypes but not in the subclone which is non-oscillatory.  Transcription factor networks revealed a role for MED1 in mediating ERK oscillation-dependent gene expression, which was confirmed with Western blot analysis.  Further experimentation confirmed a role for p38 in the mediation of MED1 phosphorylation and ERK oscillatory behavior.

DESIGN
hTERT-immortalized normal human keratinocytes (provided by Dr. Jerry Shay, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) were stably transfected with ERK1-green fluorescent protein chimera and stable subclones were isolated with distinct ERK activation/oscillation patterns: Clone #1 exhibits transient ERK activation with ligand activation but does not oscillate; Clone #2 exhibits persistent ERK oscillations that are dependent on ligand activation; and Clone #3 exhibits spontaneous ERK oscillations in the absence of ligand activation.
