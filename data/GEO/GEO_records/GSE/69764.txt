TITLE
Identification of the gene expression in IPF lung fibroblasts after demethylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease. Although the pathogenesis is poorly understood, evidence suggests that genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may play a key role. We used microarrays to see the gene expression in IPF fibroblasts after demethylation agent 5'-azacytidine treatment.

DESIGN
Human IPF lung fibroblasts were cultured and then treated with 5'-azacytidine 5uM 24 hours. RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
