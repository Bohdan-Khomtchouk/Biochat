TITLE
Biological function of antisense RNAs that are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases under rehydration

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNA loci under 2hr drought stress and 2hr rehydration, expression profiles of Poly (A+) RNA between rdr1/2/6 and wild-type using the custom microarray (GPL19830) were analyzed.

DESIGN
rdr1/2/6 and wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on MS medium for 2 weeks. Then, the plants were transferred to plastic dish and kept for 2hr. Poly (A+) RNA  from 100Î¼g total RNA by treating with Ambion Poly A purist twice.5 ng of Poly (A+) RNA were used for the expresion profiling using the custom array (GPL19830).

PLATFORM
GPL19830 Agilent-034592 Arabidopsis thaliana PSC_Custom
