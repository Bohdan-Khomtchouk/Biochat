SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of methylated or nonmethylated miRNA oligonucleotides transfected DICER exon 5-disrupted RKO cells.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of RNA modification on microRNAs, we transfected artificially synthesized nonmethylated or methylated oligonucleotides to a colorectal cancer cell line.
