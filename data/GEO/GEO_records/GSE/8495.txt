TITLE
Expression profiling of the solute carrier gene family in the chicken intestine

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Intestinal development during late embryogenesis and early posthatch has a long term influence on digestive and absorptive capacity in chickens.  The objective of this research was to obtain a global view of intestinal gene expression from late embryogenesis until 2 weeks posthatch with a focus on genes involved in nutrient uptake. Keywords: developmental time course

DESIGN
Small intestine from male chicks from two different lines(A and B) were collected on embryonic days 18 (e18) and 20 (e20), day of hatch, and days 1, 3, 7, and 14 posthatch. There are two sample pools designed for lines and different times.
