TITLE
Data expression in alveolar macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rationale: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is ubiquitous in the environment. Inhalation of LPS has been implicated in the pathogenesis and/or severity of several lung diseases, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Alveolar macrophages are the main resident leukocytes exposed to inhaled antigens.   Objectives: To obtain insight into which innate immune pathways become activated within human alveolar macrophages upon exposure to LPS in vivo.

DESIGN
In seven healthy humans sterile saline was instilled into a lung segment by bronchoscope, followed by instillation of LPS into the contralateral lung. Six hours later a bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and whole-genome transcriptional profiling was done (Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0) on purified alveolar macrophages, comparing cells exposed to saline or LPS from the same individuals.
