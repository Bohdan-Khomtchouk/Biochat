TITLE
Identification of the phosphotransacetylase (pta) and acetate kinase (ackA) regulons in Streptococcus mutans UA159

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional comparisons between wild-type Streptococcus mutans UA159 and two mutant strains (∆ackA and ∆ackA pta).

DESIGN
On growth condition in defined FMC medium, WT vs. either ∆ackA or ∆ackA pta mutants. Biological replicates: 10 control, 5 each mutant, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL15711 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 13K v3 array designed primarily based on strain UA159 [ORF version]
