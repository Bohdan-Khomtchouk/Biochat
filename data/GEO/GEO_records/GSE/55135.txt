TITLE
Gene expression patterns induced by a transient switch-on of ROS production in mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression signatures induced by transient ROS production were characterized in both mouse back skin and tail epidermis samples. A transient in situ ROS production in the tissue was activated by an adapted photodynamic treatment, using methyl aminolevulinate as a metabolic precursor of endogenous Protoporphyrin IX.

DESIGN
Gene expression in skin samples was measured 48 h after the photodynamic treatment. Experimental groups included: [1] Back skin control group (n=3 animals); [2] Back skin treated group (n=3 animals); [3] Tail skin control group (n=3 animals); and [4] Tail skin treated group (n=3 animals).
