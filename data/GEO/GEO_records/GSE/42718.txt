TITLE
miRNA microarray of mouse renal tubular cell with or without TGFbeta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find miRNAs that involve in renal epithelial-mesenchyal transition induced by TGFbeta

DESIGN
Mouse renal tubular cell, MCT (derived from SJL H-2S mice) was stimulated by TGFbeta 3ng/ml for 72 hours. miRNA expressions were compared with control.
