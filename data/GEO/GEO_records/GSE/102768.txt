TITLE
Effect of CBL0137 on gene expression in mouse cells and tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed changes in abundance of RNAs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from wild type and p53 knockout mice and in lungs of NIH Swiss mice upon treatment with 1microM (cells) or 60mg/kg IV (mice) of curaxin CBL0137 for 24 hours. CBL0137 is chromatin destabilizing agent.

DESIGN
MEF were from C57BL/6J mice (wild type) or Trp53tm1Tyj (p53-/-) mice. Mice were male NIH Swiss, 7 weeks old. CBL0137 was dissolved in DMSO for in vitro experiment and in 5% dextrose for in vivo. Control cells were untreated, control mice received IV injection of 5% dextrose. Two replicates of wild type and one replicate of p53 knockout MEFs were used. Two mice per group were used. All treatments were for 24 hours. In vitro - 1microM of CBL0137 were used, in vivo - 60mg/kg.
