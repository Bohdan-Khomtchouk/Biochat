TITLE
Comparative DNA Methylation analysis reveals genes regulating adipogenesis in Laiwu pigs over two developmental stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We performed DNA methylation analysis of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle between two development stages (120 and 240 days after birth) in Laiwu pigs, an indigenous fatty pig breed in North China. This study provides a reference for exploring methylation regulation mechanisms affecting fat deposition in obese pigs.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA Methylation variation of different development stages in Laiwu pig.

PLATFORM
GPL22918 HiSeq X Ten (Sus scrofa)
