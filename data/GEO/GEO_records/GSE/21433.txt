TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the T. thermophilus HB8 response to diamide

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 10 min after the addition of 10 mM diamide.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 4 mL of systhetic medium. The cells (2 mL) were inoculated into 250 mL of the same medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C for 8 hours (A600 value being ~0.34). Then the 10 mM of diamide was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 0 and 10 min time point after the addition of diamide, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip.
