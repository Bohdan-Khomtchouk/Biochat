TITLE
Expression data from unactivated vs. activated PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long-lasting activation of T cells requires up-regulation of many genes, for example of transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and cell surface proteins encluding ion channels. An increase of ion channel density at the cell surface reflects the needs to manage increased Ca2+ influx into the activated T cell. Using oligonucleotide-based arrays we have surveyed changes in ion channel mRNA expression that occur upon T cell activation. We used Affymetrix Analysis to confirmate our data achieved by self-designed glass array analysis.

DESIGN
We isolated PBMCs from blood of healthy donors and divided those into two parts. One was activated for 72 hr by adding PHA-L whereas the other part was incubated in the same way but not stimulated.
