TITLE
Targets of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 2-mediated tumor growth regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway has been implicated in mediating cell growth and transformation, its downstream effectors remain to be identified. Using JNK2 antisense oligonucleotides (JNK2AS), we uncovered previously a role for JNK2 in regulating cell cycle progression and survival of human PC3 prostate carcinoma cells. Here, to identify genes involved in implementing JNK2-mediated effects, we have analyzed global gene expression changes in JNK2-deprived PC3 cells using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression. More than 40,000 tags each were generated from control and PC3-JNK2AS libraries, corresponding to 15,999 and 20,698 unique transcripts, respectively. Transcripts corresponding to transcription factors, stress-induced genes, and apoptosis-related genes were up-regulated in the PC3-JNK2AS library, revealing a significant stress response after the inhibition of JNK2 expression. Genes involved in DNA repair, mRNA turnover, and drug resistance were found to be down-regulated by inhibition of JNK2 expression, further highlighting the importance of JNK2 signaling in regulating cell homeostasis and tumor cell growth.
