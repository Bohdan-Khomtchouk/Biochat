TITLE
mRNA expression profiling in mouse bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA and mRNA profiling in BASC cells and c-Myc depleted BASC cells. We built potential miRNA-mRNA interaction networks specific to c-Myc regulation in BASCs

DESIGN
Replicated profilling for both BASC cells and c-Myc depleted BASC cells.
