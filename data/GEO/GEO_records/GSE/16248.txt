TITLE
Preliminary exploration of Oryza sativa small RNAs - Run 1 and 2

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The small RNAs presented here were produced as a preliminary exploration of small RNAs in rice, and as such, various tissues and stress conditions were sampled.  Small RNAs present in these samples were all mapped to the rice genome TIGR version 5.  The total number of distinct mapped sequences are 12879 for Run 1 and 88508 for Run 2.  The total number of sequence reads were respectively 70406 and 191682. The datasets contain Oryza sativa var Nipponbar endogenous small RNA sequences in the size range 18 to 34 nt. Plants were grown in a Conviron Environmental Chamber at high light intensity using both high pressure sodium and metal halide lamps for 10.5 hr at 28 degrees C and for 13.5 hr at 26 degrees C in the dark. RNA was extracted from rice tissues at various stages of development and under different abiotic and biotic stresses. The small RNAs presented here were all mapped to the rice genome TIGR version 5. The total number of distinct mapped sequences are 12879 for Run 1 and 88508 for Run 2.  The total number of sequence reads were respectively 70406 and 191682.

DESIGN
Run 1: A small RNA library was generated from whole cell RNA isolated from inflorescence, 30 and 60 day leaves, 10 and 25 day seedlings and from seedling polysomes using Bartel primers (5' ATCGTAGGCACCTGAAA - smRNA - CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT 3').  This was combined with a library derived from whole cell RNA isolated from 30 and 60 day leaves and 10 and 25 day seedlings using Bartel A primers (5' AGCTATCGTAGGCACCTGAAA - smRNA - CTGTAGGCACCATCAATACTG 3'). Run 2: Mixed tissues from unstressed plants. Library prepared from equal amounts of adult root, adult stem and inflorescence from unstressed plants. Amplified with Standard primers (5' ATCGTAGGCACCTGAAA - smRNA - CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT 3').     Seedlings stressed by cold, salt desiccation, heat and dark. Tissues were mixed in a 2:2:1:1:1:1 ratio.  Amplified with A primers (5' AGCTATCGTAGGCACCTGAAA - smRNA - CTGTAGGCACCATCAATACTG 3').     Kinase library. RNA was isolated from tissues used in 'Adult whole plant' (~30%), 'Stressed' (~25%), from unstressed seedlings of various ages (~15%) from 30 and 60 day leaves (20%) and from immature inflorescence (~10%).  RNA isolated from tissues from unstressed plants were treated with polynucleotide kinase before second ligation.  This eliminates the dependence of a 5` phosphate as for all the other libraries.  Amplified with B primers (5' CAGTATCGTAGGCACCTGAAA - smRNA - CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGCT 3').
