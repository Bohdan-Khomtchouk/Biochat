TITLE
GRO-seq in human CD34+ erythrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: GRO-seq is a robust method to examine the nascent RNA transcriptome in the genome level Methods: The GRO-seq measures the trancription of nascent RNAs in the genome. From human CD34+ erythrocytes treated with veichle or T4 we conducted GRO-seq to examine the transcripome.

DESIGN
Analysis of nascent RNA with GRO-seq in human CD34+ derived erythroblasts  treated for 6 hrs with 1 Î¼M GC-1 or with vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
