TITLE
Comparative transcriptional analysis of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 grown under various syntrophic and fermentative conditions on pyruvate relative to respiratory growth

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20

SUMMARY
Pyruvate fermentation pathway and energetics of Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 under syntrophic coculture and fermentative monoculture conditions Expression data for Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 grown in chemostats on pyruvate under respiratory conditions (sulfate-limited and pyruvate-limited monoculture, dilution rate 0.047 and 0.027 h-1), fermentative conditions (monoculture, dilution rate 0.036 h-1), and syntrophic conditions (coculture with Methanococcus maripaludis or Methanospirillum hungatei, dilution rate of 0.047 and 0.027 h-1)

DESIGN
2 replicates each for syntrophic coculture (M. maripaludis or M. hungatei pairing) and respiratory (sulfate- or pyruvate-limited) monoculture for both growth rates (0.027 and 0.047 h-1), and 4 replicates fermentative monoculture (gas flow rate through head space of bioreactor 10 ml/min (chemostats C91 and C93) or 1 ml/min (chemostats C92 and C94)
