TITLE
Jmjd1a / Jmjd2c RNAi expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression effects of silencing Jmjd1a and Jmjd2c genes We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after silencing Jmjd1a gene and Jmjd2c gene separately Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
three biological replicates each for Jmjd1a and Jmjd2c RNAi transcript levels were compared with six biological replicated of LUC RNAi
