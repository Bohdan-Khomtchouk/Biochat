TITLE
Ketogulonigenium vulgare cells: co-culture mode vs. mono-culture mode

ORGANISM
Bacillus megaterium ; Ketogulonicigenium vulgare WSH-001

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of K. vulgare cells co-cultured with Bacillus megaterium compared to K. vulgare mono-cultured cells. Differentially expressed genes in co-cultured and mono-cultured K. vulgare cells were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the mechanisms of B. megaterium stimulating K. vulgare propagation on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: co-cultured K. vulgare and B. megaterium cells vs. mono-cultured K. vulgare cells. Biological replicates: 3 co-cultured replicates, 3 mono-cultured replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL14693 Agilent_028085 Ketogulonigenium vulgare custom microarray [Probe Name version]
