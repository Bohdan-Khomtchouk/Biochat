TITLE
miRNA data in colon mucosa samples from individuals with ulcerative colitis and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide miRNA profiling of ulcerative colitis, and normal colon mucosa samples. The GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array was used to obtain miRNA profiles across colon mucosa samples. Samples came from 5 ulcerative colitis affected, and 5 normal individuals.

DESIGN
miRNA from the 10 samples were hybridized to the GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
