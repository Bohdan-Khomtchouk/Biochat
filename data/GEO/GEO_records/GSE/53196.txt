TITLE
Expression data from drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires a more complete understanding of the immunological consequences of long-term exposure to the conditions of spaceflight. To understand these consequences better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model to compare innate immune responses to bacteria and fungi in flies that were either raised on earth or in outer space aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-121). Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression that occur in response to infection by bacteria and fungus in drosophila that were either hatched and raised in outer space (microgravity) or on earth (normal gravity).

DESIGN
Whole Oregon R strain drosophila melanogaster fruit flies either raised on earth or in space that were (1) uninfected, (2) infected with bacteria (Escherichia coli), or (3) infected with fungus (Beauveria bassiana) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
