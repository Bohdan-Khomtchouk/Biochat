TITLE
Gene expression profiles of S. cerevisiae under acetic acid stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genes whose expression correlated to the acetic acid tolerance in S. cerevisiae were identified by DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of two S. cerevisiae strains showing different levels of acetic acid tolerance were compared and an acetic acid tolerance-related gene chosen.
