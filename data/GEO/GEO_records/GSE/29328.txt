TITLE
Expression data from squamous cell carcinoma stem cells, epidermal progenitor cells and hair follicle bulge stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess the global gene expression profiles of cancer stem cells which were isolated from cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas which developed when WT, TGF beta receptor II ko, FAK KO, and TGF beta receptor II/FAK double KO were subjected to continuous DMBA treatment. Squamous cell carcinoma stem cells were compared to epidermal progenitor cells (CD49fhighCD34low) and hair follicle bulge stem cells (CD49fhighCD34high).

DESIGN
Squamous cell carcinoma was initiated by continuous DMBA treatment (complete carcinogenesis). Cancer cells were sorted based on high CD29 and CD49f expression, infected with a retrovirus expressing a triple modality reporter (luciferase, RFP, thymidine kinase) and grafted onto nude recipient mice. RFP positive lineage was separated into CD29 high, CD49f high and CD34 low; or CD29high, CD49f high and CD34high squamous cell carcinoma initiating cells.
