TITLE
Expression data from short-term mouse embryonic stem cell exposure Assay

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vitro prediction of developmental toxicity during early discovery phases of drug development has the potential to guide decision-making toward prioritizing candidate drugs that are less likely to later show teratogenicity in vivo. Such screening would reduce animal use in preclinical studies, including full-scale regulatory reproductive toxicology. we evaluate an assay format based on short-term toxicogenomic responses in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC). We exposed attached undifferentiated cells of the mouse ESC cell line R1 for 6h to 10 known teratogenic and 9 non-teratogenic pharmaceutical drugs . We used microarry to access genome-wide gene expression response and identify gene signatures to classify teratogens and non-teratogens.

DESIGN
In total sixty samples treated by 20 compounds (including one solvent compound, 10 teratogen compounds and 9 non-teratogen compounds and triplicates for each)  are performed by microarray expriment,
