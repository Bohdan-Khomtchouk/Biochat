TITLE
Expression data from Rb family deficient Cd150+ HSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Rb family in HSC results in their sustained proliferation, impaired homeostasis and extramedullar mobility.

DESIGN
We have isolated KLS CD48- CD150+ HSC from wild-type (WT) and Rb family deficient HSC two weeks after the acute inactivation of Rb family genes. Each sample is composed by a pool of 3 mice.
