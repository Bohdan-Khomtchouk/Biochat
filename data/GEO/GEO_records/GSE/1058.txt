TITLE
Reduced atherosclerosis in MyD88 null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This series represents a comparison of gene expression in mouse aorta from MyD88-/-, apoE-/- mice versus apoE-/- control mice fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks, causing atherosclerotic lesion development. 5 MyD88-/-, apoE-/- mice were compared to 5 apoE-/- control mice and dye swap replicated for a total of 10 replicate microarrays. Keywords = Mus musculus Keywords = aorta Keywords = atherosclerosis Keywords = MyD88 Keywords: other
