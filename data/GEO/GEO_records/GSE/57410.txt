TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile in CHME3 cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHME3 cells grown on six-wells were infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (P20778 strain), and total RNA was isolated from cells at 6, 24 and 48 h of post infection. MicroRNA expression was significantly altered in JEV-infected human microglial cells. A time-dependent change in microRNA profile was noted. Bioinformatics analysis identified anti-correlation between differentially expressed miRNAs and the gene expression at different time point which ultimately affected several signalling pathways in microglia cells. Brain-enriched microRNAs and a set of microRNA previously designated as NeurimmiRs were also differentially expressed in response to JEV infection.

DESIGN
CHME3 cells grown on 6-well plate. Three replicates of uninfected and JEV-infected samples at each time point (6, 24 and 48 h of post infection) were used for microRNA array.
