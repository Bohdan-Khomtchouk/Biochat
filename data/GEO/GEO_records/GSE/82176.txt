TITLE
Human liver HELP-tagging cytosine methylation data corresponding to uninfected non-malignant, HCV+ non-malignant, and HCV+ HCC tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify epigenetic regulators of transcription that may be involved in the development and the progression of HCV-associated HCC.  Using HELP-tagging, we performed the highest resolution DNA methylation profiling of HCV-associated HCC to date, testing ~2 million loci throughout the human genome in liver biopsies from 30 patients, identifying changes starting in infected liver and maintained through carcinogenesis.  We identified loci at which DNA methylation is consistently altered, beginning earlier in the course of neoplastic disease and progressing with disease advancement.

DESIGN
HELP-tagging for 11 uninfected, 10 non-neoplastic infected and 9 HCV infected HCC samples

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
