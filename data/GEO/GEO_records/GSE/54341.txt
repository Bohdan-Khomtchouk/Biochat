TITLE
Expression analysis of OSK and Sall4+OSK reprogramming cells sorted for expression of miR-290 and/or miR-302.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEFs were infected with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 (+/- Sall4), sorted for miR-290/302 reporter expression at day 9 (OSK) or 12 (Sall4+OSK), and then profiled. Resulting iPSCs were also profiled. Mouse ES cells were differentiated and sorted for miR-290/302 reporter expression during Fgf/Activin differentiation (day 4 or day 7).

DESIGN
Performed in biological triplicate. Biological triplicate samples represent three independent lines. Total RNA collected with Trizol. All processing conducted at the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core. MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
