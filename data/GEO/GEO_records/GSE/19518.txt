TITLE
Microarray analysis of CA-AhR transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated transgenic mice expressing constitutively activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (CA-AhR) to examine the biological consequences of AhR activation.. We used microarrays  to identify genes that are regulated by AhR.

DESIGN
Livers or intestines from three female mice were pooled at 5-6 week-old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
