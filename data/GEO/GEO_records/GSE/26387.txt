TITLE
Methanol is an endogenous elicitor molecule upon senescence of detached rice leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
During senescence of detached rice leaves, tryptophan (Trp) and Trp-derived secondary metabolites such as serotonin and 4-coumaroylserotonin accumulated in concert with methanol (MeOH) production. This senescence-induced MeOH induction was closely associated with levels of pectin methylesterase (PME)1 mRNA and PME enzyme activity. Exogenous challenge of detached rice leaves with 1% MeOH accelerated Trp and serotonin biosynthesis with induction of the corresponding genes. No other solvents including ethanol resulted in a Trp-inducing effect. This MeOH-induced Trp synthesis was positively regulated by abscisic acid but negatively regulated by cytokinin, suggesting hormonal involvement on the action of MeOH. Endogenous overproduction or suppression of MeOH either by PME1 overexpression or RNAi gene silencing revealed that PME1 overexpressing lines produced twofold higher Trp levels with elevated Trp biosynthetic gene expression, whereas RNAi lines showed twofold reduction in Trp level in healthy control rice leaves, suggesting that MeOH acts as an endogenous elicitor to enhance Trp biosynthesis. Among many transcription factors induced following MeOH treatment, the WRKY family showed significant induction patterns of which WRKY14 appeared to play a key regulatory role in MeOH-induced Trp and Trp-derived secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from the detached rice leaves with 1% MeOH or distilled water for 1 d, and gene expression was compared between the two groups with two replicates. DW, detached leaves in distilled water for 1 day; MeOH (2-replications), methanol treated detached leaves at the same time point as control. 2 sets of separately normalized data; DW-MeOH(1) and MeOH(2).
