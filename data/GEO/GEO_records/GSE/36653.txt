TITLE
apc transcriptome-Transcriptome on Arabidopsis APC hypomorphic lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-03_apc - apc transcriptome - Which genes are misregulated when the APC complex activity is reduced? - Wild Type Col0, APC10S and CDC16S lines (down regulation of APC10 and CDC16 endogenous genes due to overexpression of a sequence corresponding to a part of APC10 or CDC16 gene, respectively) are grown in growth chamber (16h photoperiod 22Â°C) for 15 days. Whole seedlings are then frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA are extracted.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - normal vs rnai mutant comparison
