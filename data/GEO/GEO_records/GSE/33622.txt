TITLE
Expression data from human iPS cells treated by a small molecule KY02111

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) such as embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells are promising materials for cell-based regenerative therapies to heart diseases. However, until realization there are many hurdles such as high efficiency of cardiac differentiation of hPSCs and production of clinical-grade cardiac cells derived from hPSCs. Here, we show that a novel small molecule KY02111 robustly enhances differentiation to functional cardiomyocytes from hPSCs. To reveal how KY02111 function on promoting cardiac differentiation of hPSCs, we analyzed the gene expression profiles in KY02111-treated IMR90-1 hiPSCs using the microarray technique.

DESIGN
At Day3 of cardiac differentiation from hiPSCs, KY02111 or DMSO was added in the culture and then the cell population was harvested after 12 or 24 hours for RNA extraction.
