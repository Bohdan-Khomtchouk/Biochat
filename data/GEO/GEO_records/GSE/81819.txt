TITLE
Premalignant lesions of the bronchial epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of hyperplastic, metaplastic, and dysplastic lesions of the bronchus in comparison with normal bronchial epithelium. The aim was to identify transcripts and cell signalling pathways associated with the development of isolated premalignant lesions and/or lesions combined with each other in the same bronchial epithelium.

DESIGN
Basal cell hyperplasia (n=4), squamous metaplasia (n=4), and dysplasia (n=1) vs. normal bronchial epithelial cells (n=1)

PLATFORM
