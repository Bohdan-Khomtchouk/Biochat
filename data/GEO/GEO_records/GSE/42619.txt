TITLE
Gene expression profiles of MCF7 with with the following NR ligands: estradiol/E2 (ERÎ± agonist), AM580 (RARA agonist), CD437 (RARG agonist), ATRA (RARA/RARG agonist), GW0742 (PPARD agonist), R5020 (PGR agonist), and dexamethasone (GR/NR3C1 agonist).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Altered gene expression patterns in human diseases reflect perturbations in the transcriptional networks that regulate cellular state. In breast cancer, Nuclear Receptors (NRs) play a prominent role in governing gene expression. NRs have prognostic utility and are therapeutically important targets. In order to understand the function of nuclear receptors in breast cancer, we treated MCF7 cells with 6 nuclear receptor agonist, and performed expression arrrays with three biological replicates each.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were cultured for 48 hours in medium with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, and then were treated with 6 diffferent NR ligand (E2, AM580, CD437, ATRA, R5020, DEX) separately  for 24h before collection and processing for microarrays. Three biological replicates were collected and processed for both control and treatment.   with the 100nM GW0742 (PPARD specific ligand) and 100nM ATRA (RARs ligand), then collected after 24h for microarray processing. Controls were non-treated MCF7 cells. Both treatments and controls have three biological replicates.
