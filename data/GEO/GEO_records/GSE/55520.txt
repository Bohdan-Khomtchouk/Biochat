TITLE
An analysis fo genomic structural alterations in iPS cells derived from xeroderma pigmentosum patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate frequencies of genomic structural alterations, we performed an analysis using a SNP genotyping array (Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 DNA Analysis BeadChip Kit) for iPS cells derived from xeroderma pigmentosum patients (XP3OS, XP40OS, and XPEMB-1). Samples were collected after 10 to 25 passages to detect structural mutations occurred during the cell cultivation processes. Our results suggested a higher mutation rate of the iPS cells compared to those from normal cells.

DESIGN
The iPS-cell samples were collected after several passages togerther with their precursor cell samples and subjected to the SNP genotyping array. We searched for structural mutations occurred during the culture of the iPS cells.
