TITLE
miR-K10a expression and inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of BJAB cells expressing miR-K10a and BCBL cells treated with miR-K10a inhibitor. To identify host RNA targets of KSHV miRNAs, we took advantage of the observation that RNAs targeted by miRNAs often display small reductions in their steady-state levels, perhaps as a result of their impaired translation. Accordingly, we examined cellular transcript accumulation by array-based expression profiling under three sets of conditions in which KSHV miRNAs were expressed or inhibited.

DESIGN
Cells transfected with negative control miRNA compared to miR-K10a or negative miRNA inhibitor compared to miR-K10a inhibitor. The publication associated with this data set is about human TNFRSF12A/TWEAKR being targeted by KSHV miR-K10a.
