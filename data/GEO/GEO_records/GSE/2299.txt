TITLE
Egr-1 induced gene expression changes in HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The target genes of the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) were studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Densely cultured HUVEC were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing EGR-1 or empty control viruses at a MOI of 100. RNA was isolated from the cells at the time points 16 h, 24 h and 48 h post infection. Control cells without infection were cultured in parallel and harvested at the 24 h time point. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (InVitrogen) and Alater (Ambion) reagents and cDNA synthesis, hybridization and microarray analysis using U133 GeneChips performed according to the Affymetrix manual. Gene expression changes were calculated as the ratio of EGR-1 or control virus (CV) infected cells to non-infected control cells. Keywords: time-course
