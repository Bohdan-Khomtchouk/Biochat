TITLE
cis sequence effects on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sequence and transcriptional variability within and between individuals are typically studied independently. The joint analysis of sequence and gene expression variation provides insight into biological mechanisms that underlie gene regulation and function. We investigated the role of sequence variation in cis on gene expression (cis sequence effects) in a group of genes frequently studied in cancer research. We assessed the proportion of genes exhibiting cis sequence effects and the proportion of gene expression variation explained by cis sequence effects, and compared our results to the literature. Keywords: genetical genomics
