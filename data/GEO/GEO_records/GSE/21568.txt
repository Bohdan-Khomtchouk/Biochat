TITLE
Mouse bulge (CD34+CD200+CD49+) versus secondary hair germ (CD34-CD200+CD49+) versus interfollicular epidermis (CD34-CD200-CD49+)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse back skin was disassociated to single cells, sorted by cell surface markers and tested by microarrray To compare the gene expression of mouse bulge (CD34+CD200+CD49+) versus secondary hair germ (CD34-CD200+CD49+) versus interfollicular epidermis (CD34-CD200-CD49+) xx Bald scalp retains hair follicle stem cells but lacks CD200-rich and CD34-positive hair follicle progenitor cells Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or common baldness results from a marked decrease in hair follicle size. This miniaturization may be related to loss of hair follicle stem or progenitor cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bald and non-bald scalp from the same individuals for the presence of hair follicle stem and progenitor cells using flow cytometry to quantitate cells expressing CYTOKERATIN 15 (KRT15), CD200, CD34 and ALPHA-6-INTEGRIN (ITGA6). High levels of KRT15 expression correlated with stem cell properties of small cell size and quiescence. Cells with the highest level of KRT15 expression were maintained in bald scalp; however, distinct populations of CD200high ITGA6high cells and CD34-positive cells were markedly diminished. Consistent with a progenitor cell phenotype, the diminished populations localized closely to the stem-cell rich bulge area but were larger and more proliferative than the bulge stem cells. In functional assays, analogous CD200 high /Itga6 high cells from murine hair follicles were multipotent and generated new hair follicles in skin reconstitution assays. These findings suggest that a defect in stem cell activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of AGA.

DESIGN
4 independent biologic replicates  (each pooled from 3 distinct mice) were sorted for Mouse bulge (CD34+CD200+CD49+) versus secondary hair germ (CD34-CD200+CD49+) versus interfollicular epidermis (CD34-CD200-CD49+)
