TITLE
Transcriptome of the geldanamycin producer Streptomyces hygroscopicus XM201

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus

SUMMARY
For systematically improving geldanamycin yield, we investigated the gene expression profile on the fourth day during geldanamycin fermentation (geldanamycin began to largely accumulated on this day). According to the RNA-seq data, we deduced that the PKS genes gdmAI-AIII are rate-limiting genes for geldanamycin biosynthesis. We also found a strong endogeneous promoter according to the RNA-seq data and the reporter gene. Replacing the native PKS promoter with this strong promoter brought an obvious increase in geldanamycin yield.

DESIGN
Exploration of the expression profile of geldnamycin related genes and screening for strong endogeneous promoters.
