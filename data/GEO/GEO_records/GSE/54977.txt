TITLE
Different gene expression profile in acute coronary sindrome (ACS) patients compared to stable angina(SA) patients.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes involved in plaque rupture. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (ECs) were stimulated in vitro for 12 hours with plasma obtained from the coronary sinus (CS) and the aorta (Ao) of patients with ACS (n=8), or patients with stable angina (SA, n=4). For each patient, gene expression profile was evaluated by microarray technology in ECs exposed to plasma obtained from CS and compared to that of ECs exposed to plasma sampled from Ao. In patient with ACS we found 684 genes up-regulated and 283 down-regulated was observed as compared to patients with SA. Functional and network analyses of statistically significant gene showed that the up regulated genes were associated to pathways IL17 Signaling. To validate the microarray data the RNAs were used for Real Time PCR experiment.
