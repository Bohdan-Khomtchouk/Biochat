TITLE
Analysis of eosinophil maturation and activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study compares the gene expression associated with maturation and activation of murine eosinophils. Immature (CCR3-) and mature (CCR3+) eosinophils isolated from the bone marrow were compared; and activated eosinophils isolated from the lung of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infected mice were compared to resting eosinophils isolated from the spleen of IL-5 transgenic mice. Keywords: cellular differentiation comparison
