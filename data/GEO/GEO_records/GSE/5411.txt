TITLE
Analysis of eosinophil maturation and activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study compares the gene expression associated with maturation and activation of murine eosinophils. Immature (CCR3-) and mature (CCR3+) eosinophils isolated from the bone marrow were compared; and activated eosinophils isolated from the lung of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infected mice were compared to resting eosinophils isolated from the spleen of IL-5 transgenic mice. Keywords: cellular differentiation comparison

DESIGN
We used high speed cell sorting to isolate pure populations of eosinophils at different stages during their development from age and sex matched mice on BALB/c background. RNA was amplified with the Aminoallyl mRNA amplification kit from Ambion and labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 reactive dyes and hybridized to spotted Oligonucleotide arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL929 UCSF 7Mm version 2 mouse long oligo array
