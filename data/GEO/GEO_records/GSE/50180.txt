TITLE
Gene expression profiles of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the plasmids encoding the wild type PreS/S gene or the nonsense mutant gene (sW182*) of HBV.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background and Aims: Whether hepatitis B virus (HBV) could play a direct role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains uncertain. The 3' end nonsense mutations of HBV PreS/S gene have been found to encode transcriptional transactivation activity, suggesting these mutations may contribute to HBV-associated oncogenesis.  Recently, we have identified a potent oncogenic HBV surface (S) gene nonsense mutant sW182*.  Results: Gene expression microarray study revealed that sW182* mutant was significantly enriched by gene sets associated with cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, or genome instability.  The transforming growth factor-induced (TGFBI) gene was downregulated in the sW182* mutant clones, and irresponsive to TGF- treatment. The level of Cyclin D1, a negatively regulated TGFBI target, was highly elevated in sW182* mutant cells.  Exogenous expression of TGFBI alleviated the oncogenic activity of sW182* in mouse xenograft study. In human HBV-related HCC cancerous tissue, expression of TGFBI was downregulated in 25 of the 55 (45%) patients.  Conclusions: Dysregulation of transforming growth factor-induced (TGFBI) gene is involved in the oncogenic activity of the sW182* mutant of hepatitis B virus S gene. This has never been described before.

DESIGN
NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding the wild type PreS/S gene or the nonsense mutant (sW182*) of HBV PreS/S gene. Totoal RNAs were extracted from those stable clones for gene expression microarray analysis using Illumina MouseRef-8 V2 BeadChip.
