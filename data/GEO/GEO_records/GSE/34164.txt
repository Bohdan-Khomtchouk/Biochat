TITLE
Expression data from isolated peritoneal macrophages treated with Histidine-rich glycoprotein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a 75 kDa heparin-binding plasma protein which has been implicated in regulation of tumor angiogenesis and growth. To exert some of its biological functions, HRG acts on macrophages.This study was performed to assess changes in gene expression in peritoneal macrophages treated with HRG using oligonucleotide microarrays

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples were analyzed. Peritoneal macrophages were pooled from 10 wt C57/BL6 mice and treated with recombinant HRG (1ug/ml) for 6 and 24 hours in duplicates
