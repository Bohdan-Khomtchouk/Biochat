TITLE
StpA prevents RpoS-dependent transcription during mid-exponential growth in S. Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
StpA is a paralogue of the nucleoid associated protein H-NS that is conserved in a range of enteric bacteria and had no known function in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Here, we show that 5% of the Salmonella genome is regulated by StpA, which contrasts with the situation in Escherichia coli where deletion of stpA only had minor effects on gene expression. The StpA-dependent genes of S. Typhimurium are a specific subset of the H-NS regulon that are predominantly under the positive control of sigma38 (RpoS), CRP-cAMP and PhoP. The regulatory role of StpA varied at different growth phases; StpA only controlled sigma38 levels at mid-exponential phase when it prevented inappropriate activation of sigma38 during rapid bacterial growth. In contrast, StpA only activated the CRP-cAMP regulon during late exponential phase.
