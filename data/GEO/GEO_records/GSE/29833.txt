TITLE
Expression analysis of HFF cells in G0 phase using TAS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide expression in G0 phase. Expression data were processed with Tiling Array Software (TAS).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
