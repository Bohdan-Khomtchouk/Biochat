TITLE
Association between DNA methylation profiles in leukocytes and serum levels of persistent organic pollutants in Dutch men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in Dutch men consuming eel from relatively low- or high-polluted areas, resulting in a broad range of serum POP levels. The Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.0HD was used to measure DNA methylation in these men and associate this with serum levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In total 48 POPs were measured, of which 30 POPs had levels above the detection limit in at least 60% of the participants. Furthermore, 11 different clinical parameters were measured as biomarkers for health. The leukocyte count was measured in each sample to adjust DNA methylation values. Furthermore, participants reported possible confounders in a questionnaire.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from 34 men (40-70 years old) was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human Methylation Beadchip. DNA methylation was analyzed using linear regression against serum levels of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, sum of seven indicator PCBs, and PFOS.
