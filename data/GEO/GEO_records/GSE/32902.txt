TITLE
Analysis of the early transcriptome signature of Nipah virus infection in primary endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic Paramyxovirus that causes regular outbreaks in East Asia with mortality rate exceeding 75%. Major cellular targets of NiV infection are endothelial cells and neurons. To better understand virus-host interaction, we analysed the transcriptome profile of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells. Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity.

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression profiling of NiV infected HUVEC cell (2 replicates) and of uninfected HUVEC cell (2 replicates).
