TITLE
Sca-1 expression defines different developmental stages of mouse PDC that show functional heterogeneity in the endosomal but not lysosomal TLR9 response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and were shown to be identical to previously described natural IFN-α-producing cells (NIP). Here, we describe two functionally distinct PDC subpopulations that are characterized by the differential expression of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1; Ly-6A/E). Sca-1- PDC are mainly found in the bone marrow, appear first during development, show a higher proliferative activity and represent the more precursor phenotype. Sca-1+ PDC are mostly located in secondary lymphoid organs and show higher expression of MHC class II molecules. Sca-1- PDC give rise to a Sca-1+ subset upon activation or in response to tissue-specific factors. Interestingly, in contrast to Sca-1- PDC, Sca-1+ PDC are defective in type I IFN production upon endosomal TLR9 stimulation, whereas lysosomal signaling via TLR9 is functional in both subsets. Gene expression analysis revealed that osteopontin (Opn) is strongly upregulated in Sca-1- PDC. This data provides evidence for the molecular basis of the observed functional heterogeneity, as the intracellular isoform of Opn couples TLR9 signaling to IFN-α expression. Taken together, our results indicate that Sca-1- PDC are an early developmental stage of PDC with distinct innate functions representing the true murine NIP.

DESIGN
The dataset comprises eight samples divided into two sample groups consisting of Sca-1(-) and Sca-1(+) PDCs collected from in vitro culture of differentiated bone marrow precursor cells using mFlt3-L
