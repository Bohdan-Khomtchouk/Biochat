TITLE
Expansion of GA dinucleotide repeats increases the density of CLAMP binding sites on the X-chromosome to promote Drosophila dosage compensation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila miranda

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed to compare binding the genome-wide binding profile of the CLAMP transcription factor in two different Drosophila species.

DESIGN
ChIP seq experiments compare the binding profile of CLAMP in female larvae to identify conservation of its binding sequence.
