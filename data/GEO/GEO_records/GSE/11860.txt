TITLE
The impact of glycerol on the metabolism of Lactobacillus reuteri - Exploratory experiment

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri F275

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium best known for its ability to co-ferment glucose and glycerol. Its genome sequence has recently been deduced enabling the implementation of genome-wide analysis. In this study we developed a dedicated cDNA microarray platform and a genome-scale metabolic network model of L. reuteri and use them to revisit the co-fermentation of glucose and glycerol. The model was used to simulate experimental conditions and to visualize and integrate experimental data in particular the global transcriptional response of L. reuteri to the presence of glycerol. We show how the presence of glycerol affects cell physiology and triggers specific regulatory mechanisms allowing simultaneously a better yield and more efficient biomass formation. Furthermore we were able to predict and demonstrate for this well-studied condition the involvement of previously unsuspected metabolic pathways for instance related to amino acids and vitamins. These could be used as leads in future studies aiming at the increased production of industrially relevant compounds such as vitamin B12 or 1 3- propanediol. Keywords: cell type comparison
