TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of young, senescent and p38MAPK-inhibitited senescent human fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized whole genome sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) to understand the extent to which the senescence-associated secretory phenotype is regulated by p38MAPK

DESIGN
Examination of replicates of young, senescent or p38MAPK-inhibited senescent BJ human foreskin fibroblasts.

PLATFORM
