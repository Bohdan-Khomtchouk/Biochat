TITLE
Influence of cold shock on total mRNA expression profile during harvesting Thermus thermophilus HB8 cells.

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the influence of the cold shock during harvesting the cells, we compare the expression profile of mRNA between in T. thermophilus HB8 cells harvested after arrested the growth on ice and in those harvested after addition of cold ethanol.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70째C for 16 hours in 3 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 mL) were inoculated into 1000 mL of same medium and then cultivated at 70째C for 8 hours (A600 value being ~2.57). For normal cells (harvested after arrested the growth on ice), 15 mL of culture medium was centrifuged 4270G for 5 min at 4째C. For cold-shock avoided cells (harvested after addition of cold ethanol), 15 mL of culture medium was cooled down immediately by addition of the same volume of ethanol which pre-cooled to -80째C, and then centrifuged in same way as normal cells.  Then crude RNA was extracted from each sample.
