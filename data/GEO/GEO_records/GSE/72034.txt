TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Physcion and Chrysophanol on cucumber powdery mildew Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
We generated 17.6 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (~2 Gb per sample) and catalogued the expression profiles of 12,293 annotated cucumber genes in each sample. The analysis showed differences of transcriptomes between physcion and chrysophanol alone treatment and combination treatment as well as revealed that the combination treatment the most defence-related genes induced expression changes. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns, and defence-related genes that were highly differentiated between the physcion and chrysophanol alone treatment and combination treatment. These genes have known or potential roles in defense response and were enriched in functional gene categories potentially responsible for cucumber resistance. Therefore, they are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms related to defense response.

DESIGN
cucumber leaves mRNA profiles of physcion and chrysophanol alone treatment and combination treatment were generated by deep sequencing, in two or triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.

PLATFORM
GPL16310 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Cucumis sativus)
