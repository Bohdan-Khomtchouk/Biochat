TITLE
Expression data from of HD-iPSC and CON-iPSC neuron derivatives

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared the global gene expression profiles of HD- and CON-iPSC-derived neurons We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression for comparing the global gene expression profiles of HD- and CON-iPSC-derived neurons and facilitating studies of medium spiny neurons (MSN)-degenerative processes of Huntington's Disease (HD).

DESIGN
By using a step-wise in vitro differentiation protocol combining EB formation, neural induction by small molecules, treatment with inhibitors of the TGFÃŸ pathway (SB431542) and the BMP pathway (LDN193189), and mechanical isolation/purification of neural progenitors and neurons, we induced 60-70% of control iPSCs or HD-iPSCs to differentiate into GABA- and DARPP-32- double positive neurons.
