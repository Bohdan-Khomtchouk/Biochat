TITLE
Transcriptional characterization of maize roots in response to urea and nitrate

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Although urea is the most used nitrogen fertilizer worldwide, little is known on the capacity of crop plants to use urea per se as a nitrogen source for development and growth. To date, the molecular and physiological bases of its transport have been investigated only in a limited number of species. In particular, up to date only one study reported the transcriptomic modulation induced by urea treatment in the model plant Arabidopsis (MÃ©rigout et al., 2008 doi: 10.1104/pp.108.119339). In maize, one of crops using huge amount of urea, only a physiological characterization of uptake and assimilation of the N-source has been conducted. General aim of the present work was the comprehension of the molecular basis of urea uptake and assimilation in maize plants, using a transcriptomic approach. In addition, the work focused on the possible interactions between the two main N-sources, conceivably occurring concomitantly in the soil, urea and nitrate.

DESIGN
5 dd-old maize plants were treated for 8 hours with nutrient solution containing nitrogen in form of urea; nitrate; urea and nitrate; or not exposed to any form of nitrogen. Three different biological replicates were used for each sample repeating the experiment three times. All samples were obtained pooling roots of six plants.
