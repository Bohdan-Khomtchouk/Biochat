TITLE
Expression data from wild type mice and REDD1 null mice following acute aerobic exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulated in DNA Damage and Development 1 (REDD1) is a stress induced protein whose expression is highly induced in skeletal muscle following a single bout of aerobic exercise.  However, the role of this induction is unknown We used microarrays to detail the change in gene signature within skeletal muscle following a single bout of aerobic exercise in wild type and REDD1 null mice

DESIGN
Wild type and REDD1 knockout mice were randomized to remain sedentary or undergo a single bout of aerobic exercise.  One hour following the completion of the exercise protocol, the plantaris from sedentary and exercised mice was extracted and frozen.
