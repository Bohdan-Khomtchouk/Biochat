TITLE
Targets of cytostatic drugs in HT1080 fibrosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were treated with cytostatic drugs and analysed on Affymetrix microarray to identify genes and pathways regulated by these compounds.  The array images were processed using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software. and normalized by global scaling or scaled to a polyA+ spike mask Keywords = Cytostatic drugs Keywords = Actinomycin D Keywords = Doxorubicin Keywords = Vincristine Keywords = apoptosis Keywords: ordered
