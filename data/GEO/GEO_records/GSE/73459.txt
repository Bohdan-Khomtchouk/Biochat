TITLE
Neonatal na誰ve CD8+ T cells have effector-like gene expression that prevents memory cell formation [miRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neonates are intrinsically defective at creating memory CD8+ T cells in response to infection with intracellular pathogens. Here we investigated differential of small RNAs, transcription factors, and chemokine receptors regulation in neonates as compared to adults before and during infection. We found that prior to infection, na誰ve cells have a different expression profile for many microRNAs, and gene targets of these microRNAs show widespread expression differences. These targets and other changes in gene expression in na誰ve cells result in neonatal cells that get activated more easily, express chemokine receptors that home to sites of infection, and are less protected from apoptosis during contraction. As a result, changes in neonatal na誰ve cells drive effector cell terminal differentiation at the expense of creating long-lived memory cells.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from adult and neonatal CD8+ T cells before and during infection
