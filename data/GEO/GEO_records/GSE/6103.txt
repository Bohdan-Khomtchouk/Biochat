TITLE
SAGE of cotton fibers and ovules.

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes fiber and ovules were compared by applying serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Keywords: Tissue Comparison

DESIGN
We constructed three SAGE libraries and sequenced 57321, 64188, and 69104 tags from fiber, Xu-142 ovule (ovule) and fl mutant ovules (fl) respectively of Upland Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Xu-142.
