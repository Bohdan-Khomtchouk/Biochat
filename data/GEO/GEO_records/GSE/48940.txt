TITLE
ssa_1972-null mutant of Streptococcus sanguinis SK36

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sanguinis SK36

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of ssa_1972-null mutant of Streptococcus sanguinis compared with wild type. The ssa_1972 gene was inactivated in Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 and transcriptional profile was compared with wild type SK36. More information can be found at http://www.people.vcu.edu/~pingxu
