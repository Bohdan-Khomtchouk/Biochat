TITLE
Expression data from Estrogen Receptor alpha-positive Progesterone Receptor-positive Mammary Tumors in STAT1-/- Mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aged STAT1-/- female mice spontaneously develop ERa+ PR+ mammary tumors that exhibit strikingly similar hormone-sensitivity and -dependency as human ERa+ luminal breast cancers. We used microarray data to compare the genetic relationships between the STAT1-/- mammary tumors and human breast cancers.

DESIGN
We compared five STAT1-/- mammary tumor datasets with the publicaly available datasets of human breast cancers and those from other mouse mammary tumor models.
