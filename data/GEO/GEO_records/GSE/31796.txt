TITLE
Creation of an anti-inflammatory GR cistrome by TLR4 signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An unresolved molecular paradox is how the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activates some genes while potently repressing others. We carried out genome-wide localization and expression profiling experiments in primary bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages treated with Dexamethasone in the presence or absence of LPS. Unexpectedly, we find that the anti-inflammatory GR cistrome, which is principally composed of 'canonical' GREs colocalizing with NFkB and AP-1 co-enriched with the myeloid lineage factors C/EBP and Pu.1, is shaped by TLR4-directed chromatin dynamics, suggesting that context rather than sequence may be a critical determinant of function.

DESIGN
Identification of GR, cJun, NFkB(p65) binding sites in primary bone-marrow derived macrophages unstimulated and LPS-stimulated (3hrs) that were untreated or pre-treated with Dexamethasone for 16 hrs

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
