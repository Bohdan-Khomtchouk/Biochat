C. elegans small RNA sequences from wild type animals fed on sel-1 dsRNA producing bacteria

Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RNA interference (RNAi) is a phylogenetically widespread gene silencing process triggered by doublestranded RNA (dsRNA). In plants and C. elegans, two distinct populations of small RNAs have been proposed to participate in RNAi : " Primary siRNAs " (derived from Dicer nuclease-mediated cleavage of the original trigger) and " Secondary siRNAs " (additional small RNAs whose synthesis requires an RNA-directed RNA polymerase [RdRP]). Analyzing small RNAs associated with ongoing RNAi in C. elegans, we found secondary siRNAs to comprise the vast majority. The bulk of secondary siRNAs exhibited structure and sequence indicative of a biosynthetic mode where each molecule derives from an independent de novo initiation by RdRP. Analysis of endogenous small RNAs indicated that a fraction derive from a biosynthetic mechanism that is similar to that of secondary siRNAs formed during RNAi, suggesting that small antisense transcripts derived from cellular mRNAs by RdRP activity may have key roles in cellular regulation.
