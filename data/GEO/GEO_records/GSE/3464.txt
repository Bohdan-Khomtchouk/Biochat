TITLE
Comparison of monocytes from G-CSF mobilized and normal peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A prospective randomized trial has shown that there is a survival advantage for allogeneic transplant patients receiving Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (GPBMC) versus bone marrow (BM) as a source of stem cells. The biological basis for this advantage is not clear, and may be attributable to qualitative as well as quantitative differences in the CD34 cells, T-cells and/or the monocytes transplanted. To begin to address this issue, gene expression patterns in monocytes isolated from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood were compared those from normal, non-mobilized peripheral blood to identify functional pathways that may distinguish these two populations. Keywords: Cell type comparison
