TITLE
A transcriptomic analysis of a Caucasian family cohort of high risks for the metabolic syndrome [HumanWG-6 v3.0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a strong predictor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and is defined by a constellation of phenotypes including increased and adverse body fat distribution, insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipids and lipoproteins, malfunctional cardiovascular performance, and abnormal levels of adipokines and cytokines. We assayed in a subset of our family cohort phentoyped for MetS phentoypes, the genome-wde transcript levels using the Illumina Human WG-6 v3 expression arrays.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression was assayed in members of families that originally contribute to linkage signals in a previous genome-wide linkage scans for multiple MetS phenotypes.
