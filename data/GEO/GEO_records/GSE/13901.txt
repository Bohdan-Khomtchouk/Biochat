TITLE
Treatment of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with Saccaromyces cerevisiae in exponential growth phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro experiment of stimulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells with Saccaromyces cerevisiae in exponential growth phase. This experiment was performed to verify the comparability of microarray experiments using a pathway based logic (Beltrame et al., PLoS 2009) by comparing the analysis of this sample with other seven public data  sets on monocyte-derived dendritic cells subjected to different stimuli retrieved from GEO Keywords: Case-control, transcriptional profiling, dendritic cells

DESIGN
A case-control experiment consisting of 3 case samples (stimulated dendritic cells) compared to 3 paired (from the same donor) samples

PLATFORM
GPL7763 Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array [CDF: Brainarray Version 11, Hs133Av2_Hs_ENTREZG]
