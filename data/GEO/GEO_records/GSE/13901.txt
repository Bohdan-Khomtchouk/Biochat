TITLE
Treatment of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with Saccaromyces cerevisiae in exponential growth phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro experiment of stimulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells with Saccaromyces cerevisiae in exponential growth phase. This experiment was performed to verify the comparability of microarray experiments using a pathway based logic (Beltrame et al., PLoS 2009) by comparing the analysis of this sample with other seven public data  sets on monocyte-derived dendritic cells subjected to different stimuli retrieved from GEO Keywords: Case-control, transcriptional profiling, dendritic cells
