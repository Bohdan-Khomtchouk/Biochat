TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of bovine mammary gland tissue of an udder quarter adjacent to an E.coli treated one for 24 hrs

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
By comparison of the transcriptome profiles of udder quarters neighboring to infected quarters and healthy udder tissue we analyse gene expression in the late stage of infection with E. coli 1303. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factors regulating coexpressed genes identified by SOTA clustering were used to identify key genes that define systemic reactions to infection with E. coli 1303. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
10 samples, two conditions: udder quarters neighboring to one which was treated with E. coli for 24h vs healthy control * five replicates
