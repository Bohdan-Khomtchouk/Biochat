TITLE
Genome-wide identification and analysis of gene expression in brains of mice infected with FJDRV, a street rabies virus with high virulence, and ERA, a laboratory-adapted virus with lower virulence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Host-virus interaction was analyzed at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that rabies virus (RABV) infection affects the gene expression in brains of mice and RAB with different virulence induce distinct expression pattern in host. Results provide important information that RABV infection led to alteration of gene expression in brains of mice and FJDRV, a street rabies virus with highly virulence isolated from brain of rabid dog in Fujian provice of China, or ERA, a laboratory-adapted rabies virus with lower virulence induced different expression pattern, including immune-related and cellular signaling-related genes.

DESIGN
An eighteen chip study was performed using total RNA isolated from brains in Treatment 1, three BALB/c mice infected with FJDRV, Treatment 2, three BALB/c mice infected with ERA, and Control, three BALB/c mice non-infected and all treatments were performed with two technical replicates.
