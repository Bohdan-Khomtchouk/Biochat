TITLE
P. pacificus young adults: Exposed to Xenorhabdus nematophila versus exposed to E. coli OP50 : 4 hours

ORGANISM
Pristionchus pacificus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of P. pacificus young adult worms exposed to pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila for 4 hours versus age-matched worms exposed to control lab food E. coli OP50. The goal was to identify genes regulated in response to pathogen. The broader goal of study was to study evolution of pathogen response by comparing this expression profile to that obtained by exposing the nematode C. elegans to the same pathogen. Other experiments which are a part of this study include expression profiling of C. elegans and P. pacificus on other pathogens including Bacillus thuringiensis DB27, Staphylococcus aureus, and Serratia marcescens.

DESIGN
One-condition experiments. P. pacificus young adults: Exposed to Xenorhabdus nematophila versus exposed to E. coli OP50 : 4 hours. 4 biological replicates for each condition, including 2 dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
