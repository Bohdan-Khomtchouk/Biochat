TITLE
3h pathway stimulation / inhibition experiment in epiblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment records the transcriptional responses of EpiSCs (line E3) to FGF/ERK inhibition, GSK3ÃŸ inhibition, LIF/STAT3 activation, as well as combined treatment for 3 hours each.

DESIGN
EpiSCs were grown in KSR medium on low-density feeders. At semiconfluency, media were changed as detailed for the individual samples. Cells were harvested for RNA isolation 3 hours later.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
