TITLE
iCLIP mapping of coilin-RNA interactions in HeLa and P19 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our ChIP resuls suggested that coilin association with U3, snRNA and histone genes might be dependent on coilin-RNA interaction. We used iCLIP of coilin-GFP expressed in HeLa and P19 cell lines at endogenous levels to identify coilin RNA targets and investigate RNA-binding specificity. P19 cells expressing GFP fused to a nuclear localization signal (GFP-NLS) was used as a negative control. iCLIP results revealed that coilin binds several classes of ncRNA including snRNAs, U3 snoRNA and scaRNAs. Interestlignly the majority of coilin targets were intronic snoRNAs, suggesting a novel role of CBs in snoRNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
5 biological replicates from P19 and 2 biological replicates from HeLa cells after UV-crosslinking. Negative control samples prepared from GFP-NLS fusion protein are stored uder accession E-MTAB-747.
