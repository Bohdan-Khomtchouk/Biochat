TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells after RNAi-mediated depletion of the insulator factor CTCF

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptional effects after depletion of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells from CTCF via specific dsRNA treatment in comparison to cells treated with control dsRNA.
