TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of dioxin like compounds

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We are presenting here the application of toxicogenomics in the evaluation of the toxic effects of three dioxin-like compounds, two Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Benzo(a)pyrene, Benzo(k) fluoranthene and b-naphthoflavone on the developing zebrafish embryo. The main goal is to distinguish the pattern of action of the chemical compounds and their needs varying the times of exposure. The results suggest a variety of MoA for different dioxin-like compounds, probably related to the nature and number of benzene rings. About 5% genes were affected by the treatment. Gene ontology (GO) analyses show that these genes are involved in the oxidation-reduction process. Representatives of each GO functional groups were selected and quantified by real-time PCR to validate the microarray data and to differentiate the action of dioxin-like compounds studied.

DESIGN
Four different treatments were performed in this study. Zebrafish fertlized eggs were exposed to dioxin like compounds during 48h and 96h . 3 biological replicates are included as each control sample.
