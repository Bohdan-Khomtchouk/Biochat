TITLE
microRNA expression signatures in colorectal cancer cell lines with demethylating treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen for epigenetically silenced miRNAs, wecarried out miRNA microarray analysis in three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116, DLD-1 and RKO) treated with or without 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza).  HCT116 and RKO cells were also treated with aza plus 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA).  In addition, we analyzed HCT116 cells in which the DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT1 and DNMT3B were genetically disrupted (double knockout; DKO cells), thereby abrogating DNA methylation.  Expression of a majority of miRNAs was downregulated in all three CRC cell lines tested, as compared to normal colonic mucosa. DAC treatment upregulated expression of a large number of miRNAs in all three CRC cell lines, and combination treatment with DAC plus PBA induced even greater numbers of miRNAs in CRC cells.  The most profound effect on the miRNA expression profile was induced by genetic disruption of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
CRC cells were treated with 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine (aza) or aza plus 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA). Nomal colon RNA was purchased from BioChain. Expression of 470 miRNAs was analyzed using Human miRNA Microarray V1 (G4470A; Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
