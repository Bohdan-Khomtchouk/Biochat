TITLE
Effects of shikonin on the gene expression of human lymphoma U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Shikonin is a active component isolated from the roots of the traditional Chinese herb Lithospermum erythrorhizon and exhibits multiple pharmacological properties, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects. Here, the effects of shikonin on the gene expression of human lymphoma U937 cells were investigated using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. The cells were treated with 100 nM shikonin, and followed by incubation for 3h at 37°C. Flow cytometry analysis with Annexin-V and propidium iodide demonstrated that no cell death was observed in the cells at 100 nM shikonin. Of approximately 47,000 probe sets analyzed, many genes that were differentially expressed by a factor 2.0 or greater were identified in the cells treated with the compound.

DESIGN
U937 cells, a human lymphoma cell line, were treated with 100 nM shikonin and followed by incubation for 3h at 37°C. The cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were served as control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
