TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the Δmak-1 strain

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
The MAK-1 pathway is the least characterized MAP kinase pathway in Neurospora. Microarray analyses were carried out to identify genes with altered expression in Δmak-1 as compared to wild type strains. Mycelial mats of wild type and  Δmak-1 strains were grown in constant light (LL) at 25C for 2 and 6 days, respectively,  in 1X Vogel’s, 2% glucose, 0.5% Arginine HCl, pH 6.0. A cork borer was used to cut plugs to inoculate 75mL of the same liquid media and cultures were grown in LL at 25C for 24h, transferred to constant darkness (DD) 25C for 24 h before being harvested and total RNA extracted.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment of the Δmak-1 mutant strain compared to the wild type strain. Cy3 and Cy5 dye swaps were performed.
