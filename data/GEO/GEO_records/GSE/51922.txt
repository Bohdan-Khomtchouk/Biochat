TITLE
Microarray expression analysis in idiopathic and LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (PD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the RNA profile of IPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from idiophatic and genetic form (LRRK2) of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Both, idiopathic and genetic form of the disease show similar expression alterations and were merged in one whole PD group. We found 437 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PD group as a whole. Up-regulated DEGs (n=254) encompassed genes involved in neural functions and transcription factor functions whereas down-regulated DEGs (n=183) affected basic homeostasis. These data point towards the presence of gene - and also protein - expression changes in DAn from PD patients which co-occur simultaneously along with DNA methylation changes.

DESIGN
Number of samples analyzed: 14 iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons . Control (C) samples, no pathological changes: SP9,   SP11   SP15  SP17. Samples from idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients: SP1,  SP2, SP4,  SP8, SP10, SP16. Samples from Parkinson's disease patients carriers of G2019S LRRK2 mutation (MPD): SP5,  SP6, SP12, SP13. No replicates. 30 days of cell culture.
