TITLE
Genetic factors that respond to N in maize leaf tissue

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Genotype and nitrogen-dosage effect on maize leaves collected at V8 leaf stage B73 is a model maize genotype while Illinois high protein line (IHP) is a metabolic extreme selected for higher grain protein concentration. It is a well known fact that the leaves serve as source and earshoot as a sink. Microarray analysis of V8 leaf collected from B73 and IHP genotypes grown at vairable nitrogen applications. Keywords: Genotype and N-treatment response

DESIGN
Technical replicates, dye swaps, technical replicates of dye swaps, no biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL5439 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array A GPL5440 Maize oligo array version 1.9 array B
