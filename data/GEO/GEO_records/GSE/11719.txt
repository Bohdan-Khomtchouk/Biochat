TITLE
Comparison of gene expression induced in hearts excised from mice 24 or 48 hours after DMA or DMSO (vehicle) treatment.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In isolated heart preparations, we observed that previous treatment with quinazoline DMA evoked both acute and late phases of cardioprotection. In this study, we adopted whole genome microarrays approach to investigate cardiac transcriptional responses induced in hearts from DMA treated mice in comparison to vehicle-only treatment.
