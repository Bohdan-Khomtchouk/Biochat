TITLE
Comparison of gene expression induced in hearts excised from mice 24 or 48 hours after DMA or DMSO (vehicle) treatment.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In isolated heart preparations, we observed that previous treatment with quinazoline DMA evoked both acute and late phases of cardioprotection. In this study, we adopted whole genome microarrays approach to investigate cardiac transcriptional responses induced in hearts from DMA treated mice in comparison to vehicle-only treatment.

DELAYED CARDIOPROTECTION INDUCED BY ADENOSINE KINASE INHIBITION STIMULATES ADIPOCYTOKINES AND ACTIVATORS OF PRO-SURVIVAL KINASES OF RISK PATHWAY. Unpublished yet.

DESIGN
Balb/c mice were randomly assigned to two groups, in which they were gavaged with 30 mg DMA/kg body wt (treatment group, T) or DMSO (control group, C). After 24 hours, half of the animals of each group had their hearts excised and the total RNA was isolated as a pool. Same procedures were performed with the remaining animals 48 hours after treatment.
