TITLE
RNA-seq analysis reveals profound changes in transcript profiles between siCon- and siH19-transfected EVT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used high throughput sequencing to analyze the transcriptional profiling of EVT. By comparing the transcriptional profiling of EVT with or without H19 knockdown, numerous genes showed significantly altered expression as a result of H19 repression.

DESIGN
HTR cells were transfected with either control siRNA or siH19. 48h later after transfection, total RNA was extracted for library preparation and RNA-seq analysis to compare trancript profiles between siCon and siH19 cells.
