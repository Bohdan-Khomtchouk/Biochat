TITLE
Illumina Solexa Digital Gene Expression Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type (Kasa-1) and OsMYB103L overexpression transgenic rice plant (Y103-1). Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Overexpression of OsMYB103L leads to leaf rolling in transgenic rice plants. To explore the possible molecular mechanism of OsMYB103L’s effects on rice leaf development, we examined the expression profiles of OsMYB103L overexpression transgenic rice plants and wild type leaf blades using Digital Gene Expression (DGE) profiling analysis.

DESIGN
OsMYB103L overexpression line (Y103-1) and Wild Type (Kasa-1) plants were used for Digital Gene Expression (DGE) profiling analysis.
