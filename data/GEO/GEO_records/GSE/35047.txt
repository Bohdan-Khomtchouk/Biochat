TITLE
MicroRNA expression in thioglycollate and alternatively activated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophage activation must be tightly controlled to prevent overzealous responses that cause self-damage. MicroRNAs have been shown to promote classical macrophage activation by blocking concomitant anti-inflammatory signals and transcription factors, but can also place restraints on activation by preventing excessive TLR-signalling. In contrast, the microRNA profile associated with alternatively activated macrophages and their role in regulating wound-healing or anti-helminthic responses has not yet been described. Utilizing an in vivo model of alternative activation, in which adult Brugia malayi nematodes are surgically implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice, we examined the profile of microRNA expression in these alternatively activated macrophages and compared this to alternatively activated IL-4 receptor knockout macrophages and thioglycollate elicited macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout mice were elicited with thioglycollate or using nemtodes (peritoneal implant of Brugia malayi). The latter leads to a population of alternatively activated macrophages. Microarray analysis was used to examine the microRNA profile of WT alternatively activated macrophages (n = 4), IL-4 receptor knockout alternatively activated macrophages (n = 4), WT thioglycollate elicited macrophages (n = 3) and IL-4 receptor knockout thioglycollate elicited macrophages (n = 3).
