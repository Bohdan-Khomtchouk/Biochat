TITLE
Rnase1 responsive miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the importance of RNase1 on cellular miRNA function, we used a lentivirus system to stably express RNase1 in dicer wt and dicer ex5 RKO cells in serum free culture. RNase1 was found to govern miRNA that reside outside the pureview of Dicer. Assignment of RNase1 as miRNA-generating enzyme suggests that, like Dicer, RNaseA enzymes mediate essential physiological functions through regulatory RNA.
