TITLE
Rnase1 responsive miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the importance of RNase1 on cellular miRNA function, we used a lentivirus system to stably express RNase1 in dicer wt and dicer ex5 RKO cells in serum free culture. RNase1 was found to govern miRNA that reside outside the pureview of Dicer. Assignment of RNase1 as miRNA-generating enzyme suggests that, like Dicer, RNaseA enzymes mediate essential physiological functions through regulatory RNA.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild-type RNase1 vs mutant (6x) RNase1,in two cell lines RKO dicer wild-type and RKO dicer mutant (ex5). Biological replicates: 2 for each condition and each cell line . One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL20891 Exiqon, miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation (hsa, mirbase 21)
