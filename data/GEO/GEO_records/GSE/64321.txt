TITLE
Differential expression of Rice genes upon Rhodotorula treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The experiments were performed to understand the molecular basis of plant growth promotion in rice by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1, an endophytic yeast from Typha angustifolia

DESIGN
Three week old rice plant grown in untreated condition were supplemented with Rhodototorula cell suspension. Shoots were harvested 0hr, 6hrs or 24hrs post treatment. Total RNA isolated from those shoot tissue & used for Microarray. 0 hr treated sample considered here as Control
