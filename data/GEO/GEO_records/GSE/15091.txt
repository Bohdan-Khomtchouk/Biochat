TITLE
PC3 cells transfected with androgen receptor treated with various concentration of androgens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared PC3 cells with or without harboring the wild-AR construct in the growth conditions of 1nM R1881, 10nM R1881 and ethanol (the solvent for R1881). The MOCK control is PC3 cells transfected with the empty vectors.

DESIGN
2 PC3 Samples transfected with empty vector, without R1881, 2 PC3 Samples transfected with AR, treated with Ethanol, 2 PC3 Samples transfected with AR, treated with 1nM R1881, 1 PC3 transfected with AR, treated with 10nM R1881.
