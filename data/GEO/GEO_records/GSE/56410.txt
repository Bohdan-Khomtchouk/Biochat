TITLE
Expression profile of PC-3-derived cell lines from transendothelial migration or in vivo metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastatic colonization involves cancer cell lodgment or adherence in the microvasculature and subsequent migration of those cells across the endothelium into a secondary organ site. To study this process further, we analyzed both in vitro and in vivo migration of human PC-3 prostate cancer cells . We isolated 6 subpopulation of cells: TEM4-18 were isolated from in vitro transendothelial migration of PC-3  cells; GS672.Ug, GS683.LALN and JD1203.Lu are single passaged in vivo cell lines from TEM4-18; GS689.Li and GS694.LAd are twice passaged in vivo cell lines from PC-3 cells. All the subpopulations crossed an endothelial barrier more efficiently and more aggressive in a murine metastatic colonization model than parental PC-3 cells. Microarray and FACS analysis of these cells showed that the expression of many genes previously associated with leukocyte trafficking and cancer cell extravasation were either unchanged or down-regulated. These cells exhibited characteristic molecular markers of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, including frank loss of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of the E-cadherin repressor ZEB1. We used microarray to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
We wanted to compare the expression profiles of cells that had undergone transendothelial migration in vitro or metastasis in vivo. TEM4-18 was generated from the parental PC-3 that was plated onto a confluent human microvascular endothelial cell line from the lung and allowed to migrate across this monolayer. GS672.Ug were isolated from urogenital after intravenous injection of PC-3 cells. GS683.LALN and JD1203.Lu were isolated from lung after intravenous injection of TEM-418 cells. JD549.Ki  were isolated from kidney after intravenous injection PC-3 cells. GS689.Li and GS694.LAd were isolated from liver and left adrenal after intravenous injection of JD549.Ki. All the cell lines are analyzed once except duplicate for TEM4-18 in this experiment for a total of 7 samples in this microarray. All other five sublines were then compared to TEM4-18 cells for changes in gene expression.
