TITLE
Effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on microRNA expression profile in human endothelial progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying proangiogenic function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are not fully understood. Current study was designed to explore the miRNA profile in human early endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, also referred to as CFU-Hill cells) in response to BDNF treatment.

DESIGN
Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA-3.0 array was used to examine miRNA expression profile in early EPCs derived from 4 subjects under control culture and BDNF treatment conditions

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
