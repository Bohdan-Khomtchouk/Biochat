TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of hpl-2(tm1489) vs wild-type worms at mixed embryonic and third larval stages

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Epigenetic factors guide cell fate decisions and can stabilize development by buffering environmental variation. HP1 proteins have a well-characterized role in heterochromatin packaging and gene regulation, while their function in organismal development is less well understood. Here we used genome-wide expression profiling to assess novel functions of the C. elegans HP1 homologue HPL-2 at specific developmental stages

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from either mixed-stage embryos or from third larval stage worms for both wild-type N2 (Bristol) and hpl-2(tm1489) strains.
