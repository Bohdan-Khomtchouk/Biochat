TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans : Wild type Fructose x Xylose

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing Xylose and Fructose grown on Wild type strain. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to Xylose transport. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment : A. nidulans strains grown during 16 h on fructose and transfered to xylose for 6, 12 and 24h.

PLATFORM
GPL15870 Agilent-029535 Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4 array [Feature Number version]
