TITLE
Time-series of gene expression in female murine ES cells during EpiSC differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In vivo these cells then differentiate into epi stem cells (EpiSC) that can be derived from the Epiblast in presence of Fgf2 and ActivinA. In this study, female ESCs cultured in 2i medium have been differentiated into EpiSC for 3.5 days in vitro by addition of Fgf2 and Activin A. The gene expression profile was analyzed every 4-12 h using mouse exon arrays.

DESIGN
Mouse Pgk12.1 ES cells were differentiated into EpiSC, samples were taken  every 4-12 hours for 84 hours in total
