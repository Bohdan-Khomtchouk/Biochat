TITLE
NB4 cell line untreated and induced to differentiate by a 48h exposure to 1ÂµM ATRA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NB4 is a cell line model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).The t(15;17) translocation and consequent expression of the PML (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)/RARalpha (Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha) fusion protein blocks differentiation at the promyelocytic stage.The PML portion of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein has a high affinity for the corepression complex, preventing RARalpha transcriptional activity. To induce complete remission in a high proportion of patients, a pharmacological dose of ATRA is required to destabilize this interaction and re-establish the differentiation program.
