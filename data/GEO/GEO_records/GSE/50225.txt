TITLE
Wild-type and Mecp2 -/y callosal projection neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations of the transcriptional regulator Mecp2 cause the X-linked autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome (RTT), and Mecp2 has been implicated in several other neurodevelopmental disorders. To identify potential target genes regulated directly or indirectly by MeCP2, we performed comparative gene expression analysis via oligonucleotide microarrays on Mecp2-/y (Mecp2-null) and wild-type CPN purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

DESIGN
Independent RNA samples were collected from three independent FACS purifications for both wild-type and Mecp2 -/y callosal projection neurons.
