TITLE
Salt regulated gene expression in Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high salt concentrations might alter gene expression in H. pylori.  Analysis here provides into the role that salt may play in H. pylori pathogenesis. . Keywords: comparison of salt reponsive gene expression, dose response

DESIGN
H. pylori strain 26695 (SC#7) was grown for 15 h in BB-FBS medium containing 0.5% sodium chloride (i.e. BB-FBS-0.5%)  The bacterial cells were then grown for 10 h, in fresh brucella broth at either 0.25% or 1.5% salt, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen at -80oC. RNA isolated was reverse transcribed and used to probe H. pylori Panorama arrays
