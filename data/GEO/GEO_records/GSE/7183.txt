TITLE
Salt regulated gene expression in Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high salt concentrations might alter gene expression in H. pylori.  Analysis here provides into the role that salt may play in H. pylori pathogenesis. . Keywords: comparison of salt reponsive gene expression, dose response
