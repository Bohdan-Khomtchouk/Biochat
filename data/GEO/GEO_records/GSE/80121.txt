TITLE
Identification of warm-sensitive neuron markers using PhosphoTRAP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq profiling identifies transcripts enriched in preoptic neurons activated by warm temperature challenge

DESIGN
Animals are subject to warm temperatures during which ribosomal S6 protein is phosphorylated selectively in active neurons. Transcripts associated with phosphorylated ribosome is isolated by immunoprecipitation. Comparison of Immunoprecipitation and Input fraction mRNA

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
