TITLE
Circadian regulation of gene expression in the SCN (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a circadian RNA expression profile of the mammalian biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in C57/BL6 mice, at 2-hour resolution using microarrays, and at 6-hour resolution using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
24 samples total covering 24 time points, with no replicates. SCN samples from mouse brains collected every 2 hours for 2 days (24 samples total).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
