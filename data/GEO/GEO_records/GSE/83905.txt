TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs immunoprecipitated by wild-type (WT) or phospho-mimetic (S200D) FLAG-LIN28A in PA1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effect of LIN28 (S200) phosphorylation on LIN28's association with mRNAs on a transcriptome-wide scale, we performed mRNA-seq on RNAs immunoprecipitated (RIP-seq) by wild-type (WT) or phospho-mimetic (S200D) LIN28 in PA1 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNAs immunoprecipitated by wild-type and phospho-mimetic (S200D) FLAG-LIN28 (in triplicate)
