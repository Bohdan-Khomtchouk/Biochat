TITLE
tRNA 5-methylcytosine in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we use bisulfite conversion of RNA combined with high-throughput IIlumina sequencing (RBS-seq) to identify single-nucleotide resolution of m5C sites in  transfer RNAs of all three sub-cellular transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana. 5-methylcytosine sites in tRNAs were also determined in Arabidopsis T-DNA knockouts for the RNA methyltransferases TRM4A, TRM4B, TRDMT1, NSUN5 and NOP2A.

DESIGN
RNA Bisulfite sequencing was used to identify candidate m5C sites in Arabidopsis tRNAs. Illumina sequencing was performed on a MiSeq platform. Two experiments were performed. In experiment 1, all samples were performed with one biological replicate, except for Arabidopsis thaliana wild type, which was performed in biological triplicate. In experiment 2, only one biological replicate was performed for each sample.
