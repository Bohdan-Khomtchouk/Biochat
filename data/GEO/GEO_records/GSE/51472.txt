Expression data of human aortic valve cusps

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common form of valvular heart disease in the Western World. Milder degrees of aortic valve calcification is called aortic sclerosis and severe calcification with impaired leaflet motion is called aortic stenosis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cdevelopment of calcified aortic valve disease in humans.

DESIGN
Human aortic valves from during different stages of develoment of calcified aortic valve disease (normal, sclerotic, calcified) was selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All the patients were male.
