TITLE
RNA-seq based characterization of long non-coding RNA involved in respiratory viruses pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset includes both whole transcriptome (WT) and mRNA-seq data for interferon-treated mouse samples. This is part of a larger study (GSE52405), where these interferon datasets were used as validation.

DESIGN
6-week-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with 10,000 U of recombinant interferon (Universal Type I IFN, Recombinant Human IFN-alpha A/D [BglII], R & D Systems) dissolved in endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (EF-PBS), or with EF-PBS alone. For this study, the mice at 12 hours post-treatment were used.

PLATFORM
