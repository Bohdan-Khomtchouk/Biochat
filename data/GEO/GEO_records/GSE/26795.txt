TITLE
Encyclopedia of C. elegans 3' UTRs and their regulatory elements - 454 sequencing of RACE clones

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) constitutes a major site of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence elements in the 3'UTR interact with trans-acting regulators such as microRNAs that affect translation and stability. The overall aim is to use a 3'RACE cloning-sequencing stragety to identify the 3'UTRs of C. elegans transcripts and explore their heterogeneity in different developmental stages and tissues. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Use RACE clones to identify 3'UTR isoforms via deep sequencing.
