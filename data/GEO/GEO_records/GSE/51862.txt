TITLE
Analysis of global gene expression signatures in sweet potato as affected by temperature stress

ORGANISM
Ipomoea batatas ; Ipomoea carnea

SUMMARY
Global gene expression signatures was analysed through microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify up and down regulated ESTs that represent genes involved in metabolic pathways in the leaf, fibrous root and storage root (tuber forming root) of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) as affcted by high temperature stress (40oC) compared to ambient temperature (30oC). Also Global gene expression signatures was analysed by the same procedure to explore up and down regulated ESTs in tuberous root of sweet potato in comparison with fibrous root of Ipomoea cornea and identify unique ESTs that represent genes involved in tuber formation in sweet potato.
