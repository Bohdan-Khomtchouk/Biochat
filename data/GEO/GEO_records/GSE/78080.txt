TITLE
Expression data from bam and setdb1 mutant ovaries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Germline stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are required for sustained production of gamates. GSC differentiation in drosophila requires expression of setdb1 by the somatic niche, however its function is not known. We used microarray analysis to determine what genes does setdb1 regulate to affect differentiation.

DESIGN
Less than 5 day old Drosophila ovaries were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Ovaries were selected from bam and setdb1 mutants as both of them are developmentally arrested at the same stage.
