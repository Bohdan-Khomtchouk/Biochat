TITLE
Expression data from endothelial SP and MP cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified an endothelial progenitor/stem like population in the endothelial fraction of preexsiting blood vessels. And we used microarray to see the difference of gene expression profiles between these two populations.

DESIGN
Hindlimb muscle of wild type C57BL/6 were digested to single cells and stained with anti-CD31 antibody, anti- CD45 antibody, Propidium iodide and hoechst 33342. CD31+CD45- side population cells and CD31+CD45- main population cells were sorted by flow cytometry for RNA extraction and hybridized on Affimetrix microarrays.
