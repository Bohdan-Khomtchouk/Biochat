TITLE
Expression data from human NHL cell lines treated with agonistic antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD20 is a clinically validated target for Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. Interactions of CD20 with the B cell receptor (BCR) and components of the BCR signaling cascade have been reported. In this study we show that antibodies against CD20 or activation of the BCR by specific antibodies induce very similar expression patterns of up- or down-regulated genes in NHL cell lines indicating that CD20 may play a role in BCR signaling and vice versa. We used microarray data to show that antibodies against CD20 or activation of the BCR by specific antibodies induce very similar expression patterns of up- or down-regulated genes in NHL cell lines indicating that CD20 may play a role in BCR signaling and vice versa.

DESIGN
Four different cell lines were treated with various antibodies for 4h (3 replicates per treatment), all in all 96 arrays were analysed for 32 samples. Changes were calculated relative to control/reference experiments. Expression patterns of each treatment were compared to determine overlaps.
