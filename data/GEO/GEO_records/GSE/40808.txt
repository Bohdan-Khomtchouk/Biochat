TITLE
Rotating wall vessel (RWV) grown A549s compared to monolayer grown A549s infected with F. tularensis SchuS4 over a 22 hour time-course (2, 6 and 22 h post infection)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 epithelial cells grown under two different conditions were compared.  A549s grown in rotating wall vessel cultures display a more in-vivo like phenotype. The data here describe the transcriptional differences between the two culture methods when infected with Francisella tularensis SchuS4 over a 22 hour time-course

DESIGN
1 colour; Cy3 labelled, 6 biological replicates for each culture condition and time-point, A549s grown in RWVs (RWV) compared to A549 grown in monolayers (mono), Infected vs. Na√Øve

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
