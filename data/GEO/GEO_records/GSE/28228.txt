TITLE
Expression profiling of KSR1-/- MEFs expressing KSR1 and/or H-RasV12

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We engineered KSR1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to express GFP alone, KSR1 or RasV12 and GFP, or KSR1, H-RasV12 and GFP, and performed gene expression profiling on all 4 cell lines.

DESIGN
Each cell line was measured in triplicate: 1. GFP alone 2. H-RasV12 and GFP 3. KSR1 and GFP 4. KSR1, H-RasV12, and GFP
