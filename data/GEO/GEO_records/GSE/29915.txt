TITLE
MicroRNAs altered in colon adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
95 microRNA probes were found to have altered expression in colon adenomas compared to paired non-adenoma tissue

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from colon tissue that was flash frozen immediately after surgery.  A total of 36 tissues were used for microarray analysis.  Briefly, 5 ug of RNA were biotin labeled and hybridized to OSU-CCC microRNA microarrays version 4.0.  We then analyzed associations comparing colon adenomas with paired non-adenoma tissue.

PLATFORM
