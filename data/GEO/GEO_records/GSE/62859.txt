TITLE
Functional characterization of C. elegans Y-box binding proteins reveals tissue-specific functions and a critical role in the formation of polysomes (ribosome)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We present a basic characterization of the function of Y-box binding proteins in C. elegans. Besides playing an important role for fertility in the germline (all four CEY proteins), we found that the presence of CEY-1 and CEY-4 is essential for the assembly of larger polysomes in the soma. We therefore performed ribosome-profiling in combination with total RNA sequencing in wild type and cey-1,-4 double mutant animals to globally compare mRNA levels and their translation status.

DESIGN
Ribosome-profiling analysis was peformed on wild type and cey-1,-4 mutant animals in duplicates. Four samples in total.
