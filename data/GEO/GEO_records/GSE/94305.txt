TITLE
IDN2 Interacts with RPA and Facilitates DNA Double-Strand Break Repair by Homologous Recombination in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Repair of DNA double-strand break (DSB) is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. We have previously shown that a class of DSB-induced small RNAs (diRNAs) facilitates homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we show that INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2 (IDN2), a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein involved in small RNA-directed DNA methylation, is required for DSB repair in Arabidopsis. We find that IDN2 interacts with the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex. Depletion of IDN2 or the diRNA-binding ARGONAUTE 2 (AGO2) leads to increased accumulation of RPA at DSB sites and mislocalization of the recombination factor RAD51. These findings support a model in which IDN2 interacts with RPA and facilitates the release of RPA from ssDNA tails and subsequent recruitment of RAD51 at DSB sites to promote DSB repair.

DESIGN
Here we examined the DSB repair rate via introducing a well-established DGU.US reporter system in idn2-3, mutant background. This system consists of the DGU.US reporter (R) line containing a unique I-SceI recognition site within the direct repeats and the DSB-triggering (T) line that expresses the endonuclease I-SceI. In the crossed (RxT) line, DSBs are generated at the I-SceI site and the repair of DSBs results in restored expression of Î²-glucuronidase (GUS). To compare the DSB repair efficiency in a mutant background with that in the corresponding wild-type background, we first crossed both the R line and T line with idn2-3 mutant independently. After F2 segregation, the following progenies were identified by genotyping: those homozygous for either the recombination substrate locus from the R line or the I-SceI expressing locus from the T line in the respective homozygous mutant background (named R/R; idn2-3 (-/-) and T/T; idn2-3 (-/-), respectively) and those in the WT background (named R/R; IDN2 (+/+) and T/T; IDN2 (+/+), respectively). Then, plants R/R; idn2-3 (-/-) were crossed with T/T; idn2-3 (-/-) to obtain RxT; idn2-3 (-/-), whereas the corresponding WT siblings R/R; IDN2 (+/+) were crossed with T/T; IDN2 (+/+) to obtain RxT; IDN2 (+/+). The seeds of these crosses were harvested, sterilized, and sown on MS medium. Thirteen-day-old seedlings were collected for RNA extraction. To evaluate the effects of IDN2 mutation on diRNA production, small RNAs from RxT; IDN2 (+/+) and RxT; idn2-3 (-/-) plants were cloned and sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform.
