TITLE
Hematopoietic reconstitution by multipotent adult progenitor cells: precursors to long-term hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used comparative transcriptome analysis to determine the relationship between rodent Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) and pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), or lineage restricted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neurospheres (NS). This comparison revealed a unique gene expression profile of MAPCs, that express transcripts of early endodermal and mesodermal but fewer ectodermal genes. In addition, MAPCs, but not MSCs or NS, express a number of genes expressed in ESCs including Oct-4 (Pou5f1) and other genes previously identified as ES cell associated transcripts and/or genes involved in maintenance of ESC selfrenewal capacity and pluripotency. However MAPCs do not express some key genes involved in maintaining selfrenewal and pluripotency in ESCs, including Nanog and Sox-2. Because MSC-like cells isolated under MAPC conditions are virtually identical to MSCs isolated in the presence of high serum, the MAPC signature is cell-type specific and not merely the result of differing culture conditions. Finally, this unique molecular signature was seen irrespective of the microarray platform used, and was highly similar for both mouse and rat MAPCs. Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were used for hybridizations.  cRNA from MAPCs, ESCs, and NS were added to a universal reference cRNA.
