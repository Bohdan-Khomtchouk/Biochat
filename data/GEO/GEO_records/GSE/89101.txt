TITLE
Nuclear and cellular expression data from the whole 16-cell stage Arabidopsis thaliana embryo and a cell type-specific expression atlas of the early Arabidopsis embryo

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
SuperSeries contain expression data from the nuclei of cell types involved in patterning events, with focus on root apical stem cell formation, at 16-cell stage, early globular stage and late globular stage in the early Arabidopsis embryo (atlas). Expression data comparing nuclear and cellular RNA isolated from whole 16-cell stage Arabidopsis embryos is also included. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
