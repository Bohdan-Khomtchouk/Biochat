TITLE
Gene Expression Circulating B Lymphocytes for Smoking Females

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cells were found to be directly associated with the onset and development of many smoking-induced diseases. However, the in vivo molecular response of B cells underlying the female cigarette smoking remains unknown. Using the genome-wide Affymetrix HG-133A GeneChipÂ® microarray, we compared the gene expression profiles of peripheral circulating B cells between 39 smoking and 40 non-smoking healthy US white females.

DESIGN
B cells were isolated from 70 ml of whole blood from each subject using B cell positive isolation method (Dynabeads CD19,Pan B) from Invitrogen Life Technologies Dynal Biotech Inc,CA. Total RNA was extracted from B cells using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. A total of 4ug total RNA was used to produced targets for each subject according to standard Affymetrix procedures. Hybridization was made for each subject. Multiple analytic approaches including mas5.0 algorithm (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), RMA (Robust Multiarray Algorithm), GCRMA (the improved GC-content adjusted RMA), and dChip were used for converting and normalizing our raw probe data to gene expression values Comparison was performed between smoking and non-smoking groups using t-test under Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure mutiple-testing adjustment.
