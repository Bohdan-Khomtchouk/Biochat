TITLE
Protein Kinase CK2 Controls the Fate Between Th17 Cell and Regulatory T Cell Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that CK2 inhibition with CX-4945 broadly suppresses Th17-associated effector and metabolic gene expression.  CD4+ T cells were cultured in IL-6, IL-23 and TGFb1 for 72 h, in the absence of presence of 2 mM CX-4945, RNA-seq was performed and gene expression compared between the control and treatment groups.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on 3 biological replicates in the control and treatment groups.
