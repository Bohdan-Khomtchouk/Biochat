TITLE
microRNA Expression of mice corneal endothelia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA profile comparison of the corneal endothelium of young and old mice: implications for senescence of the corneal endothelium

DESIGN
We collected the corneal endothelia from 30 mice aged 10-13 weeks and the corneal endothelia from 30 mice aged 2 years. The samples were pooled into six groups (y1, y2, y3 and s1, s2, s3). Each group comprised corneal endothelia from ten mice, and these six groups were used for a genome-wide microRNA microarray study.
