TITLE
High-throughput Illumina sequencing of bisulfite transformed genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, msh1 mutant and MSH1-epiF3 lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis msh1 mutants display developmental reprogramming (dr) phenotypes, include reduction in growth, enhanced branching, and delayed maturation and flowering time. MSH1-epi lines were derived by crossing MSH-dr lines with Col-0 wild type, followed by selection for homozygous MSH1/MSH1 F2 plants and serial self-pollination. MSH1-epiF3 plants displayed phenotypic variation in plant growth, showing enhanced growth, larger rosette diameter, thicker floral stems and earlier flowering time. We carried bisulfite sequencing and uncover the methylome changes accompany the heritable MSH1-epi phenotypes that condition dramatic variation in plant growth.

DESIGN
3 samples examined: wild type, Msh1-epiF3, msh1 mutant

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
