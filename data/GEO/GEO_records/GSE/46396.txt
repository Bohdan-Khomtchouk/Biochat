TITLE
Bivalent Chromatin Marks Developmental Regulatory Genes in the Mouse Embryonic Germline in Vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a ChIP protocol for the analysis of histone marks using less than 10,000 cells per IP, and used it to investigate the chromatin state of E11.5 mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs). A genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis of E11.5 PGCs revealed a distribution of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent domains highly enriched for developmental regulatory genes.

DESIGN
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq from mouse E11.5 primordial germ cells.
