TITLE
Effect of deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase2 on interscapular BAT gene expression upon adrenergic stimulation in thermoneutral acclimatized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ambient temperature affects energy intake and expenditure to maintain homeostasis in a continuously fluctuating environment. Here, mice with an adipose-specific defect in fatty acid oxidation (Cpt2A-/-) were subjected to varying temperature to determine the role of adipose bioenergetics to environmental adaptation. Cpt2A-/- brown adipose tissue (BAT) failed to induce thermogenic genes such as Ucp1 and Pgc1Î± in response to adrenergic stimulation, which is exacerbated by increasing temperature. Thermoneutrality induced a mitochondrial DNA stress in Cpt2A-/- BAT that resulted in a loss of classical interscapular BAT, but did not affect body weight gain or glucose tolerance in response to a high-fat diet. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse interscapular brown adipose tissue from mice acclimatized to thermoneutrality (30C) with and without beta3adrenergic stimulation with and without the deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (i.e., adipose unable to beta-oxidize long chain fatty acids in mitochondria).

DESIGN
WildType and Cpt2A KnockOut mice were treated either with or without beta3adrenergic stimulation, thus four classes. Three biologic replicates were compared per class, thus twelve mice.
