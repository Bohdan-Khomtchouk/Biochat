TITLE
Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs): Cdk7 wild type versus Cdk7 KO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of primary Cdk7lox/lox MEFs comparing Adeno-Cre vs Adeno-GFP infected controls. Samples were obtained 7 days after the Adeno-Cre mediated elimination of Cdk7. Goal was to determine the effects of Cdk7 elimination on RNA polII-mediated transcription.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Adeno-Cre vs. Adeno-GFP infected Cdk7lox/lox MEFs. Biological replicates: 10 independent primary MEF preparations.
