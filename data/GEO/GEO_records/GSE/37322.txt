TITLE
miRNA Expression data from maize young leaf and developing seed

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
miRNAs of at least 2 times expression level higher in seeds were all from the miR319, miR171 and miR166 family. In leaves, most up-regulated miRNAs included miR399a/c/d/e, miR408, miR159c/d, miR156k/j, miR160a/b/c/d/e and miR164a/b/c/d
