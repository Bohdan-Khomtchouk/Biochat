TITLE
Gene expression profiling of testicular seminoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns of testicular seminoma were analysed applying oligonucleotide microarrays in 40 specimens of different tumour stages (pT1, pT2, pT3) and in 3 normal testes. Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
A total of 40 pure seminoma including 22 samples of tumour stage 1 (pT1), 14 samples of tumour stage 2 (pT2) and 4 of tumour stage 3 (pT3) as well as three normal testicular samples of high-quality mRNA were used for microarray analyses.
