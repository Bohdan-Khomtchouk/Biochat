TITLE
GlcNAcylation of histone H2B facilitates its monoubiquitination [Affymetrix data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found that histone H2B is GlcNAcylated at residue S112 by O-GlcNAc transferase and that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation fluctuates in response to extracellular glucose level. We have also found that H2B S112 GlcAcylation promotes H2B K120 ubiquitination. To investigate whether these histone modification correlate to transcriptional activation, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip in HeLa cell cultured with different conditions, i.e. without glucose, with glucose and with FBS.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with the following three conditions, 1) DMEM without glucose for 24 hours, 2) DMEM without glucose for 24 hours and followed by treatment with 4.5 g/L glucose for another 24 hours, 3) normal culture condition (DMEM with FBS). Total RNA was purified from these cells and each RNA was linearly amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip.
