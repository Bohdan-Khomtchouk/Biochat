TITLE
Expression data of lungs from chickens infected with different H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses [24 hours post infection]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Recently, a novel protein in the influenza virus segment 3 has been identified, namely PA-X. This small protein has been reported to play a role in modulating host response of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus-infected mice. However, poteinal role of this protein in the pathogenicity and regulating host response of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in a chicken animal model is completely unknown. We used microarray analysis to evaluate the global transcriptional response in the lungs of the chickens infected with the parental strain (CK10) and PA-X deficiency mutant strain (CK-PAX3).

DESIGN
Chickens were inoculated with CK10 or CK-PAX3 or mock-infected. At 24 hours post infection, lungs were isolated from three chickens per group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were named as follows: CK10 (CK10-1,CK10-2,CK10-3), CK-PAX3 (CK-PAX3-1,CK-PAX3-2, CK-PAX3-3), Control (C-1, C-2, C-3).
