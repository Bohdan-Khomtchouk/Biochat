TITLE
Integrated genome and transcriptome sequencing identifies a novel case of hybrid and aggressive prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing is making sequence-based molecular pathology and personalised oncology  viable. We selected an individual initially diagnosed with conventional, but aggressive, prostate  adenocarcinoma and sequenced the genome and transcriptome from primary and metastatic tissues  collected prior to hormone therapy. The histology-pathology and genomic architecture were remarkably  homogeneous, yet it was possible to determine the quadrant of the prostate tumour that likely seeded the  metastatic diaspora. Despite a homogenous cell type, our transcriptome analysis revealed signatures of  both luminal and neuroendocrine cell types. Remarkably, the repertoire of expressed but private gene  fusions, including C15orf21:MYC, recapitulated this biology while the amplification and over expression  of the stem cell gene MSI2 may have contributed to the stable hybrid cellular identity. This hybrid  luminal-neuroendocrine tumour appears to represent a novel and highly aggressive case of prostate cancer  with unique biological features and conceivably a propensity for rapid progression to castrate-resistance.  Overall, this work highlights the importance of integrated analyses of genome, exome and transcriptome  sequences for basic tumour biology, sequence-based molecular pathology, and personalized oncology.
