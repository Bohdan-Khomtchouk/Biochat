TITLE
Role of the Bacteroides fragilis EcfO regulon during oxidative stress.

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis 638R

SUMMARY
Genome expression study of Bacteroides fragilis strain 638R comparing an ecfO null mutant with an empty vector to a reo (anti-ecfO) null mutant containing the ecfO gene on a plasmid under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter.

DESIGN
Seven chip study with 8 technical replicates (i.e. Each probe replicated 8 times on the chip) on each chip comparing the ecfO overexpressing strain in a reo (anti-ecfO) mutant to an empty vector control in an ecfO null mutant.
