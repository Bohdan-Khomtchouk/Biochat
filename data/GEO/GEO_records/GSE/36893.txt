TITLE
Redox regulation of auxin and strigolactone signaling in the control of Arabidopsis thaliana root growth

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Reduced glutathione (GSH) is required for cell cycle initiation and auxin-regulated root meristem development. Transcriptome profiling of the roots and shoots of the root meristemless 1 (rml1) mutant, which has about 3% of the wild type GSH, revealed a divergent auxin and strigolactone response linked to the arrest of the cell cycle.

DESIGN
Plants of the rml1 mutant and Columbia-0 ecotype were harvested and separated into roots and shoots, then RNA extraction and Affymetrix Agronomics Tiling Array were performed.
