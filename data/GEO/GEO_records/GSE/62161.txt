TITLE
Expression profile from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deleted for PMR1 treated with 5mM CaCl2

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Pmr1 is a cis-Golgi Mn/Ca transporter with a key role in protein glycosylation and manganese detoxification. We used microarray analysis to analyze the impact of CaCl2 supplementation on gene expression in pmr1∆ mutants and found that extracellular CaCl2 suppresses transcriptional misregulation in pmr∆ mutants.
