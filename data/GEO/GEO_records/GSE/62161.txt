TITLE
Expression profile from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deleted for PMR1 treated with 5mM CaCl2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Pmr1 is a cis-Golgi Mn/Ca transporter with a key role in protein glycosylation and manganese detoxification. We used microarray analysis to analyze the impact of CaCl2 supplementation on gene expression in pmr1∆ mutants and found that extracellular CaCl2 suppresses transcriptional misregulation in pmr∆ mutants.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPAD liquid culture  supplemented with 5mM CaCl2, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
