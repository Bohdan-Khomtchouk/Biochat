TITLE
Gene expression in PAO1, clonal AES-1 and non-clonal isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) lung infection is a significant cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Most CF patients acquire unique P. aeruginosa strains from the environment; however clonal strains have been identified in CF communities in several countries. Two clonal strains infect 10% to 40% of patients in three CF clinics in mainland eastern Australia. The expression profiles of four planktonically-grown isolates of one Australian clonal strain (AES-1), and four nonâ€“clonal CF P. aeruginosa isolates were compared to each other and to the reference strain PAO1 using the Affymetrix P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome array, to gain insight into properties mediating the enhanced infectivity of AES-1. The isolates were subsequently grown as 3-day old biofilms and similarly extracted for RNA and compared as above. Data analysis was carried out using BIOCONDUCTOR software. Keywords: Comparative strain hybridization

DESIGN
Four isolates of AES-1 strain were compared to four non-clonal isolates and to the reference strain PAO1, when grown both as planktonic and as a biofilm culture.
