TITLE
Bile-inducible membrane protein mediates the bile resistance phenotype of Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

SUMMARY
Bbr_0838 from Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 encodes a 683 residue membrane protein, that contains a permease domain displaying similarity to transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, as well as a CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) domain. The high level of similarity to bile-efflux pumps from other bifidobacteria, suggests a significant role for Bbr_0838 in bile tolerance of B. breve UCC2003. Bbr_0838 transcription was shown to be monocistronic and strongly induced upon exposure to bile. Further analysis delineated the transcriptional start site and the minimal region required for promoter activity and bile regulation. Insertional inactivation of Bbr_0838 in B. breve UCC2003 resulted in a strain that exhibited reduced survival upon cholate exposure as compared to the parent strain, a phenotype that was reversed when a functional Bbr_0838 gene was introduced into UCC2003::838800. Transcriptome analysis of UCC2003::838800 grown in the presence or absence of bile demonstrated that transcription of Bbr_0832, which is predicted to encode a macrolide-efflux transporter gene, was significantly increased in the presence of bile, representing a likely compensatory mechanism for bile removal in the absence of Bbr_0838. This study represents the first in depth analysis of a bile-inducible locus in bifidobacteria, identifying a key gene relevant for bifidobacterial bile tolerance.

DESIGN
In order to investigate differences in global gene expression upon growth or exposure of B. breve UCC2003-delta0838 to cholic acid compared to normal growing cells, DNA microarray experiments were performed. Total RNA was isolated from B. breve UCC2003-delta0838 cultures under normal conditions and cultures grown on or exposed to cholic acid. All experiments were performed in duplo and targets where confirmed with QRT-PCR. In addition transcriptome analyse was performed of B. breve UCC2003 compared to that of B. breve UCC2003-delta0838 both exposed to 0.1 % cholic acid. This was performed as a single experiment and targets were confirmed by QRT-PCR
