TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (pLib1) butanol stresses with repeated transfers

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824

SUMMARY
Metabolite accumulation has pleiotropic, including toxic, effects on cellular physiology, with a variety of genetic resistance mechanisms previously identified.  Using random genomic libraries and DNA microarrays, library inserts were preferentially enriched by culturing in media containing butanol, with successive transfers into fresh media containing incrementally increasing butanol concentrations. Keywords: genomic library preferential enrichment
