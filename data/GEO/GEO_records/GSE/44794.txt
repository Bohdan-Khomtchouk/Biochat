TITLE
Gene expression of LY6E-silent THP-1 cells and control THP-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of LY6E-silent THP-1 cells (THP-1-shLY6E) and control cells (THP-1-shCtrl). Results provide evidence that LY6E is effectively knocked down in THP-1shLY6E, compared to THP-1-shCtrl, and show the different expressed genes following LY6E silence in THP-1 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 2 cell lines.

PLATFORM
