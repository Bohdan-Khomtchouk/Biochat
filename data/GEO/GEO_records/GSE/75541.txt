TITLE
Analysis of altered miRNA expression profiles in the  genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming (GHS) rat compared to normal SD rat

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Urolithiasis is a common disease to human beings, and idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) is an important risk factor of calcium urolithiasis, previous studies strongly suggested that the decreased tubular Ca2+ reabsorption played a key role of hypercalciuria. However,the molecular mechanism of IH-urolithiasis formation is still not completely elucidated. GHS rat is regarded as an ideal animal model of calcium urolithiasis, reveals many identical pathophysiologic characteristics with IH patients . We analyzed miRNA expression profiles of the kidney of GHS rat  in order to find out the target genes and signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of IH.
