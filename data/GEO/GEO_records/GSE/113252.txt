TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Host Cell Responses to Virulent Haemophilus parasuis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
we investigated the host cell responses involved in the molecular pathways interaction in porcine aortic vascular endothelial cells (PAVECs) induced by H. parasuis

DESIGN
PAVECs  were  infected with H. parasuis SH0165 strain and the cells were collected for transcriptomic analysis. The control cells were infected with M-199 medium and treated in the same way. Three individual replicates were designed for the infection experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL19176 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Sus scrofa)
