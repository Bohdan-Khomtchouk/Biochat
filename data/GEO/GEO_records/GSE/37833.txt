TITLE
Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) effect on the genetic expression profile of a human keratinocyte line (HaCaT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical evidence has shown that electromagnetic fields produce a benefical therapeutic result for wounds, however little is still known about their exact mechanism of action. Moreover, clinical results concerning skin tissue restoration are still debated. In the present study, we carried out gene expression profiling of a human keratinocyte line (HaCaT) submitted to 1 hour of ELF-EMF (frequency 50Hz, intensity 1 mT) in order to identify up- and downregulated genes by this stimulus, and to verify the presence of specific molecular pathways activation. Most of the genes modulated were involved in mechanisms such as protein synthesis. In particular, these genes are related to Mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), which has been identified as a kinase with a pivotal role in cellular proliferation and survival in mammals.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of 3 biological replicates of HaCaT cells exposed to ELF-EMF (frequency 50Hz, intensity 1 mT) for 1 hour. All HaCaT cells exposed to ELF-EMF RNAs were hybridized against control sham-exposed HaCaT cells RNAs. Each biological sample was repeated with a technical replicate (extraction-labeling) and a dye-swap experiment.
