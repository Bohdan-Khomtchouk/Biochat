TITLE
Gene profiling of naive and Listeria monocytogenes-induced memory CD8 T lymphocytes in homeostatic condition and after stimulation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis comparing naive and Listeria monocytogenes-induced spleen memory CD8 T lymphocytes were conducted to identify key functions associated with memory CD8-mediated immune protection.  Gene expression analysis was performed on quiescent and re-stimulated CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Listeria monocytogenes-induced memory cells (LM-memory) were generated in C57BL/6J mice that received naive NP68-specific F5xLy5.1 CD8+ T cells one day before i.v. infection with 3000 Listeria monocytogenes bacteria expressing NP68 epitope. Specific memory F5 CD8 T cells from spleens were FACS-sorted at least 6 weeks after immunization. Naive F5 CD8 T cells were purified from naive F5 mice. Purified CD8 T cells were stimulated with NP68 peptide (restimulated condition, R) or not (homeostatic condition, H) for 2 hours.
