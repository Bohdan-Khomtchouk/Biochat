TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from G9a-KO and Cre mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the histone mehyltrasferase G9a  (also known as Ehmt2) in heart has not been extensively studied.  To identify the genes regulated by G9a in the normal heart, we first generated a conditional, cardiac-specific KO mouse for this gene using the Cre-Lox approach, crossing G9a flox/flox mice with Î±MHC-MerCreMer mice (Cre mice were used as controls). Then, we sequenced total RNA (Total-RNA-seq) from cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from G9a-KO and Cre mice, and compared the two expression profiles.

DESIGN
Profiling of the transcriptome of cardiomyocyte-enriched populations isolated from G9a-KO and Cre mice. Two biological replicates were profiled for each cell type.
