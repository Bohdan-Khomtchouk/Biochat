TITLE
Expression Data from Pten mutant epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PTEN imparts tumor suppression in mice by cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Whether these two tumor suppressor roles are mediated through similar or distinct signaling pathways is not known. Here we generated and analyzed knockin mice that express a series of human cancer-derived mutant alleles of PTEN in either stromal or tumor cell compartments of mammary glands. We find that cell non-autonomous tumor suppression by Pten in stromal fibroblasts strictly requires activation of P-Akt signaling, whereas cell autonomous tumor suppression in epithelial tumor cells is independent of overt canonical pathway activation These findings expose distinct Akt-dependent and independent tumor suppressor functions of PTEN in stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells, respectively, that can be used to guide clinical care of breast cancer patients

DESIGN
Wild type. PtenF341V, PtenWT/null, and  Pten null CDH1 positive epithelials cells of mammary ducts from 8 week old female mice were isolated by FACS, RNA was extracted and Affymetrix gene expression arrays were performed.
