TITLE
Cell type-specific transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis to salinity

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray data were generated to investigate the changes in gene expression for two cell types of the root: pericycle and cortical cells in response to salt treatment. The transcription profile of both cell types were also generated. Cell-types of interest expressing specifically Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) were isolated from the rest of the root using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

DESIGN
11 arrays were generated from plants grown in control and salt conditions. All seedlings grew in one tank were collected and correspond to one biological sample. Two control biological replicates were used for pericycle and 3 for cortical cells. By comparison from control microarray, 6 others arrays from salt treated plant (3 for each cell types) were used to identified salt responsive genes. The salt treatment was done on day 6 and 7 with increment of 25mM every 24h.
