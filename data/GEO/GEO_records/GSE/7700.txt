TITLE
Genes regulated by YAP in normal breast cell line and breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 11q22-23 in breast cancer strongly suggests that this region contains a tumor suppressor gene, yet to be identified. We and others have shown Yes-associated protein (YAP), which is located at 11q22.2, transactivates the p53 family member p73 upon DNA damage, suggesting a tumor suppressive function for YAP. Our analysis of breast tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed loss of YAP protein expression in great portion of breast cancers. We used microarray to look at the targte genes regulated by YAP in normal breast luminal cell and breast cancer cell lines. Keywords: gene knock down

DESIGN
We generated stable cell lines by introducing control vector(pRS-IRES-GFP/pmig) or YAP shRNA(pRS-IRES-GFP-YAP/pmig-YAP) in a normal breast luminal cell line 1089 luminal and breast cancer cell lines MDA MB231. RAN was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.We looked for new target genes regulated by YAP in normal breast luminal cell and breast cancer cell lines.
