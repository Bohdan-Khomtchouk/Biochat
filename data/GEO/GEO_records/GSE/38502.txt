TITLE
Aged animals generate a robust immune response against swine origin 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, due to the emergence and rapid spread of new swine origin H1N1 influenza A virus. In contrast to seasonal influenza infections, which typically cause morbidity and mortality in the elderly, this virus caused severe infection in young adults and not the elderly. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies acquired by older individuals from previous exposure to swine origin influenza. However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested using clinical data. To address this question, we investigated viral replication and the development of the immune response in na√Ø12 years old) and aged (20 to 24 years old) female rhesus macaques infected with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), one of the circulating pandemic strains in 2009. We compared viral loads as well as the kinetics and magnitude of the adaptive immune response in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples (BAL) collected longitudinally for 99 days post-infection. Although, adult animals exhibited earlier T cell responses in peripheral blood, aged animals generated a robust T cell response with comparable kinetics and magnitude as those observed in young animals in BAL. Moreover, aged animals generated a higher hemagglutination inhibition titer compared to young animals. We also measured the concentration of several cytokines in BAL supernatant. With the exception of IL-8, which was higher in aged animals, we found no differences in IFNa, IFNb, TNFa, IL-1r, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17, or MCP1 levels. Finally, we compared gene expression infection using microarray analysis of BAL samples taken on days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14 pi. Our analyses revealed that the largest difference in host response between aged and young animals was detected day 4 post-infection, with significant enrichment for genes associated with inflammation, the innate immune response, and T cell activation in aged animals. The ability of aged animals to generate a robust immune response, especially antibody response, following infection with 2009 H1N1 virus could explain the lack of morbidity normally observed with seasonal influenza viruses in this vulnerable population.

DESIGN
16 female rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulatta) 10-12 (Adult) and 20-24 years (Old/Aged) of age were used in these studies. Animals were infected with A/California/04/ 2009 H1N1 using a combinatory of intra-tracheal (4ml), intranasal (0.5 ml/nostril), and conjunctival (0.5 ml/eyelid) routes for a total dose of 7x106 TCID50 dose. Microarray analysis was performed on Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples collected on days 0, 4, 7, 10 and 14.  Note: One of the Day 0 array did not pass QC metrics so for this animal the average of the other Day 0 samples from that group was utilized. At the end of the study animals were released back to the colony.
