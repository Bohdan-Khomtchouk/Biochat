TITLE
Acute treatment with kynurenic acid in inguinal primary adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric diseases but its physiological function in peripheral tissues remains unclear. Physical exercise training activates a biochemical pathway in skeletal muscle that protects from neuroinflammation and, as a byproduct, leads to kynurenic acid accumulation in the periphery. We therefore investigated the effects of kynurenic acid in murine white adipose tissue. We used microarrays to detail  global programme of gene expression underlying Kynurenic acid mediated effects on inguinal primary adipocytes.

DESIGN
Fully differentiated inguinal primary fat cells were treated for 12h with 50Î¼M of kynurenic acid or PBS (control), in triplicate. RNA was extracted and used for global gene expression analyses.
