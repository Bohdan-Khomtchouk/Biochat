TITLE
Deep sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Flock house virus

SUMMARY
High throughput seqeuncing of small RNAs (PAGE isolated from total RNA or Argonaute immunoprecipitates) from Drosophila melanogaster using the Illumina platform. Adapter ligation requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH. Full analysis of all libraries in this set is published (Czech B. et al. 2008), leading to the description of endogenous siRNAs in flies. Keywords: Solexa sequences

DESIGN
7 libraries; each seqeunced once

PLATFORM
GPL9058 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Drosophila melanogaster) GPL9402 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Flock house virus)
