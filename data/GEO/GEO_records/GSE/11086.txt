TITLE
Deep sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High throughput seqeuncing of small RNAs (PAGE isolated from total RNA or Argonaute immunoprecipitates) from Drosophila melanogaster using the Illumina platform. Adapter ligation requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH. Full analysis of all libraries in this set is published (Czech B. et al. 2008), leading to the description of endogenous siRNAs in flies. Keywords: Solexa sequences
