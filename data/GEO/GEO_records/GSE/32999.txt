TITLE
Gene expression profiles due to common seed sequence of members of miR-302/372/373/520 family miRNAs and dsEcad640 in human PC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the genome-wide gene regulation due to the common seed sequence of the members of miR-302/3272/3273/520 family miRNAs and dsEcad640, we performed microarray profiling of gene expression by the transfection of chemically synthesized dsEcad640, miR-302a,miR-372, miR-373, miR-520c,and miR-520f duplexes into PC-3 cells.

DESIGN
Chemically synthesized dsEcad640, miR-302a, miR-372, miR-373, miR-520c,and miR-520f duplexes were transfected into PC-3 cells. At 24 hours after  transfection,the total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). As a control, mock transfected cells treated with transfection reagent  without siRNA and miRNA were used.Transfection was carried out four times independently, and the RNA quality was examined using Bioanalyzer (Agilent).  Mixed RNA samples (150 ng total) of four experiments were used for the microarray analysis. After cDNA was synthesized with the Agilent One Color  Spike Mix Kit, cRNA was prepared using the Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent), labeled with Cy-3, and purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).The cRNA  was hybridized against the Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray (4 × 44 K multipack format) at 65°C for 17 hours, then washed with Gene Expression Wash Buffer 1 and Wash Buffer 2 (Agilent) in 0.005% Triton X-102. The microarray slide was scanned using the DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent) and quantified using Feature Extraction Software (Agilent).
