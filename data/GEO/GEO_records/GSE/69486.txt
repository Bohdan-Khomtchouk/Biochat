TITLE
Gene expression analysis of skin fibroblast cells from patients with Bipolar Disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bipolar disorder is a severe, lifelong psychiatric disease. The main underlying pathophysiology of the disease is still incomprehensible. Many studies have suggested that many genes of small impact in combination with environmental factors contribute to the expression of the disease. In this study comparative transcriptomic profiling to characterize skin fibroblasts gene expression of bipolar disorder patients compared to healthy controls  has been performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from skin fibroblast cells of 5 healthy control samples that were pooled into 2 samples and from 10 bipolar disorder patients, in order to compare their gene expression profiles.
