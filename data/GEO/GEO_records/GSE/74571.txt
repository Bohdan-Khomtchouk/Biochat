TITLE
Serum Conditions Do Not Abolish The Tumorigenicity of Glioma Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The subset of GBM patient samples gives rise to adherent cultures even in sphere culture conditions. Most samples in this subset are tumorigenic and exhibit a hybrid expression profile when tested with the marker panel. Cultures from these samples have a predominantly mesenchymal character based on substrate adherence, morphology, differentiation potential and gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) cultured as spheres was compared to that from adherent GSCs cultured in sphere culture conditions that exhibited both GSC and mesenchymal properties.
