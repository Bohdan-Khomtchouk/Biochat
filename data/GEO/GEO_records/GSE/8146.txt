TITLE
Age-related transcriptional changes and the effect of dietary supplementation of vitamin E in the mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the global effects of vitamin E supplementation on heart aging, we used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to measure transcriptional alterations in 30-month-old B6C3F1 mice supplemented with α- and γ-tocopherol since middle age (15 months). Keywords: expression profiling

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were obtained from 5-month-old controls, 30-month-old controls and 30-month-old mice supplemented with α-tocopherol (1g/kg), or a mixture of α- and γ-tocopherol (500mg/kg of each tocopherol).
