TITLE
Regulation of Promoter and Enhancer Histone Landscape by DNA Methylation in Embryonic Stem Cells (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we mapped modification of lysine 4 and lysine 27 of histone H3 genome-wide in a series of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) varying in DNA methylation levels based on knock-out and reconstitution of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We extend previous studies showing cross-talk between DNA methylation and histone modifications by examining a breadth of histone modifications, causal relationships, and direct effects. Our data shows a causal regulation of H3K27me3 at gene promoters as well as H3K27ac and H3K27me3 at tissue-specific enhancers. We also identify isoform differences between DNMT family members. This study provides a comprehensive resource for the study of the complex interplay between DNA methylation and histone modification landscape.

DESIGN
Histone ChIP-seq of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac were performed on wild-type, Dnmt triple knock-out (Dnmt1/3a/3b; TKO), Dnmt double knock-out (Dnmt3a/3b; DKO), and respective reconstitution mouse embryonic stem cell lines
