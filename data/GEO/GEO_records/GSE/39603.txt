ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and Prostate cancer samples. The Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I with 1,505 CpG sites selected from 807 genes was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles.  Samples included 24 normals and 87 tumors.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 111 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Illumina GoldenGate Methylation array.
