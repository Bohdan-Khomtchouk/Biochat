TITLE
Exon-expression profiling of CD4+ T cells derived from HTLV-1-infected individuals with or without malignancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution culture of PBMC of HTLV-1 carriers. Exon expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix exon array (Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene version of CEL files 01 to 12 are presented in GSE46518.

DESIGN
The main objectives were to assess whether transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications associate with HTLV-1 infection in vivo. To this end, T-cell clones, infected or not by HTLV-1, were obtained by limiting dilution culture of PBMC derived from HTLV-1 carriers. Tumor cells derived from patients with an acute form ATLL. Exon expression profiles of cloned T-cells and ATLL cells was analyzed using Affymetrix exon array (Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Given that T-cell activation is known to modify alternative exon usage, microarray analysis was carried-out with unstimulated and PHA-stimulated CD4+ T cell clones.
