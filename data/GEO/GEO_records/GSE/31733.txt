TITLE
Expression data from B6, Sle1b and Sle1b.BACSlamf6-H1 CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently showed that the Slamf6 protein isoform Slamf6-H1 markedly diminishes T cell–dependent disease upon introduction of a Slamf6-H1–expressing transgene into the lupus-prone Sle1b mouse, which lacks this isoform. In this study we purified CD4+ T cells from Sle1b, Sle1b.Slamf6-H1, or B6 mice and a global gene expression profile was analyzed.

DESIGN
Comparison of isolated cells from three strains of mice (12wk old females) at three time points of anti-CD3 activation with three biological replicates for each group (unless indicated otherwise).
