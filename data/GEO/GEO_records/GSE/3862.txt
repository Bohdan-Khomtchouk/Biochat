TITLE
Low level of pathogenesis-related protein1 mRNA expression in 15-day-old Arabidopsis cer6-2 and cer2 eceriferum mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA from the aerial parts of 15-day-old eceriferum cer6-2 mutant and control plants were used in microarray experiments to screen for differentially expressed genes. Among those which were down regulated in the mutant, several were known to be involved in various plant defense mechanisms. The most remarkable difference was measured for the transcripts encoding the pathogenesis-related protein1 (PR-1), which is a marker of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathway, with a 100-fold decrease in the cer6-2 mutant. Further Q-PCR experiments showed that the PR-1 transcript levels were low in two other eceriferum mutants, representing 1/200th and 1/25th of the normal values in the aerial part of 15-day-old cer2 and cer1-1 mutants, respectively. Interestingly, PR-1 mRNA levels were closed to the normal values in the cer3-1 and cer6-2R mutant, the latter being a plant where the synthesis of the very-long chain fatty acids, which is deficient in the cer6-2 plants, is partially restored. Altogether, these results strongly suggested that the amount of PR1-mRNA was not directly correlated to the amount of epicuticular wax on the leaves, but was rather correlated to the presence or absence of some particular lipid-constituents in the epicuticular wax layer.
