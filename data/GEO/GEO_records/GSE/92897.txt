TITLE
Exogenous miRNA expression profiling in serum of pig and rat fed with different diets

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We performed carefully designed and controlled animal feeding studies. We devided 9 adult rats in three group and each group fed with one type of diets in 28 days: rice, potatoes and chow. We fed piglets in triplicate either with cow milk or let them feed from sows milk for 4 weeks followed by 7 weeks of maize diet. Based on the small RNA sequencing data from 9 rat and 6 pig serum samples, we detected no transfer of plant miRNAs into rat blood, or bovine milk sequences into piglet blood.

DESIGN
The miRNA profiles in serum of chow-fed, potato-fed and rice-fed rats in 28 days and the miRNA profiles in serum of cow milk and sows milk fed pigs were generated by sequencing, in triplicate, Illumina TruSeq small RNA.
