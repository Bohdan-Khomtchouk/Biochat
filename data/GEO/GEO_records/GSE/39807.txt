TITLE
Gene and microRNA expression data from tumor induced CD11b+ MDSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor growth is associated with a profound alteration of myelopoiesis, leading to recruitment of immunosuppressive cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Immuno-regulatory activity of both tumor-induced and BM-derived MDSCs (by GM-CSF and IL-6 treatment) was entirely dependent on C/EBP transcription factor (TF), a key component of the emergency myelopoiesis triggered by stress and inflammation. We used miR expression analysis to identify miRs which could drive MDSC recruitment/generation/activity by modulating specific TFs and pathway. In particular, we identified a miR signature of 79 miR differentially expressed between not suppressive CD11b+ cells and CD11b+ isolated from tumor mass and spleen of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover on the same samples we profiled gene expression with Affymetrix microarrays to perform an integrated analysis of mirna and gene expression. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
CD11b+ cells were immuno-magnetically enriched from various mouse tissues, and total RNA isolated by Trizol reagent. CD11b+ cells obtained from the spleen of healthy BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were used as reference sample for tumor induced CD11b+ MDSC, enriched from either the spleen and the tumor infiltrate of tumor-bearing mice. A triplicate of each sample was considered (except for EL4 samples, where we considered a duplicated), and each sample derives from a pool of three mice, at least.
