TITLE
cpsf30 mips1 transcriptome-Cell death control by CPSF30

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au12-06_cpsf30 - cpsf30 mips1 transcriptome - How a mutation in the CPSF30 is able to suppress the cell death phenotype observed in the mips1-1 Arabidopsis mutant? - All the plants were cultivated in the same hanging conditions 10days in " short Days " then in long Days. The takings were later made 4days in " long Days " what corresponds to the appearance of the symptoms of cellular death at the mutant mips1-1. On the other hand, the gene CPSF30 codes for two transcribed. We have a double mutant mips1 cpsf30 complemented with the transcribed young.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - genotype comparaison
