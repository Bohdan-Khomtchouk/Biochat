TITLE
Mitochondrial mutations in cigarette smoke extract-chronically treated human oral OKF6 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to analyze the mitochondrial mutations induced by chronic cigarette smoke extract treatment in human oral immortal OKF6 cells. The objective of this study was to analyze the mitochondrial mutations induced by chronic cigarette smoke extract treatment in human oral immortal OKF6 cells.

DESIGN
2 samples were included, a control passaged human oral immortal OKF6 cells and cigarette smoke extract-treated OKF6 cells.  The chronic treatment for cigarette smoke extract is 7 months. Genomic DNAs were extracted from both cells and then used for Affymetix MitoChip Version 2.0 analysis.
