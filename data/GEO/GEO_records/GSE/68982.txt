TITLE
Landscape and dynamics of transcription initiation in P. falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The lack of a comprehensive map of transcription start sites (TSS) across P. falciparum genome has hampered advances in decrypting the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite. In eukaryotic model organisms, development of genome-wide approaches and next-generation sequencing technologies has contributed to a better understanding of the impact of local nucleotide composition on transcriptional regulation. Using such methods, we generated a single nucleotide-resolution map of transcription initiation events during P. falciparum intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription start site during the intra-erythorcytic development of the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum

PLATFORM
GPL16607 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Plasmodium falciparum)
