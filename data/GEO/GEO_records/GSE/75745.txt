TITLE
Microarray characterization of Vhl; Vhl, Hif1a; Vhl, Hif2a and Vhl, Hif1a, Hif2a deficient primary kidney cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To unravel the potential cooperative roles of oxygen-regulated signaling pathways; von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors, we have generated mutant mice with; Vhlh, Vhlh/Hif1α, Vhlh/Hif2α and Vhlh/Hif1α/Hif2α gene alleles floxed. Subsequently primary kidney cells were isolated, cultured and infected with Adenoviruses bearing either Cre/GFP or GFP expression only. Agilent cDNA microarrays were utilized to compare the gene expression profiles of the kidney epithelial cells from aforementioned cell cultures to gain insight about the molecules and signaling pathways that drive aberrant cellular proliferation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

DESIGN
24 independent biological samples from 4 genetic experimental conditions were hybridized in two- color format on 13 Mouse GE 4x44K v2 Microarray Kit (Design ID 026655) arrays. Eventual dye specific hybridization effects were controlled with dye swap on biological replicates. For an each experimental condition 3 arrays were use, except of one where 4 arrays were used (one sample combination in repetition with a dye swap). For the final analysis the gene expression levels were dye effect corrected and values for biological replicates were averaged to obtain a matrix with gene expression levels for 4 independent biological (1. Vhlh-/-, 2. Vhlh-/-/Hif1α-/-, 3. Vhlh-/-/Hif2α-/- and 4. Vhlh-/-/Hif1α-/-/Hif2α-/-) conditions.
