TITLE
Expression profiling of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with DOT1L inhibitors and siDOT1L

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 cell line with relatively high DOT1L levels was treated with two potent, selective inhibitors of the DOT1L histone methyl transferase. These compounds can inhibit cells migration and invasion and induce differentiation. Here we provide expression profiling data of cells treated with two DOT1L inhibitors [1] [2], DOT1L siRNA (siDOT1L) or control.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 1uM compound [1], 5uM compound [1], 2uM compound [2], 10 uM compound [2] (DOT1L inhibitors) or control (0.1% DMSO) for 14 days, or siDOT1L for 7 days. For each unique condition, 2 biological replicates were generated for expression profiling. Compound [1]: EPZ004777 (in Diagle et al., 2011) Compound [2]: Compound 55 (in Anglin et al., 2012)
