TITLE
Expression data from human-derived oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oligodendrocytes have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we differentiated fibroblasts into induced neural progenitors and subsequently into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. To confirm that the cells obtained with this protocol express the gene signature of oligodendrocytes, we performed a small gene expression study limited to four iOligodendrocyte lines from two controls (nos. 155 and 170) and two patients (nos. 12 and 17), four iAstrocyte lines from the same samples, and four fibroblast lines from one of our previously published studies
