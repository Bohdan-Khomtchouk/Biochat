TITLE
Generation of PDGFRα+ Cardioblasts from Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We uncover a novel class of cardiac lineage cells, PDGFRα+Flk1- cardioblasts (PCB), from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) using CsAYTE, a combination of small molecules – Cyclosporin A (CsA), ROCK inhibitor Y27362, antioxidant Trolox, and ALK5 inhibitor EW7197. To elucidate the genome-wide characteristics of PCB, microarray analysis was performed and compared with the spontaneously formed PCB, which were obtained without CsAYTE incubation (hereafter referred to as “sfPCB”), Flk1+ mesodermal precursor cells (MPC), and αMHC+ cardiomyocytes (M+CM)

DESIGN
Sorting of cells was performed by flow cytometry (Flk1+ MPC at day 4.5, sfPCB and PCB at day 5.5, and M+CM at day 10.5 from PSC differentiation) and microarray analysis was performed.
