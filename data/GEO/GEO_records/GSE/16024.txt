TITLE
Identification of molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma from small sample size

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MALT lymphoma is characterized by t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH and t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, which commonly activate the NF-κB pathway. Gastric MALT lymphomas harboring such translocation do not respond to H. pylori eradication, while those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of these different MALT lymphoma subgroups, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of 24 MALT lymphomas (15 translocation-positive, 9 translocation-negative). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the NF-κB target genes and 4394 additional gene sets covering various cellular pathways, biological processes and molecular functions showed that translocation-positive MALT lymphomas are characterized by an enhanced expression of NF-κB target genes, particularly TLR6, CCR2, CD69 and BCL2, while translocation-negative cases were featured by active inflammatory and immune responses, such as IL8, CD86, CD28 and ICOS.
