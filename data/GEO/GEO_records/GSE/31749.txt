TITLE
Development of a high-density oligo microarray of cassava, an important tropical crop

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
We developed a 60-mer oligonucleotide Agilent microarray representing about 20,000 cassava genes and applied it to expression profiling under drought stress. We demonstrated that our microarray is an useful tool for analyzing the cassava transcriptome and that it can be applied to various cassava species.
