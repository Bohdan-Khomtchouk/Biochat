TITLE
Mexican maize landraces under drought stress and recovery irrigation

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of three mexican maize landraces under 10, and 17 days stress and recovery irrigation

DESIGN
A dye balanced modified loop design was implemented. Two biological replicates (pooling five representative plants) representing each sampling point for each genotype were obtained for purified RNA from 120 randomly chosen seedlings.  This experiment involved a total of forty-eight (24 sets) of microarray hybridizations, including direct and dye swap comparisons between treatments as well as across the three landraces. This design allowed us to determine differences in gene expression between the three different landraces under drought stress (10 and 17 days) and at recovery irrigation compared to irrigated controls.
