TITLE
Differentially expressed Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in Crohn's disease (CD) comparing to normal controls (NC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To date, 481 transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) have been discovered in human genome. We aimed to investigate their characteristics in Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) with conparison to healthy normal controls, to reveal differentially expressed T-UCRs.

DESIGN
3 CD patients and 3 NC volunteers were recruited in this study. With colonoscopy, colon mocosa  pinch biopsy samles were got at  inflammed site in CD patients and normal sites in  NC volunteers respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL18564 Arraystar Human T-UCR Microarray [Agilent-038545]
