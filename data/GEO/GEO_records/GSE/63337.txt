TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice ABA deficient mutant Osaba1-1  and  wild-type before and 72h after Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
ABA deficient mutant Osaba1-1 exhibits great resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection. To investigate gene expression profile changes at whole genome level between Osaba1-1 and wild-type (Nipponbare) rice during Xoo infection, we employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform.

DESIGN
Osaba1-1 and wild-type rice plants about 6.5 leaf stage were used in this experiment. For Xoo inoculation, tips (about 3cm) of the fifth and sixth fully expanded leaves were cut off, and then immersed into Xoo (PXO99 strain) inoculum (suspended in sterile distilled water containing 10mM MgCl2, ODâ‰ˆ0.5) immediately for about fifteen seconds. Inoculated rice leaves were collected (approximately 2 cm leaf fragment from the inoculation site) at 0h and 72h post inoculation. Three independent replicate samples were collected at each time point for microarray.
