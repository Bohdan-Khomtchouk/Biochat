TITLE
Effect of Dnmt3a deletion on the global DNA methylation status of osteoclasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic regulation is a fundamental mechanism mediating various cellular processes. However, epigenetic mechanisms in osteoclastogenesis remain to be elucidated. We performed MBD-seq analysis to investigate DNA methylation in osteoclasts derived from wild-type and osteoclast-specific Dnmt3a knockout  mice.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation in 2 cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
