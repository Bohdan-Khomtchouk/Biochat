TITLE
Identification of Novel Cholesteatoma-related Gene Expression Signatures Using Full-genome Microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated differentially expressed genes in human cholesteatomas  in comparison to regular auditory canal skin using Whole Human Genome Microarrays that contain 19,596 human genes. In addition to already described up-regulated mRNAs in cholesteatoma, such as MMP9, DEFB2 and KRT19, we identified 3558 new cholesteatoma-related transcripts. 811 genes appear to be significantly differentially up-regulated in cholesteatoma. 334 genes were down-regulated more than 2-fold. Significantly regulated genes with protein metabolism activity include matrix metalloproteinases as well as PI3, SERPINB3 and SERPINB4. Genes like SPP1, KRT6B, PRPH, SPRR1B and LAMC2 are known as genes with cell growth and/or maintenance activity. Transport activity genes and signal transduction genes are LCN2, GJB2 and CEACAM6. The three cell communication genes are CDH19 and genes belonging to the S100 family.

DESIGN
Two samples from each patient (cholesteatoma vs. normal auditory canal skin) for each two-colour hybridisation experiment
