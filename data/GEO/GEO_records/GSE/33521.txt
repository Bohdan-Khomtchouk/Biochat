TITLE
Gene expression profile of normoxic versus hypoxic HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify new primary HIF target genes we cultured HeLa cells under short period (6 hours) of mild hypoxia (1% oxygen)

DESIGN
Hypoxia-induced gene expression in HeLa cells was measured after 6h exposure to 1% oxygen and compare to normoxic

PLATFORM
