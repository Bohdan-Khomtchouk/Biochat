TITLE
Gene expression in phagocytic and non-phagocytic Entamoeba histolytica populations

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
The ability of Entamoeba histolytica to phagocytose host cells correlates to observed virulence in vivo. To better understand the mechanism of phagocytosis we used paramagnetic beads coated with host ligand and sorted trophozoites based on phagocytic ability. Gene expression was then measured in both the sorted phagocytic and non-phagocytic populations using a custom Affymetrix chip for E. histolytica.

DESIGN
M280 Streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were labeled with 20ug/mL biotinylated Human C1q (Quidel). Entamoeba histolytica (strain HM1) were washed twice with PBS then resuspended with the labeled beads at a 10:1 ratio of beads to trophozoites. Samples were  incubated at 37Â°C for 45 minutes, washed twice with agitation to remove adherent beads, then resuspended in MACS buffer. Samples were loaded into magnetic columns (Miltenyi Biotec) and trophozoites were seperated according to manufacturer's protocols. phagocytic vs. non-phagocytic Entamoeba histolytica populations
