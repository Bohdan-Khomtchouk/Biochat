TITLE
Disease Model of GATA4 Mutation Reveals Transcription Factor Cooperativity in Human Cardiogenesis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heterozygous mutations in GATA4 cause congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy through unknown mechanisms. To gain insights into the genome-wide localization perturbations during human cardiac development due to GATA4 heterozygosity, we performed ChIP-seq of  wildtype and GATA4-G296S diseased cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
ChIP sequencing of GATA4, TBX5, MED1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, plus input, from 75 wildtype or diseased pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
