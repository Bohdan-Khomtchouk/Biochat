TITLE
Effect of swim-training on caudal fin development in zebrafish larvae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Genome-wide microarray analysis of the effects of swim-training on caudal fin development in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish were subjected to swim-training from 5 days post fertilization (dpf) until 10  dpf. Subsequently, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis on the caudal fins of control and trained fish at 10 dpf. The goal of the project was to investigate the effects of swim-training on the gene expression level during caudal fin development in zebrafish larvae.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control vs trained fish. RNA was isolated from pooled caudal fins of 15 control fish (in duplo: pooled control samples (C2 and C3)) and of 15 trained fish (in duplo: pooled trained samples( T2 and T3)). Subsequently, each pooled RNA sample of control and trained caudal fins was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 in order to correct for dye bias. We included a technical replicate of the labeled C2 and T2 samples.
