TITLE
microRNA expression data of a paired fibrosarcoma with ESCC samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detected the expression of miRNA in a fibrosarcoma with ESCC sample and the corresponding normal esophagus tissue. Then, we identified the differentially expressed miRNAs in this rare disease.

DESIGN
miRNA molecular in total RNA was labeled by miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit (Cat#5190-0456, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturer’s instructions, labeling section. Each slide was hybridized with 100ng Cy3-labeled RNA using miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit(Cat#5190-0456, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US)in hybridization Oven(Cat#G2545A, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US)at 55℃，20rpm for 20 hours according to the manufacturer’s instructions, hybridization section. After hybridization, slides were washed in staining dishes (Cat#121, Thermo Shandon, Waltham, MA, US) with Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit(Cat#5188-5327, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).Slides were scanned by Agilent Microarray Scanner(Cat#G2565BA，Agilent  technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US)and Feature Extraction software 10.7 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US)with default settings. Raw data were normalized by Quantile algorithm, Gene Spring Software 11.0(Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).
