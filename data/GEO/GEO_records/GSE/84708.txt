TITLE
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) during bovine monocyte-derived macrophage infection: untreated vs. bafilomcyin A1 treatment

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis K-10

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis inside bovine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs; in vitro infection) during phagosome acidification at 30 min post-infection. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis profiles from bafilomcyin A1 (acidification inhibitor) treated and untreated monocyte-derived macrophages were compared.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment; 3 control (bafilomcyin treated) and 3 test, independently conducted. 1 control, 1 test per microarray.
