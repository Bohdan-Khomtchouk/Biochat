TITLE
mRNA Sequencing of Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and Control Samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IPF (n=20) and control (n=19) samples were obtained through the LTRC and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 following TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 library preparation.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional samples were analyzed. IPF diagnosis was based on American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society criteria, and all IPF samples displayed typical patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia. RNA libraries were prepared from 200 ng of high quality total RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The concentration and size distribution of TruSeq libraries was determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Santa Clara, CA), and a final quantification, using Qubit fluorometry (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was conducted to confirm sample concentration. Libraries were loaded onto paired end flow cells at concentrations of 8-10 pM to generate cluster densities of 700,000/mm2 following Illumina’s standard protocol using the Illumina cBot and cBot Paired end cluster kit version 3. The flow cells were sequenced as 51 X 2 paired end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using TruSeq SBS sequencing kit version 3 and SCS version 1.4.8 data collection software. Base-calling was performed using Illumina’s RTA version 1.12.4.2.
