TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila melanogaster E2f/Rb genetic pathway manipulation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that the cell cycle regulators, E2f /Dp and Rb, control the transcription of ribosomal proteins (RP) in Drosophila embryos.  Mutation of E2f1 or Dp and over expression of Rbf1 increase and reduce RP transcription, respectively.  Although E2f/Dp/Rb might exert this effect through a repressor complex, the regulatory regions of RP genes do not show an enrichment of canonical E2f binding sites.  In addition, E2f1, Dp and Rbf1 also regulate the expression of RACK1, a ribosomal component and a negative regulator of cell cycle progression.  These findings strengthen the coupling of cell cycle regulation to protein biosynthesis. Keywords: genotype response

DESIGN
Our study examines the genomic response of intact Drosophila embryos to the genetic manipulation of E2F/Rb pathway molecules.  For over-expression experiments, Arm-Gal4 stocks were crossed to UAS-gene stocks for the following genes: E2f1/Dp, E2f2/Dp, Rbf1, and E2f1336-805 (a dominant negative form of E2f1 lacking the DNA binding domain) [16].  The E2f17172 and E2f191 null alleles were balanced by TM3[Kr-GFP].  Dpa2 and Dpa4 null alleles were balanced by CyO[Kr-GFP].  14-16 hr E2f17172/E2f191 null mutant embryos were hand selected based on the absence of fluorescent Bolwigâ€™s organs in Kr-GFP balanced stocks using a Zeiss stereomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence.  E2f17172/E2f191 and Dpa2/Dpa4 null mutant embryos (8-10h) were selected using the COPASTM SELECT system for automated sorting of multi-cellular organisms. Eighteen RNA samples, two from each cross, were obtained from approximately 200 to 700 embryos per sample.  For each cross, 2 h embryo collections were aged for 8 to 14 h at 25oC, quick frozen in an ethanol/dry ice mixture, and stored at -80 oC.  The RNA was prepared for microarray analysis in accordance with Affymetrix instructions.
