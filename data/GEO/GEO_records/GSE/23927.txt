TITLE
microRNAs associated with bromocriptine-treated prolactinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the function of microRNA in prolactinomas treated with bromocriptine. The aim of the study was to explore the microRNAs associated with bromocriptine-treated prolactinomas.

DESIGN
Six samples are analyzed, no replicates are included.A common reference consisted of a mix of the products that was spotted on the array.

PLATFORM
