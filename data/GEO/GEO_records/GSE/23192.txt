TITLE
Integration of metabolism and virulence by Clostridium difficile CodY

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile 630

SUMMARY
CodY, a global regulatory protein that monitors the nutrient sufficiency of the environment by responding to the intracellular levels of GTP and the branched-chain amino acids, was previously shown to be a potent repressor of toxin gene expression in Clostridium difficile during growth in rich medium. In the intestinal tract, such derepression of toxin synthesis may lead to destruction of epithelial cells and the liberation of potential nutrients for the bacterium. CodY is likely to play an important role in regulating overall cellular physiology as well. In this study, DNA microarray analysis and affinity purification of CodY-DNA complexes were used to identify and distinguish the direct and indirect effects of CodY on global gene transcription. A codY null mutation resulted in > 4-fold overexpression of 146 genes (organized in 82 apparent transcription units) and underexpression of 19 genes. In addition to the toxin genes, genes for amino acid biosynthesis, nutrient transport, fermentation pathways, membrane components and surface proteins were overexpressed in the codY mutant. Genome-wide analysis identified more than 350 CodY binding regions, many of which are likely to correspond to sites of direct CodY-mediated regulation. About 60%  of the CodY-repressed transcription units were associated with binding regions. Several of these genes were confirmed to be direct targets of CodY by gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays.
