TITLE
CD8+ T cell gene expression after different antigen dose stimulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify the human T cell response toward different antigen doses. Fresh isolated CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with influenza M1 peptide-loaded autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells for 2 weeks. A high M1 peptide antigen dose (10uM on moDC, HD1-5) and an optimal antigen dose (10nM on moDC OD1-5) were used. M1-specific CD8 T cells were tetramer sorted at the end of the 2 weeks. RNA was extracted and analyzed for gene expression using Agilent 8X60K gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
5 independent samples from 3 different HLA A2+ blood donors.
