TITLE
Comparison of Glomerular Transcriptome Profiles of Adult-Onset Steroid Sensitive Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis and Minimal Change Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To search for biomarkers to differentiate Adult-Onset Steroid Sensitive  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD).

DESIGN
Compared the profiles of glomerular transcriptomes between patients with FSGS and patients with MCD using microarray analysis.
