TITLE
DNA damage response pathways after 30 minutes and 4 hours treatment with 500 μM Na2S in intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a metabolic endproduct of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the large intestine, represents a genotoxic insult to the colonic epithelium, which may also be linked with chronic disorders such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. The present study defined the early (30 minutes) and late (4 hours) response of non-transformed human intestinal epithelial cells (FHs 74 Int) to sulfide. We measured the genotoxicity of Na2S using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Changes in gene expression were analyzed after exposure to a genotoxic–but not cytotoxic–concentration of sulfide (500 μM Na2S) using pathway specific quantitative RT-PCR gene arrays.
