SUMMARY
Haemophilus parasuis(HPS) is a prominent swine pathogen that causes Gl√§sser's disease characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood, particularly the host counteraction to HPS invasion by the immune system. Here, we  investigated the global expression changes in spleen following HPS infection using the Affymetrix Porcine Genechip.Our findings indicate  previously unrecognized gene transcription changes in case of HPS infection in vivo and many presumed cascades in the study are clearly merit further investigation. Our data should provide new clues for immune response in mammals and identification of candidate genes related to HPS resistance.
