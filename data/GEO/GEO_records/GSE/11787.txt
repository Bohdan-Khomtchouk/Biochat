Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Haemophilus parasuis(HPS) is a prominent swine pathogen that causes Glässer's disease characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood, particularly the host counteraction to HPS invasion by the immune system. Here, we  investigated the global expression changes in spleen following HPS infection using the Affymetrix Porcine Genechip.Our findings indicate  previously unrecognized gene transcription changes in case of HPS infection in vivo and many presumed cascades in the study are clearly merit further investigation. Our data should provide new clues for immune response in mammals and identification of candidate genes related to HPS resistance.

DESIGN
All animal tissue collection procedures were performed according to  protocols approved by The Hubei Province, PR China for Biological Studies Animal Care and Use Committee. Piglets at 30 days old were determined to be HPS-free by serum indirect haemagglutination test before artificial bacterial challenges. Each piglet was intratracheally challenged with 5×108 colony-forming units (CFU) per millilitre of HPS strain 0165 (serotype 5) . A total of 5 piglets were challenged, and 5  pigs were used as controls. These two groups were raised in isolated facilities. Six microarrays were used in the experiment, corresponding to the RNAs from spleen tissues of three most severe piglets with fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis after HPS infection and three controls.
