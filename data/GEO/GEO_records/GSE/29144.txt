TITLE
Gene expression profiles after knockdown of Nardilysin in TMK-1 gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nardilysin (NRDc), a metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family, has been reported to promote the ectodomain shedding and resulting activation of various growth factors and cytokines, but its role in cancer biology have not been elucidated. Microarray experiments were performed to analyze the chnages of gene expression profiles after knockdown of NRDc by microRNA (miR)-based RNA interference (RNAi).

DESIGN
RNAi experiments were perfomed using BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit with EmGFP (Invitrogen).  TMK-1 cells stably expressing conrol or NRDc-targeting miR vector were established.
