TITLE
Expression of microRNAs in rat kidney treated with a carcinogenic dose of Aristolochic Acid

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Aristolochic Acid (AA), a natural component of Aristolochia plants found in a variety of herbal remedies and health supplements, is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In order to search for miRNA regulation in AA-induced carcinogenesis, we treated rats with 10 mg/kg AA and vehicle control for 12 weeks and eight kidney samples (4 for the treatment and 4 for the control) were used for examining miRNA by deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Profiliing of miRNA in 4 AA-treated rats and 4 control

PLATFORM
GPL10287 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Rattus norvegicus)
