TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana Wild-type vs. mutant sdg2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis wild-type (Col0) control seedlings with corresponding mutant seedlings is performed using Aligent's Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K).

DESIGN
15-day-old seedlings of wild-type Col0 control _vs_ 15-day-old seedlings of mutant sdg2-1. Three biological replicates. One replicate per array.
