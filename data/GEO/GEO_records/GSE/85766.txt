TITLE
Cellular model of colon cancer progression reveals signatures of mRNAs, miRNA, lncRNAs and epigenetic modifications associated with metastasis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K79me3 profiling of a cellular model of colorectal cancer progression, which is based on four defined derivates of a CRC cell line that resulted from EMT/MET transitions and phenotypically recapitulate the metastatic cascade: epithelial-like primary tumor, mesenchymal-like tumor cells growing in soft agar or as colonospheres, and mouse xenografts of the latter resulting in lung-metastasis comprised of epithelial-state cells.

DESIGN
H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K79me3

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
