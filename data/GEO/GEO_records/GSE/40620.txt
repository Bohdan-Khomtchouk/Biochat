TITLE
Gene expression in Xenopus laevis embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole body of unfertilized eggs and two-cell stage, 16-cell stage, stage 8, stage 9, stage 10.5, stage 12, stage 15, stage 20, stage 25, stage 30, stage 35 and stage 40 embryos. Results provide insight into the global molecular changes in Xenopus embryogenesis.

DESIGN
