TITLE
Genome Wide Characterization of Genome Organization in Mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes. We used a new method to determine interactions between different chromatin regions genome-wide. Using a simple statistical model, we determine the subset of those interactions which represent stable contacts. We find an enrichment in contacts between active genes, between Polycomb-repressed genes, between enhancer elements and between enhancers and active genes.

DESIGN
We used a new method to detect interactions from 490 46C Mouse ES cell derived samples
