TITLE
Discovery of PDE7B as a novel effector of GBM growth by computational deconvolution of an in vitro physical coculture system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell-to-cell interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment are critical determinants of tumor tissue biology and therapeutic responses. Interactions between glioblastoma (GBM) cells and endothelial cells (ECs) establish a purported stem cell niche. We hypothesized that genes that mediate these interactions would be important, particularly as therapeutic targets. Using a novel computational approach to deconvoluting expression data from mixed physical coculture of GBM cells and ECs, we identified upregulation of the cAMP specific phosphodiesterase PDE7B  in GBM cells in response to ECs. We further found that elevated PDE7B expression occurs in most GBM cases and has a negative effect on survival.  PDE7B overexpression resulted in the expansion of a stem-like cell subpopulation, increased tumor aggressiveness,  and increased growth in an intracranial GBM model.  This deconvolution algorithm provides a new tool for cancer biology, and these results identify PDE7B as a therapeutic target in GBM.
