TITLE
Copy number variation of human intestinal stem cells with different passage in culture (two pedigrees, passage 5, 10, 15 and 20)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and other columnar epithelia collectively resist cloning in their elemental states. Here we demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, “ground state” stem cells of the human intestinal and colon. To assess the genomic stability of our intestinal stem cells, we serially passaged two independent intestinal stem cell pedigrees derived from the ileum of one late fetal demise case and tested them after 50 (passage 5; P5), 100 (P10), 150 (P15) and 200 days (P20) of continuous proliferation. DNA from cells at these passages cells was analyzed by SNP array based copy number variation analysis (CNV).  Although at P15 and P20,  partial aneuploidy in some of pedigrees was observed, there are almost no CNVs at P5 and P10 in both pedigrees.

DESIGN
SNP array based copy number variation study was performed for 2 pedigrees from human fetal ileal stem cells (passage 5, 10, 15 and 20) to assess genomic stability at chromosomal level.
