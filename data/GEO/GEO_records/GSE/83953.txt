TITLE
Transcriptional signature in rat colonocytes in response to a high protein diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
High protein diet alter gut microbiota composition and activity. The objective of this study is to determine the consequences of a high protein diet for the colonic epithelium in rats.

DESIGN
Wistar male  rats were fed a normal or a high protein diet  (NP and HP) during 15 days. At the end of the dietary intervention, colonocytes were isolated and RNA extracted.
