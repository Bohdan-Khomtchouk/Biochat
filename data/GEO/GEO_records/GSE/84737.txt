TITLE
Macrophage transcriptional profile identifies lipid catabolic pathways that can be therapeutically targeted after spinal cord injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the RiboTag method to obtain macrophage-specific mRNA directly from injured spinal cord and performed RNA sequencing to investigate the translational profiles. Our data show that macrophages at 3 days after SCI are enriched in genes related to cell migration and cytokine signaling. However, at 7 days, lipid catabolism represents the main biological process, and we identify canonical nuclear receptor pathways as potential mediators of lipid catabolism in macrophages.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of macrophages from 3 and 7 days post contusive spinal cord injury.
