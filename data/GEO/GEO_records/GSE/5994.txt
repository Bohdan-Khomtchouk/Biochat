TITLE
Gene expression in the liver following exposition to 1Gy ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although major differences in the response of tissues were documented in the literature, the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue radiosensitivity are still fragmentary and need to be study more thoroughly. To this end, a genome wide analysis strategy was used to investigate changes in gene expression in the liver following exposition to ionizing radiation. This follows the tissue survey that was previously initiated with other organs and tends to obtain a comprehensive picture of the molecular events underlying tissue radio sensitivity. Keywords: Ionizing radiation response

DESIGN
totalRNA sample from irradiated liver was hybridized against totalRNA sample from non-irradiated liver. 8 dye-swaps have been done.
