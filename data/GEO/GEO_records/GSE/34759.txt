TITLE
Estrogen-responsive Estrogen Receptor alpha binding sites in MCF-7 by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) binding sites by ChIP-seq in MCF-7 breast cancer cells following an estrogen treatment. This study describes molecular effects of estradiol treatment and subsequent regulation by ER for a single gene/locus. A public ER chipseq (available in SRA as ERR011973), in addition to our own data, guided us to regulatory regions were ER was binding that were then analyzed in detail using " manual " ChIP.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were treated for 1 h either 10 nm estradiol (E2) or vehicle (ethanol) and subjected to ChIP using antibodies against ERa or IgG.
