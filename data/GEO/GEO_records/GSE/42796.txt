TITLE
Genetic interactions between SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 and ABSCISIC ACID HYPERSENSITIVE1/CAP-BINDING PROTEIN80 affecting fertilization, embryogenesis, germination, flowering time, and powdery mildew resistance

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis ABA HYPERSENSITIVE1 (ABH1) / CAP-BINDING-PROTEIN80 functions in cap-binding, splicing, ABA and stress response signaling and in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs).  SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 (SGS3) plays a crucial role in post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS).  We show that abh1 sgs3 double mutant manifests pleiotropic phenotypes including altered ABA sensitivity in seed germination, fused cotyledons, delayed growth in root initiation and leaf production, accelerated juvenile-to-adult phase transition and flowering time, short and bent siliques with ectopic carpelloid tissues, reduced seed set due to altered carpel structure and pollen tube growth, and increased resistance to powdery mildew infection. A systems approach using meta-analysis of whole genome tiling microarray datasets for mutants of PTGS, RNA processing, and responses to environmental stress was taken to design a 135k feature custom microarray to probe the molecular bases of these phenotypes.  Results confirmed documented effects of ABA or abh1 on precursor MIRNA expression (pre-MIR159, pre-MIR168) and identified novel miRNAs and their targets regulated by ABA (pre-MIR408, LACCASE12 and -13; pre-MIR824) or elevated in abh1 sgs3 double mutant (pre-MIR156A,C; pre-MIR164B, pre-MIR167A, pre-MIR408, At5g15845/CONSTANS-LIKE1-cis-NAT-RNA). miR156 targets SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER-BINDING-PROTEIN-LIKE genes that spawn siRNAs and control phase change; miR164 targets CUP-SHAPED-COTYLEDON1 and -2 genes; miR166 methylates target PHABULOSA genomic DNA in trans; miR167 targets AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 which regulate both female and male reproduction; miR408 targets a plantacyanin which is expressed predominantly in the transmitting tract of the pistil and affects pollen tube guidance on the stigma. We also identified sgs3 by ABA interactions on gene expression which reveal potential nodes in regulatory networks linking ABA, mRNA processing and PTGS with development.

DESIGN
24 RNA samples; four genotypes (control Col-0; sgs3; abh1, sgs3 abh1 double mutant) each with and without 30 micromolar ABA treatment for 3 hr.  Three biological replicates per genotype and treatment.  Two color strand-specific labeling of cRNA, hybridized in 'round robin' factorial hybridization scheme to 12 arrays on technical duplicate slides for a total of 48 datasets.
