MiR-199a-5p determines fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrogenesis

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and often fatal pulmonary disorder characterized by fibroblast proliferation and the excess deposit of extracellular matrix proteins. The etiology of IPF is unknown, but a central role for microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs, has been recently suggested. We report the upregulation of miR-199a-5p in mouse lungs undergoing bleomycin-induced fibrosis and also in human biopsies from IPF patients. Levels of miR-199a-5p were increased selectively in myofibroblasts and putative profibrotic effects of miR-199a-5p were further investigated in cultured lung fibroblasts. MiR-199a-5p expression was induced upon TGFÎ² exposure and ectopic expression of miR-199a-5p was sufficient to promote the pathogenic activation of pulmonary fibroblasts. CAV1, a critical mediator of pulmonary fibrosis, was established as a bona fide target of miR-199a-5p. Finally, we also found an aberrant expression of miR-199a-5p in mouse models of kidney and liver fibrosis, suggesting that dysregulation of miR-199a-5p represents a general mechanism contributing to the fibrotic process. We propose miR-199a-5p as a major regulator of fibrosis that represents a potential therapeutic target to treat fibroproliferative diseases.
