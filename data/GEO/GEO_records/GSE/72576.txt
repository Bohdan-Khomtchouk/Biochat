TITLE
Skeletal muscle gene expression after high-fat diet with or without endothelial-directed deletion of FoxO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a murine model of high-fat diet, Mx1-Cre was used to induce knockdown of forkhead box O 1,3 and 4 (FoxO 1,3 and 4) in the endothelium of adult mice. Skeletal muscle gene-expression was assessed after 8 weeks of high-fat diet in wild type versus FoxO knockdown mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from gastrocnemius muscle after 8 weeks of high-fat diet in male FVB/n mice harbouring an endothelial directed deletion of FoxO1/3/4 (Mx1-Cre+);FoxO1,3,4L/L) (n=8) and corresponding MxCre-;FoxO1,3,4L/L littermates (n=8).
