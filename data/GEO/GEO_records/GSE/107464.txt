TITLE
The influence of the Chelidonium majus extract NSC-631570 and Chelidonine on gene expression in the head and neck carcinoma cell line FaDu

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been shown, that the Chelidonium majus extract NSC-631570 has growth and invasion inhibiting properties on head and neck carcinoma cell lines. The affymetrix prime view array was used to gain a first view on the influence of NSC-631570 and chelidonine on gene expression of head and neck cancer cells.

DESIGN
FaDu cells were grown for 48 hrs with or without the EC50 dose of NSC-631570, EC50 dose of chelidonine and 10 ÂµM chelidonine

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
