TITLE
CGH: NAM parent lines vs. Wm82-ISU-01

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean nested association mapping (NAM) parent lines were compared by CGH to catalog structurally variant (e.g. deletion and duplication) regions among these genotypes. The CGH comparisons reveal reveal putative deletions and duplications among the 41 lines.

DESIGN
NAM parent lines were compared through a common reference, Wm82-ISU-01 (this is a sub-line isolated from the cultivar Williams 82 stock).  Each NAM parent line was represented by a single individual plant.  The reported values show the log2 ratio of the normalized NAM parent line hybridization signals (Cy3) over the normalized Wm82-ISU-01 hybridization signal (Cy5).
