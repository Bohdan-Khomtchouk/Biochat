TITLE
Investigating genes regulated by mir-155 in a mouse macrophage cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of the development and function of the immune system. Here, we report a strong but transient induction of miR-155 in mouse bone marrow after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated with granulocyte/monocyte (GM) expansion. Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease. These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Construct stable RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell lines expressing mir-155 or empty vector. RNA is extracted and global gene expression analysis performed to identify mir-155 regulated mRNAs.
