TITLE
Characterisation of Two New Th17-Subsets with Distinct Contribution to HIV-1 Persistence under Antiretroviral Therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Th17 cells act as the first line of defense against pathogens at mucosal surfaces. Their paucity during HIV infection causes disease progression. Here, we reveal the existence of two new CCR6+CD161+ subsets, CCR4-CXCR3- (DN; double negative) and CCR4+CXCR3+ (DP; double positive), expressing typical Th17 transcripts (e.g., RORγt, RORα, PTPN13, ARNTL), C. albicans specificity, and exhibiting Th17-lineage commitment versus flexibility.

DESIGN
4 cell populations from up to 6 donors for a total of 20 samples.

PLATFORM
