TITLE
Global analysis of mRNA expression in prospectively purified human prostate orthotopic xenograft tumor cells with varying S/TFE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human prostate CWR22 OT-tumor cells were prospectively purified for expression of various stem cell markers (TRA-1-60/CD151/CD166/EpCAM/CD44/Î±2-Integrin). Unsorted total tumor cells or the additional marker positive cells that do not manifest stem-like characteristics were used as control. All these cells were subjected to molecular profiling of total RNA expression and the fold change data are tabulated according to S/TFE of the purified cells in relation to their control. Notes: Low S/TFE   = Low sphere and tumor forming efficiency; Moderate S/TFE  = Moderate sphere and tumor forming efficiency;  High S/TFE   = High sphere and tumor forming efficiency; FDR*    = False Discovery Rate;  FC    = Fold Change;  Signal    = Average Expression Signal Level.

DESIGN
Low-S/TFE, Moderate S/TFE, High S/TFE data sets were compared to No S/TFE control sets
