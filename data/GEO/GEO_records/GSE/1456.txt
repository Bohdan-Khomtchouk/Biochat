TITLE
Gene expression of breast cancer tissue in a large population-based cohort of Swedish patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue material was collected from all breast cancer patients receiving surgery at Karolinska Hospital from 1994-1996. Material was frozen immediatley on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen and stored in -70Â°C freezers. This series contains expression data for n=159 tumors from which RNA could be collected in sufficient amounts and quality for analysis. Keywords: breast cancer, expression profiling, predictive gene signature, molecular classification of cancecr
