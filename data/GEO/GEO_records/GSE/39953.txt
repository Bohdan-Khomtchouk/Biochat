TITLE
IFIT2 mediates IFN signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IFit2 is highly induced in response to type I and type II interferons, dsRNA, LPS, viral and bacterial infections and it is als found in several chronic diseases.A possible role for the protein in cell proliferation, virion assembly/transport and microtubule dynamices was described. This study focus on IFIT2 proinflammatory cytokine response which might be involved in the development of septic shock. In the IFIT2 knockout mice gene expression levels before and after OVA challenge were analysed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 3-4 male mutant mice (challenged/un-challenged) was compared to 4 wild type controls (challenged/unchallenged).

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
