TITLE
Region specific gene expression profiling along the human epididymis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression pattern in the caput, corpus and cauda epididymides of three donors of 26-50 years of age with no medical pathologies that could affect reproductive function. The data generated in this study demonstrate a region specific gene expression pattern along the human epididymis that seems to coincide with the morphological distinctive features of the excurrent duct. Keywords: Tissue compartements comparison

DESIGN
Epididymides were dissected in caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis from three donors: ages 26, 47, and 50 yrs. Expression profiles were generated on Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (9 samples total).
