TITLE
Identification of Six Potential Markers for the Detection of Circulating Canine Mammary Tumor Cells in the Peripheral Blood

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Circulating tumor cells in the peripheral have proven to be independent prognostic factors for overall survival the monitoring of therapeutic success of human breast cancer patients. Postmortem morphologic evidence also points towards the presence of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of dogs with metastatic canine mammary tumors. However, the existence of these cells has not been verified in canines in vivo and they have not been isolated and characterized due to the lack of appropriate and canine specific detection methods. In the present study a panel of 73 genes with high expression levels in canine mammary carcinoma cells and but not in peripheral blood leukocytes were identified using microarray analysis. From this panel, six mRNA markers, AGR2, ATP8B1, CRYAB, F3 and IRX3, were expressed in canine mammary carcinoma cells but not in the peripheral blood of dogs. All six RT-PCR assays, were sensitive enough detect one carcinoma cell admixed in 106 or more peripheral blood leukocytes, a common concentration of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of human breast cancer patients. These five mRNA markers may therefore be used to detect canine mammary circulating tumor cells and to study their spatio-temporal presence in the peripheral blood of canine patients.

DESIGN
Two canine mammary carcinoma cell lines, CMM115 and CMM26, and peripheral blood samples of 3 healthy dog donors were used for microarray analysis. All blood donors were female, showed no signs of infectious or inflammatory disease and did not have mammary gland tumors or any other identifiable tumors at the time of collection. Furthermore, blood cell count and blood chemistry were unremarkable in all dogs.
