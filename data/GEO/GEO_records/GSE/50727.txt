TITLE
Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present genome-wide high-coverage genotyping data on a panel of 85 human samples from Eurasia that are used in addition to public data in studing the genomic context of  a 24 kya old DNA sample from Southern Siberia that was sequenced to the avwerage depth of 1X.

DESIGN
85 samples were analysed with the Illumina platforms Human610-Quad v1.0, HumanHap650Yv3 (HumanHap650Yv3_A) and Human660W-Quad v1.0 Genotyping BeadChips and are described herein.
