TITLE
Differential expression analysis of HFF cells in G0 phase compared to cells in G1 [MAT]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome differential expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide changes occurring at the transition from G0 phase to G1 phase detected. Expression data and fold changes were processed with MAT (Johnson et al., " Model-based analysis of tiling-arrays for ChIP-chip. " Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103:12457-62, 2006.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set each for HFF cells in G0 phase and cells in G1 phase
