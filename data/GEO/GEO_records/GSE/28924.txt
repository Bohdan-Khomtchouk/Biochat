TITLE
Gene expression in natural killer cells specifically recruited to lymph nodes by tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Fukuda's laboratory focuses on the cellular and molecular biology of cell surface glycoproteins in development and cancer with a secial emphasis on immune and neural systems.

DESIGN
Experiment to determine the genes upregulated in natual killer cells specifically recruited to lymph nodes by tumors Genes upregulated in natual killer cells specifically recruited to lymph nodes by tumors were determine via gene expression analysis Mouse RNA from control mouse NK cell, isolated from spleen, and NK cells isolated from B16 melanoma-bearing lymph nodes, was isolated and prepared in 5 paired samples. RNA was labeled and hybridized to the GLYCOv2 array. Resulting Gene expression patterns were analyzed.
