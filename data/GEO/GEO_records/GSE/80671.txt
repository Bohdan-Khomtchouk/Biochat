TITLE
Gene expression changes upon Mof knockout in MLL-AF9 transformed murine LSKs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report Illumina next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of MLL-AF9 in vitro transformed murine LSKs upon genetic deletion of Mof. These gene expression data illustrate that Mof regulates the expression of genes involved in DNA damage response and chromatin stability in MLL-AF9 transformed cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq comparing Mof homozygous knockout cells to Mof wild type control

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
