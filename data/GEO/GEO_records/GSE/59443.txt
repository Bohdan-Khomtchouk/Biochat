TITLE
GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF FIBROLAMELLAR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA REVEALS A UNIQUE MOLECULAR PROFILE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer usually developed in non-cirrhotic livers of children and young adults with unknown etiology. Treatment is limited to surgical intervention. To date, molecular pathogenesis of FLC has been poorly characterized. A cohort of FLCs was analyzed through SNP-array. GISTIC algorithm identified chromosomal aberrations.

DESIGN
FLC tumors corresponding to 25 different patients. In all cases, tumor and corresponding non-tumor samples were frozen (-80Â°C) after hepatic resection at diagnosis. Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis was done using Illumina HumanHap370CNV Genotyping BeadChip SNP array

PLATFORM
GPL6986 Illumina HumanCNV370-Duov1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (HumanCNV370v1)
