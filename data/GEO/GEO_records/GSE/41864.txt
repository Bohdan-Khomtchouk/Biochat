TITLE
Global analysis of the transcriptional difference between indigenous and invasive whiteflies reveals the possible mechanism of whitefly invasion

ORGANISM
Bemisia tabaci

SUMMARY
The whitefly Bemisa tabaci is a species complex of more than 31 cryptic species which include some of the most destructive invasive pests of many ornamental and glasshouse crops worldwide. Among them, Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (herein MEAM1) and Mediterranean (herein MED) have invaded many countries around the world and displaced the native whitefly species. However, the molecular differences between invasive and indigenous whiteflies remain largely unknown.

DESIGN
The global transcriptional difference between the two invasive whitefly Bemisia tabaci species (MEAM1, MED) and one indigenous whitefly species (Asia II 3) were analyzed using the Illumina sequencing technology.

PLATFORM
