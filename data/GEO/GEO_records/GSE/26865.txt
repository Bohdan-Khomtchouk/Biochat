TITLE
Gene expression profiling of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to benchmark digital gene expression (DGE) profiling by massively parallel sequencing against the most commonly used method for gene expression analysis. We compared the DGE levels to expression levels from Affymetrix arrays. Data from Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips was available for 12 of the 21 RNA samples from ALL patient cells analyzed by DGE.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression analysis of 12 primary ALL samples by Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips.

PLATFORM
