TITLE
The midguts transcriptome of Aedes aegypti (Liverpool strain) females knock down AaMesh and feed AaMesh antibody versus those knock down GFP and feed pre-immune.

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
We reported the RNA-seq based analyses of the transcriptional changes in the Aedes aegypti midguts knock down 3, 6days, feed antibody 18h transcriptome.

DESIGN
Comparison of the midguts transcriptome of Aedes aegypti females at two knockdown time points and one feed condition; GFP dsRNA-3 or -6days: 3 or 6 days after 7day-old mosquitos were microinjected GFP dsRNA AaMesh dsRNA-3 or -6days: 3 or 6 days after 7day-old mosquitos were microinjected AaMesh dsRNA Pre-immune-18h: 18hrs after 7day-old wild type mosquitos were fed with Pre-immune AaMesh antibody-18h: 18hrs after 7day-old wild type mosquitos were fed with AaMesh antibody
