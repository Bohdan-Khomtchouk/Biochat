TITLE
Expression data in liver from germ-free and conventional mice fed lard or fish oil for 11 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dietary lipids and gut microbiota may both influence adipose tissue physiology. By feeding conventional and germ-free mice high fat diets with different lipid compositon we aimed to investigate how dietary lipids and the gut microbiota interact to influence inflammation and metabolism in the liver

DESIGN
Wild-type C57Bl/6 male mice 11 weeks of age were fed isocaloric diets (45% kcal fat) with either menhaden fish oil (Research Diets, D05122102) or lard (Research Diets, D10011202) for 11 weeks. Liver samples were harvested at the end of the experiment and analyzed by microarray.
