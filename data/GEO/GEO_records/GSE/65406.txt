TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of germline tumor in fasted C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transciptomic analysis of germline tumor cells to understand the role of autophagy and neuronal differentiation in lifespan extension.

DESIGN
Methods: Worms were grown on control L444 seeded plates or gld-1 RNAi seeded plates and subjected to RNA isolation and sequencing using standard Illumina protocols. Conclusions: Fasting of animals expressing tumors increases their lifespan two-fold through autophagy and modular changes in transcription as well as metabolism.
