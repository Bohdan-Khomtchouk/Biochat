TITLE
Lipid engineering reveals regulatory roles for membrane fluidity in yeast flocculation and oxygen-limited growth

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in S. cerevisiae in response to OLE1 repression, SPT23 and MGA2 p90 expression, and hypoxic growth

DESIGN
9 samples (comprising 5 pairwise comparisons), three biological replicates per sample
