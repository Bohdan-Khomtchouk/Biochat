TITLE
Methylomic trajectories across human fetal brain development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dynamic changes to the epigenome mediate key neurobiological and cognitive processes in the central nervous system, and also play a role in transcriptional regulation during brain development. Although the importance of DNA methylation in brain development is highlighted by the neurodevelopmental deficits associated with mutations in genes including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), our knowledge about the specific methylomic trajectories associated with human neurodevelopment is extremely limited. Here we report an analysis of genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in 179 human fetal brain samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 179 human brain samples was hybridized to the Illumina 450K Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
