TITLE
Early B-cell Factor 1 Regulates Adipocyte Morphology and Lipolysis in White Adipose Tissue [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examination of EBf1 binding by ChIP-seq in  differentiated human adipose stromal cell (hASC) pre-adipocyte

DESIGN
Pre-Adipocytes differentiated in-vitro were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and quenched for 5 min by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M. ChIP assays were then performed with custom-made EBF1 antibody or rabbit IgG . ChIP-sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBnext chip-seq library Prep master mix set  from 5 ng of anti-EBF1 and anti-IgG ChIP DNA, respectively. Sequence data were generated with Illumina HiSeq 2000 single-read sequencing and aligned against the human genome (hg19, NCBI).
