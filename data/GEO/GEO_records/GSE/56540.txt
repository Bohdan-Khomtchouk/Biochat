TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in radio-resistant and radio-sensitive patient-derived spheroid cultures of small cell carcinoma of the cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We  established panels of patient-derived culture of the cancer cells from small cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri (SCCC) by cancer tissueâ€“originated spheroids (CTOS) method. Then we developed in vitro sensitivity assay for radiation using CTOSs to assess the intrinsic radio-sensitivity and mechanism of radio-resistance in individual SCCC patients. To find factors that affect to the radio-sensitivity we compared gene expression of radio-resistant CTOS (cerv-5) and radio-sensitive CTOS (cerv-9).

DESIGN
We compared gene expression of cerv5 and cerv9 CTOSs under the culture condition.
