TITLE
Time-series DNA occupancy during the yeast respiratory cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We use metabolically synchronous, continuously-grown yeast cultures to measure DNA occupancy and track the global patterns with respect to the metabolic state of the culture, showing a genome-wide nucleosome focusing in the reductive phase, followed by clearance of the promoter regions

DESIGN
32 timepoints protein-bound (pDNA) vs. genomic (gDNA) over 3 respiratory cycles + 3 MNase-digested naked DNA control samples.

PLATFORM
GPL19046 Yeast_WG
