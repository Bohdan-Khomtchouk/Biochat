TITLE
RNA sequencing of mechanically strained NHEKs and control NHEKs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from NHEKs that had been subjected to cyclic biaxial mechanical strain at 100 mHz for 12h together with unstrained control NHEKs, 3 biological replicates each

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in control and mechanically strained NHEKs
