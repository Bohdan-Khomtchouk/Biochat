TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling Reveals Biological Insights into the Pathophysiology of Waldenströms macroglobulinemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Waldenströms macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder with apparent morphologic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity and its origins are still poorly understood. In this study, using Gene-Expression Profiling (GEP), we compared the global mRNA expression patterns of CD19+ WM B cells (WM-BC) and CD138+ WM plasma cells (WM-PC) with those of normal CD19+ peripheral blood B cells (PB-BC), tonsil-BC (T-BC), CD138+ T-PC and bone marrow PC (N-PC). Keywords: Comparison of different immological cells

DESIGN
The sample cohort studied consisted of CD19-selected peripheral blood B cells (PB-BC; n = 7), tonsil B cells (T-BC; n = 7), bone marrow B cells from WM (WM-BC; n = 12), tonsil plasma cells (T-PC; n = 9), bone marrow plasma cells from healthy donors (N-PC; n = 10), WM plasma cells (WM-PC, n = 9), and MM plasma cells (MM-PC; n = 11).
