TITLE
A mechanism for expansion of the regulatory T cell repertoire and its role in enforcing self-tolerance.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thymic Treg cells, mature non-Treg CD4+ single positive thymocytes, peripheral (spleen) resting and activated Treg cells were sorted from Foxp3-gfp reporter (wid type, WT) mice or Foxp3 enhancer CNS3 knockout (KO, carrying the same GFP reporter) mice. Total RNA was extracted and used for RNA sequencing to assess gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Two 6-8 week old littermates of male Foxp3-gfp and Foxp3Î”CNS3-gfp mice were used to sort Treg cells and conventional CD4+ T cells. Lymphocyte preparation and electronic sorting were performed at the same time. RNA extraction, SMART amplification, library preparation were conducted in parallel.

PLATFORM
