TITLE
PBRM1 Knockdown in RCC Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBRM1 was found to be mutated in a high percentage of clear cell RCCs. We performed knockdown of PBRM1 via siRNA and compared with scrambled control in three different RCC cell lines.

DESIGN
PBRM1 siRNA and mock treated cell lines were normalized together with 'hypoxic' clear cell renal tumors and normal renal tissue samples from GSE17818.
