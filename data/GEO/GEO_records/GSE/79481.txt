TITLE
Global profiling of microRNAs in peripheral blood and synovial fluid mononuclear cells of patients with Enthesitis Related Arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) is the most common category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Asia. MicroRNA dysregulation has been shown in chronic arthritides however there is no data in ERA. MicroRNA dysregulation in ERA may help understand the pathogenesis of disease. Thus we determined the difference  in global miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with ERA (n=8) as compared to healthy controls (HC) (n=8) and further to understand the changes at the site of inflammation, the PBMCs profile was compared with the synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) (n=8) of patients with ERA.
