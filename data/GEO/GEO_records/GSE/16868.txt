TITLE
Gene Expression between two cell layers in maize shoot apical meristem

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
All above ground organs of higher plants are ultimately derived from shoot apical meristems (SAMs). The SAM exhibits distinctive structural organization, and monocot SAMs such as maize are comprised of two cell layers, a single cell layered tunica (L1) and a corpus (L2).  Although recent research has revealed roles of these cell layers in the SAM, intra- and inter-cell-layer signaling networks involved in organ development remain largely unknown except for a few differentially expressed genes. Here, we used Illumnia technology to conduct RNA-seq of L1 and L2 cell layers in maize B73 maize shoot apical meristem.

DESIGN
Single sequencing library was constructed for L1 and L2 cell layer. Each library was sequenced using 2 lanes on a Solexa flow cell. Processed data file 'ZmB73_4a.53_filtered_genes.fasta' and its README file are linked below as supplementary files. The fasta file contains the gene model ID and corresponding sequence generated from maize genome project. This fasta file was used for the following samples: GSM418173, GSM418174, GSM420173, GSM420174, GSM422828, GSM422829.
