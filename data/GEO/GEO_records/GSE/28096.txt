TITLE
Histone exchange and histone H4 acetylation in wild-type and SET2 deletion yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-on chip assays to measure the change in histone exchange or histone acetylation over the yeast genome, in a SET2 deleted strain compared to the wild-type control. ChIP of Flag and Acetylated H4 from wild-type and SET2 deleted cells were normalized to the Myc enrichment.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. SET2 deletion vs. WT cells. Biological replicates=3 per IP per cell type.
