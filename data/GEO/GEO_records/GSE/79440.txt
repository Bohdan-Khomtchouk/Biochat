TITLE
Analysis of microRNAs from exosomes in serum of  the mice, or in medium from in vitro differentiated mature brown fat cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RT-PCR panels analysis of microRNAs expression in exosomes from the serum of wt mice, cold exposed mice or beta3 Adrenergic receptor agonist (CL-316.243) treated mice, and in exosomes from culture medium of mature brown adipocytes with or without cAMP treatment. Several microRNAs were identified as indicator correlated to brown adipocytes activity. The selected microRNAs may become potential biomarkers of brown fat activation in vivo
