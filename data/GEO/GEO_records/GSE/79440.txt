TITLE
Analysis of microRNAs from exosomes in serum of  the mice, or in medium from in vitro differentiated mature brown fat cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RT-PCR panels analysis of microRNAs expression in exosomes from the serum of wt mice, cold exposed mice or beta3 Adrenergic receptor agonist (CL-316.243) treated mice, and in exosomes from culture medium of mature brown adipocytes with or without cAMP treatment. Several microRNAs were identified as indicator correlated to brown adipocytes activity. The selected microRNAs may become potential biomarkers of brown fat activation in vivo

DESIGN
In vitro examination of exosomes from medium of mature brown adipocytes (BA-Exo; sample 1) and exosomes from medium of cAMP treated mature brown adipocytes (cAMP-BA-Exo; sample 2). In vivo examination of exosomes in serum from wild type mice (Serum-Exo#1 and Serum-Exo#2; sample 3 and sample 4), and serum from cold exposed mice (Cold-Serum-Exo#1 and Cold-Serum-Exo#2; sample 5 and sample 6), and serum from CL-316.243 treated mice (CL-Serum-Exo#1 and CL-Serum-Exo#2; sample 7 and sample 8)
