TITLE
THP-1 cells treated with CXCL14

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 cells are known to respond to CXCL14. To identfy transcriptional regulation of CXCL14 signalling, we analyse gene expression changed with CXCL14 treatment.

DESIGN
THP-1 treated with CXCL14 or PBS treated sample were used.
