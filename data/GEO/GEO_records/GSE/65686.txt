TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling for Wild Type and Itch-/- Skin Transcriptomes by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that defects in the termination of inflammatory signaling led to skin inflammation that results in the “Itchy” phenotype, we isolated RNA from the lesional skin of Itch-/- mice and from the skin of wild-type mice and performed genome-wide mRNA expression profiling by RNA sequencing. We ranked genes based on the fold change in their expression (increased or decreased) in Itch-/- skin relative to that in wild-type skin. The expression of several TNF–induced genes were increased in Itch-/- skin, including, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-11, IL-19, IL-1RL1, CCL4, CXCL3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CD14.
