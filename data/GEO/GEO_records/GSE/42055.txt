TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression differences from various stem cell enriched sub-populations of mouse mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression differences in four different sub-populations of mammary epithelial cells obtained through flow cytometry of stem cell markers for H2BGFP, CD24, and CD29. The present study aims to find the specific differences between these populations that influence their ability to repopulate mammary structures in vivo during transplantation assays. H2GFP+/CD24+/CD29lo cells were found to be multipotent and able to give rise to mammary structures capable of lactation, and this ability increased dramatically if the recipient mice were pregnant.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted sub-populations of mammary epithelial cells.
