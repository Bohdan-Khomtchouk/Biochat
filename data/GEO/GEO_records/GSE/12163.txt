TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy in wild type and histone H3(A111G) yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We screened for histone H3 mutations that cause derepression of the uninduced CHA1 promoter and identified six mutants, including one, H3(A111G), that causes a constitutively active chromatin configuratin at the uninduced CHA1 promoter.  We examined genomewide nucleosome occupancy in the A111G mutant and compared it to wild type yeast; that is the data deposited here. Keywords: Nucleosomal DNA from wild type and histone H3(A111G) mutant yeast
