TITLE
Decidual stromal cell response to paracrine signals from the trophoblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During the invasive phase of implantation, trophoblasts and maternal decidual stromal cells secrete products that regulate trophoblast differentiation and migration into the maternal endometrium.  Paracrine interactions between the extravillous trophoblast and the maternal decidua are important for successful embryonic implantation, including establishing the placental vasculature, anchoring the placenta to the uterine wall, and promoting immuno-acceptance of the fetal allograph.  Global cross-talk between the trophoblast and the decidua has not been elucidated to date, and the current study used a functional genomics approach to investigate these paracrine interactions. Our data demonstrate a significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as angiogenic/static factors in decidualized endometrial stromal cells in response to trophoblast-secreted products.  The data suggest that the trophoblast acts to alter the local immune environment of the decidua to facilitate the process of implantation and assure an enriched cytokine/chemokine environment, while limiting mitotic activity of the stromal cells during the invasive phase of implantation.
