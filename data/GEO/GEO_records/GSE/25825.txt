TITLE
Expression data from MxCre;E2F1-/-2-/-3f/f Cd11B myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying cause for the observed apoptosis in E2f1-3 deficient myeloid cells. We compared gene expression profiles of Cd11b+ sorted myeloid cells isolated from bone marrow of control (E2F1-/- ) and experimental (Mxcre;E2F1-/-2-/-3f/f ) mice.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from Cd11b cells from bone marrow of eight-week-old mice after FACS sorting with FITC- cojugated Cd11b antibody.
