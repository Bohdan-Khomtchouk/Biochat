TITLE
Gene expression changes in LPS-induced neuroinflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuroinflammation plays a role in the progression of several neurodegenerative disorders. We used a lipolysaccharide (LPS) model of neuroinflammation to characterize the gene expression changes underlying the inflammatory and behavioral effects of neuroinflammation. A single intracerebroventricular injection of LPS (5 ug) was administered into the lateral ventricle of mice and, 24 hours later, we examined gene expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using microarray technology. Gene Ontology (GO) terms for inflammation and the ribosome were significantly enriched by LPS, whereas GO terms associated with learning and memory had decreased expression. We detected 224 changed transcripts in the cerebral cortex and 170 in the hippocampus. Expression of Egr1 (also known as Zif268) and Arc, two genes associated with learning and memory, was significantly lower in the cortex, but not hippocampus, of LPS-treated animals. Overall, altered expression of these genes may underlie some of the inflammatory and behavioral effects of neuroinflammation.

DESIGN
Mice were given intracerebroventricular injections of saline vehicle (n = 4) or lipopolysaccharide (n = 4).  Twenty-four hours later, we dissected the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and processed the tissue for microarray analysis.  Gene expression changes observed in the microaray data were validated with quantitative real-time PCR.
