TITLE
Nuclease footprints in sperm project past and future chromatin regulatory events

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nuclear remodeling to an extreme condensed state is a hallmark of spermatogenesis. This is achieved by varied degrees of replacement of histones with protamines. Regions retaining nucleosomes may be of functional significance. To determine potential roles for somatic-like chromatin in the paternal gamete, sperm from wild type and transgenic mice harboring a single copy insert of the human protamine cluster were subjected to Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase)-seq. Nuclease footprints linked robust endogenous protamine transcription and transgene suppression to its chromatin environment. Murine footprints were enriched within regulatory regions and sequences expressed in the early embryo. These were highlighted by Ctcf footprints that were enriched within chromatin domain boundaries and sites bound in testes and ESCs. In contrast, Ctcf footprints were absent in human and bull sperm. The continuity of Ctcf binding through the murine germline may permit rapid reconstitution of chromatin organization following fertilization. This likely reflects its preparation for early zygotic genome activation and comparatively accelerated preimplantation embryonic development program observed in mouse as compared to human.

DESIGN
Mononucleosomal sperm DNAs from wild type and transgenic mice were released with micrococcal nuclease or DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Testis RNAs from transgenic mice were subjected to high-throughput sequencing.
