TITLE
RNA sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of luminal breast cancer cells and basal breast cancer cells Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conduct transcriptome comparison of lumianl breast cancer cells and basal cells to gain genomic insights on the biological processes. More than 3000 known genes were found changed in basal breast cancer cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis _IPA_ and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis _GSEA_ show that the prominent altered pathways in basal cells are related to regulation of actin-based motility, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression profiling of luminal breast cancer cellsMCF-7,T47D,BT-474 and basal breast cancer cells SUM-159,HBL-100,BT-549.  Total RNA was isolated . Each is tested in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
