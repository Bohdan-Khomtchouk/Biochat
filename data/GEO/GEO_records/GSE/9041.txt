TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids Ib

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Keywords: regulation of gene expression

DESIGN
We have performed a copy number analysis on 99 cell lines of the T31 Radiation Hybrid Panel using CGH microarrays.  Cell line 67 is not present.
