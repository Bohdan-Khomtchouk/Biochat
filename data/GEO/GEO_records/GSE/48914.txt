TITLE
Gene expression arrays of cardiomyocyte ribosome-associated RNAs during zebrafish heart regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
A transgenic line cmlc2:TRAP was made to express EGFP-fused ribosomal protein L10a (EGFP-L10a) in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. Then ribosome-associated RNAs were immuoprecipitated from uninjured and injured adult cmlc2:TRAP fish to determine the differential expression changes during zebrafish heart regeneration.

DESIGN
A nine chip study with cardiomyocyte ribosome associated RNAs  purified from three separate isolation of uninjured adult cmlc2:TRAP fish hearts, three separate isolation of 1 day post amupation (dpa) adult cmlc2:TRAP fish hearts, and three separate isolation of 7 dpa adult cmlc2:TRAP fish hearts.
