TITLE
Expression data from 36 KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas from the BATTLE-2 clinical trial.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include expression data from 36 KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas from Stage 1 of the BATTLE-2 trial, reflecting patients whose disease has relapsed or progresses following at least one front-line metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Tumor biopsy was performed following informed consent and prior to randomisation to one of the four possible treatment arms.

DESIGN
36 samples overall were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
