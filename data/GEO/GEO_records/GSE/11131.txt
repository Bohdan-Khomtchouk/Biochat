TITLE
16MB binding of H3ac, H4ac, STAT1, IRF1 antibodies in IFNg treated and untreated HeLa cells using nimblegen array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of H3ac, H4ac, STAT1 and IRF1 binding in IFNg treated and untreated HeLa cells for 6 hours was done using 50mer oligonucletide probes at 30bp intervals tiling over non-repetitive 16MB gene locus(HG17) Keywords: ChIP-chip
