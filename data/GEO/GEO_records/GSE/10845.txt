TITLE
A Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Approach Based on BAC Transgenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have devised a technology that enables chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments in cultured human cells by circumventing both the laborious production of protein-specific antibodies and the optimization of crosslinking/immunoprecipitation conditions for each protein. Our approach utilizes bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to physiologically express chromatinbinding proteins fused to epitope tags that are recognized by widely available and highly specific antibodies. We demonstrate the robustness of our methodology for mapping chromatin binding sites of transcription factors. Keywords: ChIP-Chip Analysis
