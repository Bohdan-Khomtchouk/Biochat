TITLE
PGA Rat Liver Methylprednisolone

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Summary: The liver is the major site of gluconeogenesis, fat processing and distribution, as well as drug and xenobiotic metabolism. Altered gene expression in the liver is centrally invovled in both the immuosuppressive and the energetic actions of corticosteroids. Hypothesis: That pharmacodynamics can be derived from expression profiling data. Specific Aim: The aim of this project is to identify distinct temporal patters of RNA expression in the liver of rats following a bolus dose of the corticosteroid methylprednisolone. 47 RG_U34A chips were used for 17 time points.
