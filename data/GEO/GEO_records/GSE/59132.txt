TITLE
Altered expression of genes in WDR5 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5) plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription, involing in regulation of embryonic stem cell and cancer cell.Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers that cause approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide.The goal of this study is to identify the target genes of WDR5 in bladder cancer.Our results inditcate that the genes regulated by WDR5 involved in a variety of biological functions, such as proliferation and anti-apoptosis.

DESIGN
Bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3 was transfected with the contol siRNA or two different WDR5 siRNA for 48h. The RNA of the transfected cells was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We indentified the putative target genes of WDR5 in both WDR5 siRNA by comparing  the diferent expressed genes among control, si-WDR5-2 and si-WDR5-3. We futher validated the data of microarray in UM-UC-3 and T24 by RT-qPCR and Western bloting.
