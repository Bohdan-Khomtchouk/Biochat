TITLE
Identification of rice ethylene-response mutants and characterization of MHZ7 in distinct ethylene response and yield trait regulation

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Ethylene plays major roles in adaptive growth of rice plants in water-saturated soil; however, ethylene signaling in rice is largely unclear. Here, we report identification and characterization of ethylene-response mutants based on distinct ethylene-response phenotypes of dark-grown rice seedlings.

DESIGN
The seeds were soaked in tap-water and germinated at 37°C in the dark for two days (change the water daily). For ethylene treatment, we reduced the amount of water to 1.5-1.7cm below the seeds.Three-day old seedlings were treated with ethylene (10 ppm) for 8 hours at 28°C in the dark. Seedling grown in the air  was used as control. We isolated RNA from roots and shoots of wild-type and mutant.
