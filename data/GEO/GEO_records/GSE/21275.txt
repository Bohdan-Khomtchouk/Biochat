TITLE
Genome wide analysis of long term L1TD1 knockdown effects in NT2D1 cell line with inducible shRNA vectors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to analyze genome wide effects of long term L1TD1 silencing in embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2D1) and to identify molecular level mechanismis of L1TD1 function and determine its possible role in pluripotency and self-renewal

DESIGN
Six clones from NT2D1 cell line stably expressing TetR3 and L1TD1shRNA were analyzed. From each clone two samples were prepared: non-induced cells as control and doxycycline induced cells (+) to knockdown L1TD1, resulting altogether 12 samples. Samples were collected on day 6 after start of dox induction. One sample had to be excluded from the analysis because it did not cluster according to the sample groups.
