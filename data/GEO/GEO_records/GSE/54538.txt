TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile on hiPSCs and hiPSC-derived CD33+ myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into which pathways might be dysregulated in JMML, we compared the transcriptome profiles among hiPSC and sorted CD33+ myeloid cells from control and patient samples. NS/JMML-derived CD33+ myeloid cells showed dysregulation in major biological processes. Moreover, a consistent expression pattern among sets of genes related to pluripotency and myeloid regulation was observed in the control, NS and NS/JMML CD33+ myeloid cells further supporting generally successful myelopoiesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hiPSC and sorted CD33+ myeloid  cells (at day 14 of differentiation) from control and patient samples
