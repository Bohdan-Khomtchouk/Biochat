TITLE
8-chip high-resolution aCGH experiment NA15510 vs. NA18505

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We introduce high-throughput and massive paired-end mapping (PEM), a large-scale genome sequencing method to identify SVs 3 kb or larger that combines the rescue and capture of paired-ends of 3 kb fragments, massive 454 Sequencing, and a computational approach to map DNA reads onto a reference genome. PEM was used to map SVs in an African and putatively European individual and identified shared and divergent SVs relative to the reference genome. Overall, we fine-mapped more than 1000 SVs and documented that the number of SVs among humans is much larger than initially hypothesized; many of the SVs potentially affect gene function. The breakpoint junction sequences of more than 200 SVs were deduced with a novel pooling strategy and computational analysis. Array-CGH was used for validation. Keywords: array CGH

DESIGN
2 samples were analyzed with 8 different Nimblegen chips (385k); thus ~30M probes were used to interrogate copy number variants in NA15510 (using NA18505 as control) at high resolution.
