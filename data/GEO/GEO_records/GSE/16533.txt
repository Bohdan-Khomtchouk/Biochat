TITLE
Expression data from lenses triply deficient for E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 transcription factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The E2F family consists of transcriptional repressors and activators that control cell proliferation.  In the classic paradigm of cell cycle regulation, the three activators, E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3, are invariably depicted as the final components of a CDK/Rb signaling cascade that executes the transcriptional program necessary to commit cells to enter S phase. Unexpectedly, we find through analysis of Affymetrix expression array data that mature lens epithelial cells deficient for E2F1-3 fail to repress cell cycle-regulated genes (and other targets of E2F) and that this corresponds with subsequent apoptosis and cellular collapse in the lens.

DESIGN
Murine lenses were collected at two stages of development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Our aim was to determine key events that lead to cellular collapse of lenses triply deficient for E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 in neonates.
