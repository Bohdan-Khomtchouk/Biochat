TITLE
Analysis of gene expression profiles in wild-type vs Ets1-/- follicular B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets1-/- mice have an increase in B cell differentiation to plasma cells and increased serum immunoglobulin levels. The genes in B cells that are transcriptionally regulated by Ets1 and help regulate B cell differentiation are largely unknown. Here, we identify Ets1-regulated target genes in B cells using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. We found that Ets1 targets  genes associated with immune response, mature B cell differentiation and regulation of B cell activation.

DESIGN
Quiescent follicular B cells were sorted from the spleens of wild-type and Ets1-/- mice using the following markers B220+ CD23-high CD21-low CD80-negative IgA-negative IgE-negative IgG1-negative IgG2a-negative IgG2b-negative IgG3-negative. Total RNA was prepared from sorted cells and subjected to RNA-sequencing.
