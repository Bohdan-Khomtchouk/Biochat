TITLE
miRQC data for NanoString nCounter miRNA Expression Assays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
nCounter miRNA Expression Assay data for all profiled miRQC samples prepared by the miRQC Consortium. In this study, we systematically compared 12 commercially available miRNA expression platforms by measuring an identical set of standardized positive and negative control samples, including human universal reference RNA, human brain RNA and titrations thereof, human serum samples, and synthetic spikes from miRNA family members with varying homology. We developed novel and robust quality metrics to objectively assess platform performance of very different technologies such as small RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR and (microarray) hybridization. We assessed reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, and concordance of differential expression.

DESIGN
miRQC Consortium multi-platform comparision. *This represents the NanoString component only
