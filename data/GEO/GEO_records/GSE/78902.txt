TITLE
RNAseq analysis of the colon of intestine-specific adult Nkx2.2 mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim: Transcriptional analysis of the colon of adult Nkx2.2flox/flox;Villin-Cre (Nkx2.2int) mice versus control Methods: 2 cm of the colon (as measured after the caecum) of 6 week old control and mutant mice were dissected and total RNA extracted. Libraries were prepared from total RNA (RIN > 8) with the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument. More than 20 million reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC/mm9) using Tophat (version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. Significantly differentially expressed genes were calculated using DEseq. Results: 53 genes with a p-value < 0.05 were down-regulated and 36 were up-regulated. Among the changed genes are enteroendocrine hormones. Conclusion: Nkx2.2 regulates enteroendocrine cell specification

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of the colon of 6 week old control and Nkx2.2int mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
