Androgen arrays for Resveratrol-Induced Gene Expression Profiles in Human Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Arrays for Expression levels of androgen-responsive genes in LNCaP cells exposed to dihydrotestosterone, R1881. Gene-expression changes in LNCaP treated with 1 nmol/L R1881 at 7, 9, 18, 24, 50, and 72 hours; 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone at 18 and 50 hours; 100 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone and 1 5mol/L dihydrotestosterone at 24 hours; and androgen deprivation at 46 and 70 hours. This set corresponds to Figure 2 of the publication. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
