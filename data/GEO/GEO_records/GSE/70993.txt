TITLE
FGF2 cooperates with IL-17A to promote intestinal epithelium wound healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The intestinal epithelial barrier plays a critical role in the mucosal immunity. However, it remains largely unknown how the epithelial barrier is maintained after damage. Here we show that FGF2 synergizes with IL-17A to induce genes for repairing of damaged epithelium. Deficiency of FGF2 or IL-17A resulted in impaired epithelial proliferation, increased pro-inflammatory microbiota outgrowth, and consequently worse pathology in a DSS-induced colitis model.

DESIGN
Mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells left untreated (UN) or stimulated for 6 hr with IL-17A (50 ng/ml), FGF2 (5 ng/ml), or both (IL-17A plus FGF2).
