TITLE
Genome-wide Methylation Profiles Reveal Quantitative Views of Human Aging Rates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of individuals across a large age range. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450k CpGs from human whole blood.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 656 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
