TITLE
HNF1 regulates critical functions of the human epididymis epithelium. [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HNF1α and HNF1β recognize the same DNA consensus sequence in the genome, to which they bind as homodimers or heterodimers. Both factors share a high degree of homology their DNA binding and dimerization (N-terminus) regions but have a more divergent C-terminal transactivation domain. HNF1β is essential for the generation of a functional male reproductive tract in mice and genital tract abnormalities are evident in humans with recessive mutations in HNF1β. The functions of HNF1α and HNF1β have been studied in epithelia from other several tissues (liver, kidney, intestine, and pancreas) but their role in the adult human epididymis epithelium (HEE) remains unexplored. We established that HNF1α/β are expressed in caput HEE cells and are predicted to occupy cis-regulatory elements in these cells. To investigate the contribution of HNF1 in controlling gene expression in caput cells we performed siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1α and HNF1β together, followed by RNA-seq analysis. Three replicas of caput cells were transfected with the specific siRNAs or with a non-targeting control siRNA. RNA-seq after HNF1 depletion showed significant alterations in the expression of genes encoding ion channels and exchangers that are involved in controlling the luminal environment in the caput epididymis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Caput HEE cells transfected with negative control (NC) or HNF1alpha and HNF1beta siRNA, in triplicate.
