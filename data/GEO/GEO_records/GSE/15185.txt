TITLE
Expression data from sorted follicle populations in the 2nd telogen to anagen transition.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hair Follicle regeneration relies on both epithelial components (bulge and hair germ cells) and a mesenchymal one (dermal papilla cells). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying organ regeneration at the transition between quiescent stages (early and middle telogen) and the initiation of a new growth (late telogen).

DESIGN
These microarray at the 3 different stages were designed to identify signals released by the mesenchymal dermal papilla cells to activate epithelial growth, their target genes in the hair germ and bulge compartments, and to get at gene signature differences and similarities between hair germ and bulge cells.
