TITLE
CHD1 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in prostate cancer cell line PC-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is known to be associated with transcriptional activation and CHD1 is known to selectively recognize and bind to H3K4me3 to activate gene transcription. In addition, CHD1 is involved in the maintenance of open chromatin and cooperates with H3K4me3 to control pluripotency of murine embryonic stem cells. To determine the downstream transcriptional targets and pathways of CHD1 and H3K4me3 in PTEN-null PCa cells, ChIP-seq was performed in control versus CHD1 knockdown PC-3 cells.

DESIGN
H3K4me3 and CHD1 ChIP-seq was performed in control versus CHD1 knockdown PC-3 cells.
