TITLE
Role of CAMTA1 gene under drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The CAMTA1 mutant and Col-0 were studied under water and drought condition. The camta1 showed stunted primary root growth under osmotic stress. The expression analysis revealed drought recovery as major indicative pathway along with membrane and chloroplast related protein in  camta1 under drought stress. Large number of positively regulated genes were related to osmotic balance, transporters, AP2 and ABA. We used Affymetrix expression analysis to validate the role of CAMTA1 under drought stress.

DESIGN
The RNA of Col-0 and camta1 mutant were isolated in water and drought condition.The ATH1 gene chip was used for expression analysis.
