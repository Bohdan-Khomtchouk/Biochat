TITLE
Expression data from neonatal pig skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Muscle development and growth is an economically important process in the pig.The neonatal period is another important stage for the pig when the most rapid gain occurring in skeletal muscle.Gene expresseion changes during fetal and postnatal skeletal muscle development that can be used to enhance pig production efficiency, as well as for comparative developmental biology using the pig as a model for other mammalian species. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression level at different stages of postnatal development.

DESIGN
Pig skeletal muscles were selected at different stages of post-natal development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.So,we sampled at four time-points: within 24 hours after birth (0d),7 days after birth (7d), 14 days after birth (14d), 21 days after birth (21d).
