TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in PBMCs from kidney patiens with or without donor specific antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation whether PBMCs miRNAs could be a predictable biomarker for chronic AMR (CAMR). A validation study (Study I) based on microarray profiling of total 435 mature human miRNAs using pooled samples of Group I-1 (Stable: n=11), Group I-2 (DSA: n=11) and Group I-3 (clinical CAMR: n=6)

DESIGN
To assess the relation between PBMC miRNA levels and the development of CAMR, we conducted a global miRNA expression analysis using pooled RNA isolated from PBMCs of patients in respective groups according to the stage of CAMR (Stable function, DSA production, and then renal dysfunction due to CAMR). A total of 435 mature human miRNAs were profiled.
