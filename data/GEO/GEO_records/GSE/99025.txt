TITLE
Gene expression profiling of intact individual planarians during homeostatic tissue turnover after inhibition of myoD or nkx1-1

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
MyoD is a conserved myogenic factor which controls formation of longitundinal muscle fibers in planarians. nkx1-1 is a conserved transcription factor which controls formation of circular muscle fibers in planarians.

DESIGN
Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from individual animals from planarians following RNAi (10 dsRNA feedings) of a control gene (C.elegans unc-22; 6 replicates) and myoD (6 replicates) or following RNAi (12 dsRNA feedings) of a control gene (C. elegans unc-22; 5 replicates) and nkx1-1 (7 replicates).
