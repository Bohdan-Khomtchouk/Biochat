TITLE
WT and AUF1 KO satellite cell RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following skeletal muscle injury, muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are activated, proliferate, and differentiate to form myofibers.  We show that mRNA decay protein AUF1 regulates satellite cell function through targeted degradation of specific mRNAs.  AUF1 targets certain mRNAs containing 3  AU-rich elements (AREs) for rapid decay.  Auf1-/- (KO) mice undergo accelerated skeletal muscle wasting with age and impaired muscle repair following injury.  Satellite cell mRNA analysis and regeneration studies demonstrate that auf1-/- satellite cell self-renewal is impaired due to increased stability and overexpression of ARE-mRNAs. Control of ARE-mRNA decay by AUF1 and potentially other ARE-binding proteins represents a mechanism for adult stem cell regulation and is implicated in human muscle wasting diseases. We report the RNA transcript expression profiles from sorted satellite cells isolated from wild type (WT) and AUF1-null (KO) mice hindlimb muscles

DESIGN
Examination of RNA transcript expression from satellite cells of two genotypes Please note that mice are bred through a C57BL/6 strain of 129 background.
