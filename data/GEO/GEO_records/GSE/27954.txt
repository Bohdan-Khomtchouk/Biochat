TITLE
Probucol ameliorates renal and metabolic sequelae of primary CoQ deficiency in Pdss2 mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To discern whether the same transcriptional signature of mitochondrial dysfunction previously reported in B6.Alb/cre,Pdss2loxP/loxP liver-conditional knockout mice (Peng, Falk et al. PLoS Genetics, 2008 [PMID 18437205]) was present regardless of Pdss2 mutation type, as well as to assess whether pharmacologic therapies modulate expression of particular pathways, genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed in liver from B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) missense mutant mice on standard chow or supplemented long-term with either probucol or CoQ10.

DESIGN
For analysis of lifelong probucol and CoQ10 supplementation effects in B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) missense mutant mice, total RNA was isolated from the livers of B6 mice and from Pdss2(kd/kd) missense mutant mice fed a normal diet, or a diet supplemented with Probucol or CoQ10. Total RNA was individually hybridized to 20 total Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 arrays, which included 5 biological replicates from each of the 4 groupings: untreated B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) missense mutant mice, probucol-treated B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) mice, CoQ10-treated B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) mice, and untreated B6 wild-type mice.
