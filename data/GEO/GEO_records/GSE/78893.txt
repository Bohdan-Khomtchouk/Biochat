TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of Panax japonicus, and its comparison with other Panax species to identify potential genes involved in the saponins biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Panax japonicus

SUMMARY
In this study, we have performed Illumina based RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptome and expression profiles of genes expressed in 5 tissues of P. japonicus. RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for P. japonicus resulted in a total of 135,235 unigenes with 78,794 (58.24%) unigenes being annotated using NCBI-nr database. Transcriptome profile and GO enrichment analysis for 5 tissues of P. japonicus showed that although each tissue was characterized by several unique unigenes with leaf showing the most unique unigenes among all, overall processes were evenly conserved across all tissues.
