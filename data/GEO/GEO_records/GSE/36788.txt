TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Tie-2-Etv2 YS hematopoietic precursors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Etv2 transgene was expressed from ROSA26 locus by removing floxed STOP cassette by Tie-2 Cre transgene.VE-Cad+/CD45+ cells were sorted from control or tie-2-Etv2 E10.5 embryosYS(yolk sac) and compared for gene expression in duplicate. This study will reveal the effect of Etv2 transgene in E10.5 mouse embryo yolk sac. The effect of Etv2 overexpression in relevant mouse tissue will be important to understand its effect in comparison with in ES cells. Genes aberrantly regulated by Etv2 overexpression will help to understand the caveat when using Etv2 to induce endothelial and hematopoietic cells in vitro.
