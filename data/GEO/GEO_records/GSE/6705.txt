TITLE
Whole genome expression profile for cbc2-delta cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to identify transcripts regulated by Cbc2, the small subunit of nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Six independent expression profiling experiments were carried out for isogenic wild-type (Y255) and cbc2Î” (Y2685) strains using Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 Arrays. Three repeats were applied to each strain.

PLATFORM
