TITLE
UB/OC-1 differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study explores the profiles of genes expressed during conditional differentiation of inner ear hair cell precursors in vitro. The cell line UB/OC-1 was derived from mouse embryonic organs of Corti (Rivolta et al, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 265: 1595-1603, 1998) and it can be induced to differentiate upon a temperature shift. The study has been replicated in two separate populations of cells, named Exp A and Exp B. Exp A includes daily time points from 0 to 9 days, then 11 and 14 days. Exp B includes days 0, 2, 4, and 9. The manuscript associated to this work is Rivolta et al., Genome Research 12(7):1091-1099, 2002. Keywords: time-course
