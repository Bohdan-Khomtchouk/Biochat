TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression data from normal human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustard in the presence and absence of hydrocortisone treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bifunctional alkylating agent sulfur mustard (SM; bis-(2-dichloroethyl) sulfide) is a potent vesicating chemical that has previously been used as a chemical warfare agent.   studies have shown that exposure to CWNA compounds induces damage in the brain and heart.

DESIGN
Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were pretreated for 24 hours with control vehicle (1.25% ethanol) or hydrocortisone (500µM HC) and then exposed to either 200µM SM or 200µM NM for 1 hour or 8 hours.
