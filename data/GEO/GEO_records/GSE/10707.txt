TITLE
potyvirus effect-Transcriptionnal response to potyviruses infection in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra06-05_potyvirus-ecotypes - potyvirus effect - Common and specific genes deregulated in response to various potyviruses in different Arabidopsis genetic backgrounds. - Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Ler was inoculated with three different Potyviruses. About 4 weeks after sowing, the 6 expanded leaves plants were inoculated with the different viruses or were mock-inoculated. Seven days after inoculation, inoculated leaves were collected, RNA was extracted and virus infection controlled. Three biological repeats have been done and two dye-swaps. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison
