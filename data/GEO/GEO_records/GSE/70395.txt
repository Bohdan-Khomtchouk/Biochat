TITLE
Gene expression profiling from TS1 and TS2 cells in biological duplicates (A and B)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TS1 and TS2 are T-lymphocyte derived cell lines that striclty depend on the presence of interleukin-9 for growth and survival. The goal of the study was to compare gene expression profiles between those 2 cell lines.

DESIGN
TS1 and TS2 cell lines were maintained in vitro under the same conditions. RNA was extracted from biological duplicates ( 2 X 2 samples = 4 samples).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
