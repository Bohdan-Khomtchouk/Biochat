TITLE
Mining the Human Urine Proteome for Monitoring Renal Transplant Injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression data was analyzed to map with urine proteomics data gene expression data from kidney biopsies from kidney transplant  patients with and without acute rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy and BK virus nephritis was used to study gene expression changes during acute rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy and bk virus nephropathy. Samples labeled STA16, STA22, STA14, and STA18 were included in the CAN vs no-CAN analysis as no-CAN samples as they also qualified as non-CAN samples.

DESIGN
The study was to identify transplant injury markers using proteomics. We used gene expression data to evaluate intersection of transcriptome and proteome.
