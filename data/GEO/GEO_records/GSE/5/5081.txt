TITLE
Expression data from Helicobacter positive and negative human gastritis samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis gives an opportunity for studying the unidentified gene expression background of the idiopathic and H.pylori related gastric erosive alterations. Using microarrays we compared the whole genome gene expression profile of HP+ and HP- gastric erosions and normal adjacent mucosa to explain the possible role and response to HP infection and to get morphology related  mRNA expression patterns. Keywords: whole genomic expression
