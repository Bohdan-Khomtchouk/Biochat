TITLE
Characterization of the HP1021 regulon of Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
The genome of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori harbors a remarkably low number of regulatory genes, including three and five open reading frames encoding two-component histidine kinases and response regulators, respectively, which are putatively involved in transcriptional regulation. Inactivation of the response regulator gene hp1021 resulted in a severe growth defect, as indicated by a small-colony phenotype. Recently we found that phosphorylation of the receiver domain HP1021 is not needed for its response regulator function and may not occur at all. No target genes have been identified so far. In this study we define the HP1021-dependent regulon consisting of 79 genes (51 activated, 28 repressed) by global transcriptional profiling of an HP1021-deficient H. pylori mutant. Keywords: Identification of an HP1021-Regulon
