TITLE
Polyamides alleviate transcription inhibition associated with long GAA•TTC repeats in Friedreich’s ataxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphoblast cells from a patient with Freidriech's Ataxia were incubated with pyrrole-imidazole polyamides targeted to the GAA triplet repeat in the intron 1.  The polyamides were shown in cell culture to increase levels of endogenous frataxin mRNA.  A normal sibling derived lymphoblast cell line was used as a control. Keywords: human lymphoblast cells
