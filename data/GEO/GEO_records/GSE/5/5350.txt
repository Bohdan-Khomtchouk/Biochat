MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray technology has had a profound impact on gene expression research.  Some studies have questioned whether similar expression results are obtained when the same RNA samples are analyzed on different platforms. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and analysis issues.  We demonstrate the consistency of results within a platform across test sites as well as the high level of cross-platform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed.  The MAQC study provides a rich resource that will help build consensus on the use of microarrays in research, clinical and regulatory settings.  Manuscripts related to the MAQC project have been published in Nature Biotechnology, 24(9), September, 2006.
