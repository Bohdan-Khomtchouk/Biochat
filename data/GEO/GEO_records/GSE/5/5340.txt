TITLE
Transcriptional response of Candida albicans to oral epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is exposed to a different host environment during oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) compared to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis.  Thus, different virulence factors may be active during these two types of infection.  However,little is known about the C. albicans genes that are required for the initiation and maintenance of OPC.  To identify potential virulence factors relevant to this disease, we determined the transcriptional response of C. albicans to oral epithelial cells in vitro. Keywords: cell interaction
