TITLE
Hoxb1 gene expressing Hox-A1 protein: Altered transcriptional profile in rhombomere 4 at E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study analyzed mRNA profiles in rhombomere 4 of E10.5 mouse knock-in embryos expressing either normal endogenous Hox-B1 protein or the paralogous Hox-A1 protein from the Hoxb1 locus. The Hox-A1 protein was found to be detectably less efficacious than Hox-B1 in promoting neurogenesis in the basal plate of rhombomere 4 and its transcriptional profile shared several similarities with the Hoxb1 mutant. Keywords: gene swap, knock-in, hindbrain development, rhombomere 4
