TITLE
Adult ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A set of 37 BCR-ABL positive (21 and 16 of which expressed p185 and p210, respectively) and 17 BCR-ABL negative adult ALL specimens from the ECOG/MRC intergroup study E2993. Gene expression profiling was performed using the 3DNA Array 900 Expression Array Detection Kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a reference RNA. The results provide insights into molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with BCR-ABL oncogenesis. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
