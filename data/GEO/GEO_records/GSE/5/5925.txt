TITLE
RNA expression data from Halobacterium NRC-1 in response to oxic/anoxic transitions, verification experiment

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
In order to ensure the reproducibility of the transcriptional response of Halobacterium NRC-1 to oxic/anoxic transitions, we repeated global mRNA measurements for the oxygen time series data in GSE5924, except that cultures were equilibrated to high oxygen for 12 hours prior to the start of the experiment rather than low oxygen.  The results of these data suggest that there is good (~60%) reproducibility between datasets, and that Halobacterium responds robustly to oxic/anoxic transitions. Keywords: time series
