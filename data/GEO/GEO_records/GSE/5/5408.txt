TITLE
Comparative transcript profiling of interaction events in Pinus sylvestris root tissues following challenge (5dpi).

ORGANISM
Pinus taeda

SUMMARY
The response mechanisms, recognition and specificity of conifer trees during interaction with pathogenic, saprotrophic  or symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungus were investigated. The roots of Pinus sylvestris were challenged for five days with either Heterobasidion annosum (a pathogenic root rot fungus which attacks Norway spruce, Scots pine and broad leaf trees); Laccaria bicolor (an obligate ectomycorrhizal symbiont); or Trichoderma aureoviride (an obligate saprotroph). The gene expression data from cDNA micro-arrays consisting of 2176 Pinus taeda genes were analysed using 2-interconnected mixed linear model statistical approach. The result of the pairwise comparisons of the different treatments against un-inoculated control led to identification of genes specifically differentially expressed in the pathogenic, saprotrophic and symbiotic interactions. The results were compared with similar data obtained for two other interaction stages: 1 and 15 days post inoculation. The result of this comprehensive expression profiling will hopefully shed more light on the mechanistic basis for recognition and response of conifer trees to pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi.
