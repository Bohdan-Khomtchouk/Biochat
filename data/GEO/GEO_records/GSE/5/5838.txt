SUMMARY
Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the major cause of intestinal graft loss. Little is known about the genetic response occurring in small bowel transplantation (SBTx) during ACR. We report the case of a 44 year-old female with short gut syndrome following multiple surgeries for familial adenomatous polyposis that underwent living-related SBTx. We obtained for the first time a gene expression profile of the intestinal graft during ACR. Microarray analysis revealed increased transcript levels for genes that match identically to an IFN? signature reported for activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T-cell chemotaxis and cytolysis correlating with the diagnosis of ACR. Keywords: disease state analysis
