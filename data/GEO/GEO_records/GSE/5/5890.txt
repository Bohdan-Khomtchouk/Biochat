TITLE
Identification of candidate genes involved in fructooligosaccharides (FOS) utilization by Lactobacillus paracasei

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus paracasei

SUMMARY
A shotgun microarray-based approach was used to identify candidate genes encoding the FOS utilization pathway in L. paracasei 1195.  Differential expression profiles between cells grown on FOS and glucose provided a basis for identifying genes specifically induced by FOS.  In addition, transcriptional analysis of cells grown on FOS or FOS + glucose allowed us to investigate the effect of catabolite repression on the expression of the FOS-induced genes. Keywords: gene identification
