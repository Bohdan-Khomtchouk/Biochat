TITLE
Expression data from female SD rats with access to lifelong exercise

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression and phenotypic consequences of laboratory housing in rats. Disease related-phenotypes and associated gene expressions of sedentary animals (living solely in a standard cage) were compared with animals that had access to twice-weekly one-hour physical activity in a large box (PA) and with those that had access to voluntary running wheel exercise (EX). Keywords: exercise dose reponse, sedentary, twice weekly physical activity, daily exercise
