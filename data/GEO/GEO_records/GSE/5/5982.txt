TITLE
Gene expression in melanocytes and metastases melanoma cells from the pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov minipigs (MeLiM) provide an animal model for the study of spontaneous cutaneous melanoma. We compared the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) profile between normal skin melanocytes and melanoma cells from a pulmonary metastasis of MeLiM. Keywords: disease state study
