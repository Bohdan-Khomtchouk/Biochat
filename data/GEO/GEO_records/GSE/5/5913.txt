TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the cellular transformation induced by Rho subfamily GTPases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used microarray technology to identify the transcriptional targets of Rho subfamily GTPases.  This analysis indicated that murine fibroblasts transformed by these proteins show similar transcriptomal profiles.  Functional annotation of the regulated genes indicate that Rho subfamily GTPases target a wide spectrum of biological functions, although loci encoding proteins linked to proliferation and DNA synthesis/transcription are up-regulated preferentially.  Rho proteins promote four main networks of interacting proteins nucleated around E2F, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p53.  Of those, E2F, c-Jun and c-Myc are essential for the maintenance of cell transformation.  Inhibition of Rock, one of the main Rho GTPase targets, leads to small changes in the transcriptome of Rho-transformed cells.  Rock inhibition decreases c-myc gene expression without affecting the E2F and c-Jun pathways.  Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that c-Myc is important for the blockage of cell-contact inhibition rather than for promoting the proliferation of Rho-transformed cells.  However, c-Myc overexpression does not bypass the inhibition of cell transformation induced by Rock blockage, indicating that c-Myc is essential, but not sufficient, for Rock-dependent transformation.  These results reveal the complexity of the genetic program orchestrated by the Rho subfamily and pinpoint protein networks that mediate different aspects of the malignant phenotype of Rho-transformed cells Keywords: Rho/Rac GTPases, microarray, oncogenesis, proliferation, gene expression, transcription, Rock, c-Myc
