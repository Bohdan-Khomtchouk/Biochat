TITLE
Transcriptional response of Candida albicans to endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is exposed to a different host environment during different site of infection. Thus, different virulence factors may be active during differenttypes of infection. However,little is known about the C. albicans genes that are required for the initiation and maintenance of candidiasis. To identify potential virulence factors relevant to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, we determined the transcriptional response of C. albicans to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Keywords: cell interaction
