TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile in rat model of renal isografts from brain dead donors

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The clinical results obtained with organ allografts from marginal or extended donors are less satisfactory over both the short-term and long-term than the outcome of grafting from living donors. Early postoperative graft function depends on several pretransplant factors, with the major donor influences being brain death (BD) and ischemia/reperfusion(I/R) injury. The effects of BD and I/R injury not only reduce the number of functioning nephrons, but also trigger a host immune response to the grafted kidney. It has been hypothesized that allografts from marginal sources may not be biologically inert at the time of surgery, but may already be programmed to initiate or amplify a host response. To exclude the effects of allogenicity, we established a rat renal isograft model using dead donors and compared the results with those obtained after grafting from living donors. In this study, we performed an analysis of the changes of gene expression in rat kidney isografts using samples obtained at 0(pre-transplant) and 1 hour time points since transplantation procedure. The results enhanced our insight into the pathways and cascades that are activated or down-regulated by BD and/or I/R injury. Better knowledge of the key components of BD or I/R injury will provide clues to the factors triggering progression that leads to a decline of organ viability, as well as ideas on how to overcome such graft failures. Such data may also allow us to identify novel biomarkers as predictors of adverse outcomes. Keywords: disease state analysis
