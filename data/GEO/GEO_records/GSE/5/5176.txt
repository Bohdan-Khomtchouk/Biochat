SUMMARY
We have previously detected cyclin D1-initiated and p53-related (PERP; p53 apoptosis-associated target) cell death in a striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated Parkinsonian mouse model by adaptor-tagged competitive PCR (ATAC-PCR) (Synapse 51, 279-286, 2004). In order to establish the mechanism of dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson’s disease, various Parkinsonian animal models should be studied. Therefore, the time-course alteration of gene expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta was investigated after a single administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in common marmosets. In the MPTP model, gene expression of neither cyclin D1 nor PERP was altered. There were also few common alterations in gene expression between the MPTP and 6-OHDA models. This suggests that the mechanism of cell death may differ between these models, and extensive study in various Parkinsonian models should be performed to elucidate the mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson’s disease. Keywords: time course
