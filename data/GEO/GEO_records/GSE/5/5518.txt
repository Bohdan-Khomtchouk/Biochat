TITLE
Differential gene expression of Appresorium vs Vegetative mycelium of Magnaporthe using oligoarray

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is a devastating disease causing tremendous yield loss in rice production. The public availability of the complete genome sequence of M. grisea provides ample opportunities to understand the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis on rice plants at the transcriptome level. To identify all the expressed genes encoded in the fungal genome, we have analyzed the mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes using MPSS, RL-SAGE and oligoarray methods. Keywords: RL-SAGE, oligoarray
