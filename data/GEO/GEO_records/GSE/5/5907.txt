TITLE
IRF2 regulates macrophages apoptosis through a STAT1/3 and Caspase-1-dependent mechanism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray gene expression profiling of liver RNA samples rerived from IRF2+/+ and IRF2-/- mice treated with saline or LPS, we identified > 40 genes that were significantly down-regulated in IRF2 -/- mice, including STAT3 which has been reported to regulate apoptosis. Keywords: compound treatment design
