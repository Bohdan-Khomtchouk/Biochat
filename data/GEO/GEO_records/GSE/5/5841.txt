TITLE
Differential gene expression in mouse skNAC knockout heart at E11.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Targeted deletion of skNAC in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality with cardiac defects.  In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of the cardiac defect, we designed the microarray comparing gene expression of the mutant E11.5 heart to wild type E11.5 heart. Keywords: genetic modification in mouse
