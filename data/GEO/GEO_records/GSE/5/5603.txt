TITLE
Comparison of gene expression by co-cultured WC1+ gammadelta and CD4+ alphabeta T cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Vaccination of animals with leptospiral vaccine results in the generation of antigen-responsive CD4 alphabeta T cells and WC1 gammadelta T cells which proliferate and produce effector cytokines following secondary encounter with antigen.  In these studies we compared the gene expression of these antigen-stimulated T cell subsets to each other by microarray.  In addition, each activated T cell population was compared to a reference sample, consisting of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Keywords: cell type comparison
