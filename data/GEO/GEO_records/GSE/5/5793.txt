TITLE
C. elegans gene expression in response to the pathogenic P. aeruginosa strain PA14.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression in C. elegans adults exposed to three different bacteria: E. coli strain OP50, wild-type P. aeruginosa PA14 and gacA mutant PA14. Samples were analyzed at 4 hours and 8 hours after exposure to the different bacteria. These studies identified C. elegans genes induced by pathogen infection. Keywords: Time course, response to pathogen infection
