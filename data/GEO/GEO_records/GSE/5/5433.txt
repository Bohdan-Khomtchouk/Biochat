TITLE
Global responses of a C. jejuni single domain globin mutant to nitric oxide releasing compounds

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
A single-domain globin (cgb) mutant strain of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 was grown in 2 homemade, parallel chemostats. Cells were grown in 125 ml volumes of Mueller-Hinton Broth where the growth rate was controlled by the dilution rate  (0.1 h-1). A gas mix of 80% nitrogen, 10% carbon dioxide and 10% oxygen was pumped into the head-space of the vessels at a rate of 0.25 l/min to obtain a microaerobic environment and the culture was maintained at 42 ºC via a water jacket. Cells were grown as above until steady-state had been reached. At steady-state one of the cultures was exposed to 10 uM NOC-5 & -7 (final concentration) for a period of 10 min. Samples of both the control and stressed cultures were harvested into phenol/ethanol to stabilize the RNA and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit (as recommended by the suppliers) prior to use in microarray analysis. Equal quantities of RNA from control and GSNO-supplemented cultures were labelled using nucleotide analogues of dCTP containing either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes. The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 4). The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values. The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values. Keywords: Stress-response of a cgb mutant to NO
