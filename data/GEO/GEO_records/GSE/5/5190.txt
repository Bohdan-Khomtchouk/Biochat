TITLE
Sex-, stage-, and tissue-specific alternative splicing in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used long-oligonucleotide microarrays to investigate whether alternative splicing in Drosophila is regulated in a sex-, stage-, or tissue-specific manner.  To examine sex-specific splicing, we compared gene expression profiles of male and female pupae 12 hours after pupariation.  To examine stage-specific splicing, we compared expression profiles of mixed-sex, 0-24 hour old embryos and mixed-sex, 12 hour old pupae.  To examine tissue-specific splicing, we compared expression profiles of adult male heads and abdomens 24-48 hours after eclosion.  To examine tissue-specific splicing, we compared expression profiles of adult male heads and abdomens at 24-48 hours after eclosion. Keywords: tissue-specific expression profiles
