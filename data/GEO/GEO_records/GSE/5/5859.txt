TITLE
Allelic Differences Account for Gene Expression Differences Among Population.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression level of genes in lymphoblasts from individuals in three HapMap populations (CEU, CHB, JPT) were compared.  More than 1,000 genes were found to be significantly different (Pc < 0.05) in mean expression level between the CEU and CHB+JPT samples. Keywords: Comparison of Gene Expression Profiles from Lymphoblastoid cells
