SUMMARY
Manuscript Title: Discovery of tissue-specific exons using comprehensive human exon microarrays We have designed a high-density oligonucleotide microarray with probesets for more than one million annotated and predicted exons in the human genome.  Using these arrays and a simple algorithm that normalizes exon signal to signal from the gene as a whole, we have identified tissue-specific exons from a panel of 16 different normal adult tissues.  Pair-wise comparisons between the tissues suggest that 75% of detected genes are differentially alternatively spliced.  We also demonstrate how an inclusive exon microarray can be used to discover novel alternative splicing events.  As examples, 15 new tissue-specific exons from 9 genes were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Keywords: exon analysis
