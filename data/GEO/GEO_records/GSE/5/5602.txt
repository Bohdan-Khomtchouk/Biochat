TITLE
GATA-3 maintains luminal cell differentiation in the mammary gland and in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified GATA-3 as a critical regulator of luminal cell differentiation in the mammary gland.  Acute loss of GATA-3 in the adult mammary gland leads to an expansion of an undifferentiated luminal epithelium and the formation of a multi-layered epithelium.  Here we report microarray analysis of mammary glands that have undergone acute loss of GATA-3 Keywords: genetic modification
