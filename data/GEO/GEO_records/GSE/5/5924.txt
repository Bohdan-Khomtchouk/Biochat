RNA expression data from Halobacterium NRC-1 in response to oxic/anoxic transitions, initial experiment

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
To gain a comprehensive systems-level understanding of cellular phenotypes, it is critical to characterize the relationship between the dynamic transcriptome and proteome during environmental perturbations. Previous comparisons have shown a lack of correlation between mRNA and protein level measurements suggesting a predominant role for post-transcriptional regulation in mediating cellular environmental responses.  To investigate the extent of post-transcriptional regulation, we have analyzed transcriptome and proteome level changes over a 13-hour 28-point time course during transitions between oxic and anoxic physiologies of Halobacterium. Integrated computational analyses of these data show that temporally shifting mRNA and protein profiles relative to one another significantly increases the mRNA/protein correlation.  Although time lags for unrelated genes vary widely, we observe similar temporal lags between the transcription and translation of functionally related genes.  In contrast, no significant temporal separation was observed within the transcript profiles. Taken together, these data suggest that while there is indeed a direct correlation between many corresponding changes at mRNA and protein levels, translational delay may be the predominant mechanism for the temporal regulation of protein abundance during physiological oxic/anoxic transitions in Halobacterium. The approach and algorithms delineated in this study provide a framework for incorporating the temporal dimension of information processing across many different layers of gene regulation. Keywords: time course
