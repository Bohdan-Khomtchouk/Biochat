TITLE
Tissue-specific signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiments described here aim to generate a set of gene expression profiles from prostate, liver and kidney tissues using a custom-designed oligo-array platform enriched in messages that map to intronic regions of known human genes. Expression profiles of these tissues were combined in order to find a tissue-specific signature of intronic transcripts. Keywords: Tissue-specific, Intronic transcripts
