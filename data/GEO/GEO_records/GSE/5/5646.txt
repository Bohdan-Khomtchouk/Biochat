TITLE
The Transposon Insertion site Profiling Chip (TIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have developed a microarray intended for use in finding all transposons in a region of interest. By selectively amplifying and hybridizing transposon flanking DNA to our array, we can localize all transposons in the region present on our TIP-chip, a dense tiling array. We have tested our technology in yeast and have been successful. Keywords: transposon insertion profiling, genomic DNA, yeast
