TITLE
Growth promotion of Arabidopsis by Trichoderma hamatum

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Trichoderma spp. are ubiquitous soil-borne ascomycetous fungi that have been used widely in the biological control of plant diseases. Certain strains also exhibit growth promotion of plants, but the mechanism for this phenomenon has not yet been elucidated. We have recently identified an isolate of T. hamatum that causes significant increases in the development of Arabidopsis root systems. The aim of this work is to elucidate the mechanism of root growth promotion. One approach is to analyse the transcriptome of plants grown in the presence and absence of the fungus.
