TITLE
Signature of human hepatocytes treated with Aroclor1254

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine molecular rules for transcriptional regulation of targeted genes to explain in part the pleiotropic effect observed in animals and humans upon exposure to Aroclor 1254 we treated human hepatocytes with Aroclor1254 and analysed RNA expression using a Nimblegene human custom array. Keywords: Human hepatocytes, Aroclor1254 treatment, 20ÂµM, 72h
