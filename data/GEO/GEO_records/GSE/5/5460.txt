TITLE
Predicting Features of Breast Cancer with Gene Expression Patterns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Predictors built from gene expression data accurately predict ER, PR, and HER2 status, and divide tumor grade into high-grade and low-grade clusters; intermediate-grade tumors are not a unique group.  In contrast, gene expression data cannot be used to predict tumor size or lymphatic-vascular invasion. Keywords: disease state analysis
