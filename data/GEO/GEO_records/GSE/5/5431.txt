TITLE
Expression profiling of A.thaliana with the posttranscriptionally silenced Myosin XI-K

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study was aimed to determine roles of individual myosins in organelle trafficking in plant cell.  Expression of Myosin XI-K was suppressed in transgenic A.thaliana by using RNAi approach. To ensure that the RNAi-induced gene silencing was specific and did not affect expression of other myosins, a microarray analysis was performed. Keywords: RNAi-mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing, Myosin expression levels
