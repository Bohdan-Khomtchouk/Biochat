TITLE
Regulation of gene networks in photoperception-related functions by the CRX/OTX homologue Otd in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparative global gene expression analysis was caried out using pupal head tissue of otd-uvi an eye specific mutant allele of Otd and wild type control Canton S., in order to delineate the function of homeobox transcription factor Otd in Drosophila photoreceptor development and function. Keywords: genetic modification
