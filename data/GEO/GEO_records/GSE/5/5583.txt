SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is an enzyme that promotes deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins. Histone acetylation is often associated with gene activation and expression. Los of HDAC1 leads to severe problems in development and proliferation. Moreover, it seems to be the major histone deacetylase in mouse embryonic stem cells. We used microarrays to identify putative HDAC1 target genes.
