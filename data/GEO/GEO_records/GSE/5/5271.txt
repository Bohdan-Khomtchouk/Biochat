TITLE
Time evolution study of sepsis in patients at D1, D7 and D28 post-inclusion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was performed on PBMC with an inflammatory dedicated slide of 340 genes, and target samples labelled with Cy3 for day 0 (reference) and with Cy5 for the other days. Changes in expression levels were evaluated by the ratio Dx/D0. According to time evolution, a two-dimensional clustering was performed. Keywords: time evolution of sepsis in patients at D1, D7 and D28 post-inclusion
