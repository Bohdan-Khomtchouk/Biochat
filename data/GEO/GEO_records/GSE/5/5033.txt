SUMMARY
Stress leads to important adaptive physiological responses including release of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla. Repeated or prolonged stess increses the propensity for many disorders including cardiovascular disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. The susceptibility to stress is determined by a number of factors including prior experience with stress. It has been found that while there is adaptation to prolonged  cold stres; it leads to sensitization when cold stressed animals are exposed to a different (novel) stressor. Our study aims to determine the mechanis of this adaptatio and sensitization. We will determine teh gene expression patterns in rat adrenal medulla in response to severa times of cold stress. We will also determine the changes in gene expresion with single immobilization stress in adrenal medulla of rat with an dwithout preexposure to cold stress to investigate the mechanism of sensitizatio in cold adapted animals. We hypothesize that during the course of cold stess there are alterations in gene expression of several neurotransmitter related genes and transcription factors. In expression of several trascription factors, such as Fra-2 which lead to an exaggerated response to teh novel stresor. Rats were exposed to cold stress (4 degree C) for 1, 7, or 28 days. A parallel group was kept at room temperature (unstressed). Unstressed or rats preexposed to 28 days cold were immobilized for 2 hrs and killed by decapitation. The adrenal medullae, separatedly from right and left side, have been dissected and individually frozen at - 70 degree C. We will pool samples from 4 rats per treatment to control for variability.
