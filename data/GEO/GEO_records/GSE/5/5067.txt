TITLE
Characterization of Glucocorticoid-Induced Changes in Gene Expression in the Embryonic Pituitary Gland.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that corticosterone (CORT) can induce premature differentiation of somatotrophs in the chicken embryo.  CORT induction of GH mRNA is indirect, in that protein synthesis inhibition blocks its inducing effect.  In this study, we used a custom chicken microarray to analyze global gene expression in the embryonic pituitary gland and to identify potential direct targets of CORT that may regulate its induction of somatotroph differentiation.  Our microarray analysis revealed 25 direct early targets of CORT. Keywords: Duration of corticosterone treatment on gene expression levels
