TITLE
Gene expression changes in fetuses exposed to ethanol in utero

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Timed pregnant C57Bl6 mice were exposed to ethanol during a critical period, gestational day 15 to 18, of cerebral cortical development to identify gene expression changes in the cerebral cortex of developing fetus due to this ethanol exposure Keywords: Compared animals exposed to ethanol (alcohol fed group) to a pair-fed control group and both groups were normalized to a control group (animals fed adlibitum)
