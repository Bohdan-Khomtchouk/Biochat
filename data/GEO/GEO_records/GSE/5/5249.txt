TITLE
Profiling limb muscle degeneration by inducible dominant negative thyroid hormone receptor transgene over-expression

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles limbs develop in response to thyroid hormone by proliferation and subsequent differentiation. We have previously reported that inhibiting the thyroid hormone action using a dominant negative receptor in limbs of developing tadpoles inhibits its growth and the tadpole limb has almost no muscle. The goal of this experiment is to study the role of thyroid hormone in the maintenance of limb muscle using transgenic tadpoles carrying a doxycyline inducible dominant negative thyroid receptor transgene expressed exclusively in the muscle using a muscle specific promoter and identify the genes involved in the degenerative process . F1 progeny of transgenic Xenopus frogs and their nontransgenic siblings (at stages NF55 and NF66) were treated with 50Âµg doxycycline hyclate in 0.1 X MMR solution for 2 weeks or 6 weeks to induce the over-expression of the transgene. Limbs from the tadpoles were dissected at the end of the experiment. Keywords: development or differentiation design,reference design,replicate design,time series design
