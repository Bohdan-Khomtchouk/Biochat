TITLE
Gene expression in aortic aneurysms associated with tricuspid and bicuspid valves

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have increased risk of thoracic ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA) and dissection compared to those with a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether differences in gene expression exist in aortas from BAV and TAV patients with AscAA. Keywords: disease state analysis
