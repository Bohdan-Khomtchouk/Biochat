TITLE
Gene expression in Histone H1 variant deletion chicken DT40 mutant cell

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
There are six histone H1 variant in chicken. 01H1/02H1/03H1/.10H1/H1L and H1R. In those variant we forcused on H1L and H1R those molecule were most similar H1 among six H1 variants. we established linker histone H1L and H1R deleted mutant in chicken B-cell derived DT40 cell and assay gene expression in normal condition in those mutant cells. The detail charactalization of those mutant cell was published in Takami et al., BBRC 268, 501-508 (2000) and Hashimoto et al., DNA repair (2007) Keywords: gene expression array-based, count
