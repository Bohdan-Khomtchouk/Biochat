TITLE
Translation State Array Analysis of LPS Stimulated Human Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to LPS (1 micg/mL) for 2 hours.  Ribosomal profiling via gradient centrifugation and fractionation was used to separate monosome, or under-translated, and polysome, or actively-translated, mRNA species that were then used to probe cDNA arrays, a process known as Translation State Array Analysis (TSAA).  Four samples were obtained from these experiments: control monosome, control polysome, LPS monosome and LPS polysome.  using the normalized signal intensities from the GeneFilters, we calculated a translation index, or measure of movement of an mRNA molecule from the monosome to the polysome fraction upon stimulation.  This calculation was made as follows:  (LPS polysome/LPS monosome)/(control polysome/control monosome).  Translational indices greater than 2.5 (upregulated) or lower than 0.4 (downregulated) were chosen for further study. Keywords: Translation State Array Analysis
