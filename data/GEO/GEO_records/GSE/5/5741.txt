Expression data from ARPE-19 cells treated with LDL or ox-LDL

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LDL or Ox-LDL 200ug/ml, which showed no loss of viability after a 48 hour exposure, induced a physiological and pathological transcriptional response, respectively. LDL induced a downregulation of genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis while ox-LDL induced transcriptional alterations in genes related to inflammation, matrix expansion, lipid metabolism and processing, and apoptosis. Pentraxin-3 was secreted into the culture medium after RPE cells were stimulated with ox-LDL, and immunohistochemically evident in Bruchâ€™s membrane of human macular samples with age-related macular degeneration. ARPE-19 cells exposed to 200?g/ml ox-LDL had a 38% apoptosis rate compared to less than 1% when exposed to LDL or untreated controls (p < 0.0001). While LDL induced a physiologic response by RPE cells, a pathological phenotypic response was seen after treatment with oxidatively modified LDL. The transcriptional, biochemical, and functional data provide initial support of a role for the hypothesis that modified LDLs are one trigger for initiating events that contribute to the development of age-related macular degeneration. Keywords: treatment with non-treatment control
