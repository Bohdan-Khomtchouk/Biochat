TITLE
Adjudin-induced germ cell loss from adult rat testes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This is a study to explore the transcriptional changes after Adjudin treatment in adult rat testes at three time points (control, 8 hour and 4 day). Adjudin, [1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide], is a potential male contraceptive that targets the Sertoli-germ cell interface and causes germ cell depletion from the seminiferous epithelium. Adjudin has been proved to be a useful model to study the mechanisms that regulate junction restructuring in the testis. Keywords: Sertoli-germ cell adhesion regulation using an Adjudin model
