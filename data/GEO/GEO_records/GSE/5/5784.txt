TITLE
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of primary neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) with a DNA chip carrying 2,464 BAC clones to examine genomic aberrations of 236 neuroblastomas (112 sporadic and 124 mass screening-detected). In paralell, gene-expression profiling was also performed by using in-house cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization
