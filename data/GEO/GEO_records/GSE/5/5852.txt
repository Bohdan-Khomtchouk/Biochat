TITLE
Livers of mice fed an atherogenic diet for 6 or 24 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To address the molecular basis for atherogenic diet-induced liver injury, we performed microarray analysis using livers at early (6 weeks) and pre-cirrhosis stages (24 weeks) in the development of steatohepatitis. The Atherogenic diet up-regulated the gene expression for fatty acid synthesis, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and with down-regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation. The addition of a high-fat component to the Atherogenic diet up-regulated the gene expression for fatty acid synthesis and transport pathways and down-regulated some of the antioxidant genes. Keywords: time-course
