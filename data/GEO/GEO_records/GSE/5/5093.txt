TITLE
Comparison of metastasis-inclined microenvironment (MIM) and metastasis-averse microenvironment (MAM) HCC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the role of the hepatic microenvironment in HCC metastasis, we compared the gene expression profiles of 20 noncancerous surrounding hepatic tissues from two HCC patient groups, those with primary HCC together with venous metastasis which we termed a metastasis-inclined microenvironment (MIM) and those with HCC without detectable metastasis, which we termed a metastasis-averse microenvironment (MAM). Keywords: disease state design
