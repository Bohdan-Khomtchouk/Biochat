TITLE
Cohesin and cohesion establishment factors distribution on S.Cerevisiae chromosome VI during the cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Two identical sister copies of eukaryotic chromosomes are synthesised during S-phase. To facilitate their recognition as pairs for segregation in mitosis, sister chromatids are held together from their synthesis onwards by the chromosomal cohesin complex. It is thought that replication fork progression is coupled to establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, thus facilitating identification of replication products, but evidence for this has remained circumstantial. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4 and Ctf18 are found close to, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S-phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment, and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved. Keywords: ChIP on chip
