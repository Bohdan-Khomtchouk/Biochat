TITLE
Stress-specific role of the fission yeast Gcn5 acetylatransferase in programming a subset of stress-response genes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have found Gcn5 is specifically requried for KCl and CaCl2 mediated stress in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe. We have charaterised the genome wide gene expression responses to KCl stress and show the Gcn5 in involved in the regulation of sebset of stress response genes. Keywords: stress response
