TITLE
Gene expression in PBMC from Multiple Sclerosis patients undergoing interferon beta therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the gene expression patterns in PBMC from relapsing remitting MS patients undergoing weekly IFN-ß-1a therapy. On the basis of two fold changes in expression levels and statistical analyses we selected a diagnostic set of 137 genes that were differentially expressed between pretreatment and IFN-ß-1a-treated MS patients.  Some these 137 genes may provide the basis for lack of IFN-ß-1a response. Keywords: Drug response to Interferon beta therapy in Multiple Sclerosis patients.
