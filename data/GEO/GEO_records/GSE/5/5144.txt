TITLE
hTERT effects in CD8 T Lymphocytes from two healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression in GFP vs. GFP/hTERT transduced CD8 T Lymphocytes from Healty Donors (HD) 1 and 2 at early and late passages. Using CD8+ T lymphocyte clones over-expressing telomerase we investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell proliferation. Transduction and subcloning procedures were performed on CD8 + naive T-cell clones isolated from two different healthy individuals aged between 30 to 35 years (HD1 and HD2). T-cell cloneswere transduced to express hTERT/GFP or GFP alone. Keywords: Cell Line Comparison.
