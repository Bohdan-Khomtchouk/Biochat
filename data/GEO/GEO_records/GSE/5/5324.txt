TTP mRNA targets identified by global analysis of stabilized transcripts in TTP-deficient fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein that was identified through its rapid induction by mitogens in fibroblasts. Studies of TTP-deficient mice, and cells derived from them, showed that TTP could bind to certain AU-rich elements in mRNAs, leading to increases in the rates of mRNA deadenylation and destruction. Known physiological target mRNAs for TTP include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 2 beta (IL2 beta). Here we used microarray analysis of RNA from wild-type and TTP-deficient fibroblast cell lines to identify transcripts with different decay rates, after serum stimulation and actinomycin D treatment. Of 250 mRNAs apparently stabilized in the absence of TTP, 23 contained conserved TTP binding sites; 10 of these were shown by secondary analyses to be stabilized. The most dramatically affected transcript encoded the protein Ier3, recently implicated in the physiological control of blood pressure. The Ier3 transcript contained several conserved TTP binding sites that could bind TTP directly, and conferred TTP sensitivity to the mRNA in cell transfection studies. These studies have identified several new, physiologically relevant TTP target transcripts in fibroblasts; these target mRNAs encode proteins from a variety of functional classes.
