TITLE
Expression data from adult male and female Drosophila melanogaster antenna, proboscis, and front leg

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Sex-specific gene expression in sensory organs may play an important role in mating and foraging behavior.  We used long-oligonucleotide microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of males and females in three adult appendages that carry large numbers of chemosensory organs â€“ antenna, proboscis, and front leg. Keywords: tissue-specific expression profiles
