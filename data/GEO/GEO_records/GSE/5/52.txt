TITLE
Ume6 regulon

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Ume6 transcription factor in yeast is known to both repress and activate expression of diverse genes during mitotic growth and meiotic development. To obtain a more complete profile of the functions regulated by this protein, microarray analysis was used to examine transcription in wild type and ume6-deleted diploids during vegetative growth in glucose and acetate.
