TITLE
Expression profiling of human adult postmortem brain tissue from Down syndrome and healthy control subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Down syndrome (DS) is the result of trisomy chromosome 21 but the mechanisms by which the genotype leads to the characteristic disease phenotype are unclear. We performed a microarray study using human adult brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from DS subjects and healthy controls to characterise for the first time the human adult Down syndrome brain Keywords: disease state analysis
