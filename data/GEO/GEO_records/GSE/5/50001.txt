TITLE
Expression data from Balb/C mice spleen tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The immunotoxicity of PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) were reported previously, however, the detailed toxic mechanism remain unknown. Spleen is an important immune organ that controls the differentiation and development of immune cells including T cells, B cells, and macrophages etc. the disruption of the organ may result in altered immune functions and immunotoxicity. We used microarrays to snapshot the changes of global gene expression, and identified target genes underlying the immunotoxicity of PFOS exposure.

DESIGN
6-8 week old Balb/c female mice were exposed to 10mg/kg body weight PFOS per day for 3 weeks through intragastric administration, and then spleens were removed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. By comparing the gene expression of spleens with or without PFOS exposure, we sought to obtain differentially expressed genes in order to reveal the toxic mechanism of PFOS.
