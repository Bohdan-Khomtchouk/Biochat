TITLE
Hoxb1 mutant mRNA levels  in rhombomere 4 at E10.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hoxb1 is required for proper specification of rhombomere 4 and the facial motor neurons. This study analyzed gene expression in the corresponding hindbrain segment of E10.5 mutant embryos. Several genetic pathways were found altered, including transcription factors such as Phox2b, Gata3, Nkx2-2 and Nkx6-1. Keywords: hindbrain development, rhombomere 4, Hoxb1
