TITLE
MPSS profiling of embryonic gonad and primordial germ cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used the MPSS technology to uncover gene expression profiling in a greater depth in the early embryonic gonads and primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the chicken. Total numbers of sequenced signatures were 1,012,533 and 995,676 for the PGCs and gonad. Using a false discovery rate cut-off of 0.05, we found 3.05 % of all signatures in the PCGs and 1.89 % of all signatures in the gonad signatures were significantly up-regulated compared to each sample. The MPSS result was very consistent with our previous result using EST data( ). Keywords: cell type comparison
