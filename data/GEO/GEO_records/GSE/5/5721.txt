TITLE
Double-tiled DNA microarrays -- proof of principle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have developed a double-tiling method that effectively doubles the number of sequences on a microarray, and with these arrays we confirm that our design can be utilized quickly and easily. Keywords: testing novel microarray design
