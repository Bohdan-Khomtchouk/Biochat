TITLE
Expression data from Callipyge muscle types (ST, LD, SS, SM) at birth (T=0) and 12 weeks (T=12)

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used for transcription profiling of skeletal muscle samples taken at birth, when the phenotype was not expressed, and 12 weeks of age from Callipyge and wild type sheep. The genes that underlie the expression of the phenotype rather than result from the fibre type change in the affected muscle have been identified. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the hypertrophy phenotype and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process. A working model that links the muscle hypertrophy phenotype with a core group of transcriptional coregulators is proposed. Keywords: Genotype X muscle X  time course study
