TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of meiotic DSB induced by Gal4BD-Spo11

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We mapped the binding and DSB sites in a strain expressing the fusion protein Gal4BD-Spo11, as well as the DSB sites in strains expressing endogenous Spo11, pADH1Spo11 and pADH1Gal4BD. Keywords: ChIP-chip
