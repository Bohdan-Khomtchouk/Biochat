TITLE
Ssn6HA-ts VS WT @ 36 Deg

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the transcriptional co-repressor proteins Ssn6 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of a conditional Ssn6HA-ts strain was compared against the expression in a WT strain as described before (Xue et al, 2004), except that cells were shifted to 36 deg 1 h prior to RNA extraction. Keywords: Conditional mutant
