TITLE
FIGLA, an oocyte-specific transcription factor, affects ovarian gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovarian folliculogenesis in mammals is a complex process involving cross talk between germ and somatic cells. Carefully orchestrated expression of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors are required for success. We have identified a germ-cell specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, FIGLA (Factor In GermLine, Alpha) and demonstrated its involvement in two independent developmental processes: formation of primordial follicle and coordinate expression of zona pellucida genes. Taking advantage of Figla null mouse line, we have used microarrays to identify potential downstream target genes. Using high stringent cut offs, we find that FIGLA functions a key regulatory molecule in coordinating expression of the NALP family of genes, genes of known oocyte-specific expression and a set of functionally un-annotated genes. These data implicate FIGLA as a central regulator of oocyte-specific genes that play role in folliculogenesis and early development. Keywords: Time Course; genetic modification
