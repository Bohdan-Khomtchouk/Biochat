SUMMARY
Responses of the Human Airway Epithelium Transcriptome to In Vivo Injury To identify genes participating in repair of the human airway epithelium following injury, we used bronchoscopy and brushing to denude the airway epithelium of healthy individuals, sequentially sampled the same region 7 and 14 days later, and assessed the recovered epithelium for relative levels of gene expression using Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays with TaqMan PCR confirmation. Histologic assessment showed that the epithelium was denuded immediately following injury, at 7 days the epithelium was completely covered but partially de-differentiated, and by 14 days there was close to normal proportions of differentiated cells. Gene expression analysis was carried out with both the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 and Robust Multi-array Average algorithms, applying a multiple test correction to identify bona fide changes in gene expression. At day 7, there were substantial differences in the gene expression pattern compared to the resting epithelium, with a distinctive airway epithelial “repair transcriptome” of actively proliferating cells in the process of re-differentiation. The repair transcriptome at 7 days was dominated by genes encoding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, transcription, signal transduction, metabolism and transport. Interestingly, the majority of cell cycle genes differentially expressed at day 7 belonged to the G2 and M late phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that the proliferating cells are relatively synchronized 1 wk following injury. At 14 days post-injury, the majority of the gene expression changes observed at day 7 were no longer observed, with the expression profile similar to that of resting airway epithelium. Using a class prediction algorithm, a group of 50 genes dominated by cell cycle genes, that represent a human airway epithelial “repair signature” was identified. These observations provide a baseline of the functional gene categories participating in the process of normal human airway epithelial repair that can be used in future studies of injury and repair in human airway epithelial diseases.
