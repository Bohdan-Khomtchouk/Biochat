TITLE
Fire ant adult vs brood comparison for microarray quality control

ORGANISM
Solenopsis invicta

SUMMARY
Ants display a range of fascinating behaviors, a remarkable level of intra-species phenotypic plasticity and many other interesting characteristics. Here we present a new tool to study the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits: a tentatively annotated expressed sequence tag (EST) resource for the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. From a normalized cDNA library we obtained 21,715 ESTs, which represent 11,864 putatively different transcripts with very diverse molecular functions. All ESTs were used to construct a cDNA microarray. We compared mixed adults to mixed brood to test the quality of the microarrays. Keywords: microarray quality control
