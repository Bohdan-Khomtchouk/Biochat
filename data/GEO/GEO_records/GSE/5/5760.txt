Gene Expression Profiling of Patients with a Variation in the TNF-alpha gene and suffering from Multiple Trauma

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: Patients encountering severe trauma are at risk of developing sepsis syndrome and subsequent multiple organ failure. This is often associated with fatal outcome despite survival of the initial injury. We undertook a prospective cohort study of trauma patients to examine the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the pathogenesis of sepsis syndrome and mortality. METHODS: 159 severely traumatized patients from a single centre were included. Serial blood samples were analyzed for serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin alpha (LT-alpha). We genotyped nine polymorphisms in the TNF gene and tested for an association with sepsis syndrome and outcome. Genetic associations were validated in an external replication sample (n=76). We examined the peripheral blood transcriptome in n=28 patients by whole genome-based profiling and validated the results. RESULTS: Carriage of the TNF rs1800629 A allele was associated with higher TNF-alpha serum concentrations on the first day after trauma and during follow up (two-sided p=5.0x10-5), with development of sepsis syndrome (OR 7.14, two-sided p=1.2x10-6; external validation sample (n=76): OR 3.3, one-sided p=0.03), and with fatal outcome (OR 7.65, two-sided p=1.9x10-6). Carriage of the TNF rs1800629 A allele was associated with differential expression of genes representing stronger pro-inflammatory and apoptotic responses as compared to carriage of the wild type allele. CONCLUSIONS: Common TNF gene variants are associated with sepsis syndrome and death after severe injury. These findings are strongly supported by functional data and may be important for developing preemptive anti-inflammatory interventions in carriers of the risk-associated allele.
