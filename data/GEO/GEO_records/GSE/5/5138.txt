Chromosomal abberations and transcriptional characteristics linked to the pathogenesis of diffuse large b-cell lymphomas

SUMMARY
We superimposed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data onto existing expression array profiles (GSE3892) to sift out the pivotal genes underlying the pathogenesis of a well defined series of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). 280 gained and over-expressed genes were identified, located on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 7, 12p12, 18q and 21q. At the most frequently gained region the oncogene MDMX/MDM4 was concurrently over-expressed, which is a critical regulator of p53 function. In regions of frequent chromosomal loss, 36 genes were concurrently down-regulated, restricted to 6q and 15p. These putative tumor suppressor genes included PERP, MAP3K5, CCNDBP1 and Î²2M, and loss of 6q was associated with poor clinical outcome. Genes identified and chromosomal regions validated in an independent series of DLBCL patients. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
