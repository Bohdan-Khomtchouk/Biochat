Wilms' tumor 1 WT1(-KTS) isoform time course induction in U2OS cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays important roles during development of several organs including metanephric kidneys. A number of WT1 target genes have been identified, but the detailed mechanisms by which WT1 orchestrates renal development remain elusive. To identify WT1 target genes relevant to development, genome-wide expression profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays representing 39,000 human transcripts Keywords: Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene, -KTS isoform; time course
