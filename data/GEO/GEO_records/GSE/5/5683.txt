TITLE
Identification of Gli-Act targets in the mouse ventral neural tube by ChIP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In studies investigating Sonic hedgehog (Shh) mediated patterning of the ventral neural tube, a process where Shh acts as a morphogen, we have investigated the transcriptional network underlying neural tube specification. Adopting an ES-cell based Shh neuronal specification assay (embryoid body; EBs) and a FLAG-tagged Gli protein (a transcriptional effector of the Shh pathway), we identified a number of direct targets of Gli action using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These results will provide a first survey of the genome level response to this critical signaling input in vertebrate patterning Keywords: ChIP-chip, Gli transcription factors, Gli1, neural specification, mouse
