TITLE
Characterization of the mouse transcriptome by Serial Analysis of Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the expressed transcripts of 15 intact tissues in mice by using the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) strategy which indicates the relative level of expression for each transcript matched to the tag. Keywords: double-strand cDNA , serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) , ditags
