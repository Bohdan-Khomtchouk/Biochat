TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in Malaria Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using genome-wide expression profiles from persons either experimentally challenged with malaria-infected mosquitoes or naturally-infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, we present details of the transcriptional changes that occur with infection and that are either commonly shared between subjects with pre-symptomatic and clinically apparent malaria or that distinguish these two groups. Our findings confirm and extend aspects of the earliest responses to malaria infection at the molecular level and which may be informative in elucidating how innate and adaptive immune responses may be modulated in different stages of infection. Keywords: Human PBMC samples from natural and experimentally (clinical trial) induced malaria
