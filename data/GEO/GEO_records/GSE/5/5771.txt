TITLE
Expression data from leaf of Arabidopsis TGS mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in Arabidopsis is regulated by two distinct pathways, DNA methylation-dependent and –independent. ddm1 and mom1 mutants are defective in the DNA-dependent and –independent pathway, respectively. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression in the TGS mutants Keywords: TGS mutants
