SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to show a serogroup conversion of Vibrio cholerae from O1 to 37. For this purpose, V. cholerae O1 El Tor (A1552) was grown on crab shell fragments to induce natural competence for transformation. Purified DNA (4 ug each) from strain ATCC25872, an O37 serogroup strain, was added after 24h and the cells were further grown for 24h. After detachment from the crab shell fragments, bacteria were poured into soft-agar and overlaid onto LB plates. Mukerjee's El Tor phage III (a gift of Dr. M.S. Islam) was dropped onto the surface of the bacteria containing soft-agar. The plaques formed by killing non-transformed A1552 cells possessed resistant clones which were picked and further selected by non-agglutination with O1-specific antiserum. One to four clones were selected from each independent experiment and analyzed by microarray hybridization (BioPrime. Array CGH Genomic Labeling from Invitrogen). Two microarray replicates were done per clone.   Strain Names: AIpO37#1 / AIpO37#4 / AIpO37#6 / AIpO37#8 are clones analyzed from the first experiment; AIIpO37#9 / AIIpO37#13 / AIIpO37#16 are clones analyzed from the second independent experiment; AIIIpO37#9A is a clone analyzed from the third independent experiment; AIVpO37#1A / AIVpO37#3A / AIVpO37#4A / AIVpO37#8A are clones analyzed from the fourth independent experiment. Two MA replicates per clone were done. CGHs of A1552 versus ATCC25872 are provided as control. A genotyping experiment design type classifies an individual or group of individuals on the basis of alleles, haplotypes, SNP's. Keywords: genotyping_design
