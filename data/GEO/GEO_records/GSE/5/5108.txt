TITLE
Whole human genome DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in ectopic vs. eutopic endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brief description of the experiment:   The objective of this experiment was to use DNA microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in eutopic uterine endometrium compared to ectopic endometrium.  174 of the 53,000 genes on the whole human DNA microarrays were changed by 5-fold or greater in ectopic vs. eutopic endometrium.  Families of genes that were differentially expressed include immune system and inflammatory pathway genes,  genes whose cognate proteins code for cell adhesion, junctional proteins, the extracellular matrix and its remodeling, and cytoskeletal proteins, and ligands, receptors, and components of specific signal transduction pathways.  The altered immune environment may allow survival of endometriotic cells that enter the peritoneal cavity.  Alterations of cell adhesion-associated genes may contribute to the adhesive and invasive properties of ectopic endometrium, and changes in signal transduction pathways support a change in the communication among cells of the endometrial explant compared to eutopic endometrium.  These families of differentially expressed genes provide multiple opportunities for the development and testing of new hypotheses regarding endometriosis.
