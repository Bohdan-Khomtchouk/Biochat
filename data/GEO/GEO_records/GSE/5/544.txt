TITLE
SAM PMN Parturition

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine blood neutrophil RNA from 4 primiparous Holstein cows was collected on days -7, 0, 0.25, and 1 (relative to parturition on day 0).   RNA was pooled across the four animals at the independent time points to obtain the 20 ug necessary for use in a loop design.  RNA pools were separated into two 10 ug aliquots prior to cDNA synthesis and dye coupling in a loop design.  Each sample was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and run in paired hybridizations as follows: GSM8506 compaired day 0.25 and day -7, GSM8507 compaired day 1 and day 0, GSM8508 compaired day -7 and day 1, GSM8509 compaired day 0 and 0.25.  This pairing strategy was utilized to directly compare day -7 samples with days 0.25 and 1 samples because results from previous experiments suggested that the most pronounced differences in gene expression would occur between these days.
