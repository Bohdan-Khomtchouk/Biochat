TITLE
Human Uterine Leiomyomata microRNA gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs. MiRNAs regulate developmental activity and may be aberrantly expressed in human diseases, including cancer. Expression of miRNAs is tissue or organ specific. Human uterine leiomyomas (ULMs) are the most common neoplasms of women, characterized by the ovarian sex hormone dependence, worse morbidity in black women and genetic heterogeneity.  The high incidence of the disease may be associated with developmental defects in uteri. In this study, we examined miRNA expression in 55 ULMs with matched myometrium using spotted microarray platform. Keywords: Disease state analysis
