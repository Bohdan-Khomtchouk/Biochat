TITLE
Bovine skeletal muscle gene network

Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We present the application of large-scale multivariate mixed-model equations to the joint analysis of nine gene expression experiments in beef cattle muscle and fat tissues with a total of 147 hybridizations, and exploring 47 experimental conditions or treatments. Using a correlation-based method, we constructed a gene network for 822 genes. Modules of muscle structural proteins and enzymes, extracellular matrix, fat metabolism and protein synthesis were clearly evident. Detailed analysis of the network identified groupings of proteins on the basis of physical association. For example, expression of three components of the z-disk, MYOZ1, TCAP and PDLIM3, was significantly correlated. In contrast, expression of these z-disk proteins was not highly correlated with the expression of a cluster of thick (myosins) and thin (actin and tropomyosins) filament proteins, or titin, the third major filament system. However, expression of titin was itself not significantly correlated with the cluster of thick and thin filament proteins and enzymes. Correlation in expression of many fast twitch muscle structural proteins and enzymes was observed, but slow twitch specific proteins were not correlated with the fast twitch proteins or with each other. In addition, a number of significant associations between genes and transcription factors were also identified. Our results not only recapitulate the known biology of muscle, but have also started to reveal some of the underlying associations between and within the structural components of skeletal muscle.
