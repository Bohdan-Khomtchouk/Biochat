TITLE
Glis3: The role in osteoblast differentiation and adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of Glis3 in C3H10T1/2 cells promotes osteoblastic differentiation as indicated by the the induction of increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, and increased expression of osteopontin, a late marker of osteogenesis. Glis3 acts synergistically with bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2). In contrast, expression of Glis3 inhibits the induction of adipocyte differentiation. Microarray analysis identified the fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) as one of the genes induced by Glis3 in C3H10T1/2 cells directly. Keywords: Glis3, osteoblast differentiation, adipocyte differentiation, FGF18, BMP2
