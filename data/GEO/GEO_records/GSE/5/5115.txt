TITLE
Time course analysis of TSH-stimulated rat thyroid cell lines

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A time-course analysis of TSH-stimulation in two rat thyroid cell lines (FRTL5 and FRT/TSHR) was performed. The expression levels of 8,784 transcripts were measured at three different time points, i.e. before (0), 30 minutes (30m) and 17 hours (17h) after TSH stimulation, by means of Affymetrix RG-U34A arrays. Keywords: Time course
