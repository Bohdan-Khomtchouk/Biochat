TITLE
Profiling of CD4+ T cells responding to transient or persistent antigen presented by dendritic cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments were done to compare the gene expression profiles in CD4+ T cells responding to antigen presented by dendritic cells transiently or persistently. Some treatments include the activation of the dendritic cells by CD40 engagement. Keywords: immune response
