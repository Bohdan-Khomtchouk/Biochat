TITLE
Temporal expression profile of granulocytic differentiation of primary CD34+ cells cultured under 5% and 20% O2 levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying granulocytic (G) commitment, differentiation and maturation.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of G differentiation of human CD34-positive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells cultured with interleukin-3, interleukin-6 granulocyte colony stimulating factor and stem cell factor.  The goal this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of G differentiation including commitment, expansion, differentiation and functional capacity. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
