TITLE
Rice plants infected by Rice dwarf virus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We investigated changes in gene expression in rice plants exposed to RDV to gain some insight into the fundamental physiological and biochemical changes that are induced by viral infection, in the hope of finding clues that might help to control the viral disease. An analysis, using microarrays, of gene expression in rice plants infected with Rice dwarf virus revealed significant decreases in levels of expression of genes that are involved in the formation of cell walls, reflecting the stunted growth of diseased plants. The expression of plastid-related genes was also suppressed, as anticipated from the white chlorotic appearance of infected leaves. By contrast, the expression of defense- and stress-related genes was enhanced after viral infection. Keywords: disease state analysis
