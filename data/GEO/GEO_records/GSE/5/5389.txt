SUMMARY
Bipolar affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component but unknown pathophysiology. We used microarray technology (Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips) to determine the expression of approximately 22 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue (orbitofrontal cortex) from patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. Orbitofrontal cortex tissue from a cohort of 30 subjects was investigated and the final analysis included 10 bipolar and 11 control subjects. Differences between disease and control groups were identified using a rigorous statistical analysis with correction for confounding variables and multiple testing. Keywords: disease state analysis
