TITLE
Genomic comparison of vancomycin susceptible and vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus pairs

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
To determine if significant genomic changes are associated with the development of vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus, genomic DNA microarrays were performed to compare the initial vancomycin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) and a related vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) isolate from five unique patients (five isolate pairs). Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
