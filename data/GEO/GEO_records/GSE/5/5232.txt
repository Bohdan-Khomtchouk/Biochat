TITLE
Expression data from Lbeta T2 cells upon activin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary response of Lbeta T 2cells upon activin treatment at 1hr, 2hr, and 6hr is the significant up-regulation of FSHbeta subunit. Affymetrix genearray missed this important information due to cross-hybridization of its probes with other genes and chromosome segments. Activin modulates a network of genes and signaling pathways to exert a variety of functions. Keywords: time course
