TITLE
hTERT effects in CD8 T Lymphocytes HD2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using CD8+ T lymphocyte clones over-expressing telomerase weinvestigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell proliferation.  Transduction and subcloning procedures were performed on CD8 + naive T-cell clones isolated from two different healthy individuals aged between 30 to 35 years (HD1 and HD2). T-cell cloneswere transduced to express hTERT/GFP or GFP alone. HD1 was profiled on U133A and submitted as a separate GEO series. Keywords: Cell Line Comparison.
