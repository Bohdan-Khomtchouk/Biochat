TITLE
Epigenetic Profiles Signify Cell Fate Plasticity in Unipotent Spermatogonial Stem and Progenitor Cells (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) spontaneously convert to multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs) during in vitro expansion. Here, we examine the epigenetic signature of SSCs and MASCs, identifying bivalent histone H3-lysine4 and -lysine27 trimethylation at somatic gene promoters in SSCs and an ESC-like promoter chromatin state in MASCs.

DESIGN
Examination of histone modifications K4me3, K27me3, and K27ac in different cell types.
