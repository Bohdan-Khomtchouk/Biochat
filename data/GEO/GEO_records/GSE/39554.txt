TITLE
Expression data from early B cell progenitors including CLP,ProB and PreB of Pax5 knockout and wild type C57Bl6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we have investigated molecular and functional properties in  early B-lineage  cells from Pax-5 deficient animals crossed to a B-lineage restricted reporter mouse. Gene expression analysis of ex  vivo isolated progenitor cells revealed that Pax-5 deficiency has a minor impact on Bcell specification.By  comparison  of  gene  expression  patterns  in  ex  vivo isolated Pax-5 and Ebf-1 deficient progenitors, it was possible to identify a set of B-cell restricted genes dependent of Ebf-1 but not Pax-5, supporting the idea that B-cell  specification  and  commitment  is  controlled  by  distinct  regulatory networks.

DESIGN
wt λ5 reporter+ and Pax5ko λ5reporter+ fetal liver from d15 embryos isolated and transplanted into sublethaly irradiated mice. After 4 weeks B220+λ5+ cells were sorted out from the bone marrow of the mice and subjected to microarray analyses
