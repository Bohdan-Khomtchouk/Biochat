ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs14-01_mitomanip2 - microarray experiment 4 - Mitochondrial transcriptome regulation and coordination with the nucleus - Following a previously established strategy (Val et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Res. 39, 9262â€“9274), we express, from an estradiol-inducible nuclear transgene, a trans-cleaving ribozyme directed against the nad9 mitochondrial mRNA and associated as a trailor sequence to a tRNA mimic. The latter serves as a shuttle and ensures mitochondrial uptake of the chimeric RNA through the natural tRNA import pathway. In mitochondria, the ribozyme triggers cleavage and degradation of the target mRNA. The impact of the nad9 mRNA knockdown on the overall plant transcriptome is analyzed over 4 successive days. Control plants express the shuttle RNA combined with a ribozyme that has no specific target in A. thaliana.
