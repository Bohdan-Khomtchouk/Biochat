TITLE
Adjunctive therapy with a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor improves INH response to pulmonary tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Current antibiotic regimen to treat tuberculosis (TB) is ineffective in fully eliminating the bacterial load and in alleviating disease pathology. We examined the usefulness of a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (CC-11050) as an adjunctive to anti-TB drug Isoniazid (INH) to improve the outcome of treatment in a rabbit model of active pulmonary TB.  Control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth, disease pathology and the global transcriptional response in Mtb-infected lungs of rabbits with or without CC-11050 treatment were studied. The microarray experiments involves comparison of changes in gene expression between uninfected and Mtb-HN878 infected (Untreated) or CC-11050  treated rabbit lungs at 8 weeks post-treatment, starting at 4 weeks of infection (i.e, 12 weeks post infection).

DESIGN
New Zealand White rabbits were infected with Mtb HN878 at about 3.2log10 (on day 0).  Starting at 4 weeks post infection, group of rabbits (n=4 per group) were treated with CC-11050 or no treatment. A group of uninfected rabbits were used as controls.  Total RNA from lung tissues of uninfected and Mtb-infected with or without treatment were isolated at 8 weeks post treatment and used for microarray gene expression analysis using 4X44k Agilent Rabbit Microarray system
