TITLE
FOXP1 inhibits cell growth and attenuates tumorigenicity of neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single-color gene expression profiles from 3 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. To gain insights into the molecular processes occurring upon FOXP1 re-expression, we performed series of time-resolved gene expression measurements in FOXP1 and GFP transgenic neuroblastoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Single-color gene expression profiles from 3 neuroblastoma cell lines were generated using 44K oligonucleotide microarrays. Total RNA of FOXP1- and GFP-expressing IMR-32, CHP-212 and SK-N-BE(2) cells was isolated at 0, 12, 24 and 72 h using Trizol. To determine global differences in the expression profiles of FOXP1- and GFP-induced  IMR-32, CHP-212 and SK-N-BE(2)  cells, mean expression levels of each gene between FOXP1-induced and control (GFP) cells were compared.
