TITLE
Mouse Segmental Duplication and Copy-Number Variation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Detailed analyses of the clone-based genome assembly reveal that the recent duplication content of mouse (4.94%) is now comparable to that of human (5.5%), in contrast to previous estimates from the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly. The architecture of mouse and human genomes differ dramatically; most mouse duplications are organized into discrete clusters of tandem duplications that are depleted for genes/transcripts and enriched for LINE1 and LTR retroposons. We assessed copy-number variation of the C57BL/6J duplicated regions within 15 mouse strains used for genetic association studies, sequencing, and the mouse phenome project. We determined that over 60% of these basepairs are polymorphic between the strains (on average 20 Mbp of copy-number variable DNA between different mouse strains). Our data suggest that different mouse strains show comparable, if not greater, copy-number polymorphism when compared to human; however, such variation is more locally restricted. We show large and complex patterns of inter-strain copy-number variation restricted to large gene families associated with spermatogenesis, pregnancy, viviparity, phermone signaling, and immune response. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of 14 inbred mouse strains was tested against reference C57BL/6J sample. C57BL/6J DNA sample from another individual was tested as negative control.
