TITLE
A mechanism for triggering cell differentiation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine whether IYO is not only necessary but also sufficient to activate transcription of developmental programs, we compared the transcriptome of shoot apices from 35S::IYO-GFP plants to that of 35S::GFP plants at the time of inflorescence emergence. Our results strongly suggest that IYO activates the transcription of key developmental regulators driving differentiation.

DESIGN
Shoot apices RNA sample is a pool from RNAs from four independent experiments, and the RNA from each experiment was a pool of RNAs extracted from 12 individuals  Arabidopsis 35S:IYO-GFP or 35S:GFP plants.
