TITLE
Gene Expression of primary rat hippocampal neurons after Ncoa3 knockdown

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We identified Ncoa3 as a regulator of neuronal morphology and microRNA activity. In order to uncover target genes of this transcriptional coactivator we performed this microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The Expression of Ncoa3 was diminshed by AAV-mediated Ncoa3 shRNA expression. Gene expression was compared to control shRNA expressing cells. Three biological replicates are included in this analysis.
