TITLE
Impaired Natural Killer Cell Self-Education and 'Missing-Self' Responses in Ly49-Deficient Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nimblegen arrays were used to perform aCGH analysis on 2 mice strains, one which lacks the Ly49 gene cluster and the parent strain which still has the cluster.  A targeted knock-out of the cluster resulted in the rearrangment and deletion of the cluster.  The aCGH experiment was performed to elucidate the extent of the deletion.

DESIGN
high resolution aCGH analysis of the Ly49 cluster in deletion strain

PLATFORM
