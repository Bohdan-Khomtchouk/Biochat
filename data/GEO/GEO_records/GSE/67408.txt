TITLE
microRNA expression during tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further analyze the change of microRNA(miRNA) between normal peritoneal macrophage(PEC) and TAM from early tumor(12 days after 4T1 cell injection) or TAM from late tumor(21 days after 4T1 cell injection) , we employed Agilent mouse microRNA microarray Rel 12.0 as a discovery platform to identify miRNAs

DESIGN
Total RNA from peritoneal macrophage and TAM of early tumor (tumor formed for 12days after BALB/c mice injected wth 4T1 cell) or TAM of late tumor(tumor formed for 21days after BALB/c mice injected with 4T1 cell) were extracted and analyzed using Agilent mouse microRNA microarray platform, and changes of miRNA were screened out. Agilent mouse microRNA microarray is designed for the profiling of mouse miRNA .627 mouse miRNA and 39 mouse virus-related miRNA can be detected by our microRNA microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL9756 Agilent-021828 Unrestricted Mouse miRNA Microarray (miRNA_105_Dec08)
