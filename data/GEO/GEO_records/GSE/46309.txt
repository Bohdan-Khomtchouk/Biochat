TITLE
To study gene expression of PHO80-deleted yeast strain in xylose fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The main objective is to improve xylose fermentation by deletion of PHO80 gene in recombinant xylose-fermenting yeast strains. Microarray analysis was performed to investigate effects of PHO80 deletion on the gene expression profile of xylose-fermenting strains.

DESIGN
Samples for 2 strains (wild-type control, PHO80-deleted strain) were taken after 6h of xylose fermentation. Each sample was triplicated, resulting in a total of 6 samples.
