TITLE
mRNA expression in ttcsp1 deletion mutant and wild type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strains grown on a rich medium

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of ttcsp1 deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TR) medium at 45oC compared with that of 70oC. Keywords: temperature comparison

DESIGN
Wild-type and ttcsp1 mutant T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70oC for 16 h in 3 ml of TR medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (0.3 ml) were inoculated into 0.15 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70oC. At the Abs600=0.8 (0min), cold medium was added and the temperature were shifted down to 45oC. Cells were collected at 0min and 30min after temperature shift, and then crude RNA was extracted. In order to compare mRNA expression in the ttcsp1 mutant between 45oC and 70oC, the expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample in this website.
