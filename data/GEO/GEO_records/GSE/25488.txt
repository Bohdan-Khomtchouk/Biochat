TITLE
Expression data from C3(1)Tag mammary tumors, tumor derived cell line (M6) and normal mammary tissue (FVB)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
M6 cells expression a similar genetic signature as the parent tumor, C3(1)Tag tumor. The mammary tumors, and tumor cell line, are distinct from normal mammary epithelial tissue (FVB) BRCA/p53, cmyc, h2n, p53ERneg, p53ERpos, pymt and ras samples were not reported in this paper.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to determine whether the M6 cell line retains the SV40Tag signature (91 gene signature) that is expressed in C3(1)Tag tumors but not FVB normal mammary tissue.
