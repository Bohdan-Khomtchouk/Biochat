TITLE
Expression data from C3(1)Tag mammary tumors, tumor derived cell line (M6) and normal mammary tissue (FVB)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
M6 cells expression a similar genetic signature as the parent tumor, C3(1)Tag tumor. The mammary tumors, and tumor cell line, are distinct from normal mammary epithelial tissue (FVB) BRCA/p53, cmyc, h2n, p53ERneg, p53ERpos, pymt and ras samples were not reported in this paper.
