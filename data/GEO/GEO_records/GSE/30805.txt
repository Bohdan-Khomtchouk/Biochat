TITLE
Expression data from low expressing T58A Mutant Myc Induced Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to futher characterize the effects of T58A mutation in Myc on mammary tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
17 MMTV-Myc T58A mammary tumors were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
