TITLE
Genetic circuit 0x58

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We report the characterization of a synthetic genetic circuit using RNA-Seq data. Data is collected for all input inducer combinations and cells harboring the circuit are grown in two conditions (14 ml culture tubes and 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks).

DESIGN
Examination of 8 different inducer combinations for 2 grown conditions (culture tubes and Erlenmeyer flasks)

PLATFORM
GPL18133 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Escherichia coli)
