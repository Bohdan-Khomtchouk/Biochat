TITLE
Transcription profile of dormant and germinating Aspergillus niger conidia

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis was performed to assess the transcriptional landscape of germinating A. niger conidia using GeneChips. The metabolism of storage compounds during conidial germination was also examined and compared to the transcript levels from associated genes. The transcriptome of dormant conidia was shown to be highly differentiated from that of germinating conidia and major changes in response to environmental shift occurred within the first hour of germination. The breaking of dormancy was associated with increased transcript levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of proteins, RNA turnover and respiratory metabolism. Increased transcript levels of genes involved in metabolism of nitrate and proline at the onset of germination implies their use as sources of nitrogen. Dormant conidia contained transcripts of genes involved in fermentation, gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle. The presence of such transcripts in dormant conidia may indicate the generation of energy from non-carbohydrate substrates during starvation-induced conidiation or for maintenance purposes during dormancy. The immediate onset of metabolism of internal storage compounds after the onset of germination, and the presence of transcripts of relevant genes, suggest that conidia are primed for the onset of germination.

DESIGN
one biological replicate for each sample, each sample contained pooled RNA from three independent replicates
