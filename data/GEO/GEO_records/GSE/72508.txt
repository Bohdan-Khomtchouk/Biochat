TITLE
Maize (Zea mays): control vs cold stress

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 4 maize varieties comparing genetic root response under control temperature conditions with genetic root response under low temperature conditions

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs cold stress treatment. Biological replicates: 3 control and 3 treatment per variety, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. Hybridization followed a two-channel loop design (direct comparison) where all the samples of interest are hybridised to each other without a reference sample.

PLATFORM
GPL6438 Maize oligonucleotide array 46K version
