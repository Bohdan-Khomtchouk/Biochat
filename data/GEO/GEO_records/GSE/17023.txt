TITLE
Profiling gene expression in 32Dcl3 cells following Xbp1 retrovirus vector transfection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The significant changes of hematopoietic cells induced by Xbp1S expression indicate that there is global alteration in gene expression. UPR induces transcription of Xbp1, and phosphorylation of the ER transmembrane kinase IRE1 initiates UPR-mediated mRNA splicing of Xbp1, resulting in the production of Xbp1S, an active form of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. In the present study, Xbp1S retrovirus vector infected 32cl3 cells show cell cycle arrest and myeloid differentiation. Xbp1S may modulate important genes of differentiation and the cell cycle.

DESIGN
RNA samples extracted from 32Dcl3 cells with pMIG (empty vector), pMY-Xbp1U (unspliced form) and pMY-Xbp1S (spliced form) retroviral vector transfected cells were subjected to expression profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip microarray system.
