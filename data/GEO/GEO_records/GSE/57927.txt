TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human bone marrow CD45-CD271+ cells in comparision with CD45-CD271- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyze and compare the gene expression profile of human bone marrow primary CD45-CD271+ and CD45-CD271- cells. The hypothesis was some genes were differentially expressed in these two populations. Results provided important information regarding the gene expression difference of these two cell populations.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CD45-CD271+ and CD45-CD271- cells were amplified and genome wide gene profiling was compared.
