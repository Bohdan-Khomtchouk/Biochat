TITLE
Prior infection with Type A Francisella tularensis antagonizes the pulmonary transcriptional response to an aerosolized TLR4 agonist

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prior aerosol exposure to F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, but not the live attenuated strain (LVS) of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica or F. novicida, significantly antagonized the transcriptional response in the lungs of infected mice exposed to aerosolized TLR4 ligand E. coli LPS.

DESIGN
The ability of a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist to induce a pulmonary inflammatory response in Francisella-infected animals was examined to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms, and also to investigate potential differences between three Francisella strains that exhibit varying levels of virulence in humans.
