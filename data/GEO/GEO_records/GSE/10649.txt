TITLE
Sex-differences in the control of gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study we tested the hypothesis that male and female rat livers respond differently to a change in nutrient availability or to insulin treatment. Healthy normal rats were used to determine the effects of mild starvation or insulin injections on hepatic lipid and carbohydrate turnover as well as gene expression. Keywords: Hepatic glucose output, gluconeogenesis, gene expression, respons to insulin treatment and mild starvation

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment. Biological replicates: male rat livers +/- mild starvation (n=8), female rat livers +/- mild starvation (n=8), Treated with saline or insulin (i.p.) for 40 minutes. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6528 Rat Oligo array V3.0.5 27648 spots
