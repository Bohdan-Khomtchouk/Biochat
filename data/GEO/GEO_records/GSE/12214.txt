TITLE
Microcystin Genomic Effects on Zebrafish Larvae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were obtained from the Zebrafish Research Facility maintained in the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at the University of Tennessee.  Fish husbandry, spawning, and experimental procedures were conducted with approval from the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #1690-1007).  Water for holding fish and conducting experiments (hereafter referred to as fish water) consisted of MilliQ water (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with ions added: 19 mg/L NaHCO3, 1 mg/L sea salt (Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt, Mentor, OH), 10 mg/L CaSO4, 10 mg/L MgSO4, 2 mg/L KCl.  Embryos were obtained by spawning adult fish with no history of contaminant exposure.  Fertilization of embryos took place at the same time (± 15 min.), such that larvae used in experiments were of similar age at the time of exposure.  All activities (maintenance of adult fish, spawning, and experiments) were conducted in an environmental chamber with a temperature of 27± 1 ºC and 14:10h light:dark photoperiod.

DESIGN
At 72 h post-fertilization, zebrafish larvae were exposed to lyophilized Microcystis and purified MC-LR at concentrations of 100 and 1,000 µg/L.  Controls consisted of zebrafish system water (negative control) and zebrafish system water containing 0.05% ethanol (vehicle control). Larvae from both control groups as well as 100 µg/L MC-LR, 1,000 µg/L MC-LR, and lyophilized Microcystis were exposed in groups of 50 with three replicates and were sacrificed after 96 hours for total RNA extraction and subsequent microarray analysis.  All larvae were exposed in beakers containing 100 ml of solution. Water samples for microcystin analysis and water quality measurements were taken during the experiment, and mortality and behavioral observations were recorded at 24-hour intervals. Microcystin analysis was conducted by protein phosphatase inhibition assay.  Measured concentrations of microcystin-LR were 140 ± 12 SD (low concentration) and 1,703 ± 71 SD (high concentration).  The concentration of microcystin-LR in the lyophilized Microcystis treatment was 4.5 µg/L.  Water quality parameters measured included dissolved oxygen (6.7 mg/L), pH (6.9), total alkalinity (36 mg/L as CaCO3), total hardness (18 mg/L as CaCO3), and ammonia ( < 0.2 mg/L). No significant mortality or behavioral changes in larvae were observed during the exposure.
