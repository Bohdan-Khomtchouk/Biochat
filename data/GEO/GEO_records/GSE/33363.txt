TITLE
CD99 is a novel prognostic stromal marker in non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The delicate interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding stroma plays an essential role in all stages of tumourigenesis. Despite the significance of this interplay, alterations in protein composition underlying tumour-stroma interactions are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify stromal proteins with clinical relevance in non-small cell lung cancer. A list encompassing 203 stromal candidate genes was compiled based on gene expression array data and available literature. The protein expression of these genes in human NSCLC was screened utilising the Human Protein Atlas. Twelve proteins were selected that showed a differential stromal staining pattern. The corresponding antibodies were applied on a tissue microarray, including 190 NSCLC samples, and stromal staining was correlated with clinical parameters. Higher stromal expression of CD99was associated with good prognosis in the univariate (p=0.037) and multivariate (p=0.039) analyses. The association was independent from the total proportion of tumour stroma, the fraction of inflammatory cells, and clinical and pathological parameters like stage, performance status and tumour histology. The prognostic impact of stromal CD99 protein expression was confirmed in an independent cohort of 240 NSCLC patients (p=0.008). Furthermore, double-staining confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that CD99 was expressed in stromal lymphocytes as well as in cancer associated fibroblasts. Based on a comprehensive screening strategy the membrane protein CD99 was identified as a novel stromal factor with clinical relevance. The result supports the concept that stromal properties have a significant impact on tumourigenesis.

DESIGN
Tissue from five tumors were compared to corressponding microdissected tissue from the same tissue sample
