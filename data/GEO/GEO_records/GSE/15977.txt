TITLE
Analysis of the microRNA that involved the tuberculosis or latent TB infection I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To get to know the different levels of the microRNA among the pulmonary tuberculosis patients, latent-infected individuals and the complete healthy people, we have employed the Agilent miRNA microarray (version 2.0)  as a discovery platform to identify microRNA with the potential to diagnose the TB patients and the latent infected persons. Each group have 4 volunteers. The Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of each group were made up of equally mixed volumes. The results showed that several microRNAs were found up- or low regulated in PBMCs of TB patients versus latent-infected individuals and similarly for latent-infected individuals versus complete healthy ones.

DESIGN
Each group have 4 volunteers. The PBMCs of each group were made up of equally mixed volumes after being purified.
