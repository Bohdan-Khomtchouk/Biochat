TITLE
Inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase KDM1A are broadly efficacious in AML by evicting the enzyme from chromatin [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examine the distribution of KDM1A and the histone H3K4me2 mark on chromatin following treatment with two distinct classes of KDM1A inhibitors - an irreversible inhibitor (RN-1) and a reversible inhibitor (GSK690)

DESIGN
15 samples total from two treated cell lines - 9 from Kasumi-1 and 6 from SKNO-1.  Controls included were input DNA isolated from the treated cells.

PLATFORM
