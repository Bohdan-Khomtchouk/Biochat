TITLE
RNA-microarray analyses and protein profiles from affected and clinically non-affected scalp in male androgenetic alopecia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this pilot study was to combine standard clinical diagnostics with RNA and protein analyses from non-invasively obtained material. In 6 male volunteers with AGA, Norwood-Hamilton stage IIIv-IV, we performed global photography, phototrichogram, pH and sebum measurements, as well as skin surface cytokine measurements on AGA-affected frontal and vertex scalp skin compared to clinically unaffected occiput.

DESIGN
Six male volunteers with AGA, aged 18-45, with Hamilton-Norwood stage IIIv-IV, were included in the study. Institutional review board (Charit√©-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin) approval and written informed consent were obtained. The study was performed in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. After a screening visit and obtaining a written informed consent, subjects came for a first visit (day 0) where global photography, shaving, mini-zone CSSS (to collect scalp surface protein material), ultrasound, pH and scalp and hair sebum levels were determined. Until the second visit (V2, day 3) subjects were not allowed to wash their hairs or apply any product on scalp or hair. On visit 2, pH and sebum measurements were repeated, together with OCT, phototrichogram and hair root plucking for RNA extraction and analysis.
