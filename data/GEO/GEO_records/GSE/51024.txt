TITLE
Gene Expression of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Tumor and paired Normal Lung tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to discover critical pathways /networks or therapeutic targets in pleural mesothelioma we profiled 55 tumors along with paired normal tissue (for 41 tumors) using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 chips

DESIGN
RNA isolated from frozen resected tumor and normal tissues was hybridized to Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 chips to discover genes upregulated/downregulated in mesothelioma tumors compared to paired normal non-tumor adjacent tissue as well as find differences between the different tumors

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
