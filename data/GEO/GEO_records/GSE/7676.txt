TITLE
Changes in gene expression following Protocadherin 12 knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12) is a transmembrane adhesive protein with homophilic adhesive properties and expressed in endothelial cells, the glycogen trophoblast cells of the placenta, and the mesangial cells of kidney glomeruli. Pcdh12-deficient mice are alive although they show alterations in placenta development. To reveal Pcdh12-associated pathways, 45,000 - Affymetrix probe arrays were used on Pcdh12 knockout and control placentas. Keywords: Comparative gene knockout results
