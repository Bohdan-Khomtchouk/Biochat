TITLE
Changes in gene expression following Protocadherin 12 knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12) is a transmembrane adhesive protein with homophilic adhesive properties and expressed in endothelial cells, the glycogen trophoblast cells of the placenta, and the mesangial cells of kidney glomeruli. Pcdh12-deficient mice are alive although they show alterations in placenta development. To reveal Pcdh12-associated pathways, 45,000 - Affymetrix probe arrays were used on Pcdh12 knockout and control placentas. Keywords: Comparative gene knockout results

DESIGN
To identify genes whos expression was modified by Pcdh12 deficiency, we examined global gene expression profiles of whole E12.5 knockout placentas (Pcdh12 -l-) and their wild-type (WT â€“ Pcdh12+l+ ) littermates, using the Affymetrix Murine Genome 430 2.0 microarrays. Gestation day 12 was chosen as it is the period at which placentas already formed distinct layers, but organogenesis is still very active. Total RNA was extracted from five Pcdh12 knockout embryos and five normal placentas. RNA were tested for integrity on Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer, prior to cRNA synthesis and chip hybridization (performed by the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology, Strasbourg, France).
