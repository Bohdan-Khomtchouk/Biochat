TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human bone marrow cells (hMSC-TERT) sorted from MCF7 and BT-20 co-culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray  to identify changes in gene expression in human bone marrow MSCs (hMSC-TERT) sorted from seven days co-cultures with breast cancer cell lines (MCF7) and (BT-20)

DESIGN
Human MSC line (hMSC-TERT) were co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and BT-20 for seven days then were sorted using EpiCAM MACS beads. Subsequently, RNA was extracted using Norgen total RNA isolation kit. Extracted RNA was labeled and then hybridized to the one-color Agilent Human GE 8x60K Microarray chip.
