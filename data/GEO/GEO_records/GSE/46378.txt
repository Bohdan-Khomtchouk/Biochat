TITLE
Investigation of Alterations in Gene Expression in the Retina Induced by High-Affinity Peptides targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, AAP and HAN

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we demonstrate that high-affinity peptides targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, AAP and HAN, suppress in vivo pathologic angiogenesis in the retina. To figure out any definite toxicity at the level of gene expression, we performed microarray analyses of gene expression from retinal tissues after the treatment with AAP and HAN

DESIGN
We intravitreally injected PBS, AAP, or HAN into the right eyes of C57BL/6 male mice (n = 12 per group). PBS-treated mice were regarded as negative control. Four retinal tissues were pooled into 1 test tube and prepared for further analyses.
