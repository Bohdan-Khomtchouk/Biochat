TITLE
Analysis of DNA methylation dynamics at Alu elements during human B cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired-end sequencing of methylated DNA fragments in B cell subsets revealed widespread loss of methylation at Alu elements upon B cell activation.

DESIGN
DNA methylation pattern was analyzed in purified na√Øve and germinal-center B cells derived from 1 patient
