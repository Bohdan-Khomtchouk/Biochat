TITLE
Gene expression data from FLCN-restored UOK257-2 renal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UOK257 cell line was derived from a BHD patient. It harbors a germline mutation in FLCN (c.1285dupC) and LOH. UOK257-2 cells were generated from UOK257 cells by introducing wildtype FLCN using retrovirus. FLCN inactivation induces TFE3 transcriptional activity by increasing its nuclear localization. Thus expression microarray was used to identify the genes regulated by FLCN and TFE3.

DESIGN
UOK257-2 cells expressing wildtype FLCN were transfected with 1) scrambled, 2) FLCN, 3) TFE3 and 4)FLCN/TFE3 siRNAs with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent and RNeasy Mini Kit. The genes induced by FLCN siRNA and reduced by TFE3 siRNA were chosen as a candidate genes regulated by FLCN and TFE3.
