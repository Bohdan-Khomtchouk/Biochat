TITLE
Dendritic cells are contained within melanocytic nevus nests in vivo and can alter gene expression of epidermal melanocytes in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to determine what if any changes dendritic cells induce in melanocytes when they are grown together (co-cultured)

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes among melanocytes alone, dendritic cells alone, and melanocytes after co-culture with dendritic cells
