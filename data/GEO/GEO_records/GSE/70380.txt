TITLE
Patient Derived Xenograft for Delivery of Precision Medicine in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Developing animal models representating the cancer biology of advanced prostate cancer patients is challenging but essential for delivering individualized medical therapies. In an effort to develop patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, we took the metastatic site tissue from the rib lesion twice (ie, before and after enzalutamide treatment) over a twelve week period  and implanted subcutaneously and under the renal capsule in immuno-deficient mice.  To characterize and compare the genome and transcriptome landscapes of patient tumor tissues and the corresponding PDX models, we performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing for metastatic tumor tissue as well as its derived PDXs. We demonstrated the feasibility of developping PDX models from patient who developed castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Our data  suggested PDX models preserve the patientâ€™s genomic and transcriptomic alterations in high fidelity, as illustrated by somatic mutation, copy number variation, gene fusion and gene expression.
