TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of PLS-123 in xenograft model.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exploit targets or signaling pathways affected by PLS-123 during anti-tumor process, gene expression profiling was carried out in OCI-Ly7 inoculated xenograft model.

DESIGN
Six- to eight-week-old male SCID mice were inoculated subcutaneously with OCI-Ly7 tumor cells in 0.1 ml PBS for tumor development
