TITLE
Expression profiles from a variety of resting and activated human immune cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immune cell-specific expression is one indication of the importance of a gene's role in the immune response. In order to identify such patterns, we set out to broadly profile gene expression in a variety of immune cells.

DESIGN
We isolated twelve different types of human leukocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow, treated them to induce activation and/or differentiation, and profiled their gene expression before and after treatment. The twelve cell types are: B cells, CD14+ cells, CD4+ CD45RO+ CD45RA- T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, IgG/IgA memory B cells, IgM memory B cells, Monocytes, NK cells, Neutrophils, Plasma cells from bone marrow, and Plasma cells from PBMC.
