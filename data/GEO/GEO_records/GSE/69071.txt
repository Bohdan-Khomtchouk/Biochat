TITLE
Identification of the genetic loci associating with the OMV formation by means of transcriptome analysis on the isogenic BF2766 mutants in B. fragilis strain YCH46

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis

SUMMARY
The human gut microbe Bacteroides fragilis can alter the expression of its surface molecules such as capsular polysaccharides and SusC/SusD family outer membrane proteins through the reversible DNA inversions.ã€€We have revealed that the outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation in B. fragilis is regulated by BF2766 (tyrosine recombinase)-mediated DNA inversions at two distantly located promoter regions previously designated as class IV regions. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic loci associating with the OMV formation by means of transcriptome analysis on the isogenic BF2766 mutants. By comparing the transciptomes of four BF2766 deletion mutants, in which the promoter orientations in class IV-1 and IV-2 regions were locked ON/ON, OFF/ON, OFF/OFF, or ON/OFF, we found that the transcription of the genes downstream of class IV-2 markedly elevated in a hyper-vesiculating ON/ON strain.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA isolated from four BF2766 deletion mutants culture. Each sample contains duplicated data.
