TITLE
Rapid Recall Ability of Memory T cells is Encoded in their Epigenome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Even though T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation together with co-stimulation is sufficient for the activation of both na誰ve and memory T cells, the memory cells are capable of producing lineage specific cytokines much more rapidly than the na誰ve cells. The mechanisms behind this rapid recall response of the memory cells are still not completely understood. Here, we performed epigenetic profiling of human resting na誰ve, central and effector memory T cells using ChIP-Seq and found that unlike the na誰ve cells, the regulatory elements of the cytokine genes in the memory T cells are marked by activating histone modifications even in the resting state. Therefore, the ability to induce expression of rapid recall genes upon activation is associated with the deposition of positive histone modifications during memory T cell differentiation. We propose a model of T cell memory, in which immunological memory state is encoded epigenetically, through poising and transcriptional memory.

DESIGN
Chromatin state of resting Human Naive, Central memory (TCM) and Effector Memory (TEM) T cells was analyzed by ChIP-Seq; Gene expression in resting and activated for 40 min, 150 min and 15hrs Naive, TCM and TEM cells was analyzed by RNA-Seq
