TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Jun binding site (K562)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proto-oncogene c-jun is a leucine-zipper containing transcription factor which has a DNA binding domain and a transactivation domain. Jun dimerizes with another transcription factor Fos to form AP1 transcription factor. The AP-1 complex has been implicated in transformation and progression of cancer. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Map binding sites of transcription factor Jun in the genome of K562 cells. The K562 input data has been deposited in GEO as GSM325934.
