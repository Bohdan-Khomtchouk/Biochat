TITLE
Invitro Porcine Model Cutaneous Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The goal was to obtain the differential transcriptome in the deep cones fibroblasts between shallow and deep wounds in Duroc breeds at 20 wks.

DESIGN
We made shallow and deep wounds on the backs 2 Duroc pigs, biopsied the wounds at 20 weeks, cultured fibroblasts, extracted and  the RNA from the cultured fibroblasts, and hybridized the Affymetrix GeneChip. We compared wound depth, the system included 1 factors (depth). The system also included repeated measures since the same pigs were used at each time. It also included paired data since the shallow and deep wounds compared were located on the same pig.
