TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the Aspergillus fumigatus calcineurin

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Calcineurin plays an important role in the control of cell morphology and virulence in fungi. Calcineurin is a serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory Ca2+/Calmodulin binding subunit. A mutant of A. fumigatus lacking the calcineurin A (calA) catalytic subunit exhibited defective hyphal morphology related to apical extension and branching growth, which resulted in drastically decreased filamentation. Here, we investigated which pathways are influenced by A. fumigatus calcineurin during proliferation by comparatively determining the transcriptional profile of A. fumigatus wild type and delta calA mutant strains. Our results showed that although the mitochondrial function is reduced in the delta calA mutant strain, its respiratory chain is functional and the mutant has increased alternative oxidase (aoxA) mRNA accumulation and activity. Furthermore, we identified several genes that encode transcription factors that have increased mRNA expression in the delta calA mutant and that could be involved in the Cal-CrzA pathway. Deletion mutants for these transcription factors had also reduced susceptibility to itraconazole, caspofungin, and sodium dodcyl sulfate.
