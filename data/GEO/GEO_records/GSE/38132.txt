TITLE
ZR-75-1 microarray expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Testing the hormonal response of ZR-75-1 cells to estrogen, androgens, and a combination of both homones, with view determining the crosstalk between the transcriptional programs mediated by these hormones in breast cancer cells, and comparison with matched ChIP sequencing data for AR and ERalpha. Data analysis demonstrated reciprocal interference between 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)- and estradiol (E2)-induced transcriptional programs. Specifically, regulation of 26% of E2 and 15% of DHT target genes was significantly affected by cotreatment with the other hormone, in the majority of cases (78-83%) antagonistically. Pathway analysis suggested that DHT co-treatment, for example, depleted E2-regulted pathways in cell survival and proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extractd from luminal-like breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells in quadruplicate after treatment for 16h with 10nM of E2, DHT or E2+DHT.
