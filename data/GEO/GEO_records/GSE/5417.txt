TITLE
Expression data of control-shRNA and SATB1-shRNA expressing MDA-MB-231 cells from 2D and 3D culture system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined whether SATB1 functions as a global gene regulator in order to maintain the aggressive phenotype of the MDA-MB-231 cell line. We compared the gene expression profiles between control_shRNA-MDA-MB-231 cells, which express SATB1 at high levels, and SATB1_shRNA1-MDA-MB-231 in which the level of SATB1 was greatly downregulated by RNAi technology. This comparative studies were performed using two different platforms (Codelink and Affymetrix genechip) with two culture conditions either on plastic dish (2D) or on matrigel (3D) which allows cells to form a breast-like morphology only for non-aggressive cells. Keywords: Comparative studies on Control_shRNA and SATB1_shRNA1 expressing MDA-MB-231 from 2D or 3D culture.
