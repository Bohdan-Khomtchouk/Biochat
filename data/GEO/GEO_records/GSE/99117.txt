TITLE
Recombination at subtelomeres is regulated by physical distance, double strand break resection and chromatin status

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Two conditions experiment, ChIP-chip anti-Sir3 comparing Sir3 occupancy in exponentially growing S.cerevisiae cells to Sir3 occupancy in strains overexpressing SIR3

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment with biological duplicates
