TITLE
Expression data from static and cyclic stretched porcine aortic heart valves

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We explored the hypothesis that Serotonin (5HT) receptor signaling, that can be enhanced with 5HT transporter blockade with Fluoxetine (Fluox), in the aortic valve may vary based upon the biomechanical activity of the aortic valve leaflet. We used Affymetrix microarrays to study gene expression profiling of Porcine Aortic Valves (PAV) incubated under organ culture conditions for 24 hours in either a static state or with 10% cyclic stretch, simulating physiologic leaflet motion. PAV in the bioreactor with or without stretch were exposed to 5HT along or the combination 5HT plus Fluox.

DESIGN
Fresh porcine aortic valves were obtained from a local abattoir. The three leaflets were excised from each valve and a rectangular section of tissue 15x10 mm was isolated from the central region of each valve cusp. These samples were randomized and assigned to one of four groups. The experimental groups were: 1) Static conditions with no agents added; 2) Cyclic stretch conditions with no agents added; 3) Static conditions with 5HT plus Fluox added; and 4) Cyclic stretch conditions with 5HT plus Fluox added.
