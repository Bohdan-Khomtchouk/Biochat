TITLE
Susceptible wheat cultivar infected with the wild type Puccinia graminis (isolate 99KS76A-1) and its mutants carrying knockout mutations in AvrSr35.

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The assess the effect of AvrSr35 knock-out on host-pathogen interaction in the compatible host, we have performed time-course analysis of leaf transcriptomes obtained by infecting susceptible wheat cultivar Fielder with the wild type Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici (Pgt) isolate 99KS76A-1 and its three mutants, M1, M4 and M7, that carry loss-of-function mutations in the AvrSr35 gene.

DESIGN
The two-week seedlings of susceptible cultivar Fielder were used to perform leaf inoculation; leaf samples were collected at 24, 48 and 96 hours after inoculation in three biological replicates. As a control, mock inoculation was performed followed by sample collection after 24 hours (3 biological replicates). The RNA-seq library preparation was performed following the standard Illumina  protocols. Paired-end sequencing (2 x 100 bp) was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500 by loading 6 barcoded libraries per lane of flow-cell.
