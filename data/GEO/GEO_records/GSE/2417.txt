TITLE
Carbon starvation and pectin utilization in Aspergillus nidulans

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
We have a cDNA microarray to investigate changes in gene expression following transfer of fungal cultures from growth on glucose to growth on pectin or no carbon source.  Our goal was to asses the roles of release from carbon catabolite repression and specific induction on proteins needed for metabolism (or utilization) of a single class of complex polysaccharide. Keywords = Aspergillus Keywords = Pectin Keywords = central metabolism Keywords = pectin Keywords = carbon catabolite repression Keywords = polysaccharide Keywords = exopolygalacturonase Keywords: time-course
