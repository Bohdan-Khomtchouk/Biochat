TITLE
Androgen receptor-coregulators hormone responsiveness LNCaP / GSF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The text description is: LNCaP are androgen receptor expressing prostate carcinoma cells. Genital skin fibroblasts also express the androgen receptor. Cells were either proliferating or they were G0-arrested. Treatment of cells was performed with either the androgen DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the androgen analogue R1881 (methyltrienolone), or the solvent ethanol. Some hybridizations were performed in the type 1 design. In these cases, the hormone treated sample was hybridized against the ethanol treated sample on the same microarray. Hormone mediated induction or repression of gene transcription can directly be deduced from R/G normalized ratios on arrays. For other experiments, the ethanol treated control and the hormone treated experiment were hybridized on separate microarrays against a common reference of RNA. This reference was composed out of common reference batch CRG (50%) and a fibroblast RNA (50%). This reference was called mixed reference. For all experiments, the same batch of mixed reference was used. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Compound Based Treatment: Ethanol, R1881 (methyltrienolone), or DHT (dihydrotestosterone) Cell Line: LNCaP (prostate cancer) or foreskin fibroblasts Culture Synchrony: proliferation / Go-arrest Keywords: compound_treatment_design
