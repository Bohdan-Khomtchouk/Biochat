TITLE
The histone demethylase KDM3A regulates the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes regulated by androgen receptor (AR), we performed the profiling array analysis on the CWR22Rv1 cells and determined the differentially expressed genes upon the knockdown of AR.

DESIGN
CWR22Rv1 cells were transduced with the lentiviral particles (pLKO.1 control or AR shRNA) for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted using a Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). The knockdown efficiency of AR was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis.  RNA samples were sent to the Genomics Core Facility at University of Maryland for the quality check and processing for the Affymetrix Gene array analysis. Biological duplicate of samples were used in the  study.
