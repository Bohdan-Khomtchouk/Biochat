TITLE
The effect of transcription factor AtfA on gene expression

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter sp. ADP1

SUMMARY
We report the effect of the deletion of novel RNA polymerase binding protein AtfA on genome-wide transcription in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1.

DESIGN
Compared the transcription profile of wt vs atfA knockout in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 using RNA-seq.
