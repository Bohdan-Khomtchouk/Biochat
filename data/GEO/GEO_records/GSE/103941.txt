TITLE
Expression data from mice liver drinking Hydrogen water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver RNA samples from C57BL6 mice drinking Hydrogen water for 4 weeks We used microarrays to detail the gene expression after drinking hydrogen water.

DESIGN
We analyzed mRNA expression in liver from 4 control and 4 Hydrogen drinking mice using the Affymetrix  GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Array data was proceeded by Affymetrix Expression console sftoware.

PLATFORM
