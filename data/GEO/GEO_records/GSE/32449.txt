TITLE
Triploid causes genome instability in tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examain effects of triploidy on gene expression in mouse cells, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. To study the effects of aneuploidy in mouse cells, we isorated diploid, triploid and tetraploid cells from p53-/- mouse embryonic cells

DESIGN
Gene expression in diploid cells (RRI2, 15 and 2-1), triploid cells (RRI2-5, 2-12 and 2-15) and tetraploid cells (RRI2-2, 2-4 and 2-6).

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
