TITLE
Identification of miR-489 or miR-504 target genes in head and neck cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently identified a subset of down-regulated miRNAs such as miR-489 and miR-504 in HNSCC. Cell growth inhibitions occurred in miR-489 and miR-504 transfectants compared with the controls, suggesting that both miRNAs function as tumor suppressors. The aims of our expression studies were identification of these miRNAs target genes.
