TITLE
DACH1 expression in U87 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss or reduction in function of tumor suppressor genes contributes to tumorigenesis. We identified a novel homozygous deletion of DACH1 in gliomas. We generated U87TR-Da glioma cell line, where DACH1 expression could be activated by exposure of cells to doxycycline, and examined changing global gene expression by DACH1 expression.

DESIGN
Expression of DACH1 in U87TR-Da cells can be induced by exposure of the cells to doxycycline. We analyzed gene expression profiles of DACH1-induced/repressed U87TR-Da cells. And we also compared gene expression profiles of DACH1-induced/repressed U87TR-Da cells under different culture condition, DMEMF(serum-containing) and NBE(serum-free)
