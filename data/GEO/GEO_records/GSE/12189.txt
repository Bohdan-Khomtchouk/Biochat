TITLE
FACS-Assisted Microarray Profiling Implicates Novel Genes and Pathways in Zebrafish Gastrointestinal Tract Development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) gutGFP transgenic embryos [Tg(XlEef1a1:GFP)s854] were collected at 4 time points: 2 days post fertilization (dpf), 3, dpf, 4 dpf, 6 dpf. Embryos were dissociated into single cells and sorted by FACS based on GFP expression. RNA was extracted from the different cell populations (Stratagene), amplified (NuGEN Ovation), and hybridized to Affymetrix Zebrafish GeneChips. Keywords: Time course.

DESIGN
Series of 24 samples: 4 time points, 3 replicates, 2 samples per replicate (GFP+ and GFP-).

PLATFORM
GPL1319 [Zebrafish] Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array
