TITLE
Whole genome transcription profiling of the L5 spinal nerve transection model of neuropathic pain in the rat, at different sequencing depths (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Poly(A) enriched RNA derived from the L5 DRG 7 days following L5-SNT and from naïve L5-DRG tissue was subjected to RNA-seq analysis at different sequencing depths

DESIGN
6 biological replicates (3 case – SNT subjected L5-DRG tissue, 3 control – naïve L5-DRG tissue). Each biological replicate was divided B46into 3 technical replicates; each of the technical replicates for a given sample was sequenced to a depth of 17M, 25M or 50M reads. Reads were single stranded and 34bps in length. Multiplexing was used in order to generate the read depths of different sizes. The gene expression values and fold changes in expression between naive and SNT samples were compared to those generated by a microarray experiment carried out on further technical replicates of the same samples, details in the manuscript (submitted - under revision).
