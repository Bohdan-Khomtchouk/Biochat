TITLE
Genomic profiling of ten prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer cell lines grow in full serum under standard conditions were profiled on Agilent-014698 Human Genome CGH Microarray 105A. Digestion, labeling, hybridization and data analysis of genomic DNA were performed according to the Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) protocol version 6.0 for 105 K arrays.

DESIGN
Ten prostate cancer cell lines were included in the profiling, 22RV1, C4-2B, CA-hpv-10, DU145, LAPC4, MDAPCa-2b, NCI660, PC3, VCaP, and WPE1-NB26. All cell lines were grown in accordance with the distributor's instructions. All samples except DU145 were hybridized once on 105k Agilent Human Genome CGH microarrays according to manufacturers instructions. Two replicate hybridizations were done for DU145 cell line. Human Adult Male Normal Genomic DNA (6 normal individuals, Promega, #G1471) was used as a reference in all hybridizations. DNA from cell line samples were labeled with Cy5 and DNA from reference were labeled with Cy3.
