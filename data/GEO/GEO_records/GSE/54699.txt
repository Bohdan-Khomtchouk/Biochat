TITLE
Triiodothytonine (T3) response is changed after KLF9 knockdown in HepG2-TRbeta overexpressing cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of T3 response in HepG2-TRbeta cells transfected with siRNA (siCtrl or siKLF9) at gene expression level.The hypothesis tested in the present study was that TR/KLF9 axis is responsible for many of T3 downstream efects. Results provide information of the changr in T3 response after KLF9 knockdown.response

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from HepG2-TR beta cells transfected with siCtrl or siKLF9 and treated with T3 for 0, 8 or 24 hours. T3 response in siKLF9 samples was compared to response in siCtrl samples.
