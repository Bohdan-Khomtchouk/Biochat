TITLE
The role of small RNAs on phenotypes in reciprocal hybrids between Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum ; Solanum pimpinellifolium ; Solanum lycopersicum x Solanum pimpinellifolium

SUMMARY
we found the expression levels of 76 known miRNAs were highly variable between the reciprocal hybrids through the high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs

DESIGN
small RNA sequencing were performed in Solanum lycopersicum, S. pimpinellifolium and their reciprocal hybrids
