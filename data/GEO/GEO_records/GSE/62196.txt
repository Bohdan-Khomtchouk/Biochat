TITLE
The role of small RNAs on phenotypes in reciprocal hybrids between Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
we found the expression levels of 76 known miRNAs were highly variable between the reciprocal hybrids through the high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs

DESIGN
small RNA sequencing were performed in Solanum lycopersicum, S. pimpinellifolium and their reciprocal hybrids
