TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae, S288C with graded GCN5 F221A

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
S288C was transformed with plasmids expressing the GCN5 F221A mutant at varying levels.  We sought to examine the global impact on gene expression using the Affymetrix yeast 2.0 arrays.
