TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae, S288C with graded GCN5 F221A

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
S288C was transformed with plasmids expressing the GCN5 F221A mutant at varying levels.  We sought to examine the global impact on gene expression using the Affymetrix yeast 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
TEF promoter strength varied from 32, 68 and 95% of the wild-type expression.  Controls included wild-type with empty & GCN5 null strain with empty plasmid.  Strains were grown for approximately 7 dblings in triplicate, followed by a mid-log phase RNA extraction.  Whole cell RNA was processed for Affymetrix yeast 2.0 arrays.
