TITLE
Pyrococcus furiosus crRNAs associated with the Cas RAMP module complex

ORGANISM
Pyrococcus furiosus

SUMMARY
Analysis of CRISPR RNAs from both total Pyrococcus furiosus RNA and those that co-purify with the Cmr complex, which has been predicted to be involved in RNA-mediated targeting of foreign RNAs in prokaryotes.  Small RNAs (20 - 70 nts) were isolated either from total Pyrococcus furiosus RNA or RNAs isolated from immunopurified Cmr complexes.  The RNAs were cloned and sequenced using the Illumina platform.  Results provide insight into the anatomy of Cmr2-associated CRISPR RNAs.

DESIGN
2 Samples: total small RNAs vs Cmr2-associated small RNAs

PLATFORM
