TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis between wild-type and gpa1 mutant in response to ABA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mutations in the heterotrimeric G-protein a-subunit of Arabidopsis, GPA1, leads to deficiency in ABA-induced stomatal closure (Wang et al., 2001). To further investigate whether GPA1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to ABA, we examined the induction of known ABA-inducible genes in the gpa1 mutant and compared it to wild-type. We found significant differences in levels of ABA-induced expression between wild-type and gpa1 mutant. In order to systematically investigate GPA1 involvement in ABA signalling leading to gene expression, we are requesting the transcriptome analysis of the gpa1 mutant in response to ABA.In detail, 2 week old wild-type and gpa1 plants grown in the 16/8 hrs light and dark cycle will be treated with either ABA or with a control solution for 3 hours.  10 plants will be used per sample to produce RNA, to give 4 samples, one for each chip: gpa1-1 mutant in the presence (chip1) or absence of ABA (chip2) and wild-type (WS2) in the presence (chip3) or absence of ABA (chip4).
