TITLE
Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent co-transcriptional silencing (small RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based innate immune system that defends germ cell genomes against transposons. In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that CG9754 is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 protein to nascent mRNA transcripts causes co-transcriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 Panoramix, and propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA levels from nos-GAL4 driven UAS-dsRNA knockdowns of the indicated genes in ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster by deep sequencing.
