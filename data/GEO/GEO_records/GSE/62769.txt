TITLE
Gene expression data of primary human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to crocidolite asbestos and cristobalite silica mineral dusts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarrays were used to compare gene alterations induced by exposure to equitoxic doses of crocidolite asbestos and cristobalite silica in an isolate of normal human bronchial epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were exposed to crocidolite asbestos, cristobalite silica, and saline as control for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures, 3 separate cultures were used for each condition. The isolated RNA was used to analyze mRNA expression via Affymetix GeneChip Human U133A 2.0 arrays.
