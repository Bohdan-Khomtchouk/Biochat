TITLE
Gene expression of differentiating hESCs into otic progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stem cells, with their potential to generate different lineages, could offer a solution by replacing damaged or lost cells within the inner ear. We have shown that human embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into otic progenitors, and then into hair cell-like cells and neurons that display expected electrophysiological properties. More importantly, once these otic progenitors are transplanted into animals with induced hearing loss, they differentiate and elicit a significant recovery of auditory function.   The generation of otic progenitors is triggered by FGF signalling. In this dataset we have analysed the global gene expression profile of undifferentiated hESCs and compared with cultures that have been treated with FGF3 and 10, the two ligands involved in otic induction, or cultures that have been allowed to differentiate under basal conditions without FGF (DFNB).

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles were obtained from hESC lines H14, Shef3 and Shef1 by hybridizing samples from undifferentiated cells (Day 0) and cells exposed to either FGF3+10- or DFNB medium for 14 days. Three experimental conditions are therefore produced: hESC, FGF3+10 and DFNB.
