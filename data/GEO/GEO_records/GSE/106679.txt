TITLE
Brain-specific deletion of histone variant H2A.z results in cortical neurogenesis defects and neurodevelopmental disorder

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP experiment was performed with antibody against H3K36me3 (active motif; 61101). we generated genome-wide characterization of H3K36me3 occupancy in E13 H2A.Z cKO forebrain. We found H3K36me3 is decreased throughout the whole genome in E13 H2A.Z cKO forebrain.

DESIGN
Genomic characterization of H3K36me3 binding in E13 WT and brain-specific deficit H2A.z forebrain.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
