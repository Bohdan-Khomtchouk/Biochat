TITLE
Expression data from melanoma cancer cell line CHL-1 after Bromodomain and extra terminal domain inhibitor BAY 1238097 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibtion reduces occupancy of BET-family at promoter and enhancer sites. This finally leads to genome wide changes in the transcription of specific genes. We used microarray profiling to investigate the changes made by BET inhibitor BAY 1238097, trying to identify the underlying changes of gene regulation that lead to sensitivity.

DESIGN
CHL-1 cells were treated with BAY 1238097 a potent and selective Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibitor before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We wanted to investigate the transcriptional changes after BET bromodomain inhibtion in the BAY 1238097-sensitive CHL-1 melanoma cell line. Cells were treated with 75 nM (IC50) or 468 nM (IC90) of BAY 1238097 for 4h and 24h to look at dose-dependent changes on transcriptional level.
