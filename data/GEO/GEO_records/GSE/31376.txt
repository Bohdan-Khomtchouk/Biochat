TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of ALL samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a comprehensive genome-wide miRNA expression profiling (MEP) of adult ALL samples with known genetic and clinical characteristics (n=65) in comparison with normal, non-malignant samples, with the objective of understanding the pathogenetic role of miRNA deregulation in ALL.

DESIGN
Total RNA, including miRNA, were extracted using Trizol and profiled using Agilent human miRNA V2.
