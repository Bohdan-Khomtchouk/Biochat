TITLE
Arabidopsis Pollination Study

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were used to build a profile of candidate stigma genes that facilitate early pollination events.  Of over 24,000 genes probed, we identified 11,403 genes expressed in stigma tissue, 317 of these that are stigma specific (not expressed in control tissues). Keywords: Comparative hybridization

DESIGN
Expression profiles of stigma, ovary and seedling tissues were studied and contrasted. Four samples each of seedling and ovary were used; and three stigma samples.
