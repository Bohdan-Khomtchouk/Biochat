TITLE
Gene expression profiling of a mouse model of metabolic syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice overexpressing reverse tetracycline-transactivator (rtTA) exhibited all four sequelae of metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), a pro-inflammatory state and marked hepatic steatosis. Gene expression profiling of the adipose tissue, muscle and liver revealed changes in gene expression of key factors involved in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation.

DESIGN
Liver, epididymal White Adipose Tissue, kidney cortex, kidney medulla and muscle from wild type (FVB mice, Taconic Farms)  and rtTA overexpressing mice (line 6) were profiled in Merck/Agilent mouse 44k v1.0 arrays. For each tissue, a reference pool was used composed of total RNA from that tissue obtained from FVB mice. Channel 1 is the reference pool, channel 2 is the sample.
