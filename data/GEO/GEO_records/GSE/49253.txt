TITLE
SUDHL-4 cells: suspension vs. co-cultured with HK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We first performed miRNA analysis on SU-4 cells in suspension, and after 24 and 48 h of HK co-culture. To ensure that no HK cell contamination occurred, SU-4 cells in suspension and after co-culture were purified by CD19-positive magnetic selection, followed by total RNA isolation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, S4 vs. S4+HK cells. Biological replicates: 2 suspension controls, 2 co-cultured with HK cells, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
