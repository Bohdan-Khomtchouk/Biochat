TITLE
Identification and control of host innate disease causing responses to dengue infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our hypothesis is that dengue induces different innate immune responses in patients with mild respective severe dengue. We further hypothesize that severe dengue infection is a consequence of an over reactive inflammatory response which could be inhibited in an early stage by immune suppressants. We hypothesize that the drugs used in this study induce a down regulated inflammatory response; VP-16 by triggering apoptosis and Rosiglitazone by inhibiting NFkB related cytokine production

DESIGN
In-vitro dengue infected U937, transcriptional assessment
