TITLE
Important role for secretoglobin(SCGB)3A2 in lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 was originally identified as a downstream target in lung for the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2-1, whose null mutation resulted in severely hypoplastic lungs.   A very low level of SCGB3A2 is expressed in lungs at embryonic day (E) 11.5 during mouse development, which markedly increases by E16.5, the time when lung undergoes dramatic morphological changes.  These results suggest that SCGB3A2 may be involved in lung development.  We used microarray to determine whether SCGB3A2 plays a role in lung development. Keywords: Response to SCGB3A2

DESIGN
DNA microarray was performed using RNAs isolated from 4 day-organ cultured Nkx2-1-null lungs with and without SCGB3A2 treatment.
