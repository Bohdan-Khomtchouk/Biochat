TITLE
Chip-chip from budding yeast cells with Set3 complex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Set3 complex applied with tilling array chip ( ChIP on chip of either Set3-TAP or Snt1-TAP) analysis demonstrated that the genome-wide localization of Set3 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

DESIGN
Comparison the genome-wide localization of Set3-TAP with that of Snt1-TAP to map the majority of genome-wide localization of Set3 complex

PLATFORM
GPL18724 NimbleGen S. cerevisiae ChIP-chip 385K Whole-Genome Tiling Array [2006-07-18_Scerevisiae_ChIP] merged Probe ID
