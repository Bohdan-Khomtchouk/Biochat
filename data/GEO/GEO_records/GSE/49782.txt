TITLE
Gene expression profiles of CD4 T cells and CD45+ HLA-DR+ cells during experimental allergic rhinitis in humans.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Six patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were challenged daily for 8 days with birch pollen extract. A mucosal biopsy was obtained from one nostril at basline (day 0) and from the other nostril after allergen challenge (day 9). The mucosal biopsies were digested into single cells, and then sorted into CD4 T cells and CD45+HLA-DR+ cells. Total RNA was extracted, amplified using whole transcriptome amplification, and gene expression was profiled on microarrays.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of 6 subjects, 2 cell types (CD4 T cells, CD45+ HLA-DR+ cells), and 2 conditions (baseline, allergen challenge).
