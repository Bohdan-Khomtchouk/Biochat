TITLE
Comparative analysis of regulatory elements between Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by genome-wide transcription start site profiling [tiling arrays]

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level in Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578 grown up to mid-exponential phase in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from MGH78578 grown up to OD600nm 0.5 (mid-exponential phase) in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% glucose. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 392,778 oligonucleotide probes spaced 30 bp apart (20-bp overlap between two probes) across the K. pneumoniae main genome and plasmids.
