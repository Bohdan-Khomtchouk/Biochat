TITLE
Expression data of MCF7 cells following short-term E deprivation, ER-alpha siRNA knockdown and oxidant treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the oxidant sensitivity of E/ER regulated gene expression, E/ER regulated genes are identified using E deprivation or ER-alpha siRNA knockdown; and oxidative stress responsive is determined by 8hr exposure to diamide, hydrogen peroxide and menadione Keywords: biomarker identification

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated under various conditions to identifiy oxidative stress responsive E/ER regulated genes.  Association of these genes with respect to tumor phenotypes are assessed
