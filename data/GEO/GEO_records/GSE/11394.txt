TITLE
Transcript Analysis of Human Mammary Cell Subsets by Chip Technology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Highly purified subpopulations of primitive bipotent and committed luminal progenitor cells as well as mature luminal and myoepithelial cells from normal human mammary tissue were isolated and compared their transcriptomes obtained using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human X3P Array. Keywords: human mammary progenitors, stem cells, transcriptomes, Notch signaling, gene expression
