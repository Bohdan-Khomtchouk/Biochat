TITLE
Expression data in KSHV-infected primary rat mesenchymal precursor (MM) cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can efficiently infect and transform primary rat mesenchymal precursor (MM) cells. Regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis by KSHV-encoded microRNAs is required for KSHV-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
To determine the roles of KSHV miRs in growth deregulation, we infected MM cells with the KSHV miR cluster deletion mutant and monitored infection by examining green fluorescence protein expression from a cassette inserted in the KSHV genome.
