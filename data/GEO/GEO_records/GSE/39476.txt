TITLE
Gene Expression Changes Associated With TLR2 Mediated Inhibition of Allergen Specific TH2 Response In Vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of the gene expression changes associated with TLR2 adjuvant (lipoteichoic acid; LTA) inhibition of allergic TH2 responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (derived from house dust mite allergic individuals) stimulated with house dust mite extract.

DESIGN
Pooled samples from 5 individuals were analysed by microarray; qPCR validation was carried out in a larger cohort of 23 individuals.

PLATFORM
GPL6255 Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
