TITLE
RNA sequencing of synaptic and cytoplasmic Upf1-bound transcripts supports contribution of nonsense-mediated decay to epileptogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunoprecipitation of Upf1-bound RNA from the cytoplasmic and synaptosomal compartments followed by RNA sequencing identified unique populations of NMD-associated transcripts and altered levels after status epilepticus.

DESIGN
We sequenced Upf1-bound mRNA transcripts in neurossynaptosome and cytoplasm compartments of the hippocampus in control mice and in mice that underwent status epilepticus.
