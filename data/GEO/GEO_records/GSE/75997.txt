TITLE
Gene expression changes upon Mll1 knockout in NUP98-HOXA9 transformed murine LSKs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report Illumina next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of NUP98-HOXA9 in vitro transformed murine LSKs upon genetic deletion of Mll1. These gene expression data illustrate that Mll1 regulates Hoxa, Hoxb and Meis1 expression in NUP98-HOXA9 transformed murine BM cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq comparing Mll1 homozygous knockout cells to Mll1 flox/flox control

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
