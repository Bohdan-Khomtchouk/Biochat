TITLE
Medulloblastoma tumors derived from Ptch+/-p53-/- transgenic mouse allografted in nude mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nude mice were allografted with medulloblastoma tumors derived from Ptch+/-p53-/- transgenic mouse and treated with vehicle or NVP-LDE225.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from tumours from vehicle or NVP-LDE225 treated nude mice allografted with medulloblastoma tumors derived from Ptch+/-p53-/- transgenic mouse and hybridized on the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 RNA expression microarray.
