TITLE
CD8 CDKN2A-/- lymphocytes expressing an active form of the transcription factor Stat5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analyses of  memory CDKN2A-/- CD8  T lymphocytes expressing an active form of the transcription factor Stat5.

DESIGN
CDKN2A-/- CD8 T lymphocytes were activated by anti-CD3/CD28. After 40h, an active form of Stat5 was introduced in activated cells. Culture was continued for another 48h to induce their differentiation in effector T cells. These 88h activated T cells were injected in congeneic hosts and recovered 15 days later from the host spleen and lymph nodes: CDKN2A-/- Stat5ca -d15: 2 replicatesâ€“ S46, S47. This study is a complement of the samples previously deposited under accession number GSE41819.  Those two new samples are compared to previously deposited:  - activated CD8 T lymphocytes transduced to express Stat5ca and transferred in congenic hosts:   o S11 (GSM663446);   o S12 (GSM663445);   o S13 (GSM663444);  o S14 (GSM663439).  and  - naive peripheral CD8 T lymphocytes :  o S33 (GSM663441);  o S34 (GSM663435);  o S35 (GSM663449);  o S36 (GSM663447).
