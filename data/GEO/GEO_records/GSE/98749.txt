TITLE
Cardiomyocyte Specific Deletion of Sirt1 Gene Sensitizes Myocardium to Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A longevity gene, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) have common activators such as caloric restriction, oxidative stress and exercise.The objective is to characterize the role of cardiomyocyte SIRT1 in age-related impaired ischemic AMPK activation and increased susceptibility to ischemic insults.

DESIGN
we want to compared wt and sirt1 ko mice heart, both basal and ischemia /reperfusion condition List is : 1. WT BASAL; 2. WT ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION; 3. wt cardiomyocytes; 4. SIRT1 KO cardiomyocytes; 5. SIRT1 KO BASAL; 6. SIRT1 KO ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION
