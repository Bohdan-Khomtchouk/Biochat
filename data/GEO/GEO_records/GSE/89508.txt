TITLE
Gene expression signature in Lactococcus lactis after ethanol, butanol or hexanol exposure

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Reference samples: Strain MG1363 was grown balanced in SAL medium supplemented with 1% glucose. Stressed samples: Strain MG1363 was exposed to either ethanol (55 mg/ml), butanol (10 ml/mg) or hexanol (2 mg/ml) in GSAL medium after balanced growth

DESIGN
Each condition (reference, ethanol, butanol and hexanol stressed) were performed in minimal two biological replicas. Samples from the reference culture were taken at OD450 ~ 0.4, following which alcohol stress were added. Samples from the alcohol stressed conditions were substracted 5 and 60  min after the addition of set stress
