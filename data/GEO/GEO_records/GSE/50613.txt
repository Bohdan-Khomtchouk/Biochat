TITLE
Genomic profiling of type-1 adult diabetic and aged normoglycemic mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we characterized and compared differential gene expression from diabetic and normoglycemic NOD mice and from aged and young-adults Balb/c mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA from NOD diabetic (3 weeks with glicemia over 500mg/dl) and normoglycemic NOD mice from the same age was used. To compare the effects of aging in genomic expression, total RNA from young-adult Balb/c (9 weeks old) and middle-aged Balb/c (47 weeks old) were used.
