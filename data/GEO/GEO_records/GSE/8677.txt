TITLE
Panton-Valentine Leukocidin Does Not Impact Virulence of Community-associated MRSA

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Panton-valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been linked to worldwide emergence of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) -- its role in virulence in unclear.  Here we show that PVL had no effect on global gene expression of prominent CA-MRSA strains nor did it affect bacterial clearance from lungs, spleen and kidneys in a highly discriminatory rabbit bacteremia model.  These findings negate a large body of epidemiological research that implicated PVL in CA-MRSA virulence. Keywords: mutant vs wild type in 2 different growth phases grown in 2 different medias

DESIGN
Wild type USA 300 (strain SF8300), wild type USA 400 (strain MW2) were compared against their respective PVL isogenic knock out strains.  Strains were compared at both mid-exponential and stationary phase and grown in both TSB and CCY to determine if PVL plays a role in gene regulation under these conditions.
