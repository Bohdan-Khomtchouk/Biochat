TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mtDNA-depleted (Rho) mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of parental and mtDNA-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis revealed a downregulation of ChrM genes.

DESIGN
Mcl1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (transformed with SV40 large T antigen) were cultured for 7 days with Ethidium Bromide (100 ng/mL) in DMEM supplemented with Glucose (4.5 g/L), Uridine (50 ug/mL) and Sodium Pyruvate (100 ug/mL). Depletion of mtDNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated and up to 250 ng of total RNA per sample was labelled and hybridized to Illumina Mouse WG6V2 expression BeadChip platform. Three replicate samples were available for each population.
