TITLE
Promoter proximal pausing in response to stress in serum deprived mouse fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed short-capped RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) in order to identify genes whose expression is regulated by promoter proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPI) in response to stress stimulation. We used serum-deprived mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, either untreated (control) or treated with anisomycin to induce the p38/MAP kinase pathway.

DESIGN
Serum starved (72 h 0.2% FCS) mouse 3T3 cells were treated with anisomycin (188.5 nM) for 1 h (in duplicates). Untreated, serum-starved cells were used as a control. We isolated nuclear RNA, performed size fractionation followed by isolation of short-capped RNAs (scRNA). scRNAs were subsequently converted into DNA library and sequenced.
