TITLE
High number of chromosomal copy number aberrations inversely relates to t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation status in Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Salivary Glands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
genomic analysis using arrayCGH to gain insight into chromosomal copy number in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). Results suggest that two types of MECs can be distinguished: (i) a group of MECs without t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation with many copy number aberrations ( > 6), independent of histological grade, and (ii) a group of MECs with the t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation with no or a few copy number aberrations ( < 6 ) with two exceptions classified as low and intermediate grade. â€ƒ

DESIGN
Tumor DNA vs Normal DNA from surrounding tumor tissue. 27 parrafine embedded MEC samples of which 17 low grade, 6 intermediate grade and 4 high grade MEC samples were compared to normal surrounding tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL8687 Agilent SurePrint G3 CGH array (4X180K) CCA_VUMC design AMADID#022522
