TITLE
Expression data from mesodermal Tbx1-knockout otic vesicles and periotic mesenchyme at E11.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The T-box transcription factor Tbx1 is expressed in the otic vesicle and surrounding periotic mesenchyme during inner ear development. Mesenchymal Tbx1 is essential for inner ear development, with conditional mutants displaying defects in both auditory and vestibular systems. We have previously identified reduced expression of retinoic acid metabolic genes in the periotic mesenchyme of mesoderm conditional Tbx1 mutants, using the T-Cre mouse line, implicating retinoic acid in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling downstream of Tbx1 in the periotic mesenchyme. In order to identify downstream effectors of mesenchymal-epithelial signaling downstream of mesenchymal Tbx1, we have utilized a gene profiling approach comparing embryonic day 11.5 otic vesicle and surrounding periotic mesenchyme from T-Cre-mediated conditional Tbx1 mutants (Mest-KO) and conditional heterozygous control litter mates (control). This data was used in conjunction with OV-only data (GSE34064) to identify expression changes within the periotic mesenchyme.

DESIGN
E11.5 T-Cre-mediated conditional Tbx1 mutants (Mest-KO) and control (T-Cre conditional Tbx1 heterozygotes) embryos were microdissected to isolate the otic vesicle and surrounding periotic mesenchyme. Left and right ears from 3 embryos of the same genotype were pooled for each chip, and 3 biological replicates of each chip were performed.
