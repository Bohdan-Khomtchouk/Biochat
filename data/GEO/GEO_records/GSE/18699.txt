TITLE
Chromatin Profiling by Directly Sequencing Small Quantities of Immunoprecipitated DNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin structure and transcription factor localization can be assayed genome-wide by sequencing genomic DNA fractionated by protein occupancy or other properties. However, current technologies involve multiple steps that introduce bias and inefficiency. Here we apply a single-molecule approach to directly sequence chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA with minimal sample manipulation. This method is accurate, compatible with just 50 picograms of DNA and should thus facilitate charting chromatin maps from limited cell populations.

DESIGN
Application of a single-molecule approach to directly sequence chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA of the CTCF DNA binding protein.
