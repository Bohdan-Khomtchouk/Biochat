TITLE
cDNA microarray data after Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) infection in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A special immune system exists at distinct respiratory epithelium to combat invasion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1). This study aimes to determine if interleukin-17C (IL-17C) is correlated with acute PAO1 infection in human nasal epithelium and to prove the role of IL-17C on iron sequestration during PAO1 infection. IL-17C has antipseudomonal effect by lowering iron sequestration and reducing siderophore activity. IL-17C could be efficient mediator to control PAO1 infection in human nasal epithelium.

DESIGN
To evaluate the change of gene expressions after PAO1 infection, we performed gene expression analysis using Platform Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The data were processed using the robust multi-array analysis algorithm, which performs a background correction, a normalization step, and a probe-level summary.
