TITLE
The transcriptomic response to finasteride in the Silurana tropicalis testis

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
An ex vivo protocol was optimized to expose testis tissues from juvenile Silurana tropicalis to 5 uM finasteride.  Testis tissues were incubated in L-15 media with (n = 8) and without (n = 8) finasteride for 6 h at 26 °C on top of an orbital shaker. Afterwards, the tissues were flash frozen on dry ice and RNA was isolated using Trizol. The isolated RNA of four control tissue samples and four finasteride exposed tissue samples were then analyzed using a custom microarray for S. tropicalis containing 44,000 probes .

DESIGN
Testis tissues were incubated in L-15 media with (n = 8) and without (n = 8) finasteride for 6 h at 26 °C
