TITLE
Comparing Control and Schizophrenic hiPSC-derived Neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia is a debilitating neurological disorder for which no cure exists. Few defining characteristics of schizophrenic neurons have been identified and the molecular mechanisms responsible for schizophrenia are not well understood, in part due to the lack of patient material for study. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a new strategy for studying schizophrenia. We have created the first cell-based human model of a complex genetic psychiatric disease by generating hiPSCs from schizophrenic patients and subsequently differentiating these cells to hiPSC-derived neurons in vitro. Schizophrenic hiPSC-derived neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of schizophrenic hiPSC-derived neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cAMP and WNT signaling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the schizophrenic phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of schizophrenic hiPSC-derived neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine.

DESIGN
3 independent differentiations (biological replicates) for each of four control and four schizophrenic patients were analyzed.
