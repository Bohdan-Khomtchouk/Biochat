TITLE
Gene expression in E9.5 heads comparing wt with Arid3b-null embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analysed and compared mRNA expression between wt embryos and embryos deficient for Arid3b in E9.5 heads, with the aim of identifying differentially expressed genes that could give us a clue to the functions of Arid3b during development.

DESIGN
Heads were dissected from E9.5 embryos (including head and first branchial arch). Four wild-type and four mutant embryos were collected and pooled for each of the microarray triplicates.
