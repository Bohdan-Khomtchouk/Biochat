TITLE
Expression data from EGR1-transfected H1299 cells vs normal H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The functions of EGR1, a multifunctional transcription factor, in prostate cancer are well documented. However, little is known about the functions of EGR1 in lung cancer. we observed the function of EGR1 in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and identified the genes that influence cell fate and tumor development. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified genes differentially expressed when EGR1-overexpressed.

DESIGN
We have demonstrated that EGR1 is able to increase cell apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis. And we sought to find genes distributed to  decrease the malignancy of human non-small cell lung cancer regulated by EGR1. To that end, H1299 cells were transfected either EGR1 or pcDNA3.1. After 48h, cells were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (PEGR1 VS PCDNA3.1).
