SUMMARY
[original Title] Rapid and synchronous clearance of PcG histone modifications from Hox genes anticipates motor neuron differentiation. Hox genes are expressed in patterns that are spatially and temporally collinear with their chromosomal organization. This feature is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of embryonic development, and in vertebrates it is critical, among others, for the specification of motor neuron subtypes and the wiring of sensory-motor circuits.  We show here that the differentiation of motor neurons from stem cells is accompanied by a synchronous, domain-wide clearance of “repressive” Polycomb (PcG)-dependent histone methylation from Hox gene chromatin domains.  These findings argue against the idea, advanced recently, that the collinear dynamics of Hox gene expression invariably reflects the progressive clearance of repressive chromatin modifications.  The rapid establishment of stable chromatin domains in response to a transient patterning signal likely serves as a molecular correlate of enduring rostro-caudal neural identity, which underlies the specification of postmitotic motor neuron subtype diversity and neuronal circuit assembly.
