TITLE
TU-tagging: cell type specific RNA isolation from intact complex tissues

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We show that the combination of spatially restricted uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) expression with 4-thiouracil (4TU) delivery can be used to label and purify cell type specific RNA from intact complex tissues. This method is useful for isolating RNA from cell types that are difficult to isolate by dissection or dissociation methods and should work in any organism where UPRT can be spatially expressed, including mammals and other vertebrates.

DESIGN
To confirm that thio-labeled RNA was from UPRT-expressing cells and demonstrate the utility of TU-tagging for cell type-specific RNA isolation, we purified TU-tagged and untagged RNA and compared them using microarrays. We chose to isolate RNA from larval glia, which are present in low number, are highly dispersed, and have a complex cell morphology, making them one of the most difficult cell types to isolate by dissection or dissociation methods. We used reversed polarity (repo)-GAL4 to drive expression of UAS-UPRT specifically in glial cells of the larval brain. We purified TU-tagged and untagged RNA from 72-96h larval brains, and hybridized them to custom Agilent microarrays.  We performed two biological replicate experiments.
