TITLE
TU-tagging: cell type specific RNA isolation from intact complex tissues

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We show that the combination of spatially restricted uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) expression with 4-thiouracil (4TU) delivery can be used to label and purify cell type specific RNA from intact complex tissues. This method is useful for isolating RNA from cell types that are difficult to isolate by dissection or dissociation methods and should work in any organism where UPRT can be spatially expressed, including mammals and other vertebrates.
