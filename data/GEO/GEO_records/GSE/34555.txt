TITLE
Evaluation of auto-antibody serum biomarkers for breast cancer screening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using protein microarrays, derived from 642 His-tag proteins, we could distinguish sera from breast-nodule positive patients and healthy control individuals.

DESIGN
Each Protein microarray was divided in to 4 sub-arrays. Each protein was spotted in duplicates in each sub-array. For evaluation 24 malignant, 16 benign breast cancer serum samples and 20 healthy control serum samples were used.
