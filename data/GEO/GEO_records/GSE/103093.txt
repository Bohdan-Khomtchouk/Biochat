TITLE
Profiling of microRNA expression in canine mammary cancer

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs may act as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, which make these small molecules potential diagnostic/prognostic factors and targets for anticancer therapies. On account of this, we performed large-scale profiling of microRNA expression in canine mammary cancer.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of 317 microRNAs in 146 canine mammary tumours of different histological type, malignancy grade and clinical history (presence/absence of metastases) and in 25 control samples were evaluated.

PLATFORM
GPL21439 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 7th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (miRBase 21; probeID version)
