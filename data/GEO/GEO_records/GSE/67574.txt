TITLE
Two human HCC cells (MHCC97H and MHCC97L): PML-siRNA transfected vs. control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found PML was responsible for ATO resistance in HCC cells, PML knockdown cells show better sensitivity to ATO treatment. To further explore the mechanism of PML-induced ATO resistance, we performed a microarray assay to compare the differential gene expression profiles of PML-siRNA-treated (PML knockdown) and negative control siRNA-treated cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, PML-siRNA vs. control cells. Biological replicates: two cell lines and each cell line has 1 control, 1 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. Comparisons were made between PML siRNA group and control group for each cell line
