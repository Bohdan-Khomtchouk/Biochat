TITLE
Serious leaf damage caused by Osslac7 mutation arouses self-protection mechanism in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
OsSLAC7 in Oryza sativa L. is a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana AtSLAC1, which contains conserved C4-Dicarboxylate transporter domain. Loss of its function caused cell membrane instability and serious leaf damage. We used Affymetrix Rice Genome Array to detail the differences in global gene expression between widetype and the OsSLAC7 T-DNA insertion mutants, and to make clear the bioprocesses affected by the mutation.

DESIGN
OsSLAC7(Os01g0385400) T-DNA insertion mutant and wildtype japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Rice Genome Array.
