TITLE
Vertical sleeve gastrectomy reverses diet-induced gene-regulatory changes impacting lipid metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) produces sustainable weight loss, remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and improvement of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of VSG have remained elusive. We have previously demonstrated that diet-induced obesity leads to chromatin modifications in the liver of mice. We demonstrate here that VSG in C57BL/6J wild-type male mice can reverse these chromatin modifications and thereby impact the expression of key metabolic genes. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, especially omega-6 fatty acid metabolism, are up-regulated in livers of mice after VSG while genes in inflammatory pathways are down-regulated after VSG. Consistent with gene expression changes, regulatory regions near genes involved in inflammatory response displayed decreased chromatin accessibility after VSG. Our results indicate that VSG induces global regulatory changes that impact hepatic inflammatory and lipid metabolic pathways, providing new insight into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial metabolic effects induced by VSG.
