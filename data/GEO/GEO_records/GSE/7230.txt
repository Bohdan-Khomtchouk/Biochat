TITLE
Genome-wide assessment of DNA aberrations in human neuroblastoma primary tumors using BAC array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA signature patterns embed important prognostic information in diagnostic neuroblastoma samples, and can identify candidate cancer-related genes. Keywords: aCGH

DESIGN
Measure DNA copy number alterations in a carefully annotated and representative set of 82 neuroblastoma tumors obtained at diagnosis on a customized high-resolution BAC array-based aCGH platform supplemented with additional clones at tiling path density across 1p36, 2p24, 3p21-22, 11q14-24, and 16p12-13, and integrate these data with genome-wide RNA expression data from the same tumors.

PLATFORM
GPL4894 Penn/CHOP Homo sapiens 4.5K (BAC array for studying Neuroblastoma)
