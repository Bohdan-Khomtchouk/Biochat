TITLE
Temporal expression profile of primary T cell culture and T cell response to Oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying T-cell activation and T-cell response to oxidative stress.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of human T-cell activation and T-cell response to H2O2 stress.  The goal of this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of human T-cell activation and T-cell response to H2O2 stress. Keywords: time course
