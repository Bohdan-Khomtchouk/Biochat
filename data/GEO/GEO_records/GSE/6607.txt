TITLE
Temporal expression profile of primary T cell culture and T cell response to Oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying T-cell activation and T-cell response to oxidative stress.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of human T-cell activation and T-cell response to H2O2 stress.  The goal of this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of human T-cell activation and T-cell response to H2O2 stress. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
T cells isolated from peripheral blood were cultured with CD3, CD28, and IL-2 to induce T-cell activaiton.  Samples were splited into two parts before the cutlure started, one treated with 25 uM H2O2 for 10 minutes, the other intact. At each timepoint, cells were harvested and frozen for RNA isolation.  Three biological replicate experiments were analyzed and approximately one-half of the samples from each experiment were technically replicated.  Hybridizations were performed in a reference design with all samples labeled with Cy3 and a reference thymus total RNA labeled with Cy5.
