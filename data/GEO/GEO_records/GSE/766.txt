ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) were transected with an adenovirus (Ad) expressing a dominant negative (DN) form of Ik-B stimulated 18 hours later with TNF-a. Controls were RASF transfected with Adtet then treated with TNF-a 18 hours later. RNA was extracted 3 hours after TNF-a application. The same cell line was split into 6 lots grown up  and then treated with the virus independent. Each of the Ik-B and Adtet has 3 replications. Data is Hu95Av2 processed with MAS 4.0. Keywords: repeat sample
