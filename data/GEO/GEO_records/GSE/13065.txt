TITLE
Expression data from kidney of 36d old PKD/Mhm rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gender has strong impact on kidney performance. Female gender tends to be renal protective. PKD/Mhm is rat model for human polycystic kidney disease (PKD) caused by a mutation in gene Anks6. PKD progresses faster in male rats compared with females. We used microarrays to detect gender-dependent gene expression in kidney of 36d old PKD/Mhm rats. Keywords: gender, genotype

DESIGN
Gender-dependent gene expression was examined both in heterozygous PKD/Mhm rats affected with PKD and in their wild type littermates. Three microarrays were hybridized for each combination of gender and genotype.
