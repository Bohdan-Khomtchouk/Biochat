TITLE
A high-throughput screen of inactive X chromosome reactivation identifies the enhancement of DNA demethylation by 5-aza-2’-dC upon inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase-wide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: DNA methylation is important for maintenance of the silent state of genes on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). Here, we screened for siRNAs and chemicals that reactivate an Xi-linked reporter in the presence of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2’-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1, at a concentration that, on its own, is not sufficient for Xi-reactivation. Results: We found that inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) induced expression of the reporter. RNR inhibition potentiated the effect of 5-aza-2’-dC by enhancing its DNA incorporation, thereby decreasing genome-wide DNA methylation levels. Since both 5-aza-2’-dC and RNR-inhibitors are used in the treatment of hematological malignancies, we treated myeloid leukemia cell lines with 5-aza-2’-dC and the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea, and observed synergistic inhibition of cell growth and decreases in genome-wide DNA methylation. Conclusions: Taken together, our study identifies a drug combination that enhances DNA demethylation by altering nucleotide metabolism. We demonstrate that XCR assays can be used to optimize epigenetic activity of drug combinations.
