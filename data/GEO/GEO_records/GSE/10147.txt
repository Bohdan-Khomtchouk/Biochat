TITLE
Expression data from human plasmacytoid dendritic cells treated with p17 or CpG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the effect of p17 on human plasmacytoid dendritic cells and was compared to CpG profile. Keywords: gene expression study

DESIGN
Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells were purified from two donors and cultured in the presence of p17 or CpG for 18 h.
