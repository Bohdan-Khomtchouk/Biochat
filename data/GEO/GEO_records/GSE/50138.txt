TITLE
Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of PTK7 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1299 and NCI-H2009

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PTK7 was identified from a meta-analysis of 1905 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples across 12 datasets to be one of seven genes commonly up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). Using ADC cell lines NCI-H1299 and NCI-H2009, disruption of PTK7 resulted in decreased cell viability and induction of apoptosis. A xenotransplantation model of the cell lines with PTK7 knock-down also resulted in decreased tumor burden. We assayed gene expression in these cell lines after PTK7 knock-down by shRNA to uncover deregulated pathways and genes.

DESIGN
8 samples were analyzed. In each cell line, we knocked down PTK7 with 2 independent hairpins, and 2 control hairpins targeting luciferase and GFP. Thus, NCI-H1299 has 2 samples of PTK7 knock-down, and 2 samples of control knock down. NCI-H2009 has similar samples.
