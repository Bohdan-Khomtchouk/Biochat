TITLE
CSF2 x gender interactions on the transcriptome of Day 15 bovine extra-embryonic membrane

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We aimed to study the effects of CSF2 treatment on the transcriptome of the Day 15 female and male embryo. Within the raw files, channel 1= Cy3 and channel 2= Cy5

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of bovine extra-embryonic membrane at Day 15 post-insemination produced by IVF.  Oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro using a single Holstein bull. After 5 days in vitro culture, the embryos were either treated with 10 ng/ml bovine recombinant CSF2 or the Control (DPBS/BSA) until Day 7.  At Day 7, the embryos were transferred into recipients.  At day 15 following insemination, embryos were flushed and collected for total RNA and gDNA extraction.  The gender of the embryos were determined by PCR prior to microarray analysis.    CSF2 males were compared to Control males while CSF2 females were compared to Control females. Control females were also compared to control males.
