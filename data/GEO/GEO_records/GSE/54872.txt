TITLE
The long noncoding RNA PCAT-1 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation through post-transcriptional stabilization of the cMyc oncogene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Du145-PCAT1 and RWPE-PCAT1 cells treated with either non-targeting siRNA or two independent siRNAs targeting cMyc. The goal was to determine the role of cMyc in mediating PCAT-1 transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, PCAT1 cells with non-targeting siRNA vs cMyc siRNA #3 or cMyc siRNA #4. Performed on two cell lines, Du145 and RWPE. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates per cell line, 2 transfected replicates per siRNA per cell line.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
