TITLE
The Menin-Bach2 axis is critical for regulating CD4 T cell senescence and cytokine homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although CD4 T cell senescence plays an important role in immunosenescence, the mechanism behind this process remains unclear.  Here we show that T cell-specific Menin deficiency results in the premature senescence of CD4 T cells, which is accompanied by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype after antigenic stimulation and dysregulated cytokine production.  Menin is required for the expansion and survival of antigen-stimulated CD4 T cells in vivo and acts by targeting Bach2, which is known to regulate immune homeostasis and cytokine production.  Menin binds to the Bach2 locus, and controls its expression through maintenance of histone acetylation.  Menin binding at the Bach2 locus and the Bach2 expression are decreased in the senescent CD4 T cells.  These findings reveal a critical role of the Menin-Bach2 pathway in regulating CD4 T cell senescence and cytokine homeostasis, thus indicating the involvement of this pathway in the inhibition of immunosenescence.
