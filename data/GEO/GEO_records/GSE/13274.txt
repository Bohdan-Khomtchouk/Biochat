TITLE
Ad-HER-wt and Ad-HER2-ki infected HMECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As an oncogene, use of HER2 vaccines in humans requires the development of HER2 immunotherapies with maximal immunologic potential, but minimal oncologic potential.  To address these issues, we developed a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing a mutated HER2 inactivated for kinase function (Ad-HER2-ki).  Ad-HER2-ki was highly expressed, but non-phosphorylated and elicited minimal transcription dysregulation in primary cells.  In contrast, Ad-HER2-wt elicited a strong oncogenic signature associated with tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Early Passage Human Mammary Epithelial cells (HMECs) were serum starved for 36hrs. and infected at a MOI of 150 with either Ad-GFP, Ad-HER2-wt, or Ad-HER2-ki vectors.  At 18 hpi, RNA was extracted and transcriptomes evaluated by microarray.  Five samples were infected per virus treatment, each a completely separate biologic replicate.
