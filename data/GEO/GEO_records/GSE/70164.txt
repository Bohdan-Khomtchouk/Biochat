TITLE
De novo generation of somatic stem cells from differentiated cells [mammary]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of YAP/TAZ as factors able to convert differentiated cells into stem cells of the same tissue, we compared the expression profiles of mammary organoids (yOrg) obtained by doxycycline-inducible expression of YAP in luminal differentiated mammary cells with original luminal differentiated mammary cells (Lum) and organoids from native mammary stem cells (Org).

DESIGN
We collected RNA from Org, yOrg and Lum. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicas (A, B, C) were used for each sample, for a total of 9 samples.
