TITLE
A role for TFIIIC transcription factor complex in genome organization

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analyses of TFIIIC subunit, Sfc6, and RNA Polymerase III subunit, Rpc130, across the S. pombe genome. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA recovered with either Sfc6 or Rpc130 antibody from wild-type asynchronous growing fission yeast cells and DNA from whole cell extracts were amplified by random priming and respectively labeled with Cy5 and Cy3.  Labeled DNA were mixed and hybridized onto a 44k pombe Agilent oligo array.  Data were processed using Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software.

PLATFORM
GPL2558 NCI Pombe 44K v1.0
