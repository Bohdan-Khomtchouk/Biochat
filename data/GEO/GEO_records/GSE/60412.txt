TITLE
Differential Immunomodulatory Impact of Bacillus subtilis Spores and Vegetative Cells on a Human Colonic Epithelial Cell-Line Model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bacillus subtilis strain R0179 is found in a number of commercially-available probiotic products. The mechanism(s) of action of B. subtilis in the host are poorly understood, but may involve the immune system response to switching between spore and vegetative forms. In order to help elucidate this mechanism, we challenged the immune response of a human colonic epithelial HT-29 cell model for 3 hours with the two forms of B. subtilis. The cellular response was evaluated using a custom-designed two-color expression microarray targeting 1354 genes of the human immune system. The data obtained in this study indicates that the vegetative cell form of the strain moderately induced TH1 pro-inflammatory response through IL-17C and TNF signaling pathway while down-regulating anti-inflammatory response genes IL-10 and TGFÎ²-2. The spore form had an opposite effect and acted primarily by down-regulating the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase pathway.

DESIGN
The overall design consisted of 2 samples of HT-29 cells treated with Bacillus subtilis R0179 spores or vegetative states versus unchallenged HT-29 cells. A minimum of four dye-swap hybridizations (4 biological replicates) were performed for each of the 2 samples analyzed. Unchallenged HT-29 cells were controls and challenged HT-29 cells with Bacillus subtilis R0179 spores or vegetative were treated samples.
