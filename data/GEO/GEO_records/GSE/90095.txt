TITLE
Deep sequencing analysis of differences in miRNA expression between IBDV-infected and Mock-infected DF-1 cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the change of miRNA expression profile in DF-1 cells in respond to Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection, Deep sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) on DF-1 cells infected with mock or IBDV  Lx strain at an MOI of 1 for 24 h.

DESIGN
DF-1 cells (immortal chicken embryo fibroblast) were cultured in 100mm cell culture dish in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 incubator. when cells would be 70-90% confluent, they were infected with Mock or IBDV Lx strain at an MOI of 1, and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS . Twenty-four hours after infection, total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (LC Science, China) following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The deep sequencing were performed by LC Science (hangzhou, China).
