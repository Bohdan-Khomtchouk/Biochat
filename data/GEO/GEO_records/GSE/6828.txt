TITLE
Transcriptome response to change in ploidy level in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
By reciprocally crossing 2x and 4x C24 ecotype plants, we have generated 4 types of offspring with various ploidy (2x; 3x; 4x) or parent-of-origin genome dosage (3x from 4xper2x; 3x from 2xper4x). For each offspring generated, total RNA was extracted using Trizol from 8 seedlings 9 days after germination (developmental stage1.02, 2 leaves).
