TITLE
A Role for WDR5 in Integrating Threonine 11 Phosphorylation to Lysine 4 Methylationon Histone H3 and in Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Upon androgen stimulation, PKN1-mediated histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3T11P) promotes AR target genes activation. However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we show that WDR5, a subunit of the SET1/MLL complex, interacts with H3T11P and this interaction facilitates the recruitment of the SET1/MLL complex and subsequent H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Using ChIP-seq, we find that androgen stimulation results in a six-fold increase in the number of H3T11P-marked regions and induces WDR5 colocalization to one third of H3T11P-enriched promoters, thus establishing a genome-wide relationship between H3T11P and recruitment of WDR5. Accordingly, PKN1 knock-down or chemical inhibition severely blocks WDR5 association and H3K4me3 on AR target genes. Finally, WDR5 is critical in prostate cancer cell proliferation, and is hyperexpressed in human prostate cancers. Together, these results identify WDR5 as a critical epigenomic integrator of histone phosphorylation and methylation and a major driver of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Identification of Histone 3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3T11P) marks and WDR5 binding sites in LNCaP cells treated with R1881 ligand (androgen) or solvent control.
