TITLE
Gene expression in Mob1DKO mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mps One Binder Kinase Activator (MOB)1A/1B are core components of the Hippo pathway. These proteins, which coactivate LArge Tumor Suppressor homolog (LATS) kinases, are also tumor suppressors. To investigate MOB1A/B’s roles in normal physiology and lung cancer, we generated doxycycline (Dox)-inducible, bronchioalveolar epithelium–specific, null mutations of MOB1A/B in mice [SPC-rtTA/(tetO)7-Cre/Mob1aflox/flox/Mob1b-/-; termed luMob1DKO) mice]. Most mutants (70%) receiving Dox in utero [luMob1DKO (E6.5-18.5) mice] died of hypoxia within 1hr post-birth. Their alveolar epithelial cells showed increased proliferation, impaired YAP1/TAZ-dependent differentiation, and decreased surfactant protein production, all features characteristic of human respiratory distress syndrome　(RDS). Intriguingly, mutant mice that received Dox postnatally [luMob1DKO (P21–41) mice] did not develop spontaneous lung adenocarcinomas, and urethane treatment-induced lung tumor formation was decreased (rather than increased). Lungs of luMob1DKO (P21–41) mice exhibited increased detachment of bronchiolar epithelial cells and decreased numbers of the bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) thought to initiate lung adenocarcinomas. YAP1/TAZ-NKX2.1-dependent expression of collagen XVII, a key hemidesmosome component, was also reduced. Thus, a MOB1-YAP1/TAZ-NKX2.1 axis is essential for normal lung homeostasis and expression of the collagen XVII protein necessary for alveolar stem cell maintenance in the lung niche.

DESIGN
We isolated lung epithelial cells from Mob1DKO and WT mice and compared their gene expression level.
