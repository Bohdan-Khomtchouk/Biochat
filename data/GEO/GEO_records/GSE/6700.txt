TITLE
comparison of gene expression in urogenital ridges of Wt1-/- and +/+ E11.5 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Wilms tumor protein Wt1 is a transcription factor known to play an important role in urogenital development. Mutations in the human Wt1 encoding gene (WT1) lead to several syndromes associated with defective renal and sexual development, namely WAGR-, Denys-Drash-, and Frasier-syndrome. During mammalian embryogenesis, urogenital development starts with formation of the urogenital ridges, consisting of the embryonic kidneys, called mesonephroi, and the gonads. In Wt1 knockout mice, these ridges start to form, degenerate, however, during further embryonic development . Although WT1 and the syndromes associated with its mutation are known for several years, it is still unclear which genes, regulated by Wt1, mediate the whole variety of Wt1's function in gonad and mesonephros development. To obtain a comprehensive view on Wt1-dependent gene activity in developing urogenital ridges, we employed microarray analysis. Comparison of gene expression in Wt1 wild-type and knockout mice, led to the identification of almost 150 genes with differences in expression levels higher than factor three. Keywords: wild-type and knockout comparison

DESIGN
urogenital ridges of wild-type and Wt1 knockout mouse embryos were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Amersham CodeLink Mouse 20k microarrays. For both genotypes five embryos with 11-12 tail somites, a stage immediately before the beginning of sex differentiation, were used. Wild-type and knockout were measured three times.
