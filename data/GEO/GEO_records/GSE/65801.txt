TITLE
Characterization of differentially expressed genes involved in pathways associated with gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the patterns of gene expression in gastric cancer, a total of 32 paired gastric cancer and noncancerous tissues from patients were collected for gene expression microarray analyses. Limma methods were applied to analyze the data, and genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed if the False Discovery Rate (FDR) values < 0.01, P-value < 0.01 and the fold change > 2. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to analyze the main functions of the differentially expressed genes. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we found pathways significantly associated with the differential genes. Gene-Act network and Co-Expression networks were built respectively based on the relationships among the genes, proteins and compounds in the database. There were 2371 differential mRNAs and 350 differential lncRNAs in our microarray data. The GO categories, pathway analyses and the Gene-Act network showed a consistent result that up-regulated genes were involved in tumorigenesis, migration, angiogenesis and microenvironment formation, while down-regulated genes were involved in metabolism. The results of this study provide some novel findings on genes, pathways and the co-expression network in gastric cancer which will be useful to guide further investigation and target therapy for this disease.

DESIGN
32 gastric cancer tissues and 32 paired  noncancerous tissues were collected for this microarray analysis.
