SUMMARY
Tumor angiogenesis requires intricate regulation of gene expression in endothelial cells (EC). We recently showed that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)- and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors directly repress EC growth and tumor angiogenesis, suggesting that epigenetic modifications mediated by DNMTs and HDACs are involved in regulation of EC gene expression during tumor angiogenesis. To understand the mechanisms behind the epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis, we used microarray analysis to perform a comprehensive screen to identify genes downregulated in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent EC, and re-expressed by 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. Among the 81 genes identified, 77% harboured a promoter CpG island. Validation of mRNA levels of a subset of genes confirmed significant downregulation in tumor-conditioned EC and reactivation by treatment with a combination of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, as well as by both compounds separately. Silencing of these genes in tumor-conditioned EC correlated with promoter histone H3 deacetylation and loss of H3 lysine 4 methylation, however did not involve DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands. For six genes, downregulation in microdissected human tumor endothelium was confirmed. Functional validation by RNA interference revealed that clusterin, fibrillin 1 and quiescin Q6 are negative regulators of EC growth and angiogenesis. In summary, our data identify novel angiogenesis suppressing genes which become silenced in tumor-conditioned EC in association with promoter histone modifications and reactivated by DNMT- and HDAC inhibitors through reversal of these epigenetic modifications, providing a mechanism for epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis.
