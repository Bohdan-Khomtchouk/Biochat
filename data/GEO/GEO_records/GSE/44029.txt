TITLE
Expression data from  SW480 cells with Gankyrin knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we performed genome-wide screening  using SW480 cells with Gankyrin knockdown on  an Affymetrix gene expression array to identify the transcriptional targets of Gankyrin

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling with samples from SW480 cells that were infected with control or gankyrin shRNA. Two condition experiment: control shRNA (three replicates) and NFIL3 shRNA (three replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
