TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells cultured in media containing different osmolaric conditions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The functionality of dendritic cells might be influenced by alterations of their biophysic microenvironment, e.g. changes in salt concentration. Microarray analysis aims to evaluate whether dendritic cells cultured in medium containing different salt concentrations  modulate their gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow of mice were cultured in cell culture medium in the presence of different salt concentrations -+ LPS. Total RNA was isolated and processed as described in Material and Methods
