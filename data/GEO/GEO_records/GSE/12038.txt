TITLE
XBP1 links ER stress to intestinal inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
XBP1 is the transcriptino factor that is activated by the ER stress. XBP1 is known to induce the ER dexpansion and increase the expression of the ER chaperone genes to prtect the cell from the ER stress. We generated a mouse strain that lacked XBP1 specifically in the mouse intestine by breeding the XBP1flox mice with Villin-cre mice. Here we examined genes that are differentially expressed between WT and XBP1 KO mouse intestine to identify genes that are downstream of XBP1.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were pooled from three mice of indicated genotypes. Microarray experiments were performed by using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array in Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School.
