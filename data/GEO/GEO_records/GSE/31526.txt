TITLE
Exacerbated T cell lymphoma in NOD.Stat5bTg mice is caused by selective activation of Stat5b in CD8+ thymocytes and can be prevented by inhibition of the Stat5b signaling pathway with chemoprevention agents

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study demonstrated that genetic background is critical to the STAT5B-mediated lymphomagenesis probably through regulation of STAT5B activation, which results in the alteration of many tumorigenic genes.  Chemopreventive compounds that can reduce STAT5B phosphorylation and/or the STAT5B signaling pathway can efficiently block lymphomagenesis, demonstrating that the NOD.Stat5bTg mouse is an excellent model for testing novel chemopreventive strategies.
