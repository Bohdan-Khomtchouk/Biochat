TITLE
Exacerbated T cell lymphoma in NOD.Stat5bTg mice is caused by selective activation of Stat5b in CD8+ thymocytes and can be prevented by inhibition of the Stat5b signaling pathway with chemoprevention agents

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study demonstrated that genetic background is critical to the STAT5B-mediated lymphomagenesis probably through regulation of STAT5B activation, which results in the alteration of many tumorigenic genes.  Chemopreventive compounds that can reduce STAT5B phosphorylation and/or the STAT5B signaling pathway can efficiently block lymphomagenesis, demonstrating that the NOD.Stat5bTg mouse is an excellent model for testing novel chemopreventive strategies.

DESIGN
To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the activation of Stat5b upon lymphoma onset, we profiled gene expression in thymocytes of NOD.Stat5b mice, Gene expression was analyzed with the Illumina's MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression beadchips

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
