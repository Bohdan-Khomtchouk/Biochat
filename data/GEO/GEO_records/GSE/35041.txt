TITLE
Expression profile of ACC-overexpressed wild type yeast strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of 1918 genes connected with lipid metabolism in yeast strain overexpressed of fatty acid biosynthesis gene

DESIGN
In the study presented here, expression profiles of wild type and ACC-overexpressed wild type yeast strain were well-clustered by profiles- and gene similarities. It was analyzed the gene expression profile of ACC-overexpressing as compared with those of wild type. The expression levels between wild type(WT) and ACC-overexpressed wild type(ACC) were compared individually three times.
