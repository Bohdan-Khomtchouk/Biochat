TITLE
Transcriptome of wild type N2 worms at embronic stage and starved L1 stage

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcription factors are key components of regulatory networks that control development, as well as the response to environmental stimuli.  We have established an experimental pipeline in C. elegans that permits global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing.  We describe and validate this strategy, and apply it to the transcription factor PHA-4, which plays critical roles in organ development and starvation stress response.  We defined binding sites for PHA-4 during formation of the embryonic pharynx, and in starved larvae.  PHA-4 binds to thousands of locations throughout the genome.  These sites shift dramatically between embryos and larvae, from developmentally regulated genes to genes involved in metabolism. We acquired transcriptome of wild type N2 worms at embyonic and starved L1 stages using RNA-seq method in comparing to the ChIP-seq experiment to study transcription factor binding. The wild type worms were cultured the same as the transgenic worms for transcription factor binding experiment.
