TITLE
Profiling of gene expression in TLR2 and TLR3 activated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified more than 50 genes that have upregulated expression in TLR3 activated (PMI-1,2), but have downregulated expression in TLR2 activated (PMP-1,2) macrophages, as compared to control cells (PMC-1,2)

DESIGN
identify genes that have upregulated expression in TLR3 activated (PMI-1,2), but have downregulated expression in TLR2 activated (PMP-1,2) macrophages, as compared to control cells (PMC-1,2)
