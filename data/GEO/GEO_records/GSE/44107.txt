TITLE
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in murine Satb1-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) compared to wild-type HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis on purified murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) deficient for Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (Satb1) compared to wild-type HSCs.

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression of bone marrow-derived CD45.2+ CD150+cKit+Sca-1+CD4-CD8a-CD19-B220-Gr-1- HSCs from congenic recipient animals transplanted > 20 weeks with either wild-type or Satb1-deficient hematopoeitic cells.
