TITLE
ATF4 Licenses C/EBPb Activity in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Primed for Adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-seq for C/EBPb and ATF4 in human mesenchymal stem cells and in a cell-free system using naked genomic DNA. ChIP-Seq for GR, RNA Polymerase II, and H3K27 acetylation in hMSCs cultured under different adipogenic conditions are also presented.

DESIGN
hMSCs cultured at high or low cell seeding densities in the presence or absence of adipogenic induction cocktail
