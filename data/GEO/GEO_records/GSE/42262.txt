TITLE
Chromatin occupancy of key transcriptional regulators in P493-6 cells with various levels of c-Myc expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
P493-6 cells are immortalized human peripheral B cells that carry a conditional, tetracycline-regulated myc gene. We present ChIP-seq analysis of key transcritional regulators in P493-6 cells expressing various levels of c-Myc: 0hr (low c-Myc levels), 1hr (intermediate c-Myc levels), 24hr (very high c-Myc levels) and No Tet (steady-state c-Myc levels).

DESIGN
Brd4, c-Myc, Max, Med1, RNAPII, and the chromatin modification H3K27Ac were profiled in P493-6 cells

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
