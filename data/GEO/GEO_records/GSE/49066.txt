TITLE
Microarray analysis of CD14+ CD163low cells in human intestinal lamina propria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mouse intestinal innate immune cells have been identified as inducing Th17 cell differentiation. However, few studies have investigated innate immune cells that are involved in CD (Crohn's disiease) pathogenesis in humans. The present study aimed to identify a human intestinal lamina propria cell subset that induces Th17 cells, and to clarify its role in CD pathogenesis. Intestinal mucosa samples were obtained from patients who underwent resection of colorectal cancer or CD. Lamina propria cells (LPCs) were obtained by enzymatic digestion, and were analyzed for expression of HLA-DR, lineage markers (Lin), CD14, and CD163 using flow cytometry. Among HLA-DRhigh Lin- cells, we identified a CD14+ CD163low cell subset that was selectively present in intestinal LPCs. We identified CD14+ CD163low cells as having a potent capacity to induce Th17 cell differentiation in human intestinal lamina propria. The Th17-inducing activity of these cells was enhanced in CD patients.

DESIGN
The Cy3-labeled cDNAs were hybridized on Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray (G4845A) in one color experiments, resulting in four individual microarrays.
