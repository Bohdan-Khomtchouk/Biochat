TITLE
FSH and Testosterone treated Infant Monkey Sertoli cells vs. FSH and Testosterone treated  pubertal Monkey Sertoli cell

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Sertoli cells of Monkey origin comparing infant Sertoli cells with pubertal Sertoli cells, isolated from Monkeys in which puberty was induced by extrinsic GnRH administration. Both Infant and pubertal cells were treated with FSH and Testosterone in vitro.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, infant Sertoli cells vs Pubertal Sertoli cells. 1 set  infant sertoli cells, 1 set pubertal sertoli cells. One color experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13252 Agilent-027114 Genotypic Technology designed Custom Human Whole Genome 8x60k Microarray
