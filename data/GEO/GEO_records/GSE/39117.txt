TITLE
Expression data from Human Adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose inflammation is a key component of cardiometabolic disease. We used microarray to profile gene expression changes in adipose tissue following administration of LPS (3ng/kg IV) to healthy human volunteers.

DESIGN
We obtained subcutaneous adipose biopsies from healthy volunteers at baseline, and at 4-, 12- and 24-hours following evoked endotoxemia (LPS), to examine gene expression changes during inflammation.
