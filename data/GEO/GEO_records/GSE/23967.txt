TITLE
DNA methylation signatures define molecular subtypes of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed DNA methylation (HELP) and gene expression profiling in 69 samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). First, by gene expression, two molecular subtypes of DLBCL termed as germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL were assigned to the 69 DLBCL cases. Then, we performed  supervised analysis using HELP data and defined DNA methylation signature differentiating 2 subgroups of DLBCLs. Keywords: DNA methylation profiling

DESIGN
The retrospective study included DNA extracted from 69 clinical samples. [This Series represents the DNA methylation profiling component of the study.]
