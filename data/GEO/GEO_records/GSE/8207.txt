TITLE
Exploring Biodiversity in Andean Potato Varieties

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Seed of 4 lines of S. tuberosum var andigena were sown and, after transplanting, grown in 3 gal nursery containers in a greenhouse with natural daylight.  The seeds were sown in July and the drought stress experiment began in September.  Drought stress was administered by withholding water and monitored by measuring the rate of photosynthesis (PS; LiCor 6400).  We found that loss of photosynthetic capability (ie a PS rate of 0-2 mM CO2/m2/sec) correlated with a severe drought stress.  Control plants were watered normally and maintained a PS rate of 18-20 mM CO2/m2/sec.  After drought stress, the treated plants were re-watered and PS measurements taken again.  After the first cycles of stress, control and treated plants were harvested and roots, tubers and shoots were stored at –80°C for RNA extractions.  The drought experiment was then repeated for the remaining plants such that they were exposed to a second cycle of stress.  For each line of S. andigena, there were 2 control and 2 treated plants per cycle of stress.  RNA was extracted following the acid phenol protocol of TIGR. Keywords: Direct comparison, loop design
