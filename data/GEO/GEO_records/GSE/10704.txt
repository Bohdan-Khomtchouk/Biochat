SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) is a fatal disease that is associated with increased vascular resistance due to sustained contraction and enhanced proliferation of pulmonary vascular cells. The current treatment however is still not satisfactory. A better understanding of the involved molecular mechanisms may lead to new therapeutical strategies. Pulmonary arterial walls of healthy human lung tissue and of iPAH lungs were laser-microdissected. The extracted RNA was pooled and subjected to SMART-based RNA preamplification and fluorescence labeling. Gene expressions between iPAH and donors were compared using dual-channel microarrays. Keywords: disease characterization
