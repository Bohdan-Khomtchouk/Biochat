TITLE
Unique MicroRNA Expression Signature Predicts Survival, Metastases and Recurrence of HCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the miRNA expression profile of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens from radical resection. We developed a unique 20 miRNA signature that could significantly distinguish HCC venous metastasis from metastasis-free HCC. In contrast to HCC staging systems, this signature was capable of predicting survival and recurrence of HCC patients with multinodular or solitary tumors, including those with early-stage disease. Moreover, the signature was an independent and significant predictor of patient prognosis and relapse when compared to other available clinical parameters. Our study suggests that these 20 miRNAs can enable HCC prognosis and may have clinical utility for the advance identification of HCC patients with a propensity towards metastasis/recurrence. Keywords: disease state design
