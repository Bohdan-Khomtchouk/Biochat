TITLE
Unique MicroRNA Expression Signature Predicts Survival, Metastases and Recurrence of HCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the miRNA expression profile of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens from radical resection. We developed a unique 20 miRNA signature that could significantly distinguish HCC venous metastasis from metastasis-free HCC. In contrast to HCC staging systems, this signature was capable of predicting survival and recurrence of HCC patients with multinodular or solitary tumors, including those with early-stage disease. Moreover, the signature was an independent and significant predictor of patient prognosis and relapse when compared to other available clinical parameters. Our study suggests that these 20 miRNAs can enable HCC prognosis and may have clinical utility for the advance identification of HCC patients with a propensity towards metastasis/recurrence. Keywords: disease state design

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were conducted in primary HCC and corresponding noncancerous hepatic tissues from 244 Chinese HCC patients. A total of 134 well-defined cases were used as a training group. Among them, 30 had primary HCC lesions accompanied by tumor emboli and 104 had solitary HCC with no metastasis/recurrence found at follow-up (3 yr). We used a testing group of 110 independent cases. The testing cases included 43 multinodular and 67 solitary HCC. In addition, eight normal liver tissues from disease-free patients were included as normal controls. In the analysis of the 244 HCC cases, RNA was isolated in a pairwise fashion from tumor or non-tumor tissue and samples were selected in random order for miRNA analysis to avoid grouping bias.
