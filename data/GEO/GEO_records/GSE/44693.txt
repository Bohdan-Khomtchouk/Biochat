TITLE
MiR-155 promotes blood-brain barrier dysfunction in neuroinflammation (part 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Over-expression of miR-155 induces changes in the pattern of gene expression of hCMEC/D3 cells. hypothesis tested in the present study was that miR-155 constitute an important regulatory control of the brain endothelial response to inflammatory cytokines.

DESIGN
To identify miR-155 target genes in brain endothelim that might be implicated in BBB dysfunction relevant to human disease, we then analysed changes in mRNA expression of hCMEC/D3 cells that overexpress miR-155 and results were contrasted to cells transfected with scrambled miR. To ectopically express miR-155 in hCMEC/D3 cells, 30 nM of pre-miR-155 and the siPORT Amine transfection agent (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) were combined following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
