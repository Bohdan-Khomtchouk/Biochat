TITLE
Genome-wide maps of DNA methylation state in rice embryo and endosperm

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We report the application of methylacytosine immunoprecipetation combined with Illumina sequencing (MeDIP-seq) for high-throughput profiling of DNA methylation in rice embryo 3, 6, 9 DAP and endosperm 2, 3, 6, 9 DAP. A total number of 12-14 million of 2Ã—49 bp paired-end reads was generated for each sample, and BOWTIE2 was used for read mapping. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of rice embryo and endosperm. This study provides a framework to systemically characterize the effect of DNA methylation in developing seeds and will help to illustrate the epigenetic regulation of rice seed development.

DESIGN
Rice embryo and endosperm were selected for DNA extraction and methylacytosine immunoprecipetation combined with Illumina sequencing. We sought to obtain the genome-wide DNA methylation profilings of embryo at 3,6,9 days after pollination(DAP) and endosperm at 2,3,6,9 DAP. To that end, we hand-selected embryo at 3,6,9 DAP and endosperm at 2,3,6,9 DAP according to morphological criteria.
