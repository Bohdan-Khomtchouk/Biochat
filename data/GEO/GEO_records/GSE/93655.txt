TITLE
Store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) controls ameloblast cell function and enamel development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Abstarct:Mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) result is a number of disease states including abnormal enamel formation. However, these defects in enamel have remained unclear given a lack of animal models available. We generated Stim1/2K14Cre mice to ablate the activity of STIM1 and its homologue STIM2 in enamel cells. These mice showed impaired Ca2+ entry in enamel cells and although enamel formed, it was severely hypomineralized and mechanically weak. RNA-sequencing of enamel cells provided a global overview of loss of Ca2+ sensor activity. ER stress markers associated with unfolded protein response (UPR) were increased. Cell morphology was altered showing loss of the typical ruffled-border and mislocalized mitochondria. We also identified decreased glutathione system and potentially associated with this, increased ROS and abnormal mitochondria. The Ca2+ extrusion system and enamel gene expression were also altered. These data might represent the first in vivo study linking Stim1/2 ablation with increased UPR function, decreased glutathione metabolism, increased ROS and abnormal mitochondria. Loss of ER Ca2+ sensors Stim1/2 in enamel cells has substantial detrimental effects at the cell and mineral phase level.

DESIGN
Total RNA from enamel organ was isolated for 3 wild type (WT) and 3 Knock out (DKO) for, mus musculus were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000.
