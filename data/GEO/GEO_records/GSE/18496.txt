TITLE
Breast Cell Lines: Experimental vs. Mixed Reference

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of breast cell lines comparing breast cell line mixed reference with individual breast cell lines. Goal was to characterize breast cell line subtypes.

DESIGN
Fifty one cell lines profiled against breast cell line mixed reference Breast cell line mixed reference is a pool of the following 10 breast cell lines selected for their diverse molecular properties:  184B5, CAMA-1, DU4475, MCF-7, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-468, and SK-BR-3.
