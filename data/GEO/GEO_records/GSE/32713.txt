TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis CLIB214  versus UPC2 delete, both at 1% oxygen (hypoxia)

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray were used to generate the transcriptional profile of C. parapsilosis UPC2 delete in hypoxia.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from CLIB214 or upc2 delete grown in YPD medium in hypoxia at 30 degree Celsius for 2 h, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Four independent biological replicates were compared. 2 dye swaps were perfomed so that 2 out of 4 samples isolated from CLIB214 in hypoxic culture were labeled with Cy3, and 2 were labeled with Cy5
