SUMMARY
This is a miRNA expression analysis by microarray. Comparison was made beween Ulcerative Colitis (UC) vs control, Active UC vs Remission, Ascending Colon vs Rectosigmoid area of Colon. The samples were labeled using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Hi-Power Labeling Kit, Hy3™/Hy5™ and hybridized on the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (7th gen) following the scheme you outlined in the sample submission form.  The technical data quality assessment showed that the labeling was successful as all capture probes for the control spike-in oligo nucleotides produced signals in the expected range. Following normalization of the quantified signals (background corrected) using the global Lowess regression algorithm, we have performed an unsupervised as well as supervised data analysis.
