TITLE
Role of miRNA in inflammatory bowel disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a miRNA expression analysis by microarray. Comparison was made beween Ulcerative Colitis (UC) vs control, Active UC vs Remission, Ascending Colon vs Rectosigmoid area of Colon. The samples were labeled using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Hi-Power Labeling Kit, Hy3™/Hy5™ and hybridized on the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (7th gen) following the scheme you outlined in the sample submission form.  The technical data quality assessment showed that the labeling was successful as all capture probes for the control spike-in oligo nucleotides produced signals in the expected range. Following normalization of the quantified signals (background corrected) using the global Lowess regression algorithm, we have performed an unsupervised as well as supervised data analysis.

DESIGN
RNA from 4 samples pooled in each category. NA- Sample from ascending colon Active Ulcerative colitis; RA- Sample from rectosigmoid colon Active Ulcerative colitis; NC- Sample from ascending colon Control individuals; RC-Sample from rectosigmoid colon Control individuals; NR- Sample from ascending colon remission Ulcerative colitis; RR- Sample from rectosigmoid colon remission Ulcerative colitis; Comparision was done in UC vs Control, Ascending Colon vs Rectosigmoid area in UC and Ascending Colon vs Rectosigmoid area in Controls The supplementary file samplesinfo_2146-1.csv includes additional information about the raw data files

PLATFORM
GPL19128 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array; 7th generation - hsa, mmu & rno (miRBase 18.0)
