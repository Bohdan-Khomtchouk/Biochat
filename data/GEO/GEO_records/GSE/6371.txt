TITLE
Transcriptional changes caused by cpst12 gene disruption in Cryphonectria parasitica

ORGANISM
Cryphonectria parasitica

SUMMARY
A putative homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste12 transcription factor was identified in a series of expressed sequence tag (EST)-based  microarray analyses as being down regulated in strains of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, infected by virulence-attenuating hypoviruses.  Cloning of the corresponding gene, cpst12, confirmed a high level of similarity to Ste12 homologues of other filamentous fungi.  Disruption of cpst12 resulted in no alterations in in vitro growth characteristics or colony morphology and an increase in the production of asexual spores, indicating that CpST12 is dispensable for vegetative growth and conidiation on artificial medium.  However, the disruption mutants showed a very substantial reduction in virulence on chestnut tissue and a complete loss of female fertility, two symptoms normally conferred by hypovirus infection.  Both virulence and female fertility were restored by complementation with the wild-type cpst12 gene.  Analysis of transcriptional changes caused by cpst12 gene disruption with a custom C. parastica cDNA microaray chip identified 152 responsive genes. A significant number of these putative CpST12-regulated genes were also responsive to hypovirus infection.  Thus, cpst12 encodes a cellular transcription factor, CpST12, that is down-regulated by hypovirus infection and required for female fertility, virulence and regulated expression of a subset of hypovirus responsive host genes. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles between cpst12 deletion mutant strain cpst-E1 and isogenic wild-type strain EP155 were compared in this experiment. Two sets of RNA samples with dye-swab (total of four hybridizations) were analyzed.
