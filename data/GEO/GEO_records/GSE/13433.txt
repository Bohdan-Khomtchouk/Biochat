TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Alveolar Soft-Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is an extremely rare, highly vascular soft tissue sarcoma affecting predominantly adolescents and young adults. In an attempt to gain insight into the pathobiology of this enigmatic tumor, we performed the first genome-wide gene expression profiling study.
