TITLE
The role of SOX10 in human melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have shown that Sox10 plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of giant congenital nevi and melanoma in a mouse model of melanoma.To dissect the molecular mechanisms and analyze the role of SOX10 in the maintenance of human melanoma, we have performed microarray study.

DESIGN
Human melanoma cell line M010817 was transfected with either control shRNA or SOX10 shRNA.  RNA was isolated at 48 hours and 96 hours after transfection and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
