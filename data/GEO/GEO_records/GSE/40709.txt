TITLE
Expression data comparing adult human islets to human embryonic stem cell-derived insulin-positive and insulin-negative cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was completed to compare expression profiles of primary human beta cells (in the form of adult human islets), to the expression profile of hESC-derived beta-like cells. A HES3 line modified by homologous recombination to express GFP under the insulin promoter allowed us to FACS sort the hESC-derived cells into purified insulin-positive (presumably beta-like cells), and insulin-negative populations.

DESIGN
Expression profile of adult human islets from cadaveric donors is compared to insulin-positive and insulin-negative populations of hESC-derived beta-like cells
