TITLE
Gonadal transcriptome analysis in sterile double haploid Japanese flounder

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
We used the Illumina sequencing platform to analyze the transcriptome of sterile female DH Japanese flounder in order to identify major genes that cause sterility and to provide a molecular basis for an intensive study of gonadal development in teleosts. Through sequencing, assembly, and annotation,

DESIGN
Three sterile female japanese flounders were control samples and three fertile ones were references samples
