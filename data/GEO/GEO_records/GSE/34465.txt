TITLE
Expression data from periphereal blood lymphocytes of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients pre and post therapy as well as 9 healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of periphereal blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma pre and post immunotherapy was accessed and pre therapy gene expression was compared to PBL gene expression of healthy volunteers Microarray gene expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and compared to results from flow cytometry and serum cytokine analysis.

DESIGN
PBLs of 17 patients pre therapy and 13 patients post therapy could be included in the study as well as PBLs from 9 healthy donors.
