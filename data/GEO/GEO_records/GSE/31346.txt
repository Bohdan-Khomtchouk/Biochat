TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of queen and virgin queen of two ants: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator

ORGANISM
Camponotus floridanus ; Harpegnathos saltator

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of mRNA from queen and virgin queen of two Ants: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from virgin queens and queens by pulverizing the entire animal after removal of gut and poison glands in liquid N2 and then dissolving in TRIzol. PolyA+ RNA were prepared for deep sequencing.
