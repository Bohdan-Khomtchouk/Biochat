TITLE
SNP chip data of EWS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ewing sarcoma is one of the solid tumor that developed in children. We performed SNP-chip analysis against 27 specimens of Ewing sarcoma using Affymetrix GeneChip and CNAG/AsCNAR software. Our study revealed the detailed profile of copy number alterations in Ewing sarcoma. Keywords: SNP-chip

DESIGN
To identify oncogenic lesions in Ewing sarcoma, we performed a genome-wide analysis of Ewing sarcoma samples using high-density SNP arrays (Affymetrix GeneChip).
