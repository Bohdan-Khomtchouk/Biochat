TITLE
Dual transcriptomic analysis of the interaction between the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N and soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens BB6cR8 and Pf29Arp

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor

SUMMARY
In order to get insights into the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to perceive their biotic environment as well as into the mechanisms of the interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria, we analysed the transcriptomic response of the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor and of two beneficial, and neutral soil bacteria during their interactions in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed nine hybridizations (macroarray) with samples derived from Laccaria bicolor cultivated alone (3 biological replicates), with P. fluorescens BBc6R8 (3 biological replicates) and with Pf29Arp (3 biological replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL9465 Laccaria bicolor 4.9K ADNc macroarray
