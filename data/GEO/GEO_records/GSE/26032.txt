TITLE
Identification of target genes of cancer-related microRNAs in human cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify target genes of oncogenic or tumor suppressive microRNAs in human cancer, several cell lines (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma. lung squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were subject to Agilent whole genome microarray. miR-183 and miR-96 function as oncogene. miR-1, miR-133a, miR-135a, miR-145 and miR-375 function as tumor suppressor

DESIGN
The miRNA transfected human cancer cell lines (KK47, T24, A498, PC3, DU145, FaDu, SAS, PC10 and H157) were compared to control cell lines.
