TITLE
Expression data from EGFR mutant transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed mRNA expression profiling of lung tumors from C/L858R, C/T790M, and C/L+T mice and from corresponding normal lung tissue.

DESIGN
mRNA was extracted from pulverized lung samples using Trizol (Invitrogen) and then hybridized to MOE 430 2.0 chips (Affymetrix) using standard hybridization techniques.
