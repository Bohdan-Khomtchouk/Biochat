TITLE
Microarray analysis of the skin of P2.5 K5cre-caNrf2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Nrf2 transcription factor is a key player in the cellular stress response, which regulates the expression of important antioxidant enzymes and other cytoprotective proteins. We recently generated a novel transgenic mouse model to determine the function of Nrf2 in the skin. These mice show reduced number of apoptotic keratinocytes after UVB irradiation due to enhanced ROS detoxification. They also show enhanced tumorigenesis in the HPV8 tumor model.

DESIGN
RNA from whole skin of 3 single P2.5 K5cre-caNrf2 (tg/tg) and 3 single P2.5 K5cre-wt (tg/wt=control) mice were used

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
