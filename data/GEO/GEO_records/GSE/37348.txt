TITLE
Expression data of human ES cells-derived CD34+CD43+CD45low cells (hemogenic endothelium-like cells) expanded upon overexpression of Sox17

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of transcription factor Sox17 in human ES cells-derived endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells enhances expansion of hemogenic endothelium-like cells.

DESIGN
Human ES cells were differentiated for 6 days, 8 days or 12 days in EBs, then CD34+CD43-CD45- endothelial cells, CD34+CD43+CD45- pre-hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) or CD34+CD43+CD45+ HPCs were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected to a microarray analysis.　Some samples were plated onto OP9 cells after the isolation by FACS, and transduced with the 4OH-tamoxifen-inducible 1×FLAG-tagged Sox17-ERT retrovirus. The cells were cultured with 4OH-tamoxifen. CD34+CD43+CD45low hemogenic endothelium-like cells expanded by Sox17-ERT were collected by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and subjected to a ChIP-chip analysis.
