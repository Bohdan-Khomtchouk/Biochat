TITLE
Induction of antiviral RNA interference by influenza A virus in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that mature human somatic cells produce abundant virus-derived siRNAs co-immunoprecipitated with Argonaute proteins in response to IAV infection. We show that the biogenesis of viral siRNAs from IAV dsRNA precursors in infected cells is mediated by wild type human Dicer.

DESIGN
Examination of 14 viral small RNA profiles sequenced from 2 human somatic cells infected by 2 different NS1-deficient influenza A virus strains, either with or without Argonautes co-immunoprecipitation

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
