TITLE
Expression data from TKI258 treated 4T1 tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells have an autocrine FGFR active loop leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways. We found that FGFR inhibitors have a strong effect on 4T1 tumors in-vivo. We used microarray to understand the contribution of FGFR signaling to the tumor formation upon TKI258 treatment.

DESIGN
4T1 cells were injected in the 4th mammary gland of Balb/C mice. After 7 days, daily treatment with TKI258 or water was performed for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, the RNA were extracted from three individual tumors per condition and hybridized on Affimetrix microarrays.
