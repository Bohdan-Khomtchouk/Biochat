TITLE
Let-7 and miR-125 cooperate to promote astrogliogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular basis of astrocyte differentiation and maturation is poorly understood. Here we  set out to study miRNA function during the glial progenitor cell (GPC) to astrocyte transition. Inducible deletion of all canonical microRNAs in GPCs in vitro led to a block in the differentiation to astrocytes. In an unbiased screen, the reintroduction of let-7 and miR-125 families of microRNAs rescued differentiation. Let-7 and miR-125 shared many targets and functioned in parallel to JAK-STAT signaling, a known regulator of astrogliogenesis. While individual knockdown of shared targets did not rescue the differentiation phenotype in microRNA-deficient GPCs, overexpression of these targets in wild-type GPCs blocked differentiation. This finding supports the idea that microRNAs simultaneously suppress multiple mRNAs that inhibit differentiation. The microRNA-regulated targets were enriched for genes downregulated during in vivo astrocyte differentiation and upregulated in glioblastomas, consistent with validity of using the in vitro model to study in vivo events. These findings provide insight into the microRNAs and the genes they regulate in this important cell fate transition.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from ESC-derived undiff, diff, Dgcr8 knockout and Dgcr8 knckout + let7/miR125 glial progenitor cells (GPCs). Three replicates were included for each sample.
