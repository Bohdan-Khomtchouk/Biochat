TITLE
SAHA Rat Dental Pulp

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of rat dental pulp cells (DPCs) cultured with SAHA at early and late mineralisation time points Transcript profiling of DPC identified several novel genes expression induced and supressed by HDACi at 24 hrs and 14 days under mineralising conditions. SAHA induces several members of the MMP family of endopepsidases (TIMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13) and other members of the endochondral ossification pathway at 24 h.

DESIGN
8 experiemental parameters were analysed, each carried out in quadruplicate
