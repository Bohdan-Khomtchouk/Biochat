TITLE
Transcriptome of transition from primary to secondary stem development in Populus

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The terminal region of the developing shoot provides a steep developmental gradient from primary to secondary growth that facilitates identification of the genes that play specialized functions during each of these phases of growth Keywords: Developmental series

DESIGN
