TITLE
The effects of adenine-midiated purinergic signaling in 3T3 fibroblasts and adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In previous study, we demonstrated that adenine could activate AMPK signaling in 3T3 fibroblast. To investigate the changes of transcriptome in differential 3T3 cells by adenine stimulation, we used microarrays to analyze undifferentited annd differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in mRNA levels.

DESIGN
A chip study using total RNA recovered from undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with/without adenine or AICAR.
