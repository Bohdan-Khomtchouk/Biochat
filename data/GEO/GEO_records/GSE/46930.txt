TITLE
Diversity of HrpL-regulons across Pseudomonas syringae isolates

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas syringae

SUMMARY
We implemented transcriptional analysis methods using cDNA and high-throughput sequencing data to identify HrpL-regulated genes for six strains of Pseudomonas syringae

DESIGN
Each Pseudomonas syringae strains was transformed with either pBAD::EV or pBAD containing native hrpL sequence. Strains were grown in MM media supplemented with arabinose and collected 1, 3, and 5 hours post arabinose treatment. RNA was extracted for each time point and mixed at a 1/3 ratio. After removal of rRNA, double stranded cDNA was generated and library prepared accordeing to Illumina protocols.
