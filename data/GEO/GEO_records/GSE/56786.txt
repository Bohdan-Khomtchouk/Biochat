TITLE
Gene expression profiling of small intestinal eosinophils of BALB/c mice after stimulation with GM-CSF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing was performed to conprehensively investigate the changes of gene expression of small intestinal eosinophils of mice after stimulation with GM-CSF in vitro.

DESIGN
Lamina propria eosinophils were collected from small intestine of wild-type BALB/c mice. Eosinophils were stimulated with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF for 4 hours. Cells were cultured in triplicate. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to next generation sequencing analysis.
