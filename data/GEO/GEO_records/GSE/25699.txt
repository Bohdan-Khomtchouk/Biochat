TITLE
Dose-dependent immunomodulation of human dendritic cells by the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in human dendritic cells after contact with either 10e4 or 10e7 CFU of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35

DESIGN
Bacterial cells were incubated for 3 hours with dendritic cells. Total RNA was extracted, quantified, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (control, dendritic cells without bacteria). Hybridization was performed using Agilent Whole Human Genome microarray 4x44K (Agilent).
