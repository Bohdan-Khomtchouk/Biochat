TITLE
Development of a 37K High-density oligo-nucleotide microarray for rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
We have constructed a rainbow trout high-density oligonucleotide microarray by using all the available tentative consensus (TC) sequences from the Rainbow Trout Gene Index database (The Computational Biology and Functional Genomics Lab., Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health).  The Rainbow Trout Gene Index integrates research data from all available international rainbow trout genomic research projects. The newly designed microarray incorporates 37,394 unique transcript-specific oligonucleotide probes, 60-mer long each. The microarray was printed according to our design by Agilent Technologies using the 4 X 44-design format and contains 1417 Agilent control spots.  The performance of the new microarray platform was evaluated by analyzing gene expression associated with the rainbow trout vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy.  These chips can be ordered from Agilent using design number 016320. This microarray is anticipated to open new avenues of research that will aid in the development of novel strategies to enhance growth efficiency and quality in salmonid species.
