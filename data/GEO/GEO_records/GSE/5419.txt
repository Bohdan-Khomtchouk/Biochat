TITLE
Auratus goldfish genome project: Muscimol experiment (6 hour)

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
A goldfish brain enriched cDNA combined with a carp microarray (Gracey et al., 2004). Female goldfish were i.p. injected with 1 ug/g muscimol once and after 6 hours, telencephalon dissected and used in microarray analysis. More details on microarray hybridizations and technique used in our laboratory in Martyniuk et al. Gene expression profiling in the brain of male goldfish exposed to 17Î±-EE2(paper under review) Keywords: muscimol, GABA, goldfish, brain
