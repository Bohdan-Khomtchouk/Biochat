TITLE
Auratus goldfish genome project: Muscimol experiment (6 hour)

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
A goldfish brain enriched cDNA combined with a carp microarray (Gracey et al., 2004). Female goldfish were i.p. injected with 1 ug/g muscimol once and after 6 hours, telencephalon dissected and used in microarray analysis. More details on microarray hybridizations and technique used in our laboratory in Martyniuk et al. Gene expression profiling in the brain of male goldfish exposed to 17Î±-EE2(paper under review) Keywords: muscimol, GABA, goldfish, brain

DESIGN
4 arrays using a common control pool and 3 treatment samples. Slides 16, 22, 33, and 50 Slides 22 and 33 are dye swap.

PLATFORM
