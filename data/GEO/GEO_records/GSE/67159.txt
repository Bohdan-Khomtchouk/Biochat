TITLE
Prenatal Exposure to DEHP Affects Spermatogenesis and Sperm DNA Methylation in a Strain-Dependent Manner

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the impact of prenatal exposure to DEHP on spermatogenesis and DNA sperm methylation in F1 mice strains FVB/N and C57BL/6J. Prenatal exposition was performed orally on mothers with 300 mg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 9 to 19. 20 sperm-extracted DNA samples of males born from DEHP-treated and control mothers were analysed by MBD-seq at NXT-DX company.

DESIGN
We test 22480 probes of 2.2kb size ranging from 2kb upstream to 200bp downstream of the start of genes in quintuplicates comparing controls to DEHP conditions in both strains.
