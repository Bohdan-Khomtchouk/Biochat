TITLE
Ptdsr (phosphatidylserine receptor) embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is fundamental to animal development, immune function and cellular homeostasis. The phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti-inflammatory signaling. Ptdsr is essential for the development and differentiation of multiple organs during embryogenesis but not for apoptotic cell removal. Ptdsr may thus have a novel, unexpected developmental function as an important differentiation-promoting gene. Moreover, Ptdsr is not required for apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages but seems to be necessary for the regulation of macrophage cytokine responses. Keywords: ptdsr, embryo E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, cDNA microarray experiments

DESIGN
Comparison of Ptdsr-/- and Ptdsr+/+ embryos, age: E.11.5, E.12.5, E.13.5, technical replicates for all including 50% dye swap experiments. Biolobical replicates for E.12.5 only

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
