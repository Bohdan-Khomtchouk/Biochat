TITLE
Integrated miRNA-mRNA analysis revealing the potential roles of miRNAs in chordomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucially involved in tumorigenesis and that paired expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs can be used to identify functional miRNA-target relationships with high precision.However, no studies have applied integrated analysis to miRNA and mRNA profiles in chordomas. The purpose of this study was to provide insights into the pathogenesis of chordomas by using this integrated analysis method

DESIGN
Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs of chordomas (n = 3) and notochord tissues (n = 3) were analyzed by using microarrays with hierarchical clustering analysis. Subsequently, the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted and overlapped with the differentially expressed mRNAs. Then, GO and pathway analyses were performed for the intersecting genes
