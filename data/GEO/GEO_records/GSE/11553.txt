TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in different T cell clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to analyze the expression of genes in T cell clones having different functional profiles (Th1, Th0, Th17, Th2) obtained from the same individual. Keywords: Gene expression, T cell clones, Th17 characterisation

DESIGN
The T cell clones were derived according to well known protocol, using different cytokines, and classified on the basis of their ability to produce cytokines. Once characterized for their production of IL-4, IL-12, gamma-IFN, IL-13, IL-1, they were used to prepare microarray experiments.
