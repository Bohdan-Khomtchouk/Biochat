Validation of the Swine Protein-Annotated Oligonucleotide Microarray.

Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study we evaluate the Swine Protein-Annotated Oligonucleotide Microarray by profiling the expression of transcripts in four porcine tissues. We validate the hybridization results by comparative analysis of expression in human orthologs, confirm expression patterns for a subset of genes by QPCR, and assess the usefulness of designed control oligonucleotides. Simple descriptive diagnostic analyses of PM/MM probe sets introduced in this paper are useful to detect non-specific hybridization. Using comparative transcriptional profiling, we found that the microarray data correlate to QPCR data for most genes detected as differentially expressed using the microarray platform. Moreover, comparison to human ortholog expression confirmed the utility of experiments based on this array in swine species as a biomedical model for human tissue specific expression.
