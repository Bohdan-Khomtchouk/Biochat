TITLE
Gene expression from Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression from Wild-type and NFAT5 knock-out Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts keywords: Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 arrays from each condition: isotonic wild-type MEFs, hypertonic treated wild-type MEFs , isotonic wild-type MEFs pretreated for 1 hour with 100 nM Torin1, hypertonic treated wild-type MEFs pretreated for 1 hour with 100 nM Torin1, isotonic knock-out MEFs and hypertonic treated knock-out MEFs.

PLATFORM
