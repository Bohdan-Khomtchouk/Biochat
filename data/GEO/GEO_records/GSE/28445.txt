TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of human preadipocyte treated by macrophages from adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is characterized by a chronic auto-inflammation of the hypertrophied white adipose tissue (WAT) associated with metabolic and vascular complications. WAT of obese subjects produces inflammatory factors like cytokines (IL6, TNF-alpha) and chemokines (CCL2 and IL-8) originating mainly from the accumulated macrophages. WAT macrophages profoundly affect adipose cell biology leading in particular to the inflammation of the adipocytes and altered differentiation of their precursors, the pre-adipocytes. We previously showed that conditioned media from WAT macrophages (ATM CM) induced inflammation in human pre-adipocytes. We performed pangenomic cDNA microarrays analysis to compare gene expression profiles between control and ATM CM treated preadipocytes. By a functional analysis, we identified the biological themes that best characterized the proinflammatory preadipocytes. The most significantly overrepresented GO Cellular Component categories were " cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction " and " chemokine signaling pathway " , emphasizing the importance of cytokine and chemokine production by the inflammatory preadipocyte. The chemokines acting  in concert to recruit leukocytes in inflamed tissues, still need to be more precisely identified in human WAT. Thus, our data lead to the identification of new chemokines involved in attraction of immune cells in inflamed human WAT.

DESIGN
The transcriptomic profile of human preadipocytes was compared to that of preadipocyes treated by macrophages isolated from human adipose tissue. Two-condition experiment,human control preadipocyte vs preadipocyte treated by macrophages from adipose tissue. 5 biological replicates (with a dye-swap design).
