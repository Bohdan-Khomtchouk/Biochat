TITLE
Characterization of RNAi genes and their impact on sRNA biogenesis, growth and development of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
RNAi is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotic organisms and has been the subject of recent attention pertaining to many animal and plant models. But research related to fungal systems is limited, especially in plant pathogenic models. The present study was undertaken to examine the involvement of RNAi components on the biogenesis of small RNAs and their impact on growth and pathogenicity of the plant pathogenic model organism Magnaporthe oryzae. Through genetic and genomic analyses, we demonstrate that an individual Dicer, an RdRP and an Argonaute are essential for the generation of sRNAs. Collectively, they are involved in biogenesis of sRNAs matching to coding regions, repeats and intergenic regions. The loss of a particular Argonaute made the fungus less virulent on barley leaves and was also essential for sRNA production. Furthermore, one specific RdRP that was not essential to sRNA generation nonetheless reduced fungal virulence. In total, ten deletion mutants were constructed in each of the putative sRNA-generating genes, as well as a double deletion mutant in the two Dicers, and comparison of sRNA and RNA-seq profiles of each mutant yielded new insights into the involvement of sRNAs in transcriptional regulation and intergenic regions in M. oryzae. Together, these data support that RNAi machinery in M. oryzae is not only involved in generation of sRNAs, but is involved in regulating various developmental processes including fungal growth and virulence.
