TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic cancers patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the identification of miRNA biomarker of pancreatic cancer, total RNA containing miRNA was extracted from the serum samples using Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 and the serum miRNA purification kit (Genolution, Seoul, Korea)

DESIGN
Blood serum samples were extracted from 88 PC patients, 101 ICC patients, 7 stomach cancer (SC) patients, 5 colorectal cancer (CC) patients, 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) patients, 10 cholelithiasis patients, and 19 healthy subjects who had been clinically classified as so at the time of participation
