TITLE
Acyl-CoA synthetase 1 in differentiated adipocytes from small for gestational age neonates: Putative association with fetal programming of cellular insulin sensitivity and lipid content [ACSL1_knockdown]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesised that SGA as a proxy for intrauterine growth restriction promotes specific epigenetic marks and pathways, whose physiological implications may become apparent only in the fully differentiated state.

DESIGN
Samples (SGA derived cell line MSC-01) were collected from umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) and treated.
