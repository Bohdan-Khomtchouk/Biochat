Uterine stromal cell_cultured with uNK conditioned Medium

SUMMARY
The endometrium contains a distinct population of immune cells consisting of 70% natural killer (NK) cells that undergo cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle. However, how these uterine NK (uNK) cells interact with uterine stromal cells (SC) remains unclear. We therefore investigated the paracrine effect of medium conditioned by uNK cells on the gene expression profile of endometrial SC in-vitro using a cDNA Microarray. Our results, verified by real-time PCR and ELISA, reveal that soluble factors from uNK cells substantially alter endometrial SC gene expression. The largest group of up-regulated genes found were chemokines and cytokines, including IL-15 and IL-15RÎ±. The latter could produce a niche for uNK cells allowing proliferation within and recruitment into the uterus, as seen in bone marrow. In addition, the most abundantly up-regulated genes, including IL-8, CCL8 and CXCL1 have also been shown to be stimulated by contact of SC with trophoblast, suggesting that uNK cells work synergistically to support the initial trophoblast migration during implantation. Overall this study demonstrates for the first time the paracrine communication between uNK cells and uterine SC, and adds to the understanding of how the uterine immune system contributes to the changes seen within the cycling endometrium.
