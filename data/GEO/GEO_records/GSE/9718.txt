TITLE
Uterine stromal cell_cultured with uNK conditioned Medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The endometrium contains a distinct population of immune cells consisting of 70% natural killer (NK) cells that undergo cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle. However, how these uterine NK (uNK) cells interact with uterine stromal cells (SC) remains unclear. We therefore investigated the paracrine effect of medium conditioned by uNK cells on the gene expression profile of endometrial SC in-vitro using a cDNA Microarray. Our results, verified by real-time PCR and ELISA, reveal that soluble factors from uNK cells substantially alter endometrial SC gene expression. The largest group of up-regulated genes found were chemokines and cytokines, including IL-15 and IL-15RÎ±. The latter could produce a niche for uNK cells allowing proliferation within and recruitment into the uterus, as seen in bone marrow. In addition, the most abundantly up-regulated genes, including IL-8, CCL8 and CXCL1 have also been shown to be stimulated by contact of SC with trophoblast, suggesting that uNK cells work synergistically to support the initial trophoblast migration during implantation. Overall this study demonstrates for the first time the paracrine communication between uNK cells and uterine SC, and adds to the understanding of how the uterine immune system contributes to the changes seen within the cycling endometrium. Keywords: Response of endometrial stromal cells to uNK conditioned medium

DESIGN
This study was designed to identify the response of non-decidualised stromal cells from the endometrium, to soluble factors secreted by uterine NK cells.  Endometrial stromal cells were isolated from 7 patients and treated with control medium or medium conditioned by uterine Nk cells. THE 'REF' COLUMN ON EACH ARRAY IS THE SIGNAL PRODUCED BY A COMMON REFERNCE RNA SAMPLE THAT WAS LABELLED AS A SINGLE BATCH SAMPLE AND HYBRIDISED TO ALL THE ARRAYS- IT IS A 'COMMON REFERENCE'. THE 'TEST' SAMPLE COMPRISES EACH INDIVIDUAL SAMPLE OF CELLS TREATED AS DESCRIBED IN THE SERIES SUBMISSION. FOR EXAMPLE; SAMPLE Y1 (gsm2435820) IS RNA FROM PATIENT 1 TREATED WITH CONTROL MEDIUM, SAMPLE G1 (GSM245371) IS RNA FROM PATIENT 1 TREATED WITH NK CONDITIONED MEDIUM THESE TWO SAMPLES THEREFORE FORM A PAIR- IE CELLS FROM THE SAME PATIENT TREATED WITH CONTROL OR NK-CONDITIONED MIDIUM. Y2,G2 ARE FROM PATIENT 2, ETC
