TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression from different developmental stages of the tomato fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The goal of this research was to measure the gene expression levels thoughout 10 stages of tomato fruit development. Whole buds, flowers or fruits were collected at various developmental timepoints.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 10 stages of flower and fruit development. A single technical and biological repeat was performed. cDNA was amplified and labelled using standard Affymetrix protocols.
