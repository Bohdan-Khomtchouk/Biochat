TITLE
The effect of the HDAC inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and adenocarcinoma cells II

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Title: In vitro and in vivo effects of the orally bioavailable phenylbutyrate-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate nucleosomal packaging of DNA, thereby influencing gene transcription and multiple cancer-associated processes. We conducted microarray analysis on esophageal tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with OSU-HDAC42 or vehicle to assess target effect in an in vivo model utilized for EAC development. Keywords: esophageal tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with OSU-HDAC42 or vehicle

DESIGN
5-6 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered OSU-HDAC42 (50 mg/kg/dose thrice weekly for a total dose of 350 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage.  Twenty-four hours after the final gavage, the esophagi were harvested and total RNA was isolated using the RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).  Global gene expression analysis was conducted using the 230 2.0 chip (Affymetrix).
