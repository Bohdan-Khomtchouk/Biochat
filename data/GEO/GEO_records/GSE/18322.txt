TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Ara-C Resistance in AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using two independently derived murine BXH2 cell lines, Ara-C resistant derivatives were developed by exposure to increasing concentrations of Ara-C.  Microarray analysis comparing the Ara-C resistant cells to their Ara-C sensitive parental cell lines identified potential genes involved in Ara-C resistance.

DESIGN
Two highly Ara-C-resistant cell lines, B117H and B140H, were derived from Ara-C-sensitive parental cell lines, B117P and B140P.  Variations in gene expression between these Ara-C-resistant and -sensitive sets were studied. Three replicates per cell line.
