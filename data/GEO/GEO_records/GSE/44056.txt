TITLE
Gene expression data from lateral ventricle choroid plexuses of developing and adult rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Choroid plexuses (CP) develop early during development. They form a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, and fulfill important protective and nutritive functions. We used Affymetrix microarrays to assess whether CP of the lateral ventricles (LVCP) have similar functions in developing and adult brain. We identified distinct families of protective and transport genes and found that most of these genes were already well expressed during development.

DESIGN
2 batches of CP from embryonic day E19, postnatal day 2 and adult rats were processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
