TITLE
Inhibitory Actions of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) on Ovarian Primordial Follicle Assembly

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The current study was designed to investigate the actions of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) on primordial follicle assembly.  Ovarian primordial follicles develop from the breakdown of oocyte nests during fetal development for the human and immediately after birth in rodents.  AMH was found to inhibit primordial follicle assembly, decrease the initial primordial follicle pool size and promote the persistence of small oocyte nests in a rat ovarian organ culture.  The AMH expression was found to be primarily in the stromal tissue of the ovaries at this period of development, suggesting a stromal-epithelial cell interaction for primordial follicle assembly.  AMH was found to promote alterations in the ovarian transcriptome during primordial follicle assembly with over 200 genes with altered expression.  A gene network was identified suggesting a potential central role for the Fgf2/Nudt6 antisense transcript in the follicle assembly process.  A number of signal transduction pathways are regulated by AMH actions on the ovarian transcriptome, in particular the transforming growth factor – beta (TGFß) signaling process.  AMH is the first hormone/protein shown to have an inhibitory action on primordial follicle assembly.  Due to the critical role of the primordial follicle pool size for female reproduction, elucidation of the factors, such as AMH, that regulate the assembly process will provide insights into potential therapeutics to manipulate the pool size and female reproduction. We used microarrays to determine genes expressed differentially between control and AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) treated P0 ovary

DESIGN
RNA samples from 3 control groups are compared to 3 AMH treated ovary groups
