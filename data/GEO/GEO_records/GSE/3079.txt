TITLE
Expression profile of MRP14(S100A9)-positive and -negative mouse bone marrow granulocytes under different stimulations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MRP14 is tissue-specific expressed only in granulocytes, monocytes and in inflammation-activated keratinocytes. Its existence in the early phase of inflammation may be a hint towards a participation in immune response. Intra- and extracellular functions have been described yet. An antibacterial effect is caused by chelation of zinc, which then cannot be used for bacterial growth. The experiments were performed to shed light on the function of the SA100 protein MRP14. Keywords: cell type comparison, response to stimulus

DESIGN
MRP14(SA100A9)-positive and -negative mouse bone marrow granulocytes are measured unstimulated as control (2 repeats each at time point 0h, 5 repeats each at time point 4h) and then stimulated for 4h with LTB-4 (1 repeat each), A23187 (a calcium ionophore, 4 repeats each), LPS (part of gram negative bacteria, 3 repeats each) and PMA (1 repeat each); MRP14(SA100A9)-positive and -negative mouse spleen tissue (1 repeat each) for comparison; another data set contains all experiments of this data set with Mu11KsubA instead of Mu11KsubB arrays

PLATFORM
GPL75 [Mu11KsubA] Affymetrix Murine 11K SubA Array GPL76 [Mu11KsubB] Affymetrix Murine 11K SubB Array
