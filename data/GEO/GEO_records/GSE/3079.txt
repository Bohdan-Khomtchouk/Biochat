TITLE
Expression profile of MRP14(S100A9)-positive and -negative mouse bone marrow granulocytes under different stimulations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MRP14 is tissue-specific expressed only in granulocytes, monocytes and in inflammation-activated keratinocytes. Its existence in the early phase of inflammation may be a hint towards a participation in immune response. Intra- and extracellular functions have been described yet. An antibacterial effect is caused by chelation of zinc, which then cannot be used for bacterial growth. The experiments were performed to shed light on the function of the SA100 protein MRP14. Keywords: cell type comparison, response to stimulus
