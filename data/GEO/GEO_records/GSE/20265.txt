TITLE
Comparison of gene expression of OT-I CD8 T cells after infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to examine gene expression after in vivo activation by different vaccine strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Heat killed LM, irradiated LM and live actA- LM were used to immunize mice after transfer of OT-I cells

DESIGN
5x10e5 OT-I-RAG-/- cells transferred to B6 mice, 24hrs later mice immunized; 24hrs later cells sorted on MHC class II-, CD45.1+, CD8+, CD69+ Two arrays were performed per sample for a total of 8 arrays.  RAW data file (supplementary file on the Series record) contains the data for each array individually.
