TITLE
The role of Clec4e (Mincle) in microglia response to transient ischemic injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data set shows dramatic changes in gene expression in microglia isolated from C57Bl6/J mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, as compared to those subjected to sham surgery. Mice deficient in Mincle (Clec4e-/-) showed significantly improved injury outcomes 3 and 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, when comparing changes in gene expression in microglia 24 hours after blood reperfusion, there were no differences between wild-type and Clec4e-/- mice, indicating that Mincle does not participate in early microglial activation.

DESIGN
Wild type and Mincle knock-out (Clec4e-/-) mice. After 1 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and 24 h of reperfusion, mice were perfused with PBS, their brains dissected, and 2 ipsilesional hemispheres (with cerebellum and brainstem removed) pooled for microglia isolation. For sham-operated animals, the whole forebrain was used and brains were not pooled. After myelin separation by Percoll gradient centrifugation, around 80,000 CD45intermediate, CD11b+ microglial cells were sorted from each sample. Sham samples n=3, tMCAO samples n=5.
