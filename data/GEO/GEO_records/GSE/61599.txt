TITLE
Loss of SOX2 expression induces cell migration via Vimentin up-regulation and serves as unfavourable risk factor for poor survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of patient derived HNSCC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) cell line HNO223 comparing control cells transfected with shRNA against luciferase (shLuci) with cells transfected with two different shRNAs targeting SOX2. The goal was to determine the effects of SOX2 knockdown on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from stably transfected HNSCC cells with shLuci (control) and two different SOX2 shRNAs (shSOX2#1 and shSOX2#2), comparing the control with each of the two SOX2 shRNAs (replicate1: shLuci vs. shSOX2#1 and replicate2: shLuci vs. shSOX2#2). The biological replicates were from two independent transfection experiments (transfection 1 and transfection 2). Gene expression profiling was performed using the Human GE 4x44K v2 Microarray according to manufacturer`s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
