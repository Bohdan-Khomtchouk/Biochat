TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Salmonella Typhimurium stimulated heterophils using a chicken 44K Agilent microarray

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To determine the host response to Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) in heterophils, a whole chicken genome array was used to analyze RNA isolated from heterophils stimulated in vitro with ST (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h) or medium control (NS). Dual-color, direct comparisons were carried between ST-stimulated and non-stimulated controls (30 min vs. NS (30M/NS), 1 h vs. NS (1HR/NS), 2 h vs. NS (2HR/NS) and 3 h vs. NS (3HR/NS)). Each comparison includes four biological replicates. There were 2791, 3744, 12947 and 12482 genes differentially expressed in the comparisons of 30M/NS, 1HR/NS, 2HR/NS and 3HR/NS, respectively (P < 0.001) , while 50, 82, 153, and 146 genes were related to immune function, respectively. More than 80% of immune-related genes overlapped between the comparisons (30M/NS vs. 1HR/NS, 1HR/NS vs. 2HR/NS, and 2HR/NS vs. 3HR/NS). These candidate genes include cytokines (e.g. Interleukin (IL) 1Î², -6, -10B and -12B), chemokines (e.g. IL-8, CCL4, K60 and K203) and cluster of differentiation (CD) markers (e.g. CD44, -47 and -83). A relatively large increase in the number of differentially expressed immune-related genes was observed between 1 h and 2 h post-stimulation. The results of continuous transcriptional change provide important information to elucidate both the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ST stimulation in chickens.

DESIGN
Dual-color, common reference comparisons were carried between ST-stimulated (30M, 1HR, 2HR and 3HR) and non-stimulated controls (NS). Four biological replicates, with dye swap labeling, were included in the comparisons of each post-stimulation time point (30M/NS, 1HR/NS, 2HR/NS and 3HR/NS). Background subtracted signal intensity were collected from 16 arrays and normalized before data analysis.
