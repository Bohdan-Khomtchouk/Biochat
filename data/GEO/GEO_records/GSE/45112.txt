TITLE
Transcriptome and transposable element dynamics  during PIWI regulation in Drosophila ovarian cell cultures

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study examines the regulatory capacity of the Piwi protein in the Drosophila OSS cell. Piwi CLIP-Seq, mRNA-Seq and nascent RNAseq datasets were integrated to determine how Piwi proteins where using piRNAs and binding interactions to regulate the expression of transcripts.  We also sequenced the genomes of various OSS cell lines.

DESIGN
We first performed several replicates of a Piw CLIP-Seq experiment to isolate RNA fragments as CLIP-tags to discover which transcripts are preferentially bound by the Piwi protein.  Then we performed several types of mRNA expression profiling experiments using several forms of mRNA-Seq library construction formats.  Finally, we sequenced the genomes from various OSS cell lines. The genomic sequencing component of the study is represented by BioProject PRJNA240323. The genomic sequencing raw data have been deposited at SRA (SRP039565).
