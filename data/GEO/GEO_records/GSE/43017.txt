TITLE
Expression profiles of leukemia cells of acute-type adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently mapped 605 chromosomal breakpoints in 61 ATL cases by spectral karyotyping and identified chromosome 14q11 as one of the most common chromosomal breakpoint regions. To map the precise location of chromosomal breakpoints at 14q11, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based comparative genomic hybridization on leukemia cells from acute-type ATL patients. The breakpoints accumulated frequently adjacent to the T cell receptor alpha/delta chain locus (TCRα/δ) with chromosomal deletions at 14q11 and a recurrent 0.9 Mb interstitial deletion was identified at a region including part of the TCRα/δ locus. Because leukemia-associated genes are frequently located near the breakpoint cluster regions, we then analyzed the gene expression profiles of ATL cells and identified N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) as one of the genes that are down-regulated in ATLL cells among the 25 genes mapped to the region adjacent to the recurrently deleted regions at 14q11.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of ATL cells from seven acute-type ATL patients and CD4+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of five healthy volunteers as references using oligonucleotide microarrays.
