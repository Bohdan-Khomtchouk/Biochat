TITLE
Expression data from side-population sorted putative intestinal stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the existence of intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESCs) has been well established, their study has been limited due to the inability to isolate them.  Previous work has utilized side population (SP) sorting of the murine small intestinal mucosa to isolate a viable fraction of cells enriched for putative IESCs.  We have used microarray analyses to characterize the molecular features of this potential stem cell population. Keywords: Comparitive gene expression analysis
