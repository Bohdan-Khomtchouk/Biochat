TITLE
Activating transcription factor 3 regulates immune and metabolic homeostasis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Integration of metabolic, stress and immune responses plays a fundamental role during animal development to maintain energy homeostasis while ensuring growth and proper developmental timing. Perturbation of metabolic and immune signaling circuits has detrimental consequences to animal development including growth retardation, organ malfunction and emergence of the metabolic syndrome. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), safeguards a balance of metabolic and immune system responses during fly development. Loss of Atf3 function results in lethality during late-larval and pupal stages. Atf3-deficient larvae exhibit phenotypes resembling the metabolic syndrome in mammals. Excessive accumulation of lipids in the larval fat body and gut is accompanied by altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, the fat body of atf3 mutants becomes infiltrated by hemocytes. The major pro-inflammatory pathways signaling through JNK and Imd are hyperactivated in atf3 mutants, causing ectopic expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. Suppression of the immune response, achieved by reducing the gene dose of the transcription factors FOXO or NF-kappaB/Relish, significantly improves lipid metabolism and normalizes gene expression profile of atf3 mutants. In addition, heterozygosity of relish partially rescues lethality of the atf3 mutants. Our data thus identify Atf3 as an essential player that links metabolic and immune system homeostasis during animal development.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels from four genotypes of male, 3rd instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae.  mRNA levels from four genotypes relative to y w control were determined using two biological replicates per genotype. Genome build: BDGP R5/dm3, April 2006
