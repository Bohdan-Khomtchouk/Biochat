TITLE
Gene expression profile of A549 cells cultured with FP001

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preclinical cancer drug discovery efforts have employed two-dimensional (2D)-cell-based assay models, which fail to forecast in vivo efficacy and contribute to a lower success rates of clinical approval.  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are recently expected to bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models. We have developed novel 3D culture method that improves the growth of spheroid-forming cancer cells under anchorage-independent condition by leveraging a feature of FP001. Gene microarrays were used to observe the global gene expression in A549 cells cultured in multi-well plate with or without FP001 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
A549 cells were cultured for 5 days in normal attachment plate with normal medium (as control) or normal attachment plate with FP001 containing medium. Each sample was collected three times.
