TITLE
Diversity in the polyadenylation and decay of human cellular microRNAs during Vaccinia virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a large cytoplasmic dsDNA virus that causes dramatic alterations to many cellular pathways including microRNA biogenesis. Here we use small RNA sequencing to comprehensively quantify the impact of VACV infection on the expression of endogenous small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) at both early (6 h) and late (24 h) times post infection.

DESIGN
Non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) were assessed at 6 hours and 24 hours, in naive and VACV-infected HeLa cells, in the presence or absence of the inhibitor AraC.  There were three replicates for each of the eight groups.
