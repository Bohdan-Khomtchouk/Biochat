TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of infection of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus with STIV

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus solfataricus

SUMMARY
Time series of infection of Sulfolobus solfataricus strain 2-2-12 cells infected with STIV are compared with uninfected cells over 32 h.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. Infected cells sampled at 5 time points (0, 8, 16, 24, 32 h post infection). Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 infected, paired samples independently grown. One replicate per array. Dye swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL7093 Sulfolobus 3.4K long oligo array version 2.0
