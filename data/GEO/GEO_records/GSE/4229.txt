TITLE
Alzheimer disease diagnostic prediction using peripheral BMC gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (BMC) gene expression proves useful as predictive markers of sporadic AD. We obtained 90% accuracy for correct AD classification by PAM (36 of 40; four NEC classified as AD) using BMC gene expression. Investigating the contribution of these genes to the pathology of AD and their usefulness as prognostic biomarkers holds promise in the prevention of this devastating disease.
