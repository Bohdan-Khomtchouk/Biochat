TITLE
Identification of ERRalpha dependent PGC-1alpha tagret genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1 transcription factor was customized to limit its interations to ERRalpha. This mutant (2x9) was used to dissect the transcription activation patterns that are attributable to the PGC1-ERR interaction and PGC-1 actions that are independent of ERR. Inactive mutant with the deleted LLXXL motifs (L2L3) and wt PGC-1 were used as negative and positive controls respectively. BGAL-expressing construct was used to control for non-specific effects of adenoviral infection. Keywords: ERRalpha, PGC-1alpha, nuclear receptor, orphan nuclear receptor, coactivator, transcription factors
