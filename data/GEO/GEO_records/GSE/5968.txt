TITLE
Identification of ERRalpha dependent PGC-1alpha tagret genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1 transcription factor was customized to limit its interations to ERRalpha. This mutant (2x9) was used to dissect the transcription activation patterns that are attributable to the PGC1-ERR interaction and PGC-1 actions that are independent of ERR. Inactive mutant with the deleted LLXXL motifs (L2L3) and wt PGC-1 were used as negative and positive controls respectively. BGAL-expressing construct was used to control for non-specific effects of adenoviral infection. Keywords: ERRalpha, PGC-1alpha, nuclear receptor, orphan nuclear receptor, coactivator, transcription factors

DESIGN
Expression constructs for BGAL control and three variants of PGC-1 were introduced into HepG2 cells via adenoviral infection. RNA was isolated 24 hrs post infection and the changes in gene expression were detected using GeneChip technology (Affymetrix). Hybridization was performed on the HG-133 plus 2 platform. The experiment was performed in three biological replicates. Raw expression data were normalized using MAS5.0 algorithm.
