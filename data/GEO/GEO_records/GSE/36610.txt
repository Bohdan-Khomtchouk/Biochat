TITLE
Gene expression profiles of uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is a poorly understood gynecologic cancer with few effective treatments. This study explores molecular events involved in ULMS with the goal of identifying strategies.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling were used to compare clinically well-annotated specimens of myometrium, leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma.
