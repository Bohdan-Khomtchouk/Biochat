TITLE
Mouse CD8+CD122+ regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile was compared between CD8+CD122+ T cells and CD8+CD122- T cells.

DESIGN
mRNA taken from CD8+CD122+ cells or CD8+CD122- cells collected by cell sorting from C57BL/6 mice spleen was amplified and analyzed by using gene chip of Agilent.

PLATFORM
GPL2872 Agilent-012694 Whole Mouse Genome G4122A (Feature Number version)
