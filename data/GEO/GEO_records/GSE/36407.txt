TITLE
mRNA Expression data from transverse aortic constriction hearts (cardiovascular disease) and sham hearts in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used transverse aortic constraction pressure overload hypertrophy mouse hearts as a model of cardiovascular disease to study the genetic changes between TAC and SHAM (normal) mouse hearts and over 1 circadian cycle (24h). This is one approach to identify diurnal genetic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. The micorarray approach allowed to see the gene expression in all genes in cardiovascular disease and sham hearts.

DESIGN
There are 36 samples of cardiovascular disease (TAC) and normal SHAM hearts.  For TAC: There were 3 mice sacrificed at each time point as biological replicates, for 6 timepoints over 24 hrs.  For SHAM: There were 3 mice sacrificed at each time point as biological replicates, for 6 timepoints over 24 hrs.
