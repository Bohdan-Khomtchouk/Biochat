TITLE
Transcriptional and functional analysis of trifluoromethionine resistance in Entamoeba histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Previously, we have shown that in Entamoeba histolytica, methionine Î³-lyase (EhMGL) downregulation results in trifluoromethionine resistance. The transcriptional response, however, of this parasite to the drug is not known. In this study, we used microarray analysis to determine if additional genes are involved.

DESIGN
The expression profile of 9,230 genes in wild type and trifluoromethionine resistant strains was compared. Episomal overexpression of EhBspA1 was performed to verify its role in trifluoromethionine resistance. The transcriptomes of trifluoromethionine resistant strain cultured with or without trifluoromethionine, EhMGL-gene silenced strain, metronidazole resistant strain, and wild type strain under cysteine-deprived conditions were compared to determine the specificity of the changes observed in trifluoromethionine resistant strain.
