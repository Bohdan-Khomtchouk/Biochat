TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation mapping in preadipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, using MeDIP-seq experiment, we report the mapping of DNA methylation in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells (preadipocytes).

DESIGN
Examination of DNA methylation pattern in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells (preadipocytes)

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
