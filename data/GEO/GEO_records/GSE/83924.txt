TITLE
miRNA experiment of fresh frozen colonic biopsy samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to perform an additional global miRNA microarray analysis of tubular and tubulovillous adenoma biopsy specimen completed with colorectal adenocarcinomas using fresh frozen tisse

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tissue samples from tubular and tubulovillous adenoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were hybridized on Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 3.0 microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
