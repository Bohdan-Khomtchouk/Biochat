TITLE
Expression data from yeast strain VIN13 in small and large scale alcoholic fermentations.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analyses of fermenting yeast are increasingly being carried out under small scale simulated winemaking conditions. It is not known to what degree data generated from such experiments are a reflection of transcriptional processes in large-scale commercial fermentation tanks. In this experiment we set out to determine the effect of scale, or fermentation volume, on the transcriptional respone of wine yeast strains. Parallel fermentations were carried out in laboratory fermentation vials and commercial fermentation tanks using the same wine media and inoculated yeast strain. Comparative transcriptomic analyses were carried out at three time points during alcoholic fermentation.
