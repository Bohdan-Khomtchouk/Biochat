Analysis of normal lung cells treated with 5-aza-dC to induce DNA demethylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2 cultured normal lung cell lines, Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial (NHBE) and Human Small Airway Epithelial (SAEC) cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), following treatment with 5-aza-dC to induce DNA demethylation. These results provide insight into the role of epigenetic alterations, specifically demethylation, in differential gene expression in various lung neoplasms.
