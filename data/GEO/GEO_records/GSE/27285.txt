TITLE
Transcriptome and translational signaling following endurance exercise in trained skeletal muscle: impact of dietary protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Impact of protein ingestion following 1 h intense cycling on the induced transcriptome and signaling in biopsy samples from endurance-trained men, relative to isocaloric control

DESIGN
Single blind, randomized, crossover design comprising two experimental blocks. During the blocks, exercise and diet were controlled and the intervention consisted of the ingestion of a protein-enriched and control beverage, with outcome measures obtained from skeletal muscle tissue collected following a bout of intense cycling. Total RNA were obtained from quadriceps. Each of the two serves were isocaloric and provided 0.2 g/kg fat (freeze dried canola oil) with either 1.2 g/kg carbohydrate (1:1 maltodextrin:fructose) and 0.4 g/kg protein (2:1 milk protein concentrate:whey isolate); or 1.6 g/kg carbohydrate (1:1 maltodextrin:fructose).
