TITLE
Expression of genes in adult hepatocytes and fetal hepatoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze stem/progenitor cell function, we purified hepatocytes derived from adult livers and fetal hepatoblasts derived from embryonic day 13 livers.

DESIGN
Compared gene expression in E13 hepatoblasts and adult hepatocytes derived from C57BL/6NCr mice
