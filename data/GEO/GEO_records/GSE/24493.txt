TITLE
Effect of Imatinib on chronic myelogenous leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) encodes the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, which is present in almost every patient with chronic myeloid leukemia. In this study, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib was used for pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL1. Gene expression profiles of CML cell lines were analyzed in response to Imatinib treatment.

DESIGN
Three CML cell lines (KU-812, KCL-22, JURL-MK1) were either treated with 10 ÂµM STI571 (Imatinib) for 16 hours or cultured in absence of STI571.
