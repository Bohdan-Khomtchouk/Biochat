TITLE
Expression data from human mesenchymal stem cell and osteosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether enhanced self-renewal and tumorigenicity in UT2 cells (derived from the second humanâ€“mouse xenotransplantation of U2OS cell-formed osteosarcoma tissues) correlate with increased expression of stem/progenitor cell-associated genes, we measured global gene expression in MSC, U2OS and UT2 cells by microarray analysis. Compared to U2OS and MSC, molecules involved in regulation of self-renewal signaling pathways of cancer stem cells were also up-regulated in UT2 cells, including those in the Notch, Wnt, and TGF-beta pathways. These data suggest a genetic basis for the enhanced self-renewal and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma-initiating cell in UT2 cells.

DESIGN
MSC, U2OS and UT2 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to analysis stem/progenitor cell-associated genes and molecules involved in regulation of self-renewal signaling pathways of cancer stem cells between UT2 cells and its parent cells: U2OS (MSC works as positive control here).
