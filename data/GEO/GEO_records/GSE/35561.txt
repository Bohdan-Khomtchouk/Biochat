TITLE
Expression data from trisomy 21 and euploid induced pluripotent stem cell hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We modeled human Trisomy 21 primitive hematopoiesis using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  Primitive multipotent progenitor populations generated from Trisomy 21 iPSCs showed normal proliferative capacity and megakaryocyte production, enhanced erythropoiesis and reduced myeloid development compared to euploid iPSCs.

DESIGN
CD41+/235+ iPSC-derived progenitor cells were flow cytometrically sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization onto Affymetrix microarrays.
