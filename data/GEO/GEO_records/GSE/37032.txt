TITLE
Cell type-specific chromatin profiling of Drosophila neurons [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin profiling of nuclei isolated from genetically defined neuronal subpopulations of the adult Drosophila brain.

DESIGN
Cell type-specific histone modification maps were generated from nuclei isolated from all neurons (R57C10-GAL4), Kenyon cells (OK107-GAL4), and octopaminergic (Tdc2-GAL4) neurons using a method similar to INTACT (Deal and Henikoff, 2010; Steinner et al., 2012). Three histone modifications were profiled: H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3. Sequencing was performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2000.
