TITLE
microRNA profiling of lung adenocarcinomas, induced by cRaf overexpression in lung epithelium (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the expression of miRNAs in the lungs of SP-C/c-raf transgenic mice. The transgene is under the transcriptional control of the surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter and consists of the oncogenically activated NH2-terminal deletion mutant c-Raf-1-BxB. Overall this study aims at identifying miRNAs regulated in precursor lesions of lung cancer.

DESIGN
Affymetrix platform was used to analyze and compare the miRNA expression pattern in RNA extracts derived from two different conditions, i.e. lung of wild type mice and lung of SP-C/c-raf mice expressing the c-Raf-1 transgene. Each gender and condition was tested separately using 6 different individuals from each group: male and female wild type mice (M WT and F WT) and male and female transgenic mice (M c-Raf and F c-Raf).
