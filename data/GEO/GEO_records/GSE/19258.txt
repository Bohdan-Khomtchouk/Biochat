TITLE
Temperature-controlled inhibition of phyB action

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
It has been established that the frequently reported early flowering phenotype of the phyB mutant is very sensitive to small changes in ambient temperature (Halliday et al., 2003). A 6oC drop in temperature to 16oC is sufficient to abolish the pronounced early flowering phyB phenotype observed at 22oC. Using Affymetrix technology we will identify genes that are differentially regulated at 16oC and 22oC in a phyB-specific manner using phyB mutant and wild type seedlings.

DESIGN
16 samples were used in this experiment.
