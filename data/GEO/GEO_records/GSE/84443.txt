TITLE
Genome-wide screening and characterization of long non-coding RNAs involved in flowering development of citrus (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Citrus trifoliata

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of lncRNAs in citrus flowering, paired-end strand-specific RNA sequencing was performed between precocious trifoliate orange and its wild-type. Total 6,584 potential lncRNAs were identified, 51.6% of which came from intergenic regions. It was also observed that 555 lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and 276 lncRNAs were down-regulated in precocious trifoliate orange, indicating that lncRNAs could be involved in the regulation of citrus flowering.

DESIGN
Two samples, the terminal bud and the five following buds (the major node position for flower formation) from spring flushes of the MT and the WT 2-year-old trees were collected at flower initiation (after self-pruning).  And then subjected to RNA-seq.
