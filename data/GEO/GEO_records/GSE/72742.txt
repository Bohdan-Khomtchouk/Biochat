TITLE
Expression profiling of Col-0 and rps2 treated with Psm:AvrRpt2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of differential gene expression during RPS2-mediated effector-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis

DESIGN
Four-week-old leaves of Arabidopsis Col-0 wild type and rps2 mutant plant were infiltrated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Maculicola carring effector AvrRpt2 at OD 0.01. Samples were collected at 0, 6 and 10 hours after infiltration for WT plants and at 0 and 10 hours after infiltration for rps2 plants. Three biological replicates were performed per genotype per time point.
