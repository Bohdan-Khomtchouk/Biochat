TITLE
Polymorphic cis- and trans-regulation of human gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression levels of human genes vary extensive among individuals.  Gene expression determines cell function and characteristics thus this variation likely contributes to phenotypic variation.  Genetic studies have shown that there is a heritable component to gene expression variation, and have identified genomic regions that contain polymorphic regulators.  However, most of these regions are quite large, and few regulators have been identified.  In this genetic of gene expression study, we used a large sample to search the genome for polymorphic regulators that influence gene expression, and followed up the results with deep sequencing of transcriptomes and molecular analyses. Key word(s): Transcriptome Analysis

DESIGN
genetics of gene expression study, 41 Coriell cell line samples examined.
