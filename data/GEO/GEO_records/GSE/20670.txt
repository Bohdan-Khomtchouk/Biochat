TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 versus T-DNA mutant sir1-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were compared to sir1-1 T-DNA insertion mutants to investigate transcript levels of sulfur metabolism related genes under standard conditions.

DESIGN
For wildtype Col-0 and sir1-1, leaf tissue was harvested from 3 independent plants that were 7 weeks old; total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, hybridised on custom made array.
