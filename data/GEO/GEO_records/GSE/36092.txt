TITLE
Bifunctional Activity of members of the Arabidopsis NF-YA Transcription Factor Family

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Five members of the Arabidopsis thaliana NF-YA gene family are strongly induced by several stress conditions via transcriptional and miR169-related posttranscriptional mechanisms. These transcription factors participate in gene regulation via two different mechanisms, one depending on binding to the CCAAT-box in the promoter of regulated genes and the other, independent of the CCAAT-box, in which NF-YA prevents the interaction of the NF-YB/YC heterodimer with transcription factors.

DESIGN
Three biological  and two technical (in swap) replicates for each genotype were obtained for each treatment (DMSO (mock) and estradiol  24h after induction). Mock samples were pooled and used as a reference.
