TITLE
Expression data from Pax7+ satellite cell derived tumors in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse muscle stem cells, defined as Pax7+ satellite cells, can initiate rhabdomyosarcoma when transformed by oncogenic Kras and concomitant loss of p53. Mouse Pax7+ satellite cells were transformed in vitro and in vivo utilizing the Cre-ER/loxp system.

DESIGN
We wanted to address two major questions: do the in vitro and in vivo tumors cluster together compared to another mouse to another mouse derived soft-tissue sarcoma AND which human soft-tissue sarcoma do the in vivo derived tumors resemble transcriptionally?  Therefore, tumors from cells transformed in vitro and tumors from mice that restrict the oncogenic lesions to Pax7+ satellite cells in vivo were compared to answer these two questions.
