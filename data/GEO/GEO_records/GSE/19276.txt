TITLE
Osteosarcoma is characterized by impaired osteoclastogenesis and antigen presentation compared to normal bone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is characterized by reduced expression of markers of impaired osteoclastogenesis and antigen presentation compared to normal bone Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumour in children and young adults, and the second highest cause of cancer-related death in this age group. In spite of aggressive chemotherapy, disease-free survival has not improved significantly in the past 20 years, and 50% of patients subsequently develop fatal pulmonary metastasis. We have performed gene expression profiling of primary osteosarcoma biopsies and compared the results to gene expression profiling of non-malignant bone to identify differentially expressed genes unique to OS in the context of the bone micorenvironment. Keywords: Comaprison between disease status (OS) and normal; comparison between good and poor response to chemotherapy

DESIGN
Two-colour experiment. 23 samples of OS analyzed in duplicate (dye-swaps); 3 samples of good responders, 20 of poor responders analyzed in duplicate (dye-swaps); 5 samples of non-malignant bone analyzed individualy, no dye-swaps (i.e. 5 biological replicates).
