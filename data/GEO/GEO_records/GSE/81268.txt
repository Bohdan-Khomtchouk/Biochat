TITLE
Unexpected Innovative Early Diagnosis in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Premature Tooth Eruption in ADNP-Mutated Children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The discovery of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) regulated tooth eruption in mice and man, provides, for the first time, an early detection of tooth eruption, with full or almost full mouth of teeth at one year of age, as a potential biomarker for an intellectual disability (ID)/autism spectrum disorder (ASD) syndrome, toward improved translational medicine.

DESIGN
RNAseq of 4 samples, comparing three ADNP-mutated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs, derived from ADNP-mutated children) with a non-mutated cell line. No replicates were performed but results were verified usign RT-PCR.
