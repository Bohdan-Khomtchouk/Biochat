TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of the wild type strain Azoarcus sp. BH72  with that of nifLA knockout strain under nitrogen fixing condition

ORGANISM
Azoarcus sp.

SUMMARY
Azoarcus sp. BH72 is known to express nitrogenase genes endophytically in  rice seedlings in gnotobiotic culture. Availability of fixed nitrogen is one of the important signals regulating the transcription of nitrogenase genes and hence nitrogen fixing activity. NifA is the essential transcription activator of nif genes. RNA isolated from the nifA knockout mutant of strain BH72 was compared with the transcriptome of  wild type under nitrogen fixing condition using a global genome wide microarray approach and the differences in the gene expression profile were monitered.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from wild type strain BH72  and  nifLA mutant strain BHLAO  grown respectively under microaerobic nitrogen fixing condition with glutamate as poor nitrogen source  was used for two color whole genome microarray approach

PLATFORM
GPL11300 Azoarcus sp. BH72 Array
