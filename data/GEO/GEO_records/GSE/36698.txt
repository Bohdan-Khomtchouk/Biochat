TITLE
ego3-Studying the transcriptional consequences of a QTL for shoot growth (SG3, SG1). Studying the transcriptional consequences of a QTL for shoot growth under mannitol condition (EGO3).

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra09-01_qtlleafgrowth - ego3 - What are the transcriptional consequences of the allelic contrast at SG3, SG1 and EGO3 loci mapped for its effect on shoot growth and identified at the gene level - Plants were grown in the in vitro conditions with 60 mM mannitol, where we have mapped and cloned the concerned QTL which allows us to see the phenotype linked to the segregation of the natural alleles. We are comparing 2 genotypes descending from a RIL from the Cvi x Col (H1 is Col allele containing HIF, and A2 is Cvi allele containing HIF).

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - genotype comparison

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
