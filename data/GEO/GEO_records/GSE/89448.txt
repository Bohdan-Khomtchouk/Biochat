TITLE
Global reduction in H3K27me3 and DNA hypomethylation define poorly prognostic pediatric posterior fossa ependymomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subgroup of  Posterior fossa ependymomas show reduced H3K27me3, global DNA hypomethylation, are more invasive, exhibit poor prognosis and epigenetically deregulated genes converge on radial glial factors, suggesting developing cerebellar radial glia as candidate cells-of-origin.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing was performed  in 5 posterior fossa (PF) and three supratentorial (ST) ependymoma samples. All 5 PF samples show low H3K27me3 and designated PF_H3K27me3-ve; all 3 ST ependymoma samples show high H3K27me3 and desginated ST_H3K27me3+ve

PLATFORM
