TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing in the tammar wallaby unveils conserved gene expression networks underlying reproduction in therian mammals

ORGANISM
Notamacropus eugenii

SUMMARY
We characterized the transcriptome of the wallaby placenta and lactating mammary gland over the course of reproduction

DESIGN
Expression profiling of three time points in two tissue types of the wallaby placenta and three time points of lactating mammary gland tissue
