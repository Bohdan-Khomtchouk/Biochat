TITLE
Expression data from IMR90 cells expressing either E7-ca-STAT5A-shNTC vs E7-ca-STAT5a-shSOCS1 at 7 days post infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOCS1 plays a role in cellular senescence. Knocking down SOCS1 in senescence induced by the STAT5 oncogene results in senescence bypass by preventing p53 activation

DESIGN
IMR90 cells were infected with retroviral constructs of either E7 oncoprotein with pWZL ca-STAT5A and pLKO shNTC or E7 with pWZL ca-STAT5A and pLKO shSOCS1
