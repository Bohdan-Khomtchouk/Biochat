TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of RNA Pol II binding site (GM12878)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation following by high-thoughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using the GA II platform from Illumina for the human  RNA Polymerase II in GM12878 cells. We have also generated a sequenced input DNA datasets for GM12878 cells. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Map binding sites of RNA Polymerase II in the genome of GM12878 cells. The GM12878 input data has been deposited in GEO as GSM487430.

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
