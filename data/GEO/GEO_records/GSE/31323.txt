TITLE
Different expressed genes in epithelium and stromal of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes differently expressed in the epithelium and the stromal of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), we collect the epithelium and the stromal from the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia by laser micro-dissection.  And then, Affymetrix HG-U133_Plus_2 gene-chip was used to detect and compare the expression level of genes. To find which genes are most abundantly expressed in epithelium and stromal and what is the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of BPH.

DESIGN
8 prostate tissues were collected from patients undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with informed consent. Each tissue was embedded in O.C.T and subsequently used for laser micro-dissection. The total RNA was isolated from each sample and equally mixed for gene-chip assay.
