TITLE
chromosomal aberrations in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among men in the world and the pathogenesis of prostate cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, we intended to disclose chromosomal aberrations that might be involved in tumorigenesis, using cDNA microarray-based CGH technology. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
A total of 18 experiments were performed without replicates, using a kidney tissue as normal references. Prostate tumors and normal references were labeled with Cy5-dCTP and Cy3-dCTP, respectively.
