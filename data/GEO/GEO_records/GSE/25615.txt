TITLE
Murine Prostate Tissue: Rb1 null vs. Rb1 E2F binding deficient mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profilling of 60 day old prostate tissue from Rb1F/F:Trp53F/F:PB-Cre4 or Rb1R654W/F:Trp53F/F:PB-cre4 mice versus wild type prostate tissue. Profiles used to compare deregulation of known E2F target genes in prostate tissue expressing a mutant Rb1 gene to tissue lacking Rb1 expression.

DESIGN
Tissue from two Rb1F/F:Trp53F/F:PB-Cre4 (null) mice or two Rb1654/F:Trp53F/F:PB-cre4 (mutant) mice compared to a pool of tissue from 3 wild type mice using two color arrays.
