Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Distinguishing between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in hospitalized patients remains challenging. Transcriptional profiling is a promising tool for improving diagnosis in LRTI.     Methods: We performed whole blood transcriptional analysis in a cohort of 118 adult patients (median [IQR] age, 61 [50-76] years) hospitalized with bacterial, viral or viral-bacterial LRTI, and 40 age-matched healthy controls (60 [46-70] years). We applied class comparisons, modular analysis and class prediction algorithms to identify distinct biosignatures for bacterial and viral LRTI, which were validated in an independent group of patients.     Results: Patients were classified as bacterial (B, n=22), viral (V, n=71) and bacterial-viral LRTI (BV, n=25) based on comprehensive microbiologic testing. Compared with healthy controls statistical group comparisons (p < 0.01; with multiple test corrections) identified 3,376 differentially expressed genes in patients with B-LRTI; 2,391 in V-LRTI, and 2,628 in BV-LRTI. Independent of etiologic pathogen, patients with LRTI demonstrated overexpression of innate immunity and underexpression of adaptive immunity genes. Patients with B-LRTI showed significant overexpression of inflammation (B > BV > V) and neutrophils (B > BV > V) while those with V-LRTI displayed significantly greater overexpression of interferon genes (V > BV > B). The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that discriminated patients with bacterial vs viral LRTI with 97% [95%CI: 84-100] sensitivity and 92% [77-98] specificity. In comparison, procalcitonin classified bacterial vs viral LRTI with 38% [18-62] sensitivity and 91% [76-98] specificity.      Conclusions: Transcriptional profiling can be used as a helpful tool for the diagnosis of adults hospitalized with LRTI.
