TITLE
[E-MTAB-345] ChIP-Seq of human MCF-7 cells with anti-ERalpha following estrogen treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with overnight with antibodies against the C-terminus (HC-20, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Europe) or the N-terminus (anti-Estrogen Receptor 18-32, from SigmaAldrich, Italy) of human ER-alpha with or without estrogen treatment for 45 minutes on TAP-ER-beta cells, and the immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced with the Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer.
