TITLE
Gene expression from human B-lymphocytes (P493-6)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
P493-6 contain a tet repressible MYC contruct.  In the presense of tetracycline, MYC levels are great reduced and the cells cease to cycle.  Gene expression was compared between high and low MYC expressing cells

DESIGN
P493-6 cells were grown in both the presence and absence of tetracycline.  RNA was extracted and gene expression analysis was performed using exon arrays
