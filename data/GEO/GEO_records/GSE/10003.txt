TITLE
Gene expression profile of H187-63AR, an ABT-737 resistant derivative of H187

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ABT-737 is a highly potent small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 which has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies.  To identify factors which mediate ABT-737 sensitivity we created an ABT-737-resistant cell line derivative. This cell lines maintained its ABT-737 resistance in vitro and in vivo.  We isolated RNA from H187-63AR xenografts and compared their global gene expression to H187 xenografts. Keywords: Tumor comparison

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of H187 and H187-63AR derivative tumors were compared. Two tumors from each group were compared. The raw data file (21208_Hann_nonorm_nobkgd_GEOarchive_Matrix.txt) contains the following: 1688628038_B - H187 Control 1 (57) 1688628038_C - H187 Control 2 (58) 1688628038_E - H187-63AR 1 (513) 1688628038_H - H187-63AR 1 (565)
