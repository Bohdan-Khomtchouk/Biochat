TITLE
Human inflammatory dendritic cells induce Th17 differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of five population of Antigen Presenting Cells: inflammatory macrophages, Inflammatory dendritic cells, Cd14+CD16- monocytes, CD14 dim Cd16+ monocytes and BDCA1+ Dendritic cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed transcriptomic profiles from 5 differents DC populations: inflammatory DC  and macrophages form inflammatory ascites (ovarian cancer, 4 different donors); CD14+CD16- monocytes, CD14dim CD16+ monocytes and BDCA1+ DC (from 3 different healthy donors) using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST platform.
