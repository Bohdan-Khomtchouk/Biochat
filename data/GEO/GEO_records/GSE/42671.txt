TITLE
F1 Interspecies Hybrid Analysis Reveals Parent-Of-Origin Bias in the Mouse Placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the epigenetic landscape at the interface between mother and fetus, we provide a comprehensive analysis of parent of origin bias in the placenta.  Using F1 interspecies hybrids, we sequenced RNA from 23 individual midgestation placentas, five late stage placentas, and two yolk sac samples and then used SNPs to determine whether transcripts were preferentially generated from the maternal or paternal allele.  In the placenta, we find 103 genes that show significant and reproducible parent-of-origin bias, of which 78 are novel candidates. Most (96%) show a strong maternal bias which, using multiple models, we demonstrate is not due to maternal decidual contamination.  Analysis of the X chromosome also reveals paternal expression of Xist and several genes that escape inactivation, most significantly Rps4x, Fhl1, and Slc38a5. Finally, sequencing individual placentas allowed us to reveal notable expression similarity between littermates.  In all, we observe a striking preference for maternal transcription in the midgestation mouse placenta and a dynamic imprinting landscape in extraembryonic tissues, reflecting the complex nature of epigenetic pathways in the placenta.
