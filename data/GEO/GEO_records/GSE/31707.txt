TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in Spontaneous Corneal Degeneration in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
When recruiting Balb/c mice for projects concerning corneas, we found that some mice presented corneal abnormality mimicking human corneal degenerations. The mice were unilaterally or bilaterally affected. The corneas of unilaterally affected mice were collected and pooled respectively into Normal and Degenerative samples. RNA was prepared and subjected to dual-labeling microarray analysis using the Capital Bio work station.

DESIGN
Spontaneously degenerative corneas vs nomal corneas from same unilaterally affected mice. Dye swap was applied to reduce systemic error.
