TITLE
Microarray expression analysis of PRF1 (perforin 1) haplotypes in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A genetic study of the PRF1 gene has shown association of several polymorphisms with multiple sclerosis (MS). Haplotype analysis identified risk haplotypes strongly associated with male patients having the primary-progressive form of MS (PPMS). Gene expression microarrays were performed in 10 male PPMS patients carrying the risk (n=6) and protective haplotypes (n=4) in order to identify pathways associated with the risk haplotypes. Pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of the cell killing gene ontology category among down-regulated genes in patients carrying risk haplotypes compared with patients carrying protective haplotypes.

DESIGN
Number of samples analyzed: 10 Protective haplotype samples: UOM982, EMA1473, MMC-998, CDP1842 Risk haplotype samples: UUS1554, RAU1550, RPS1011, AGS1013, PFB1530, MGA1014
