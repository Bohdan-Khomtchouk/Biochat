TITLE
RAMPAGE from SK-N-DZ (ENCSR479BMI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from nuclear fractions of a neuroblastoma immortalized cell line SK-N-DZ derived from a metastatic site in the bone marrow of a 2 year old female. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RAMPAGE libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
