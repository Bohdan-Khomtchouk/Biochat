TITLE
Small molecule activation of PKM in cancer cells induces serine auxotrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proliferating tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to support their high metabolic demands.  Paradoxically, increased glycolysis is often accompanied by expression of the lower activity PKM isoform, effectively constraining lower glycolysis.  Here, we report the discovery of novel PKM activators with a unique allosteric binding mode.  Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism.  PKM activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the non-essential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation.  Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters.  These data support the hypothesis that PKM expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells that allows adaptation to nutrient stress.

DESIGN
A549 cancer cells were treated with compound-16 for up to 24 hours in the presence and absence of serine in the media.
