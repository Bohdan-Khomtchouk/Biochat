TITLE
PTH and PTHrP treatment of primary adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) are involved in cachexia associated with chronic kidney disease and cancer respectively. Tumor-derived PTHrP triggers adipose tissue browning and thereby leads to wasting of fat tissue in tumor-bearing mice. Similarly, elevated in 5/6 nephrectomized mice, PTH stimulates adipose tissue browning and wasting. Mice lacking the PTH/PTHrP receptor in their fat tissue are resistant to wasting of both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Therefore, the PTH/PTHrP signaling in adipocytes should activate various pathways that contribute to hypermetabolism and muscle wasting.

DESIGN
Inguinal stroma-vascular fractions were cultured and differentiated into primary adipocytes. 8 days after differentiation, cells were treated with PTH(1-34) or PTHrP(1-34) (100 ng/ml each) for 4 hours.
