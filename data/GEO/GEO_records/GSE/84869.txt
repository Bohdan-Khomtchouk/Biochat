TITLE
H3K36me2 occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing from control and WHSC1 knockdown PC3 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WHSC1 catalyzes dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3, which is profoundly upregulated in prostate cancer patients especially in metastatic PCa patients. We conduct ChIP sequencing in chromatin landscape induced by WHSC1 depleted in prostate cancer cell PC3 to understand the H3K36me2 genome-wide alterations.

DESIGN
Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was used to knockdown WHSC1 expression in prostate cancer cell line PC3. The chromatin was prepared and followed by ChIP-Seq analysis by Active Motif, Inc. using the antibody against H3K36me2 (Millipore).

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
