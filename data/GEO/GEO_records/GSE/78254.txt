TITLE
Deciphering transcriptome profiles of porcine PBMCs in response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In vivo microarray study of global gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of German Landrace pigs during the innate immune response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccination.

DESIGN
PBMCs samples collected at four time points (0, 6, 24 and 72 hpv) from PRRSV vaccinated and three time points (6, 24 and 72 hpv) from unvaccinated pigs were subjected hybridization of 21 arrays. Samples from each  time points were hybridized with three biological replications. To characterize the gene expression changes, we compared the PBMCs transcriptome profiles in two phenotypic dimensions. I. Between vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs (6 hpv_vaccinated vs. 6 hpv_unvaccinated and 24 hpv_vaccinated vs. 24 hpv_unvaccinated). II. Within the vaccinated group between before (0h- control) and the three post vaccination time points (6, 24 and 72 hpv).
