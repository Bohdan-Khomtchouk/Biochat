TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis between Miltefosine resistant and sensitive leishmania donovani

ORGANISM
Leishmania donovani

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was carried out between experimental miltefosine resistant L.donovani (adapted to 30ug/ml miltefosine drug pressure) and its corresponding wild type miltefosine senstive parasite

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of lab generated miltefosine resistant Leishmania donovani (K417 M30) were compared with corresponding wild type sensitive parasite (K417WT)

PLATFORM
GPL13919 Agilent-027511 Leishmania [ORF-centered version]
