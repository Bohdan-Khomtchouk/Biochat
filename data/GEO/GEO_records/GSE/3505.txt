TITLE
Mutational state FLT3-ITD and GATA2 overexpression could define a subgroup of AML-M1 patients with normal karyotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
More than 40% of patients with AML have a normal karyotype and are included in the intermediate prognostic group, in which risk classification is currently poor defined and more molecular markers are needed to achieve treatment stratification. EVI1 overexpression (OE) has been reported to discriminate in this group those with a worse prognosis. The EVI1 mice homolog has a role in the HSC proliferation through Gata2 expression, therefore, GATA2, a transcription factor with a relevant role in hematopoiesis, could be a candidate gene in the leukemogenic transformation in AML in patients with normal karyotype, and in other subgroups. GATA2 OE was detected in 46% of cases with normal karyotype, and was more frequent among samples with FLT3-ITD (p=0.0021), especially among the AML-M1 cases. We found a mutational pattern FLT3-ITD/GATA2-OE/WT1-OE that could define a subgroup of patients with normal karyotype and AML-M1, with a different gene expression array pattern and a poor prognosis. Our results show that GATA2 OE is a common event in AML cases with normal karyotype (46%). The deregulation of the expression of the GATA2 transcription factor would lead to a hematopoietic differentiation impairs, focusing GATA2 as a candidate gene that fits in the cooperating model for the multistep pathogenesis that causes AML transformation.

DESIGN
Nine slides were hybridized, one for each patient, being three patients per group. Each patient sample is labeled with cy5 and the reference sample, the same for all slides, is a pool of nine bone marrows from healthy patients, labeled with cy3.
