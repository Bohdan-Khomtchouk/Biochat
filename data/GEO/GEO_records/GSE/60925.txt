TITLE
Access to follicular dendritic cells is a pivotal step in murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cell activation and proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis B cell antigen receptor signaling seems important for leukemia B cell ontogeny, whereas the microenvironment influences B cell activation, tumor cell lodging and provision of antigenic stimuli. Using the murine Eμ-Tcl1 CLL model, we demonstrate that CXCR5-controlled access to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) confers proliferative stimuli to leukemia B cells. Intravital imaging revealed a marginal zone B cell-like leukemia cell trafficking route. Murine and human CLL cells reciprocally stimulated resident mesenchymal stromal cells through lymphotoxin-β-receptor activation, resulting in CXCL13 secretion and stromal compartment remodeling. Inhibition of lymphotoxin/lymphotoxin-β-receptor signaling or of CXCR5 signaling retards leukemia progression. Thus, CXCR5 activity links tumor cell homing, shaping a survival niche, and access to localized proliferation stimuli.

DESIGN
This GEO dataset is comprised of GEP measurements for EµTCL mouse CD5+CD19+ tumor cells and healthy WT controls, including healthy MZB cells and B1 cells. 6 measurements are for WT EµTCL1 mice, 5 for the CXCR5-KO EµTCL1 genotype. MZB and B1 cells were pooled from 15 animals. WT reference was obtained from 5 WT animals
