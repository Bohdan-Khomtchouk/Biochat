TITLE
Identification of mRNAs modulated by knockdown of CD24

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We endeavored to identify factors and pathways regulated by CD24 and to obtain leads regarding the mechanism by which CD24 inhibited the invasiveness and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells by performing cDNA microarray analysis on S2-013 CD24 RNAi clones and control clones. The group of genes showing increased expression was mainly comprised of genes for molecules with functions related to RNA metabolism, transcription factors, proteases, and molecules involved in embryonic development and cell growth. The set of genes downregulated by knockdown of CD24 included the target mRNAs of a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease G3BP that interacted with CD24. The target mRNAs of G3BP were identified in GSE17056. These results suggested that CD24 inhibited the RNase activity of G3BP, and that a function of CD24 was to inhibit the degradation of specific mRNAs.

DESIGN
Transcripts upregulated or downregulated by knockdown of CD24 were identified through expression profiling of a total of 12,135 genes in S2-013 CD24 RNAi clones compared to control clones. Before labeling with Cy5 or Cy3, total RNA from two S2-013 CD24 RNAi clones were mixed and total RNA from two control clones were mixed. The supplementary files 'GSE17055_higher_siCD24.txt' and 'GSE17055_higher_control.txt' list the differentially expressed genes.
