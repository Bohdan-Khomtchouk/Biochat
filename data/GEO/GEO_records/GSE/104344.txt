TITLE
FoxP3 scanning mutagenesis reveals functional variegation and mild mutations with atypical autoimmune phenotypes [nanostring]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nanostring profiles of CD4+ T cells transduced with EV, WT or FoxP3 mutants

DESIGN
DAPI-CD4+THY1.1high T cells were double sorted after 3 days of retroviral infection. Total RNA was prepared using RLT buffer followed by NanoString nCounter assay system manual

PLATFORM
GPL24057 Nanostring nCounter Treg Custom CodeSet
