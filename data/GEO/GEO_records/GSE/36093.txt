TITLE
Expression data from infected (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (P10)) leaf in japonica rice (cv. Y73)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Previously, we successfully introduce the bacterial blight resistance trait from Oryza meyeriana into O. sativa using asymmetric somatic hybridization with O. meyeriana as the donor species. After years of breeding, a progeny named Y73 was generated with recurrent parent O. sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Dalixiang, and it shows high resistance to broad-spectrum of bacterial blight pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo). However, the resistance mechanism of Y73 is remain undiscovered. To provide insights into the high resistance phenotype of these plants, we examined the transcriptome response in leaves of Y73 to the bacterial blight infection in this study. Xoo inoculated and mock inoculated rice plants were grown in growth room and the global analysis of gene expression events in rice leaves at 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) were analyzed using Affymetrix Rice GeneChip microarrays. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Xoo infection in rice Y73.

DESIGN
To find out pathways and genes involved in its high and board-spectrum resistance, microanalysis were carried out on Y73 after Xoo infection at 24 hours post inoculation (hpi). Three independant replicates were perfomed for each treatments.
