TITLE
Affymetrix expression data from colon cancer patient tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of 111 colon tissues from tumors and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Genotypes for the rs5995355 in NCF4 are included to identify genes whose expression are associated with this genotype.

DESIGN
RNA from fresh frozen colon tissues were extracted using Trizol and hybridized to Affymetrix U113A arrays
