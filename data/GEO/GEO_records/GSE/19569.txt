TITLE
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and GCR2 deletion strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and GCR2 deletion strain. Impact of the transcription factor Gcr2p on mRNA expression was investigated in the corresponding deletion strain in exponentially growing glucose minimal medium batch cultures.

DESIGN
Both streins were grown on glucose minimal medium and harvested during exponential growth for transcript analysis
