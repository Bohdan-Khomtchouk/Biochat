TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profiling of rice Zhonghua11 and ila1 lamina joint

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The leaf lamina joint joins the rice leaf blade and sheath, contributing significantly to the leaf angle trait. A more erect leaf facilitates the penetration of sunlight, enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and occupying less space in dense planting. Genetic screening found a mutant increased leaf angle1, ila1 from rice T-DNA insertional mutants library. We used microarrays to detail the transcriptional profile changes in the mutant ila1 lamina joint.
