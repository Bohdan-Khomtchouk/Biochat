TITLE
Characterization of the gene expression changes associated with melanoma-endothelial cell communication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Average life expectancy for patients with metastatic melanoma is less than 6 months, and only a handful of treatment options are available. If the disease can be stopped before it spreads to other organs, life expectancy is greatly increased. The goal of this project is to identify possible regulators of melanoma metastasis by determining genes whose expression is modulated when the cells are grown in contact with endothelial cells. Identification of genes involved in this cell-cell communication could have therapeutic implications. Keywords: co-culture

DESIGN
Using a lentiviral system, melanoma cell line 1205Lu was transduced with GFP, and HUVEC (human umbillical vein endothelial cells) cells at passage 2 were transduced with RFP. These labeled cells were plated at near confluency either alone (controls) or mixed at a 1:1 ratio (co-cultures) for 48 hours in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Cambrex). The labeled cells were then sorted by FACS and RNA was collected from all 4 cultures. There are a total of four samples: GFP-1205Lu cells grown alone, GFP-1205Lu cells separated from co-culture with RFP-HUVEC cells, RFP-HUVEC cells grown alone, and RFP-HUVEC cells separated from co-culture with GFP-1205Lu cells. The JHMI Microarray Core was responsible for sample processing and initial data processing using Affymetrix-recommended protocols (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2004).
