TITLE
Characterisation of Modular Reponse of non-pathogenic E.coli K12 MG1655 Response to acid adaptation, part A

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
To study the dynamics of acid adaptation in E.coli at pH5.5 as opposed to that at pH7, samples were collected from a steady-state system for transcriptomics. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Single channel hybridisation were carried out using cy5 dye. Samples were collected from steady state system at pH7 and pH5.5 for 1hr every 5min.

PLATFORM
GPL7535 UBEC Operon Array Ready E. coli Oligonucleotide set 1.0 [Oligo ID version]
