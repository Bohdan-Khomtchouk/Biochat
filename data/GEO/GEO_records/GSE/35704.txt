TITLE
Whole Transcriptome RNA-seq Analysis: the Tumorigenesis and Metastasis of Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the tumorigenesis and metastasis of human metastatic melanoma(MM) , we analyzed the transcriptomes of three cell lines that represent the three distinct stages of MM pathogenesis: the normal stage (HEMn), the onset of MM (A375), and the metastasis stage (A2085). Using the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we detected unsymmetrical expression of genes particularly in Chr9, 12, and 14 among three cell lines, an indication of the involvement of these genes in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of MM. These genes were assigned into 41 categories by their expression patterns and their biological functions were subsequently analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. In the top category associated with cancer, HIF1A, IL8, TERT, ONECUT1 and FOXA1 had direct interaction with the transcription factors or cytokines known to be involved in the tumorigenesis or metastasis in other malignant tumors. Our findings suggest that pathway about cytokines regulation in macrophages may play a more prominent role in the pathogenesis of MM. This study provides not only new targets for downstream mechanistic studies in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of MM, but also a new strategy to study the progression of other malignant cancers.

DESIGN
