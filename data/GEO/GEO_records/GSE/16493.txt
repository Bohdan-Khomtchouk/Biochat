TITLE
Preadaptation of Yersinia pestis to resist mammalian innate immunity during transit through the flea vector

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, is transmitted to mammals by infected fleas. Y. pestis exhibits a distinct life stage in the flea, where it grows in the form of a cohesive biofilm that promotes transmission. After transmission, the temperature shift to 37Â°C induces many known virulence factors of Y. pestis that confer resistance to innate immunity. These factors are not produced in the low-temperature environment of the flea, however, suggesting that Y. pestis is vulnerable to the initial encounter with innate immune cells at the flea bite site. In this study, we used whole-genome microarrays to compare the Y. pestis in vivo transcriptome in infective fleas to in vitro transcriptomes in temperature-matched biofilm and planktonic cultures, and to the previously characterized in vivo gene expression profile in the rat bubo. In addition to genes involved in metabolic adaptation to the flea gut and biofilm formation, several genes with known or predicted roles in resistance to innate immunity and pathogenicity in the mammal were upregulated in the flea. Y. pestis from infected fleas were more resistant to phagocytosis than in vitro-grown bacteria, which was largely attributable to a cluster of insecticidal-like toxin genes that were highly expressed only in the flea. Our results indicate that cycling through the flea vector preadapts Y. pestis to face the mammalian innate immune response that it encounters immediately after transmission.
