TITLE
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 Induces Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition via Activation of NF-ÎºB Pathway in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IGFBP2 has been shown to act as an oncogene augmenting tumor progression in a number of malignancies. We sought to investigate role of IGFBP2 and its related pathways in PDAC. Gene expression profiling  were used to reveal the key signaling pathways.  Microarray experiments in IGFBP2-overexpressing AsPc-1 cells were carried out.Transcriptional profiling of human pancreatic cancer cells AsPc-1 comparing empty vector transfected control  AsPc-1 cells with AsPc-1 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-IGFBP2.

DESIGN
We performed cDNA microarray analysis to compare IGFBP2 stably expressing cell line originating from AsPc-1 with empty vector control cells. AsPC-1 clones transfected with empty vector were placed in the reference channel in hybridization.
