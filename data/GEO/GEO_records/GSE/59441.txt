TITLE
Expression profile for BW25113 Î”mqsRA with deoxycholate stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
MqsR/MqsA is a well-characterized toxin/antitoxin system with several regulatory roles. Deletion of mqsRA reduced growth with deoxycholate stress.  Here we performed a microarray to determine the expression profile with and without mqsRA under deoxycholate stress to determine transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Escherichia coli K-12 BW25113 with and without mqsRA was exposed to deoxycholate stress.
