TITLE
P. aeruginosa PA14-WT vs pyrF mutant vs pyrF mutant w/uracil

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptome analyses of P. aeruginosa PA14 pyrF mutant with PA14 wild type, and with PA14 pyrF mutant with 1 mM uracil supplement and PA14 wild type with 10 mM uracil in biofilm cells. All samples were cultured in LB with glass wool at 37C for 7h. Keywords: Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm pyrF uracil
