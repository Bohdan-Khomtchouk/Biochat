TITLE
Transcriptome of rice seedling and callus based on RNA-seq method

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To support our research of epigenomics in rice genome, we conducted massively parallel pyrosequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) using rice seedling and callus tissues. We obtained a total of 40.1 M reads from seedling and 29.6 M reads from callus.The RNA-seq data derived from the replicates showed high correlations (Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient, SC, 0.96 for seedling, 0.88 for callus). Our RNAseq data derived from the seedling also showed a high correlation with the recently published rice RNA-seq data that was also from two-week old seeding tissue (Lu et al., 2010, PMID: 20627892) (SC=0.87).

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of each tissue was applied in RNA-seq. Each biological replicate was sequenced twice in separate lane.
