TITLE
Epididymal Adipose Tissue Profiling In HMDP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes in the epididymal adipose tissue whose expression is under genetic regulation in the hybrid mouse diversity panel.  The hybrid mouse diversity panel is comprised of classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild type mice.  The RMA values of genes were used for genome wide association as described in Bennett et al Genome Research 2010.  These data are used to identify candidate genes at loci associated with obesity and dietary responsiveness.

DESIGN
GWAS for expression of epididymal adipose tissue in inbred strains

PLATFORM
GPL8759 [HT_MG-430A] Affymetrix HT Mouse Genome 430A Array
