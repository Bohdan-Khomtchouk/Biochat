TITLE
Yeast cells: Mutant M1 vs. the control with and without oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription profiles of mutant M1 and the control in the absence/presence of 4mM H2O2 M1 is a mutated  Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. It was obtained through transcriptional engineering of general transcription factor TFIIB. Encoded by SUA7, TFIIB is reported to regulate the expression of over 730 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. M1 showed significant growth improvement compared with the control when challenged with 4mM H2O2. It also had resistance towards high osmotic pressure (1.5M NaCl).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment (no stress and 4mM H2O2 stress): M1 vs the control. Two biological replicates for M1 and the control under each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL16244 Agilent-016322 Yeast (V2) Gene Expression 8x15K Microarray (Probe Name version)
