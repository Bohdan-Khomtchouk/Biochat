TITLE
Knockdown of EI24 in ZR-75-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of ZR-75-1 cells folowing knockdown of EI24 (P53-Induced Gene 8) and control vector. As a p53 response gene, EI24 is known to controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and autophagy. Results provide insight into the role of EI24 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal

DESIGN
Parental ZR-75-1 cells, ZR-75-1 cells with shGFP knockdown (control), Two independent clone of knockdown of EI24 in ZR-75-1. All samples are perfomed in duplicate. Total 8 samples exist.

PLATFORM
