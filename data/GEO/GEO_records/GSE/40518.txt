TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in Arabidopsis trichome between gtl1-1 mutant and wild type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Total RNA from trichomes of fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutants (Figure 3B) were extracted. We found a total number of 1,759 genes, corresponding to 1,694 probes on the ATH1 chip, that show differential expression of at least 1.3-fold. Out of these 1,694 genes, 47.2% are positively regulated and 52.8% are negatively regulated by GTL1.

DESIGN
Compared gene expressions in fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutants
