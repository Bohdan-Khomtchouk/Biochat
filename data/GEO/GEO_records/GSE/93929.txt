TITLE
Altered expression of long noncoding RNAs in LNCaP castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that arise after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy is a leading cause of deaths in prostate cancer patients.However, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as crucial regulators in a lot of human cancers, yet their potential roles and molecular mechanisms in CRPC are poorly understood.The goal of this study is to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in LNCaP cells and its two castration resistant sublines. Our study reveals that deregulation of lncRNAs is involved in the initiation and progression of CRPC.

DESIGN
We constructed two LNCaP castration resistant sublines.On one hand, we generated LNCaP-Bic by continuously exposed to bicalutmide for more than 12 months.On the other hand, LNCaP-AI was established by sustained passaging in cultural medium supplied with androgen deprived serum. The RNA of the cells was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We indentified the differentially expressed lncRNAs in LNCaP-Bic and LNCaP-AI cells, as compared with LNCaP. We futher validated the data of microarray by RT-qPCR.
