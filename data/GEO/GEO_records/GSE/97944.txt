TITLE
E. coli evolution to alternating substrate conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli was evolved under growth conditions in which the carbon substrate alternated between glucose and either glycerol, xylose, or acetate with every tube of growth. Controls were also evolved to each substrate individually, without switching.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of wild-type and evolved strains grown on M9 minimal medium with either glucose, glycerol, xylose, or acetate as the sole carbon source.
