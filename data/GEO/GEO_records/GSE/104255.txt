TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in broiler chicken hypothalamus and pitutary during ontogenesis

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 16 hypothalamus (3-week-old= 8 and 6-week old=8) and 16 pitutary (3-week-old= 8 and 6-week old=8) of Ross308 fast growing-chicken line. In which groups were chickens characterized with high growth rate (n=4) and low growt rate (n=4). The cockerels were reared in a deep-litter facility in experimental farm of the National Research Institute of Animal Production located in Aleksandrowice till 22 or 42 days of age, under the same, optimal, electronically controlled environmental conditions (temperature, lighting regime, air humidity) and were fed ad libitum with the same complete starter (1-21 days of age), grower (22-35 days of age) and finisher (36-42 days of age) diets containing 22, 20.5 and 20.5% crude protein and 2990, 3130 and 3130 kcal/kg metabolic energy.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels between chicken groups differing in age and growth rate. The study was supported by statutory activity of National Research Institute of Animal Production (no. 01-013.1) and National Multidisciplinary Laboratory of Functional Nanomaterials NanoFun nr POIG.02.02.00-00-025/09 (Innovative Economy Operational Programme, Priority Axis 2: R & D Infrastructure, Action 2.2: Support of Formation of Common Research Infrastructure of Scientific Units

PLATFORM
