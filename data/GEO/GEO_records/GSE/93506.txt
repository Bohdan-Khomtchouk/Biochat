TITLE
Coordinated regulation of acid resistance in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We report regulatory interactions on four E. coli transcription factors in relation to the acid resistance systems by using a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and total RNA extraction on WT strains cloned with inducible TFs in E. coli K-12 MG1655. Sequences were generated with an Illumina GAIIx

PLATFORM
GPL16227 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Escherichia coli K-12)
