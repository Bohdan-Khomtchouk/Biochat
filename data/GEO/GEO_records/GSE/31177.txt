TITLE
Effect of anti-miR-33 treatment on gene expression in non-human primate liver

ORGANISM
Chlorocebus aethiops

SUMMARY
In this study the effect of anti-miR-33 treatment on plasma and liver lipid profiles was examined in non-human primates.  A significant increase in plasma HDL-C, and a significant decrease in plasma triglyceride levels were observed.

DESIGN
African green monkeys on a Normal chow diet were treated with anti-miR-33 or control anti-miR for 4 weeks and were then switched to a High Carb/Med. Cholesterol diet and treated with anti-miR-33 or control anti-miR for 8 more weeks (n=6/group).  Gene expression profiling was performed on liver biopsies obtained at -5 weeks (baseline),  4 weeks and 12 weeks.
