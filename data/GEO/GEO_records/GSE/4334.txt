DNaseI/Array GM06990

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to map DNaseI sensitivity and DNaseI hypersensitive sites over the ENCODE regions in human lymphoblastoid cells (GM06990, Coriell). Keywords: DNase/Array

DESIGN
DNA fragments released from DNaseI cut sites in nuclear chromatin were collected and hybridized to the Nimblegen ENCODE array.  DNaseI-fragmented naked DNA was used as a control.
