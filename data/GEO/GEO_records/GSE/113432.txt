TITLE
MeDIP-chip result of 10 lung cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared with non-cancerous lung tissues, lung cancer in Xuanwei tissues expressed a total of 6,899 differentially methylated regions, including 5,788 hypermethylated regions and 1,111 hypomethylated regions. Many differentially methylated regions have been found in lung cancer in Xuanwei.

DESIGN
Differentially methylated regions were detected on 10 paired lung cancer in Xuanwei tissues and non-cancerous lung tissues by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation combined with microarray. For genome-wide methylation detection, equal quantities of gDNA from lung cancer or non-cancerous specimens from 10 patients were pooled respectively.
