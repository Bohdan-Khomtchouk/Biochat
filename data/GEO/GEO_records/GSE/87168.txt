TITLE
Global transcriptional response in Japanese medaka larvae following embryonic exposure to TCDD

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
A global RNA-Seq analysis was conducted using RNA isolated from the axial region of DMSO- and 0.3 nM TCDD-exposed medaka to identify targets within the osteochondral pathway potentially impacted by TCDD exposure.  In total, 597 genes were significantly up- or down-regulated (q < 0.05) and were associated with select pathological states including inflammatory disease, connective tissue disorders, and skeletal and muscular disorders.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from axial tissue (containing vertebrae and surrounding muscle, fat, and dermis) from Japanese medaka larvae. Whole transcriptome libraries from DMSO and TCDD-medaka were generated for downstream RNA-Seq using the Ion Torrent PGM platform.
