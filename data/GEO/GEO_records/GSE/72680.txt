TITLE
DNA Methylation of African Americans from the Grady Trauma Project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Childhood and cumulative exposure to trauma increases an individual's lifetime risk for psychiatric and stress-related disorders.  This study evaluates DNA methylation in whole blood from African American participants, with the goal of identifying associaitons between peripheral DNA methylation and psychiatric symptoms.

DESIGN
DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood from participants of the Grady Trauma Project.  Blood was collected in EDTA vacuum tubes prior to extraction.  DNA methylation was interrogated for each sample using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina).
