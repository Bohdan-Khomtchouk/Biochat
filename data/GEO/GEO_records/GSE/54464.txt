TITLE
All-trans retinoic acid effect on the squamous cell carcinoma cell line ME180: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects, particularly in the context of cancer.  However, the effects of ATRA on gene and microRNA expression in solid tumors have not been investigated.  In this study, we performed gene expression and microRNA analysis of the squamous cell carcinoma cell line, ME180, following treatment with 10 micromolar all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 1, 3, and 6 hours.  Results provide insight into the temporal regulation of genes and microRNAs by retinoids.
