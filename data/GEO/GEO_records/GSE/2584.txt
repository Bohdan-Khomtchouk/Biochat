TITLE
Gene expression patterns induced by 5-Fluorouracil in breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have compared the changes in cell cycle and cell death parameters induced by 2 different concentrations of 5-FU (IC50 and IC80) in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7. G1/S cell cycle arrest was associated with both concentrations, whereas cell death was mainly induced after IC80 5-FU. These changes were correlated with gene expression assessed by cDNA microarray analysis. Main findings included an overexpression of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis (CDKN1A/p21, TP53INP, TNFRSF6/FAS and BBC3/PUMA), and significant repression of Myc. High dose 5-FU also induced a higher regulation of the mitochondrial death genes APAF1, BAK1 and BCL2, and induction of genes of the ID family. Keywords: Dose Response
