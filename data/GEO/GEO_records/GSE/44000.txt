TITLE
Transcriptome profile of subcutaneous adipocytes isolated from obese vs. lean postmenopausal women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipocytes isolated from lean and obese postmenopausal women with no significant differences in metabolic syndrome parameters demonstrate changes in multiple inflammatory, metabolic and structural gene families.

DESIGN
Purified adipocyte samples were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue surgical biopsies of 7 obese (BMI > 30) and 7 lean (BMI < 25) postmenoposal women and gene expression was quantified with Agilent-014850, 4X44K human whole genome platform arrays (GPL6480)
