TITLE
Barley drought stress

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
In this study we used the Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip to investigate transcriptome responses of barley cv. Morex to drought over 21 days based on five triplicated stress treatments and a wide range of soil water content treatments. Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
Three control were collected at 91% SWC. Five soil water content conditions (SWC) were examined (approximately 68% SWC, 38% SWC,  20% SWC, 11% SWC and 9% SWC) and three samples were analysed for each of these.

PLATFORM
GPL1340 [Barley1] Affymetrix Barley Genome Array
