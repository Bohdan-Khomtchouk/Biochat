TITLE
Formaldehyde-induced changes in microRNA signaling [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In addition to gaining knowledge on in vivo miRNA responses to formaldehyde, we set out to relate these miRNA responses to transcriptional profiles modified by formaldehyde. Rats were exposed by inhalation to either 0 or 2 ppm formaldehyde (6 hours/day) for 28 days. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles and associated signaling pathways were assessed within the nasal respiratory mucosa and circulating mononuclear white blood cells (WBC).

DESIGN
Male Fischer rats received nose-only inhalation exposures of 2 ppm formaldehyde for 7 days or 28 days (6 hours/day). Control (unexposed) rats were placed in nose-only exposure tubes containing room air for the same duration. After the last exposure period, animals were euthanized. RNA were assessed from sampes collected from the nasal epithelium and circulating white blood cells. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles were evaluated using microarrays.
