TITLE
ROS homeostasis and pimaricin production in Streptomyces natalensis ATCC 27448

ORGANISM
Streptomyces natalensis ATCC 27448

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to unveil the molecular mechanisms by which Streptomyces respond to a ROS intracellular imbalance and the effect of such response on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The study was focused on the industrial actinomycete S. natalensis ATCC 27448 producer of the polyene pimaricin - an antifungal agent widely used in the food industry and promising for antiviral activity and stimulation of immune response.

DESIGN
Two-color microarray with common reference. The transcriptomes of S. natalensis ATCC 27448 (wild-type), S. natalensis CAM.02 (DsodF) and S. natalensis CAM.04 (DahpCD) were compared. Two time points were included: late exponential (T1) and early stationay (T2) phase. Biological triplicates were performed for each strain/time point. Genomic DNA of S. natalensis ATCC 27448 was used as common reference.
