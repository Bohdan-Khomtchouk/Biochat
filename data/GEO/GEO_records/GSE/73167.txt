TITLE
Alectinib-resistant NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK cells: Parental vs. Alectinib-resistant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK comparing parental H2228 cells with alectinib resistant H2228 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, H2228 vs. H2228/CHR cells. Biological replicates: 1 parental replicates, 3 alectinib-resistant replicates.
