TITLE
Mouse tissue-resident macrophage expression profiles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show that macrophages from murine spleen, liver and peritoneum display dramatically different expression profiles. Clusters of genes were found to represent unique biological functions related to adhesion, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, lipid metabolism and signal transduction. Some gene families, such as integrins, are differentially expressed among the macrophages resident in different tissues, suggesting that the tissue of residence influences their biological function.

DESIGN
18 FACS sorted mouse tissue-resident macrophge samples. 6 cell types, 3 biological replicates per cell type.
