TITLE
Expression data from HEK293 Flp-In cells constitutivly expressing FLAG-HA-tagged TRIM71 and that of the parental cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify mammalian TRIM71 as repressor of mRNAs that inhibits translation and affects mRNA stability. In this data set we compare the expression profile of human HEK293 Flp-In cells stably expressing TRIM71 to that of the parental cells, not expressing TRIM71 protein.

DESIGN
Experiment was performed in triplicate.
