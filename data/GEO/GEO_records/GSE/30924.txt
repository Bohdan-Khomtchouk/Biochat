TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium: wild type vs. ∆scsA mutant

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of log and stationary phases of S. Typhimurium, comparing wild type with the ∆scsA strain.

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. Triplicate arrays were carried out for each of the 4 conditions: wild type log phase, wild type stationary phase, ∆scsA log phase and ∆scsA stationary phase.
