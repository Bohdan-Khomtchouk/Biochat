TITLE
Monitoring the ethanol stress response of a sigZ deletion strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579.

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
The stress response of as sigZ deletion strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579 is monitored true time by use of microarrays. The sigZ regulon in ethanol stress response was determined and compared with the regulon determined by micorarray analysis of overexpression of sigZ. Keywords: stress response, comparative transcriptome study

DESIGN
The sigZ deletion strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579 was cultured to an OD600 of ~0.6. Here the first RNA sample was taken, 0 min. After sampling 4% of ethanol was added (v/v), and samples were taken after 10, 30 and 60 minutes of exposure. Comparisons performed were 0 min - 10 min, 0 min - 30 min, and 0 min - 60 min.

PLATFORM
