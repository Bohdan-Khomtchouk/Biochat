TITLE
Gene expression profile of human T-ALL cell line JURKAT after TRIB2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To dissect molecular pathways regulated by TRIB2 in T-ALL, we performed microarray gene expression profiling in the TAL1-positive T-ALL cells (Jurkat) after TRIB2 knockdown.

DESIGN
A human T-ALL cell line JURKAT cells were transduced with TRIB2 (shTRIB2) or control GFP shRNA (shGFP).  Experiment was done in biological duplicate (dup1 and dup2). A total of 4 RNA samples (2 control and 2 TRIB2 knockdown) were used for microarray gene expression analysis.
