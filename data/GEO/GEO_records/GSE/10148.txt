TITLE
Analysis of Endoglin function in rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Endoglin is a transmembrane receptor able to bind several members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamliy. We used a siRNA-mediated knock down approach to analyse the function of Endoglin in hepatic stellate cells (HSC). We found that the targeted disruption is associated with significant changes in gene expression resulting in cellular changes that prolongated cellular activation, morphological maturation, transdifferentiation, expression of basement and fibrillar extracellular matrix proteins. In addition, the lack of Endoglin resulted in rearrangements of cytoskeletal organization. Keywords: gene function analysis, siRNA, gene knock down

DESIGN
We have performed a set of four microarray hybridizations using Agilent Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarrays. We compartively analysed the gene expression profile in RNAs taken from: (I) untreated HSC taken from one animal vs. HSC that were taken from one animal and transfected with a control siRNA, (II) HSC taken from one animal and transfected with a siRNA targeting endoglin vs. HSC that were taken from one animal and transfected with a control siRNA, (III) untreated HSC that were pooled from three individual animals vs. HSC that were taken from three individual animals and independently transfected with siRNA control, and finally (IV) HSC that were taken from three animals and independently transfected with a siRNA targeting endoglin vs HSC that were taken from three individual animals and independently transfected with a siRNA control.
