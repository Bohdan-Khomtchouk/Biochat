TITLE
Ischemic Pre- and Post Conditioning has pronounced effects on Gene Expression Profiles in the Rat Liver after Ischemia/Reperfusion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Ischemia/reperfusion injuries is a known complication to hepatic surgery. Ischemic pre- (IPC) and postconditioning (IPO) protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion-injuries. Expression profiling were performed on liver biopsies seeking to identify molecular mediators of the protective properties.

DESIGN
48 rats were divided into 5 groups; sham (n=8), IRI (n=10), IPC (n=10), IPO (n=10) and IPC+IPO (n=10). All rats except sham rats were subjected to 30 min of total liver ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion before liver biopsies were sampled. In the IPC group, liver ischemia was preceded by 10 min of hepatic ischemia, followed by 10 min of reperfusion. IPO were performed by three cycles of 30 sec of reperfusion and 30 sec of ischemia, applied immediately after the 30 min of total liver ischemia. In the IPC+IPO group the two interventions were combined.
