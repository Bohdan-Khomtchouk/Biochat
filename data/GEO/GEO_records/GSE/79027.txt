TITLE
Expression profiling of IL-13 stimulated PBMCs with and without an IL-13R antagonist

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment aims to identify the biological pathways and diseases associated with the cytokine Interleukin 13 (IL-13) using gene expression measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

DESIGN
The experiment comprised of samples obtained from 3 healthy donors. The expression profiles of in vitro IL-13 stimulation were generated using RNA-seq technology for 3 PBMC samples at 24 hours. The transcriptional profiles of PBMCs without IL-13 stimulation were also generated to be used as controls. An IL-13R-alpha antagonist (Redpath et al. Biochemical Journal, 2013) was introduced into IL-13 stimulated PBMCs and the gene expression levels after 24h were profiled to examine the neutralization of IL-13 signaling by the antagonist.
