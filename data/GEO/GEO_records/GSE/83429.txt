TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis reveals mechanisms of sterile and fertile flowers differentiation and development in Viburnum macrocephalum f. keteleeri

ORGANISM
Viburnum macrocephalum

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from fertile and sterile flowers growing V. macrocephalum f. keteleeri inflorescence using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform to generate the first transcriptome dynamics that may serve as a gene expression profile blueprint for sterile and fertile flowers differentiation and development in flowering plant.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in fertile and sterile flowers growing V. macrocephalum f. keteleeri inflorescence
