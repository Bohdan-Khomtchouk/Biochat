TITLE
Vitamin D regulates expression of multiple genes including CD14 and CD180 to modulate the syncytiotrophoblast response to lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the response of primary cultures of human trophoblasts to bioactive 1,25 (OH)2D3 and used whole genome microarray to identify innovative hypotheses. Data indicate that bioactive vitamin D has wide-spread effects on villous gene expression in general, and a specific affect effect on the immune response.

DESIGN
Primary human villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated as described {Chen et al., 2010, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 299, C968-76; Chen et al., 2015, Placenta, 36, 847-53} and washed thoroughly 4 h after plating, to eliminate villous fragments and nonviable cells.
