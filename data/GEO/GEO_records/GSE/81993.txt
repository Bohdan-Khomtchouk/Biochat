TITLE
Mitochondrial dynamics mediated by Mitofusin 1 is required for POMC neurons glucose-sensing and insulin release control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) is a transmembrane GTPase protein implicated in mitochondrial fusion. To investigate the potential role of Mfn1 in energy balance and metabolism control we generated mice lacking Mfn1 specifically in hypothalamic POMC neurons (POMCMfn1KO). We used microarrays to determine gene expression changes resulting from deletion of Mfn1 in POMC neurons under fed and fasting conditions

DESIGN
Total hypothalamic mRNA was isolated from control and conditional knock-out mice under ad libitum fed or fasting (16h) conditions. RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
