TITLE
Platelet microRNA expression profiles of acute coronary syndrome patients with high and low platelet reactivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the diverse platelet microRNA (miRNA) expression between high platelet reactivity (HPR) and low platelet reactivity (LPR) patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), we enrolled a cohort of ACS patients and performed miRNA expression profiling of platelets from four HPR and four LPR patients using human miRNA microarray system. VerifyNow P2Y12 assay was applied to indentify HPR and LPR. Venous blood was drawn from the patients and was centrifuged to prepare platelets. Among the candidate differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-15b expression was further confirmed to be lower in platelets of 22 HPR patients than 17 LPR by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

DESIGN
We enrolled a consecutive cohort of 290 ACS patients and assessed the platelet reactivity using VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. In this study, HPR was defined as â‰¥300 platelet reactivity unit (PRU) while LPR < 170 PRU. miRNA microarray analysis was performed in platelets of four HPR and four LPR patients with ACS.
