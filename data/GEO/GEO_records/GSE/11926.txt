TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Ad-F3 and Ad-F7 transduced macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes that may regulate distinct or overlapping functions of IRF-3 and IRF-7, primary human macrophage preparations were transduced with adenoviral vectors: Ad-GFP (control), Ad-F3 (expressing the active form of IRF-3, IRF-3 5D), or Ad-F7 (expressing the active form of IRF-7, IRF-7 D247-467) and evaluated by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
RNA was collected 24 hours post-transduction with Ad-GFP, Ad-F3 and Ad-F7  and subjected to microarray analysis. Submited tables show the average of 7 donors.
