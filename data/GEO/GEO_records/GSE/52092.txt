TITLE
Expression data from AR3 transgenic and wild-type mouse prostates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have established AR3 transgenic mouse models with targeted expression of AR3 in the prostate using the ARR2PB promoter. We have carried out gene expression profiling in AR3 transgenic prostate and wild-type prostate tissues respectively.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling in AR3 transgenic prostates to identify differentially expressed genes in the AR3Tg at the age of 4 weeks (n=3),  wild-type littermates (n=3) were used as controls.
