TITLE
Intestinal ablation of CKIalpha highlights invasiveness control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling, which drives the rapid self-renewal of the gut epithelium is causally associated with intestinal neoplasia. Here we show that CKIalpha is a activation depends on p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1: CKIÎ± ablation provokes activation of p53 and p21, which assume a pivotal role in suppressing invasive cancer. Dual loss of CKIalpha and either p53 or p21 results in rapid, rampant malignant signature denoted p53supinv (p53-suppressed invasiveness) that is conditionally induction of invasiveness. Like invasiveness control, the transcriptional suppression of p53supinv genes is largely mediated by p21, independently of cell cycle control, representing a novel tumor suppressor function of wild-type p53.

DESIGN
13 arrays of mice entrocytes herto or homozygot for gut specific KO of CKI alpha. Crossed with p53 or p21 KO mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
