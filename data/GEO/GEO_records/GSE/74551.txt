TITLE
The chromatin remodeler protein DDM1 regulates early seedling growth hybrid vigor by modulating gene expression in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Despite of the paramount importance of heterosis in agriculture, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis remain elusive. Recent studies in Arabidopsis suggested possible involvement of DNA methylation in heterosis. We tested this hypothesis genetically by crossing homozygous mutants in DNA methylation-related genes in the Columbia (Col) ecotype with homozygous mutants in the same DNA methylation-related genes in the C24 ecotype. When genes in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway were mutated, the resultant F1 hybrids did not show appreciable loss of best parent heterosis (BPH) performances in early seedling growth. In contrast, mutations in the putative chromatin remodeling protein DECREASE OF DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) caused ddm1-Col like growth pattern of ddm1-F1 hybrids, a mid-parent heterosis (MPH) performance. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we compared the transcriptomes of the parental plants and reciprocal F1 hybrids in the wild type and ddm1 mutant backgrounds, and identified 183 non-additively expressed (NAE) genes, which were functionally enriched in defense response, a group of genes negatively associated with plant size. Interestingly, for the expression levels of the NAE genes, WT-F1 hybrids were enriched in the Golden Ration between mid-parent values (MPVs) and Col parents in WT, but ddm1-F1 hybrids were comparable to ddm1-Col parent in ddm1 mutant, which explained the MPH performance of ddm1-F1 hybrids. DNA methylation analyses revealed only one third of the NAE genes with highly methylated promoters whose expression is negatively associated with DNA methylation of promoters, strongly suggesting that DDM1 regulates heterosis by multiple epigenetic modifications.

DESIGN
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing of the wild type and ddm1 mutant background of parent Col, C24, the hybrid ColXC24 and C24XCol to explore the role of the DDM1 in DNA hybrid vigor.
