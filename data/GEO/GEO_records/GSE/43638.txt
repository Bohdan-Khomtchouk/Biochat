TITLE
Molecular and Genetic Crosstalks Between mTOR and ERRα are Key Determinants of Rapamycin-induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mTOR and ERRα are key regulators of common metabolic processes. However, the extent of functional overlap between these two factors has not been investigated. ChIP-sequencing analyses on mouse liver reveal mTOR recruitment to regulatory regions of genes on a genome-wide scale including enrichment at genes shared with ERRα that are involved in the TCA cycle and lipogenesis pathway. A total of 9469 and 23226 peaks were identified for mTOR and ERRα ChIP-seq datasets, respectively.

DESIGN
mTOR and ERRα mouse liver ChIP-seq datasets obtained from pooling 8 individual ChIPs from a chromatin pool of 26 livers.
