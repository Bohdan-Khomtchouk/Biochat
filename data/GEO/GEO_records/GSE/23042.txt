TITLE
DNA accessibility profile of three C. elegans tissues during development

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We show there is minimal genome-wide chromatin rearrangements (as measured by DNA accessibility) during tissue differentiation in C. elegans

DESIGN
transgenic expression of E. coli DAM (DNA Adenine Methyltransferase) from tissue-specific promoters followed by mapping of methylated sites using a procedure that captures 20bp sequences flanking methylated sites for Illumina sequencing PD3994 = transgenic line expressing DAM from myo-3 promoter PD3995 = transgenic line expressing DAM from rol-6 promoter PD3997 = transgenic line expressing DAM from vit-2 promoter N2dam = wildtype (N2) line; its genomic DNA was in vitro DAM-methylated parsed = Solexa reads in which linker sequences were successfully parsed out by the authors WS170DAMtags_ALL.txt = the set of all in_silico-generated DAM tags from C. elegans genome version WS170

PLATFORM
GPL9309 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Caenorhabditis elegans)
