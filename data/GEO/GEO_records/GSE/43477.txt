TITLE
Genomic profiling of primary and metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated CNAs of 20 primary clear cell renal cell caricinomas (ccRCCs), 20 corresponding metastases and another subsets of 30 primary ccRCCs by 44k oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

DESIGN
20 primary ccRCCs, 20 corresponding metastases and another subsets of 30 primary ccRCCs.
