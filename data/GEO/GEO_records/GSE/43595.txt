TITLE
IL-27 Inhibits HIV-1 Infection in Human Macrophages by Down-regulating Host Factor SPTBN1 during Monocyte to Macrophage Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection is modulated during monocyte differentiation. IL-27 is an anti-HIV cytokine that also modulates monocyte activation. Here, we present new evidence that IL-27 promotes monocyte differentiation into macrophages that are non-permissive for HIV-1 infection. While IL-27 treatment does not affect expression of macrophage differentiation markers or macrophage biological functions, it confers HIV resistance by down-regulating spectrin beta non-erythrocyte 1 (SPTBN1), a required host factor for HIV-1 infection. IL-27 down-regulates SPTBN1 through a TAK-1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway. Knockdown of SPTBN1 strongly inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages; conversely, overexpression of SPTBN1 markedly increases HIV susceptibility of IL-27 treated macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate that SPTBN1 associates with HIV-1 gag proteins. Collectively, our results underscore the ability of   IL-27 to protect macrophages from HIV-1 infection by down-regulating SPTBN1, thus indicating that SPTBN1 is an important host target to reduce HIV-1 replication in one major element of the viral reservoir.

DESIGN
2 samples with different treatments were analyzed. Genes with absolute fold change > = 5 were selected.
