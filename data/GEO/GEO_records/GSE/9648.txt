Anticancer metabolites discovered by Computational Metabolomics

SUMMARY
CoMet, a fully automated Computational Metabolomics method to predict changes in metabolite levels in cancer cells compared to normal references has been developed and applied to Jurkat T leukemia cells with the goal of testing the following hypothesis: up or down regulation in cancer cells of the expression of genes encoding for metabolic enzymes leads to changes in intracellular metabolite concentrations that contribute to disease progression. Nine metabolites predicted to be lowered in Jurkat cells with respect to normal lymphoblasts were examined: riboflavin, tryptamine, 3-sulfino-L-alanine, menaquinone, dehydroepiandrosterone, Î±-hydroxystearic acid, hydroxyacetone, seleno-L-methionine and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. All, alone or in combination, exhibited antiproliferative activity. Of eleven metabolites predicted to be increased or unchanged in Jurkat cells, only two (bilirubin and androsterone) exhibited significant antiproliferative activity. These results suggest that cancer cell metabolism may be regulated to reduce the intracellular concentration of certain antiproliferative metabolites, resulting in uninhibited cellular growth and have the implication that many other endogenous metabolites with important roles in carcinogenesis are awaiting discovery.
