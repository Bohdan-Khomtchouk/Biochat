TITLE
Silencing of AEBP1 in U87MG glial cells and Chip-chIP with AEBP1 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AEBP1 has been identified as a transcriptional repressor playing a significant role in adipogenesis. Recently, we have found that AEBP1 is specifically upregulated in primary glioblastoma. We have used gene silencing to identify genes perturbed upon AEBP1 downregulation and ChIP-chip technique to identify its genomic targets of binding and regulation to understand the un-annotated/undescribed role of this transcription factor in gliomagenesis.

DESIGN
Cells either mock silenced or silenced using siRNA against AEBP1 were harvested at 46hrs post transfection. Gene expression was profiled for control and AEBP1 silenced cells. comparison of AEBP1/Rabbit IgG/ Glial cells
