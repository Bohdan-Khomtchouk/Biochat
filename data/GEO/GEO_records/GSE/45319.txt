TITLE
The glycogen scaffolding protein PTG coordinately regulates glycogen and lipid storage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glycogen and lipid are major storage forms of energy that are tightly regulated by hormones and metabolic signals. Here, we evaluate the role of the glycogenic scaffolding protein PTG/R5 in energy homeostasis. We demonstrate that feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) increases hepatic glycogen, corresponding to increased PTG levels, increased activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and induced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). PTG promoter activity was increased by activation of mTORC1 and SREBP1, and PTG and glycogen levels were augmented in mice and cells in which mTORC1 is constitutively active. HFD-dependent increases in hepatic glycogen were prevented by deletion of the PTG gene in mice. Interestingly, PTG knockout mice fed HFD exhibited improved liver steatosis and decreased lipid levels in muscle, in coordination with decreased glycogen, suggesting possible crosstalk between glycogen and lipid stores in the overall control of energy metabolism. Together, these data suggest that transcriptional regulation of PTG by dietary and nutritional cues has profound effects on energy storage and metabolism.fi

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis was used to characterize hepatic diet-associated gene expression changes between wild-type and PTG KO mice. Mice were maintained on a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet as indicated. 2-3 biological replicates per genotype/diet.
