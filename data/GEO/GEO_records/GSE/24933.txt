TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of the transcription factor GABP-alpha binding in human CD34+CD133+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-Seq to map GABP-alpha binding sites in human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Coupled with functional assays using GABP-alpha deficient mouse model and bioinformatics analysis, we systematically determined a transcriptional module controlled by GABP in HPCs.

DESIGN
Examination of the role of GABP in hematopoietic stem cells
