TITLE
Genome-wide map of GATA6 DNA binding in human CRC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe the genome-wide DNA-binding of GATA6 in a human CRC cell line (LS174T). GATA6 is found to bind the promoter of genes involved in the maintenance of intestinal stem cells, including genes of the Wnt and TGFbeta/BMP pathways. With this we describe a novel GATA6-dependent mechanism of stem cell maintenance in colorectal tumors.

DESIGN
Examination of GATA6 binding and H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels in a human CRC cell line by Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing.
