TITLE
Characterization of circulating microRNA expression in patients with a ventricular septal defect

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
36 differentially expressed miRNAs were found in the patients with VSD and the VSD-free controls. Compared with VSD-free controls, expression of 15 miRNAs were up-regulated and 21 miRNAs were down-regulated in the VSD group

DESIGN
MiRNA microarray analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were employed to determine the miRNA expression profile from 3 patients with VSD and 3 VSD-free controls
