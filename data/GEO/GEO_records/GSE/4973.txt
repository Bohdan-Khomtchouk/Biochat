TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana tritrophic interaction experiment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Multi-species interactions are a major force in the evolution and dynamics of ecosystems. These interactions may occur either when species affect each other directly or when they interact indirectly via an intermediary species. Direct interactions between species are best understood, but indirect interactions may also often be strong enough to alter the evolutionary trajectories of the target species. Little is known about the genetic basis of direct interactions within an ecosystem and even less data is available for indirect interactions. This experiment uses a simple model ecosystem to build a view at the transcriptome level of how interactions between plants (Arabidopsis) and rhizosphere bacteria (Pseudomonas) are altered by biotic stressors (insect herbivores) and abiotic stressors (UV-B). Keywords: stress response
