TITLE
Genome-wide analyses of the DRB response of the histone H3 Lys36 methylation state, as well as Ash1l occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using wild type and Ash1l ∆SET mutant embryonic stem cells, against a prevalent notion, here we report di-,tri-methylation of histone H3 Lys36 occur independently of ongoing transcription. Ash1l ∆SET mutant shows the impaired methylation levels in broad range of genome. Intriguingly, data implicate that a binding of retinoic acid receptor to a certain genomic region promotes installation of the tri-methylation in the retinoic acid receptor-associated gene independent of its ongoing transcription.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in 2 cell types in 2 different conditions. Examination of Ash1l occupancy in 2 different conditions.
