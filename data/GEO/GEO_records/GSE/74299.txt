TITLE
Gene expression in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) inherently resistant to glucocorticoids were cultured in vitro. The study aims to determine discrepancy in gene expressions between different xeno strains.

DESIGN
The same xenograft was innoculated into 3 mice. Spleen-harvest xenograft samples were analyzed using microarray.
