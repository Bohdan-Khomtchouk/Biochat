SUMMARY
Mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases are frequent in human glioblastomas1 and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemias (AML)2. These alterations are gain-of-function mutations in that they drive the synthesis of the “oncometabolite” R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)3. It remains unclear how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations modify myeloid cell development and promote leukemogenesis. Here we report the characterization of conditional knock-in mice in which the most common IDH1 mutation, Idh1-R132H, is inserted into the endogenous murine Idh1 locus and is expressed in cells of the hematopoietic (Vav-KI) or more specifically in cells of the myeloid (LysM-KI) lineage. These mutants show increased numbers of early hematopoietic progenitors and develop splenomegaly and anemia with extramedullary hematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Furthermore, LysM-KI cells exhibit both hypermethylated histones and changes to DNA methylation similar to those observed in human IDH1/2-mutant AML. Thus, our study is the first to describe the generation of conditional Idh1-R132H-KI mice. Furthermore, our study is also the first report showing the induction of a leukemic DNA methylation signature in a modeled system and sheds light on the mechanistic links between IDH1 mutation and human AML.
