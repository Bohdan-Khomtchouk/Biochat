TITLE
Effect of chronic ethanol consumption on rat pancreas

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male Wistar rats weighing 90-120 g were acclimatized for one week and fed standard laboratory chow, at which time the animals were divided into two groups.  Animals were then pair-fed for 8 weeks a regular laboratory chow and water “ad libitum” or Lieber-DeCarli diet (36% calories from ethanol). Control animals received the iso-caloric amount of dextrose to replace ethanol. After 8 weeks of differential feeding rats were euthanized, the pancreas immediately dissected and stored at -80?C until RNA isolation.  RNA expression was analyzed using Affymetrix RAE230A gene chips Keywords: stress response, disease state analysis
