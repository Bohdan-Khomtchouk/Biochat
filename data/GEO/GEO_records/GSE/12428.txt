Current smoking-specific gene expression signature in bronchial epithelium is enhanced in squamous cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the development of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC). However, the smoking-related molecular changes in SCC have not been studied. We wanted to identify genes in both histologically normal bronchial epithelium and SCC samples that are differentially expressed between current and ex-smokers. In addition, to analyze the levels of the smoking-related genes identified in normal bronchial epithelium with the levels in SCC. Gene expression profiles were generated using Agilent whole human genome microarrays in 28 laser microdissected normal bronchus epithelial samples and in 35 laser microdissected SCC samples of current and ex-smokers. Levels of 246 genes, mainly related to oxidative stress response, were significantly different between normal bronchial epithelium of current and ex-smokers. No significant differences were associated with the smoking status in SCC samples. Analysis of the 246 smoking specific genes in SSC from current and ex-smokers also revealed no differences. As a next step, we compared the levels of the smoking-specific gene signature between normal bronchial epithelium from ex- and current smokers to all 34 SCC samples. Twenty-two percent of the upregulated genes are further upregulated in SCC as compared to current smokers. Expression of the downregulated genes was even further downregulated for 79% of the genes in SCC as compared to bronchus epithelium of current smokers. The downregulated genes included several tumour suppressor genes. This study shows that genes upregulated in normal bronchial epithelium of current smokers are expressed at similar levels in SCC samples, while levels of downregulated genes were significantly further reduced in SCC. This indicates that these downregulated genes play a role in SCC oncogenesis.
