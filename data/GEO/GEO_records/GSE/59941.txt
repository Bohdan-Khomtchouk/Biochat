TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse cortex harvested at two different zeitgeber (ZT) timepoints of the 24h cycle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in forebrain structures change during day and night depending on circadian and rest-activity cycles. Clock genes have been shown to be involved in the control of circadian and sleep-wake control. In this study, we aimed at studying the consequences of loss of SHARP1 (DEC2/BHLHE40) and SHARP2 (DEC1/BHLHE41) on cortical gene expression at rest (ZT4) and activity (ZT16) phases.

DESIGN
We harvested cortex tissue from individual mice from WT and SHARP1/2 double null mutant mice at ZT4 and ZT16, prepared total RNA and subjected the corresponding samples (n=2 biological replicates per timepoint and genotype) to Affymetrix genechip analysis to assay the changes of gene expression.
