TITLE
Antenatal Blood DNA Methylation Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiles were generating using Illumina HM450 microarrays in a prospective sample blood from the prenatal period of pregnant mood disorder patients who would and would not develop depression post partum.

DESIGN
We recruited 54 pregnant women with a history of either Major Depression or Bipolar Disorder (I, II or NOS) and prospectively followed them during pregnancy and after delivery in order to identify genetic and clinical characteristics that precede the development of a postpartum depressive episode. Blood samples profiled were collected at varying time points during pregnancy.
