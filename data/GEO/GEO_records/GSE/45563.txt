TITLE
Drought, heat and combined stress in durum wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum turgidum subsp. durum

SUMMARY
Durum wheat is an important cereal crop grown mainly in semi-arid environments (e.g. Mediterranean regions) characterized by water scarcity and high temperatures often occurring at the same time. This work reports on a transcriptomic analysis carried out on two durum wheat cultivars (Cappelli and Ofanto) characterized by different water use efficiency (WUE), grown to booting stage and subjected to a combination of drought and heat stresses, a situation similar to the experience of a crop grown in Mediterranean environments and exposed to a terminal heat/drought stress.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  alessio.  The equivalent experiment is TA47 at PLEXdb.]
