TITLE
The pyruvate-tricarboxylic acid cycle node: a focal point of virulence control in the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [rovA mutant]

ORGANISM
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome assessment of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain YPIII. The Y. pseudotuberculosis rovA regulon was determined in Yersinia minimal minimum developed for the study. RovA is a key regulator for Yersinia virulence.

DESIGN
Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII or the isogenic rovA mutant strain  were cultivated at 25°C under aeration on a rotary shaker. First pre-cultures were grown in a 1:1 mixture of HAM’s F-12 Nutrient Mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US) and liquid DMEM medium (Biochrom, Berlin, DE). Second pre-cultures and main cultures were grown in a Yersinia minimal medium (YMM). The analysis comprised three biological replicates for each strain. In addition, samples, taken at three different time points of the exponential growth phase, were used to validate constant expression during the cultivation. Total RNA was extracted using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) and the quality of the RNA was confirmed by the lack of PCR amplification of the hns gene and by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
