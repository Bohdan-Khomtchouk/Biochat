TITLE
Comparison between all runs of industrial serial repitching 3

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differently expressed genes between all runs of four serial repitchings from a German brewery. In the brewery the number of successive runs varied from 17 to 20. A run describes the industrial fermentation of brewery wort. By the end of fermentation the yeast slurry is cropped. These cells are reused for inoculation of another cylindro-conical vessel (CCVs).

DESIGN
Results from four loops are summarized in this study. The samples were taken from four serial repitchings of a German brewery (brewery A). Microarrays were hybridized in a loop approach.
