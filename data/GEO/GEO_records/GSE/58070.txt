TITLE
Gene expression profile during SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y undergoes a morphology change upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment, the neurite outgrowth characteristic in undividing cells is accompanied by cell cycle arrest and neuronal markers expression, controlled by a precise dynamic molecular circuits. Depletion of CSB in SH-SY5Y cells leads to differentiation defects. This study examines the temporal gene expression profile during differentiation. Using Nimblegen microarray we characterized the gene expression profiles before and after RA treatment in both wild type and CSB-KD SH-SY5Y cells, and we identified the difference in gene expression between wild type and CSB-KD cells underlying the differentiation defects induced by CSB depletion.

DESIGN
The Nimblegen human 12 x 135K gene expression arrays were used to define gene expression profiles of wild type and CSB-KD SH-SY5Y cells before and after RA treatment during a nine-day culture period.
