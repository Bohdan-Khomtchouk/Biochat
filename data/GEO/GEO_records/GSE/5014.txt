TITLE
Expression profiling of T. rubrum treated with amphotericin B and ketoconazole

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
Two antifungal agents, ketoconazole (KTZ) and amphotericin B (AMB), have specific activity against dermatophytes.A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to KTZ and AMB were determined. Some class-specific and mechanism-independent changes in gene expression were found. Keywords: comparison of expression status

DESIGN
The expression profiles of Trichophyton rubrum treated with AMB and KTZ were compared to those of Trichophyton rubrum without drug. Each treatment has three replicates.
