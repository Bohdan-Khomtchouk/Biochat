TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Hansenula polymorpha in response to sulfur starvation and cadmium stress

ORGANISM
Ogataea angusta

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling analysis of the Hansenula polymorpha MET4 gene deletion strain have been carried out to obtain comprehensive information on the HpMet4p-mediated regulatory networks in association with the cadmium (Cd) detoxification and sulfur regulation in H. polymorpha.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were collected from H. polymorpha wild type, and HpMET4  deletion strain, under sulfur starvation or Cd (0.6 mM) stress conditions. The differential fluorescence intensities of each RNA sample were measured after labeling with Cy3 or Cy5. For all analyses, we performed dye swapping experiments to avoid dye bias. Thus, four intensity values were generated for each ORF and averaged for analysis.
