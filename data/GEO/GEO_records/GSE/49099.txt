TITLE
Melampsora larici-populina gene expression in telia, uredinia, urediniospores and in planta

ORGANISM
Melampsora larici-populina

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Melampsora larici-populina was analysed in telia (in planta sample, early telia harvested before overwintering), uredinia (in planta sample, 168 hours post-inoculation, hpi), in planta during biotrophic growth (96 hpi) and in resting urediniospores. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, Department of Energy) Melampsora larici-populina genome sequence version 1. The aim of this study was to determine gene expression in early telia formed in decaying poplar leaves in autumn before the overwintering process and to compare this expression with other stages of the poplar rust life cycle that were previously described (i.e., resting urediniospores as pure fungal material, and uredinia and biotrophic growth stage as poplar leaf infecting fungal structures). This study should highlight telia-specific transcripts and contribute to the understanding of the poplar rust biological cycle.

DESIGN
We performed 12 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from resting urediniospores (3 biological replicates), infected poplar leaves harvested at 96 and 168 hpi (3 biological replicates each) and Telia (3 biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.
