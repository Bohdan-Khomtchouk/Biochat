TITLE
Effect of SWELL1 gene deletion on gene expression in adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to detail the global expression changes induced when SWELL1 is genetically deleted from adipocytes.

DESIGN
We generated isogenic SWELL1 KO adipocyte cell lines from 3T3-F442A cells. CRISR/Cas9 was used to knockout the SWELL1 gene in the parental 3T3-F442A line. These cell lines were grown in culture and RNA was extracted for sequencing. RNA was sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq at the University of Iowa Core Facility.

PLATFORM
