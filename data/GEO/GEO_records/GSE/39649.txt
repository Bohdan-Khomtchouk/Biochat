TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between MEFs, MEFs (NWD), immature Sertoli cells and mature Sertoli cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the the genomic profile of MEFs, immature Sertoli, mature Sertoli cells, and MEFs (NWD) after infection of Nr5a1, Wt1 and Dmrt1 after 1 month of dox exposure.

DESIGN
MEFs (NWD) were infected with Nr5a1, Wt1 and Dmrt1 and were exposed to dox for 1 month. MEFs, immature Sertoli and mature Sertoli cells were cultured for 3 days and collected
