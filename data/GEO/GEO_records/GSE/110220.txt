TITLE
USP15-dependent lysosomal pathway controls p53-R175H turnover in ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gain-of-function p53 mutants such as p53-R175H form stable aggregates that accumulate in cells and play an important role in cancer progression. Selective degradation of gain-of-function p53 mutants has emerged as a highly attractive therapeutic strategy to target cancer cells harboring specific p53 mutations. We identified a small molecule called MCB-613 to cause rapid ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation of p53-R175H through lysosome-mediated pathway leading to catastrophic cancer cell death. In contrast to its effect on the p53-R175H mutant, MCB-613 causes slight stabilization of p53-WT and has weaker effects on other p53 gain-of-function mutants. Using state-of-the-art genetic and chemical approaches, we identified the deubiquitinase USP15 as the mediator of MCB-613â€™s effect on p53-R175H and established USP15 as a selective upstream regulator of p53-R175H in ovarian cancer cells. These results confirm that distinct pathways regulate the turnover of p53-WT and the different p53 mutants and open new opportunities to selectively target them.
