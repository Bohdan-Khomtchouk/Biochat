TITLE
Functional splicing network reveals extensive regulatory plasticity of the core  Spliceosomal machinery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-mRNA splicing relies on the still poorly understood dynamic interplay between  more than 150 protein components of the Spliceosome, and the steps at which splicing  can be regulated remain largely unknown. Here we systematically analyze the effect of  knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing events  relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and use this information to reconstruct a  network of functional interactions. The network accurately captures well-established  physical and functional associations and identifies new, revealing remarkable  regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components, related to the order and duration  of their recruitment during Spliceosome assembly. In contrast with standard models of  regulation at early events of splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic  activation of the Spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds  light on the antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF and on targets of anti-tumor  drugs, and can be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.

DESIGN
RNA from 3 biological replicates of 72 hours knockdowns of human IK or SMU1 and a control set were used. Changes between the control and knockdowns were measured based on using a splice-junction array (Affymetrix HJAY).
