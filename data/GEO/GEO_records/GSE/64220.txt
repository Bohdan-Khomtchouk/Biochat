TITLE
Expression profile from murine acute myeloid leukemia cells C1498 with or without PARP-1 inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is abnormally expressed in a wide variety of tumors. Emerging evidence suggests that PARP-1 plays key roles in multiple biologic behaviors of tumors, such as modulation of chromatin structure, regulation of gene transcription, tumor proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, by acting on different molecular pathways. PARP-1 inhibition can achieve a beneficial outcome in tumor treatment. But the specific mechanism of PARP-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still to be discovered. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in C1498 with and without PARP-1 inhibition and profile differentially expressed genes that might be involved in PARP-1 regulation in AML.

DESIGN
Murine acute myeloid leukemia cells C1498 was from ATCC and cultured in complete Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were treated with 20Î¼M PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 or control PBS for 48 h. Then total RNA was extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each sample was conducted in triplicate.
