TITLE
Identification of Erythroid-Enriched Gene Expression in the Mouse Embryonic Yolk Sac using Microdissected Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primitive erythropoiesis in the mouse yolk sac is followed by definitive erythropoiesis resulting in adult erythrocytes. In comparison to definitive erythropoiesis little is known about the genes that control the embryonic erythroid program. The purpose of this study was to generate a profile of mouse embryonic yolk sac erythroid cells and identify novel regulatory genes differentially expressed in erythroid compared to non-erythroid (epithelial cells). The identification of these genes will contribute to a greater understanding of how the primitive erythroid program is controlled. This work will have clinical implications for treating sickle cell anemia and Î²-thalassemia. Activating genes in adult erythroid cells that increase embryonic or fetal globin gene expression may be a therapeutic approach to treat individuals with these disorders. Keywords: Comparison between mouse embryonic day 9.5 yolk sac microdissected primitive erythroid precursors and epithelial cells

DESIGN
Embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) yolk sacs were dissected from the embryos of timed-pregnant FVB/N mice. These tissues were frozen in OCT media and 8-micron frozen sections were obtained. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to isolate primitive erythroid precursors and epithelial cells from these E9.5 yolk sac frozen sections using 2 to 4 yolk sacs from 2 different litters per biological replicate.  Paired erythroid and epithelial samples were collected from the same microscope slides. Total RNA was isolated from 4 different pairs of erythroid and epithelial samples and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 A 2.0 microarrays.
