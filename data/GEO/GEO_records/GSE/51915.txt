TITLE
Systematic evaluation of DNase-seq experimental parameters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We systematicaly evaluated two major factors, enzyme digestion level and fragment size, that would affect DNase-seq experiment. We found that while under- or over-digestion sigificantly decreases the DNase-seq signal, there is a broad range of suitable digestion level. In addition, we found fragment smaller than nucleosome size is optimal to identify transcription factor binding events.

DESIGN
We tested digestion level of 5U, 25U, 50U, 75U, 100U and fragment size of 50-100bp, 100-200bp, 200-300bp
