TITLE
Novel mechanisms of galactose toxicity in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT)-deficient cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles in GALT-deficient and GALT-reconstituted cells showed that cells lacking GALT activity responded to galactose challenge by activating a set of genes characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.  This response was specific to galactose insult, as cells grown in glucose or hexose-free media did not exhibit ER stress. Keywords: GALT infected cells

DESIGN
Cells were first grown and then infected in high glucose, then transferred to DMEM, 3 experiments with dye-swap

PLATFORM
GPL1708 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Feature Number version)
