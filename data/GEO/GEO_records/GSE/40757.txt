TITLE
Transgenic Eµ-myc mouse lymphoma expression data for test dataset [Mouse430_2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used gene expression data from Eµ-myc mouse lymphomas to test various genomic signatures and select lymphomas for further study

DESIGN
When Eµ-myc mice had evidence of lymphoma and/or ill appearance, they were humanely sacrificed and dissected.  Lymphoma tissue was obtained and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Lymphoma was dissociated into a single cell suspension, and cell pellets were frozen.  Later, lymphoma tissue or cells were homogenized, and RNA was extracted.  Gene expression microarrays were performed with the isolated RNA.
