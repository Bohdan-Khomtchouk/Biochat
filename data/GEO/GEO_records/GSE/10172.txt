TITLE
Molecular profiling of pediatric mature B-cell lymphoma treated in population-based prospective clinical trials

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The spectrum of entities, the therapeutic strategy and the outcome of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas (maB-NHL) differs between children and adolescents on the one hand and adult patients on the other. Whereas adult maB-NHL have been studied in detail, data on molecular profiling of pediatric maB-NHL are hitherto lacking. Our aim was to characterize pediatric maB-NHL on the molecular level and to evaluate whether a molecular diagnosis of pediatric maB-NHL reveals clinically relevant groups. Keywords: pediatric disease state analysis

DESIGN
36 pediatric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma samples were hybridized to HGU133A Affymetrix GeneChips

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
