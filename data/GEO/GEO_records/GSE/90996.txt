TITLE
CHD1 in yeast is recruited by transcription elongation factors and maintains H3K4me3/H3K36me3 domains at actively transcribed and spliced genes [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide Chd1 occupancy in WT and in ten elongation factor mutants, and genome-wide H3K4me3/H3K36me3 profiles in WT and CHD1 mutant.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for Chd1 in wild-type and in ten elongation factor mutants. ChIP-seq for H3K4me3/H3K36me3 in wild-type and CHD1 mutant.

PLATFORM
