TITLE
Effects of heat, anoxia, and combined heat-anoxia treatments

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Anoxia induces several heat shock proteins and a heat pre-treatment can acclimatize Arabidopsis seedlings to a subsequent anoxic treatment.  In this work we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to anoxia, heat and a combined heat+anoxia stress. A significant overlapping between the anoxic and heat shock responses has been observed by whole-genome microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We treated Arabidopsis seedling, 4-days old, dark germinated with: -Control (23°C, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). -Heat-treated (38°C for 90 minutes, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). -Anoxia-treated (23°C,  under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). -combined heat+Anoxia-treatment (23°C,  treated at 38°C for 90 min and thereafter under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Two biological replicates for each condition.
