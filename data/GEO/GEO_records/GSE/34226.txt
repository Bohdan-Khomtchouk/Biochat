TITLE
CDDP treatment of U2OS cells with NCOR and SMRT knock-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detected an interaction between checkpoint kinase Chk2 and some members of the NCOR/SMRT co-repressor complex. In order to study the role of gene repression in the checkpoint response to DNA damage, we performed RNA profiling in NCOR or SMRT knockdown cells after treztment with cisplatin.

DESIGN
U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAs for NCOR or SMRT, grown for 2 days in complete medium, and then treated with 100 microM cisplatin (CDDP) for 6h. Biological duplicates were used for RNa profiling
