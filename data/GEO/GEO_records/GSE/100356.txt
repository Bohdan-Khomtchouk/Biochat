TITLE
Transcriptome of neonatal preBötzinger Complex neurons in Dbx1 reporter mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced the transcriptome of brainstem interneurons in the specialized respiratory rhythmogenic site dubbed preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) from newborn mice. To distinguish molecular characteristics of the core oscillator we compared preBötC neurons derived from Dbx1-expressing progenitors that are respiratory rhythmogenic to neighbouring non-Dbx1-derived neurons, which support other respiratory and non-respiratory functions.

DESIGN
RNA-seq gene expression profile for preBötC neurons in newborn mice
