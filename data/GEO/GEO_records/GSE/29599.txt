TITLE
BC ChIP-on-chip in SW480, array A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of Wnt signaling is involved in carcinogenesis, mainly through activation of beta-catenin/TCF target genes. Although aberrant activation of several Wnt target genes, including CCND1 and MYC, has been reported as promoting proliferation of cancer cells, it is hardly enough to understand malignant phenotypes of cancer cells with aberrant Wnt signaling. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of beta-catenin/TCF target genes, we examined binding of beta-catenin (BC) to DNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to genome tiling array (ChIP-on-chip).

DESIGN
Beta-catenin ChIP vs. Input in SW480 cells.
