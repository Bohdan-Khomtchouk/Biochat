TITLE
Arabidopsis CAF-1 depletion / gamma-irradiation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CAF-1 is involved in nucleosome assembly following DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the 3 CAF-1 subunits p150, p60 and p48 are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively.fas mutants exhibited increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks, a G2 phase retardation, and elevated levels of mRNAs coding for proteins involved in homologous recombinational repair. The same genes that were transcriptionally up-regulated in the fas mutants were also found to have a higher steady state level of transcription in wild-type Arabidopsis plants exposed to gamma-irradiation. Keywords: stress response, genetic modification
