TITLE
Gene expression profile in Caco-2 cells treated with carnosine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal the effects of carnosine on Caco-2 cells, we have employed whole genome microarray to detect genes that showed significantly different expression when exposed to carnosine. Caco-2 cells were treated with 1 mM carnosine for 3 days.

DESIGN
Caco-2 cells were treated with 1 mM carnosine for 3 days. Three independent experiments were performed.
