miR-495 regulates multiple epigenetic modifiers in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Revealing Dominant Regulatory MicroRNA-495-3p that Governs Multiple Epigenetic Modifiers in Gastric Carcinogenesis

DESIGN
In this study, we identified miR-495-3p targeting multiple epigenetic modifiers through comprehensive miRNA and mRNA profiling analysis with in silico target prediction in GC. Western blotting assay or quantitative real time PCR was performed to confirm the expression of miR-495-3p and targets of it. We applied miRNA mimics to ectopic overexpression in gastric cancer cells and observed tumor suppressive effects of miR-495-3p in the growth and metastasis of cancer. Also, we confirmed the status of CpG islands of miR-495-3p promoter using methylation specific PCR analysis.
