TITLE
Downregulation of LATS kinases alters p53 to promote cell migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-?B subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53â€™s conformation and transcriptional output towards a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants, and endow p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently downregulated in breast cancer; we propose that such downregulation might benefit cancer by converting p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tumor facilitator.

DESIGN
MCF10A cells transfected with siRNA against LATS1/2 alone, p53 alone or LATS1/2 and p53 together. Two independent MCF10A batches provided biological replicates
