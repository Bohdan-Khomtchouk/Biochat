TITLE
Control of Embryonic Stem Cell Lineage Commitment by Core Promoter Factor, TAF3 (ChIP-Seq data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that TAF3, a TBP-associated core promoter factor, is highly enriched in ES cells. In addition to its role in the core promoter recognition complex TFIID, genome-wide binding studies reveal that TAF3 localizes to chromosomal regions bound by CTCF and cohesin. Enrichment for TAF3/CTCF/cohesin bound regions distinguishes TAF3-activated from TAF3-repressed genes. Our findings support a new role of TAF3 in mediating long-range chromatin regulatory interactions to safeguard the finely-balanced transcriptional programs that give rise to pluripotency.

DESIGN
Genome-wide binding of TAF3, TAF1, TBP and PolII assayed by ChIP-Seq.
