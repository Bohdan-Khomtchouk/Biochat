TITLE
GSK-3 inhibitor treatment effect on MLL leukemia cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human leukemia cell line RS4.11 was treated with GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 for 20 hours.  Gene expression profiling was performed to analyze genes affected by GSK-3 inhibition.

DESIGN
Human leukemia cell line RS4.11 was grown in vitro and treated with 10 uM GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 or solvent DMSO for 20 hours.  Total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed.  Two controls and three inhibitor treatment samples were analyzed.
