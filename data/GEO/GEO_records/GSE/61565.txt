TITLE
Characterization of the complete genome sequence of Barley yellow striate mosaic virus reveals an overprinted ancillary gene encoding a small hydrophobic protein

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
In the recent years, RNA silencing has been studied extensively to be a conserved regulatory process in plants. In the antiviral silencing, the intermediate double-stranded RNA form during the replication of RNA viruses were recognized and processed into abundant of overlapping viral siRNA (viRNAs). Accordingly, the cloned viRNAs could be conversely assembled into some contigs of viruses, which is recently exploited for identifying new viruses and their genome sequences.To obtain rapidly the complete genome sequence of BYSMV, we carried out deep sequencing of small RNAs from healthy and BYSMV infected wheat, respectively. Thirteen contigs were assembled from the overlapping viRNAs only present in the infected wheat but not in the healthy wheat. The results of BLAST showed that ten contigs shared about 96% identity with the reported L gene of BYSMV isolate Zanjan-1.

DESIGN
Viral assembly from the BYSMV infected wheat plants to obtain the full lengh genome and characterise the viral siRNAs
