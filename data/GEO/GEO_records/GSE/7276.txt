TITLE
Distribution of Arp4 in G2/M phase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The actin-related proteins (ARPs) comprise a conserved protein family. Arp4p is found in large multisubunits of the INO80 and SWR1 chromatin remodeling complexes and in the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. Here we show that arp4 (arp4S23AD159A) temperature-sensitive cells are defective in G2/M phase function. arp4 mutants are sensitive to the microtubule depolymering agent benomyl and arrest at G2/M phase at restrictive temperature. Arp4p is associated with centromeric and telomeric regions throughout cell cycle. Ino80p, Esa1p, and Swr1p, components of the INO80, NuA4, and SWR1 complexes, respectively, also associate with centromeres. The association of many kinetochore components including Cse4p, a component of the centromere nucleosome, Mtw1p, and Ctf3p is partially impaired in arp4 cells, suggesting that the G2/M arrest of arp4 mutant cells is due to a defect in formation of the chromosomal segregation apparatus. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
• The goal of the experiment Genome-wide localization of Arp4 binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae • Experimental factors Distribution of Arp4 in WT in G2/M phase in the presence of nocodazole (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). • Experimental design ChIP analysis: Hybridization data for ChIP fraction was compared with WCE (whole cell extract) fraction. Chromosome III, IV,V,VI S. cerevisiae: SC3456a520015F, P/N# 520015, affymetrix tiling array were used.
