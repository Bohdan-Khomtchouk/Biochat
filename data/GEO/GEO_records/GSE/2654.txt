TITLE
Effects of Voluntary Exercise on Hippocampal Gene Expression in male C57Bl/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify changes in gene expression in the brain (specifically the hipocampus) in relation to variable levels of voluntary exercise.  Male C57Bl/6J mice were weaned onto a low fat diet (LF; Research Diets D12329, 11% kcal fat) and given continuous access to exercise wheels (30.3 x 20.6 x 26 cm; Mini Mitter®, Nalgene® Activity Wheel for Rodents) at ten weeks of age, for three days (n=96). Six mice had their wheels locked to act as sedentary controls (sed).  Animals were considered to be high runners (HR) if they ran > = 5 km/night and low runners (LR) if they ran < = 2 km/night.  Middle runners (MR) were chosen randomly from the population of animals falling between the high and low groups.  This series is comprised of array results from three parallel experiments comparing HR versus sed, MR versus sed, and HR versus LR.  Six hybridizations were performed for each of the three comparisons (3 forward-labeled, 3-reverse labeled) to account for dye-incorporation differences.  One slide from the HR vs LR experiment was broken during processing, so only five are included from that group.
