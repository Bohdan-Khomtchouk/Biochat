TITLE
Identification of genes activated in cancer cells cultured under hypoxia and serum-free condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes activated under hypoxia (1%O2) and serum-free treatment of a cancer cell line, we performed cDNA microarray analysis with an ovarian cancer cell line, OVSAYO.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured under normoxia /hypoxia (1%O2) and serum-plus/serum-minus conditions for 16 hours. Total RNA was isolated for cDNA microarray analysis.
