TITLE
Post-replicative formation of cohesion is required for repair and induced by a single DNA break

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sister chromatid cohesion, established during replication by the protein complex Cohesin, is essential for both chromosome segregation and double-strand break (DSB) repair. Normally cohesion formation is strictly limited to the S-phase of the cell cycle, but DSBs can trigger cohesion also after DNA replication has been completed. The function of this damage-induced cohesion remains unknown. In this investigation we show that it is essential for repair in post-replicative cells in yeast. Furthermore, it is established genome-wide after induction of a single DSB, and controlled by the DNA damage response and Cohesin regulating factors. We thus define a cohesion establishment pathway that is independent of DNA duplication and acts together with cohesion formed during replication in sister chromatid-based DSB repair.
