TITLE
Germline BRCA2 mutations drive prostate cancers with distinct evolutionary trajectories

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Germline mutations in the BRCA2 tumour suppressor are associated with both an increased lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) and increased risk of aggressive disease. To understand this aggression, here we profile the genomes and methylomes of localized PCa from 14 carriers of deleterious germline BRCA2 mutations (BRCA2-mutant PCa). We show that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease. BRCA2-mutant PCa shows genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the MED12L/MED12 axis, which is frequently dysregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This dysregulation is enriched in BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring intraductal carcinoma (IDC). Microdissection and sequencing of IDC and juxtaposed adjacent non-IDC invasive carcinoma in 10 patients demonstrates a common ancestor to both histopathologies. Overall we show that localized castration-sensitive BRCA2-mutant tumours are uniquely aggressive, due to de novo aberration in genes usually associated with metastatic disease, justifying aggressive initial treatment.

DESIGN
In total, we have methylation profiles for 172 samples, of which 12 samples (corresponding to 10 unique samples) carry the BRCA2 mutation and the remaining 160 samples (corresponding to 104 unique samples) were sporadic samples. Out of the 10 unique BRCA samples, 2 samples were repeated twice; out of the 104 unique samples, 34 samples were repeated twice, 8 samples repeated three times, 2 samples repeated four times.
