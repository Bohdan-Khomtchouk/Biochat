TITLE
An immediate transcriptional signature predicts response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Givinostat in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of three sets of patient-derived T-ALL xenografted murine lines treated or not treated with Givinostat, to investigate the immediate anti-leukemic effects after 6 hours of in vivo treatment with this histone deacetylase inhibitor.

DESIGN
Three different sets of class comparisons between Givinostat-treated and un-treated murine models xenografted with three different human primary pediatric T-ALL cells.
