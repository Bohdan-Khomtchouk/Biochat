TITLE
Gene expression profiles of two distinct neuronal populations in the neonatal rat spinal cord

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we compare the gene expression profiles of two distict, fluorescently identified neuronal populations, the motor neruons (MN) and the decending commissural interneurons (dCIN) of the neonatal rat spinal cord isolated with laser microdissection. These two populations participate in the neuronal networks in the spinal cord where they have destinct functions in shaping (dCINs) and transferring the output to the muscles (MNs) during locomotion. We wished to determine how the functinal differences in these nerurons are manifested at the gene expression level. Keywords: Cell type comparison.

DESIGN
Neurons were retrogradely labelled with rhodamine through application of the tracer to cut axons followed by incubation in oxygenated Ringer solution. Spinal cord were then snap frozen, cryosectioned and fluorescent single cells were laser dissected into a collector tube to a total of ca. 50-200 cells pr sample.  RNA was then extracted, two round amplified and hybridized to Affymatrix RNU-34 chips.  22 samples were hybridized onto chips, 7 MNs, 7 CINS and 8 MIX.
