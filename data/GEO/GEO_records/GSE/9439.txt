TITLE
Gene expression profiles of two distinct neuronal populations in the neonatal rat spinal cord

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Here we compare the gene expression profiles of two distict, fluorescently identified neuronal populations, the motor neruons (MN) and the decending commissural interneurons (dCIN) of the neonatal rat spinal cord isolated with laser microdissection. These two populations participate in the neuronal networks in the spinal cord where they have destinct functions in shaping (dCINs) and transferring the output to the muscles (MNs) during locomotion. We wished to determine how the functinal differences in these nerurons are manifested at the gene expression level. Keywords: Cell type comparison.
