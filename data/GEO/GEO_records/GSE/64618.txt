TITLE
Gene expression analysis of maternal zygotic ezh2 mutant zebrafish embryos vs wildtype at 0 and 3.3 hpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Goal of the experiment was to assess the differences in gene expression between maternal zygotic ezh2 mutant zebrafish embryos and wildtype embryos at 0 and 3.3 hpf.

DESIGN
Experiment with two conditions (wildtype and ezh2 mutant), two timepoints (0h and 3.3h) and two biological replicates.

PLATFORM
