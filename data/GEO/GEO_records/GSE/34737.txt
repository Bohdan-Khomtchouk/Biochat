TITLE
Comparative analysis of mRNA expression in untreated lymph node stroma cells and upon treatment with exosomes derived from ASMLwt, ASML cd44v knockdown cells.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of total RNA isolated from ASML and ASML CD44v knockdown exosomes; and RNA from untreated B12 lymph node stroma cells vs. cells treated for 24h with ASML wt or ASML CD44v kd exosomes

DESIGN
The array consists of 12 samples. Samples 1-3 consist of total RNA from exosomes derived from ASML cells; samples 4-6 : total RNA from exosomes derived from ASML CD44v knockdown cell; samples 7,8 are total RNA from untreated B12 lymph node stroma cells; samples 9,10 are RNA from B12 cells treated for 24h with ASML wt exosomes and samples 11, 12 are RNA from B12 cells treated with ASML CD44v kd exosomes
