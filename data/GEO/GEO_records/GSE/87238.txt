TITLE
In vivo RNA binding sites of the yeast ribosome biogenesis factor Utp23

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Purpose: Pre-ribosomal RNA is cleaved at defined sites to release the mature ribosomal RNAs, but the functions of many ribosome biogenesis factors involved in 18S rRNA release are not known. We apply an in vivo cross-linking technique coupled with deep sequencing (CRAC) that captures transcriptome-wide interactions between the yeast PIN domain protein Utp23 and its targets in a living cell. Methods: We apply CRAC to an HTP-tagged Utp23 protein (HTP: His6 - TEV cleavage site - two copies of the z-domain of Protein A) in budding yeast.  At least two independent experiments were performed and analysed separately. A non-tagged yeast strain was also used as a negative control. Results: We found that yeast Utp23 UV-crosslinked in vivo to the snR30 snoRNA and to the eukaryotic-specific expansion segment 6 (ES6) in the 18S rRNA. Conclusion: According to our crosslinking data, Utp23 is perfectly positioned to coordinate release of the snR30 snoRNA from the 18S ES6 region.
