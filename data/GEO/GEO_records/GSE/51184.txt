TITLE
Microarray analysis of Crx Knock-IN mice E168d2 and R90W

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P10 retinal gene expression analysis of the homozygous Crx Knock-OUT or Knock-IN mice carrying the mutation E168d2 or R90W. Results provide important information about the retinal genes affected by mutations in the transcription factor Crx, which have been implicated in human retinopathies.

DESIGN
PolyA RNA isolated from 3 Sex-matched (1M,1F) pairs of P10 mouse retinas from each genotype (WT, E168d2neo/d2neo, R90Wneo/Wneo, and Crx -/-)

PLATFORM
