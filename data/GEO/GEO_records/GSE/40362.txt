TITLE
Gene expression profiling of colorectal tissues in the early adenoma-carcinoma sequence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Colorectal polyps are recognised pre-cursors of CRC, however hyperplastic polyps lack malignant potential. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in gene expression between normal colonic mucosa, hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps from disease-free individuals. By comparing polyps believed to have malignant potential (adenomatous polyps) with hyperplastic polyps it is hoped that new insights into colorectal carcinogenesis can be achieved.

DESIGN
24 colonic samples comprising 8 normal colonic mucosa, 8 hyperplastic polyps and 8 adenomatous polyps.

PLATFORM
