TITLE
Transcriptome analysis revealed that SMD regulates neuronal differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis from Staufen-mediated mRNA (SMD) targets during differentiation confirmed that STAU1 was a key factor in neuronal differentiation.

DESIGN
Because the levels of STAU1 and UPF1 were reduced during differentiation, the levels of SMD target transcripts had to increase. These speculations drove us to further determine which transcripts were upregulated by both UPF1 and STAU1 depletion and differentiation.
