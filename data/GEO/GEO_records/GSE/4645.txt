TITLE
The function of CEBiP in the chitin elicitor signaling in rice cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To see the function of CEBiP in the chitin elicitor signaling in rice cells, a plasmid for the gene-specific knock-down by RNA interference (RNAi) was constructed by using a sequence for the 3â€™-terminal region of CEBiP and transformed into the rice cells by using Rhizobium radiobacter (Agrobacterium tumefaciens). chitinoligomer was added (or not added) to the medium. For the control of them, rice cells that non transformed wild type was used. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
We compared chitinoligomer treated rice cells with non treated on a same plate. Dye-swaps was done for transfomed or non transformed rice cells individually.
