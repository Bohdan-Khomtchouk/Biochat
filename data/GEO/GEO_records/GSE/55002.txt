TITLE
Transcription array by profiling in WT and SRC-2 null mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular targets of SRC-2 regulation in the murine liver stimulate fatty acid degradation and glycolytic pathway while fatty acid, cholesterol, and steroid biosynthetic pathways are down-regulated.

DESIGN
A genomic approach using microarray analysis was employed to identify the subsets of genes that are altered in the liver of  SRC-2-/- mice.
