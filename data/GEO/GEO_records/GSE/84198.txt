TITLE
Role of Ezh2 on Skeletal Development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the role of Ezh2 in growth plate, we generated Ezh1 complete knockout, Ezh2 cartilage-specific knockout mice (Ezh1-/-, Col2-cre Ezh2 f/f) and compared it with Ezh2 wildtype littermates (Ezh1 -/-, Col2-cre Ezh2 +/+). Proliferative zone (PZ) and Hypertrophic zones (HZ) of proximal tibial growth plate were dissected from 3-day old mice by laser capture microdissection and RNA were isolated by pico pure RNA isolation kit

DESIGN
Total 24 samples, 6 WT PZ vs 6 KO PZ; 6 WT HZ vs 6 KO HZ, to identify genes up- or down-regulated upon deletion of Ezh2 expression in the growth plate
