TITLE
Interactions between root knot nematodes and potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Plant-parasitic nematodes and especially the root-knot nematodes are ubiquitous pathogens. Eggs of root-knot  nematodes (Meloidogyne javanica) were extracted from greenhouse cultures and second-stage juveniles (J2) were hatched in tap, sterile water on 30 µm sieves. Solanum tubersum cv. Desiree explants, i.e., stem including an axillary bud, were sectioned, under sterile conditions from in vitro growing seedlings and transferred to Magenta boxes containing Gamborg's media. Seedlings, 4 weeks post transferring to Gamborg's media were planted in pots containing autoclaved quartz sand. Three weeks later the plants were infected with 3000 M. javanica infective juveniles, applied to the soil in tap, sterile water. Control uninfected plants were mock-inoculated with tap, sterile water. Roots from 6 infected and 6 mock-inoculated plants were collected at a series of time points, including 5, 10 and 15 days post nematode infection/mock inoculation. Roots were observed under the microscope, and nematode feeding sites were selectively dissected, from young lateral roots. To control for the effect of tissue sectioning on gene expression, young lateral roots of the mock inoculated roots were dissected similarly to the infected roots, and collected. Dissected roots were snapped-freeze in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored in -80 C freezer. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNAEasy kit. The experiment for each time point was duplicated, each duplicate derived from independent biological repeat. All RNA samples were amplified using the Ambion kit Message Amp catalog no. 1750, using as starting material 2.5 to 5 µg of total RNA. Keywords: Reference design
