SUMMARY
Prostate Microarrays for two studies on Low-Fat, Low-Glycemic Load Diet intervention in prostate cancer and the effect of Surgical Manipulation on Prostate Gene Expression. Influence of Surgical Manipulation on Prostate Gene Expression: Implications for Molecular Correlates of Treatment Effects and Disease Prognosis " Measurements of tissue gene expression are increasingly used for disease stratification, clinical trial eligibility, and assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response. However, the method of tissue acquisition alone could significantly influence the expression of specific transcripts or proteins. This study examines whether there are transcript alterations associated with surgical resection of the prostate gland by radical retropubic prostatectomy. " Low-Fat, Low-Glycemic Load Diet and Gene Expression in Human Prostate Epithelium: A Feasibility Study of Using cDNA Microarrays to Assess the Response to Dietary Intervention in Target Tissues " We examined the feasibility of using gene expression changes in human prostate epithelium as a measure of response to a dietary intervention.
