TITLE
Inflamatory response-related gene expression in the uteri of Dogs with Pyometra

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Pyometra, which is accompanied by bacterial contamination of the uterus, is defined as a complex disease associated with the activation of several systems, including the immune system. The objective of the study was to evaluate the gene expression profile in dogs with pyometra compared with those that were clinically normal.

DESIGN
The study included uteri from 43 mongrel bitches (23 with pyometra, 20 clinically healthy). RNA used for the microarray study was pooled to four separated vials for control and pyometra.
