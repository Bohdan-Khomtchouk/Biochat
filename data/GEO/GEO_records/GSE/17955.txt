TITLE
Amygdalae and hippocampi of C57BL/6J and A/J mouse inbred strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in C57BL/6J and A/J mouse inbred strains reveals gene networks specific for brain regions independent of genetic background Comparison of whole genome expression data of amygdala and hippocampus of both C57BL/6J and A/J mouse inbred strains using a network approach

DESIGN
Amygdala and hippocampus dissected from frozen tissue (adult test-naive A/J and C57BL/6J males) using a punching procedure. N=8-9 per group

PLATFORM
