TITLE
Expression data from murine hematopoietic cells expressing BCR-ABL alone, NUP98-HOXA9 alone, BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9, or null for both oncogenes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemia is a complex malignancy with hundreds of distinct mutations associated with disease development.  Studies have shown that oncogenes cooperate to promote leukemia transformation, however, the downstream effectors of this cooperation are largely unknown. Using a genetically defined mouse model of acute leuekmia, we investigated the regulated of genes downstream of the cooperative oncogenic interaction between BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 and identified a unique gene signature abberrantly expression in leukemia.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from hematopoietic cells transduced with BCR-ABL and Nup98-HOXA9 retroviruses and transplanted into recipient mice.  Bone marrow cells were purified by GFP (BCR-ABL) and YFP (NUP98-HOXA9) using FACS.
