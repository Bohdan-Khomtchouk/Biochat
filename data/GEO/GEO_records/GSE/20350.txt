TITLE
Comparison Between Gene Expression Profiles of Sensitive and Resistant Trabectedin Liposarcoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of 402-91 FUS-CHOP type I cells have been compared to 402-91/ET cells made resistant to Trabectedin

DESIGN
Experiments were performed on purified RNA from independent batches of 402-91 and 402-91/ET cells without drug treatment.
