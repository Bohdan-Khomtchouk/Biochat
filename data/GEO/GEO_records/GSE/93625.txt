TITLE
Human colon cancer SW480 cells: stably transfected with vector control and LRP16 treated with or without etoposide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human colon cancer SW480 cells comparing control untreated SW480 cells with cells stably transfected with LRP16 treated with or without etoposide (50 μM) for the indicated periods (0,1hour, 3hours).An exploratory microarray analysis was performed with mRNA extracted from clutured SW480 cells transfected with LRP16 or control plasmid that were treated with or without etoposide. Total RNA of colon cancer cells stably transfected with vector control and LRP16 treated with or without etoposide (50 μM) for the indicated periods was isolated and purified using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of RNA was assessed by using an Agilent BioAnalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies).

DESIGN
An exploratory microarray analysis was performed with mRNA extracted from clutured SW480 cells transfected with LRP16 or control plasmid that were treated with or without etoposide. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (0, 1 or 3 hours) using different group cells for each experiment.
