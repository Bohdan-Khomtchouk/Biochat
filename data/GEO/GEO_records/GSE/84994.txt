TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of livers of mice fed a high fat diet with and without administration of an inhibitor of the ileal bile acid uptake transporter ASBT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was designed to determine the effect of inhibition of ileal bile acid uptake on hepatic gene expression in high fat diet induced hepatic steatosis in mice

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiling was performed on liver tissues of mice fed a chow diet, a high-fat diet plus 0.2% (w/w) cholesterol (HFD), and the HFD plus the ASBT-inhibitor SC-435 (0.006%), for 16 weeks.
