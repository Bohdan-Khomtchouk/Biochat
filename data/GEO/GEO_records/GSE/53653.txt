TITLE
Genome-wide view of TGFb/Foxh1 regulation of the early mesendoderm program [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
We identified Nodal and Foxh1 downstream targets by performing RNA-seq of embryos either treated with small molecule SB431542 or microinjected morpholino anti-sense oligo against Foxh1.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression analyses of perturbed embryos (SB431542 treated, or Foxh1 MO injected) using RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL13741 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis)
