TITLE
dsRNA-seq of Physcomitrella patens rdr mutants

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of rdr2 and rdr6 mutations upon the strucutred component of the Physcomitrella patens transcriptome, dsRNAseq performed. The accumulation of dsRNAseq reads within known small RNA (microRNA and siRNA) loci was quantified and compared between wild-type and the two mutants.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were obtained from wild-type, rdr2, and rdr6, and subject to dsRNAseq via the protocol described by Zheng et al. (2010) (PMID: 20941385)

PLATFORM
GPL9916 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Physcomitrella patens)
