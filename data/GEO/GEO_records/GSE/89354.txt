TITLE
Gene expression differences between Gata2cko and wt mouse rhombomere 1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During development, rhombomere 1 gives rise to a multitude of cell types, including serotonergic as well as glutamatergic neurons that populate the raphe nuclei. Transcription factor Gata2 has been shown to regulate the development of the serotonergic neurons in the rhombomere 1. To further understand the role and targets of Gata2 in the rhombomere 1 during development, we used cDNA microarrays to compare gene expression in the embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) rhombomere 1 tissues extracted from wild-type and Gata2 mutant embryos.

DESIGN
Rhombomere 1 region was dissected from the E12.5 mouse embryos from the En1-cre, Gata2 flox/+ x Gata2 flox/flox crosses, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After genotyping, dissected rhombomere 1 pieces were pooled according to genotype, combining 6 En1-cre, Gata2 flox/+ samples into one control pool, and 6 En1-cre, Gata2 flox/flox samples as one mutant pool. RNA was extracted from 3 sample pools (biological replicates) per genotype, reverse transcribed and labelled according to standard Illumina protocols and hybridized on Illumina Mouse WG-6 Expression BeadChip arrays. For the comparison of gene expression, samples were grouped according to genotype (control vs mutant).
