TITLE
Gene expression of fly testes with dMi-2, kumgang (CG5204) knock downs and wild-type heads by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effect of different spermatocyte-specific loss of functions; kumgang (kmg or CG5204), dMi-2 in the gene expression in fly testes was assessed by RNA-Seq. Gene expression in wild-type heads were also measured to have a reference expression profile of 'somatic tissues'.  / Title: Blocking promiscuous activation at cryptic promoters directs cell type–specific gene expression / Abstract:  To selectively express cell type–specific transcripts during development, it is critical to maintain genes required for other lineages in a silent state. Here, we show in the Drosophila male germline stem cell lineage that a spermatocyte-specific zinc finger protein, Kumgang (Kmg), working with the chromatin remodeler dMi-2 prevents transcription of genes normally expressed only in somatic lineages. By blocking transcription from normally cryptic promoters, Kmg restricts activation by Aly, a component of the testis-meiotic arrest complex, to transcripts for male germ cell differentiation. Our results suggest that as new regions of the genome become open for transcription during terminal differentiation, blocking the action of a promiscuous activator on cryptic promoters is a critical mechanism for specifying precise gene activation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of kumgang and dMi-2 knock down testes and corresponding sibling control testes (no Gal4 driver), and wild-type heads were generated in duplicate using Illumina NextSeq 500.
