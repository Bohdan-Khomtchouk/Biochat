TITLE
Nitrate control of Arabidopsis seed dormancy

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Freshly harvested Arabidopsis seeds (ecotype Col0 obtained under 10 mM nitrate nutrition, referred to as C10) are dormant and do not germinate when sown on an agarose-based medium. This experiment was performed to analyze the genes that are differentially expressed in freshly harvested C10 seeds sown on agarose (dormant) versus freshly harvested C10 dry seeds (dormant) to analyze differential expression of genes during the first 6 hrs of imbibition of dormant seeds. Reference: Alboresi et al. Plant Cell Environ (2005) 28 : 500-512  - 16 DAP siliques were harvested from Col 0 plants grown on 10 or 50 mM nitrate or from G4 3 mutant grown on 10 mM nitrate in growth chambers. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
