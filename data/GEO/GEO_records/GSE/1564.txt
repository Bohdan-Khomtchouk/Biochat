TITLE
Electrical pacing of mouse muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were electrically stimulated by implanting a pacer. The hindlimb muscles received low frequency stimulation for three hours and the tibialis anterior muscle was harvested at different time points after the stimulation. Sham operated control mice were included in the experiment. mRNA was pooled from 6 mice at each time point and hybridized to the arrays together with mRNA from untreated mice (reference). Keywords: time-course
