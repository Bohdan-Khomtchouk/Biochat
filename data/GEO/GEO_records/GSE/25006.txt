TITLE
Mouse heart tissue: wild-type vs. aMHC-Calcineurin transgenic (CnTg)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac profiling of miR expression levels in a transgenic mouse model of heart failure (MHC-CnA) to identify miRs that are co-regulated with the development of calcineurin-induced heart failure.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: WT vs CnTg. Biological replicates: one array was performed on 3 pooled samples of each genotype (2 arrays in total).
