TITLE
Expression data from reactive astrocytes acutely purified from young adult mouse brains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reactive astrogliosis is characterized by a profound change in astrocyte phenotype in response to all CNS injuries and diseases. To better understand the reactive astrocyte state, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to profile gene expression in populations of reactive astrocytes isolated at various time points after induction using two different mouse injury models, ischemic stroke and neuroinflammation.

DESIGN
Young adult male mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to produce ischemic stroke or control sham surgery. Young adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce neuroinflammation or saline for control. Astrocytes were acutely purified from control and injured brains at 1 day after injury for LPS/saline injection and 1, 3 days and 7 days after MCAO/sham surgeries.
