TITLE
Identification of metastasis associated genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigates the genes that promote clear cell renal cell carcimoma (ccRCC) metastasis using 4 primary metastatic and 5 non-metastatic tumor samples. U133 plus 2.0 array was used to identify the diffrently expressed genes between the primary metastatic and non metastatic ccRCC samples

DESIGN
To identify differences in gene expression assoctiated with ccRCC metastasis, 4 primary metastatic and 5 non-metastatic ccRCC samples were used to perform expression profiling.
