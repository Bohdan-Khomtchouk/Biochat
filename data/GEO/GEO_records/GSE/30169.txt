TITLE
Expression of human aortic endothelial cells treated with or without oxidized phospholipids (II)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxidized phospoholipids are a pro-inflammatory component of minimally modified lipoproteins that get trapped in the subendothelial space of atherosclerotic plaques of large arteries. To model the response of endothelial cells in a pro-atherosclerotic enviroment we measured the expression in primary endothelial cells with and without treatment with oxidized phsopolipids from 96 genetically identical donors of anonymous origin. These samples are an extention of samples of similar origin deposited in GSE20060

DESIGN
Primary human aortic endothelial cells were collected from aortic heart explants of heart transplant donors and cultured in standard cell culture condiditions. At confluence, cells were treated with or without  40 ug/ml oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (Ox-PAPC) for 4 hours in media 199 containing 1% fetal bovine serum. After 4 hours, the cells were collected for RNA extraction and quantification of transcripts via microarrays. Application of electronic probe mask (HT_U133Amsk.cdf) on raw data.
