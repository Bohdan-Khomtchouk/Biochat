TITLE
Bactrocera dorsalis Gene expression

ORGANISM
Bactrocera dorsalis

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA sequencing was performed on a laboratory colony of B. dorsalis with a focus on attempting to capture as many genes in the sequencing from throughout the entire developmental life history. De novo assembly and analysis of the resulting sequence

DESIGN
One sample each for the egg, larvae, pupae, adult male, adult female and mated female life stages was sequenced.
