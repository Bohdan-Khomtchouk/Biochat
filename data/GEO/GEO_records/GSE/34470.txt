TITLE
TAF15 protein regulates CDKN1A through miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TAF15 (formerly TAFII68) is a member of the TET family of RNA and DNA binding proteins whose genes are frequently translocated in sarcomas. Consistent with a functional role in cell viability, TAF15 depletion had a growth-inhibitory effect and increased apoptosis. Interestingly, one of the genes affected by TAF15 depletion is CDKN1A/p21, a key regulator of cell cycle. Here we show that TAF15 down-regulates CDKN1A/p21 expression through a pathway involving miRNAs.

DESIGN
We performed a gene expression profiling upon TAF15 knock down by RNA interference.Total RNAs purified from four biological replicates of HeLa GL3 luc cells transfected either with si-TAF15 or control  si-LUC were hybridized to the array.
