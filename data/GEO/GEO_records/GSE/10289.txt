TITLE
Cells silenced for SDHB expression and tumor phenotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effect of SDHB silencing using siRNA methodologies in the tumor phenotype We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression when SDHB is silenced. Keywords: siRNA experiment (loss of function)

DESIGN
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B was stably silenced with control or SDHB-specific siRNAs
