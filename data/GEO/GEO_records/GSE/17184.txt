TITLE
ConA-induced fulminant hepatitis in a mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of  this experiment was to investigate the early mechanisms of human fulminant hepatitis through ConA-induced hepatitis model.Early diagnosis and interventions are important for patients with fulminant hepatitis and gene expression may be pivotal in the early diagnosis. Keyword :ConA-induced hepatitis model

DESIGN
ConA was injected through the mouse caudal vein at one of 4 time points (0 hr, 1 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr). The effects of ConA treatment on hepatic gene expression at these time points were analyzed .There are 3 replicates  at each timepoint  then  4*3=12 samples in all.
