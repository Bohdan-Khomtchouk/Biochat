TITLE
Comparative Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Cellular Dosimetry and Response in Mice by the Inhalation and Liquid Cell Culture Exposure Routes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular impact of SPIO nanoparticle inhalation exposure on lung tissue. Transcriptional responses were measured by global microarray analysis of mouse lung.

DESIGN
Male Balb/c mice were exposed to aerosolized SPIO nanoparticles using a nano-aerosol generation and inhalation system . Exposure was performed using two groups of 30 male Balb/c mices (60 total).  One group of 30 was exposed to aerosolized SPIO nanopartic
