TITLE
MYBL2/CREB1-Dependent Distinct FoxA1 Cistrome Directs G1/S Cell Cycle Progression in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FoxA1, in conjunction with MYBL2 and CREB1, governs G1/S cell-cycle transition in androgen-independent prostate cancer .

DESIGN
FoxA1 whole genome ChIP-on-chip was performed in an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line abl. Whole genome binding sites were compared between these two cell lines.
