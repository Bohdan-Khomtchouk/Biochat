TITLE
Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) Inhibits Wnt/β-catenin Signaling in the Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of PEDF knockout livers revealed induction of pathways associated with experimental and human HCC and a transcriptional profile characterized by Wnt/β-catenin activation Genome-wide expression analysis of liver tissue of wild type vs PEDF knockout animals fed high fat diet

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from whole liver tissue
