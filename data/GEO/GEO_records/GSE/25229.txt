TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of unbalanced chromosomal changes in colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is often characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) which has been associated with a poor prognosis. Disease-related de novo methylation often causes gene repression that may complement chromosomal losses or mutations. To compare CpG island methylation and chromosomal abnormalities in colorectal cancer, we determineded unbalanced chromosomal changes by aCGH of CRCs that were also profiled for aberrant de novo DNA methylation at 23,000 CpG islands of the human genome (Gebhard et al. 2010; and unpublished data). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
