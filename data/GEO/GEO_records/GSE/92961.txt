TITLE
Characterization by gene expression arrays of the human CRC populations according to the Ki67 and Lgr5 expression levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In normal intestine, Lgr5 are a pool of rapidly dividing stem cells that gives rise to the whole intestinal crypts. Here we have labelled both Lgr5 and Ki67 genes with fluorescent markers by means of CRISPR/Cas9 in human patient derived organoids (PDO).

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from Lgr+Ki67+, Lgr5+Ki67-, Lgr5-Ki67+ and Lgr5-Ki67- populations sorted by FACS

PLATFORM
