TITLE
ChIP-chip from HEK293-RPF-1 stable transfectants expressing the HA-tagged RPF-1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RPF-1 binds promoters of genes modulated by its induction in HEK/RPF-1 transfectant Chromatin IP (ChIP) combined to chromatin array analysis (ChIP-chip) shows that RPF-1 transcription factor bind to promoter elements of genes repressed or activated by RPF-1 expression

DESIGN
Comparison of cells induced for RPF-1 expression (Tet-) over uninduced control cells (Tet+)

PLATFORM
