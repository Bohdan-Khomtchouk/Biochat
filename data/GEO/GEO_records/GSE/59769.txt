TITLE
A large-scale, in vivo transcription factor screen defines bivalent chromatin as a key property of regulatory factors mediating Drosophila wing development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq to map enrichment of histone modifications and RNA polymerase II DNA occupancy in imaginal wing discs at 120 h of development.

DESIGN
The following antibodies (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, USA) were used in this study: ab6002: anti-Histone H3 (tri methyl K27); ab28940: anti-Histone H3 (mono+di+tri methyl K79); ab8895: anti-Histone H3 (mono methyl K4); ab6000: anti-Histone H3 (di+tri methyl K4); ab4729: anti-Histone H3 (acetyl K27) antibody; a mix (1:1) of ab5408 and ab817: anti RNA-polymerase II-CTD.

PLATFORM
