TITLE
Alternative NF-kB pathway hierarchy defines a DNA-binding network in Hodgkin Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NF-kB transcription factors regulate different sets of genes in distinct germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas. ChIP-Seq and expression array data merged showed that Rel-B hierarchical network defined HL and cRel hierarchical network characterized DLBCL.

DESIGN
We sequenced the inmunoprecipitated DNA fragments by Rel-A, Rel-B, cRel, p50 and p52 antibodies in human cell lines representing Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma as well as in human primary centroblasts. Raw data files are not available for this series because they were not provided by the sequencing facility and no longer exist.

PLATFORM
