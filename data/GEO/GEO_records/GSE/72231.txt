TITLE
Preadult life history variation determines adult transcriptome expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila mojavensis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome transcription expression level changes in Drosophila mojavensis wild-type populations (Las Bocas:LB and Punta Prieta:PP). The experiment was designed to investigate preadult life history affects over adult transcriptome expression.

DESIGN
A total of 137 hybridizations were performed in this entire experiment. We used 135K 12-plex NimbleGen arrays. Total RNA was recovered from each sample listed below. The experimental design consisted a total of two populations (Las Bocas:LB; Punta Prieta:PP),  two host diets (Agria:AG and Organ pipe:OP) and four " length of egg to adult development time " points, i.e. 14, 15, 16, and 17 days. (14 days:D1; 15 days:D2; 16 days:D3; 17 days:D4). Each chip measures the expression level of 14528 transcripts. One to 5 replicates were used for each type (R1, R2, R3 etc.). Fly source details are as follows: Las Bocas 2009: LB09; Punta Prieta 2008:PP08.
