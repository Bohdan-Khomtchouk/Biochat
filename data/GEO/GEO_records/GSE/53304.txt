TITLE
Deep sequencing reveals divergent expression patterns within the small RNA transcriptomes of cultured and vegetative tissues of sugarcane

ORGANISM
Saccharum sp.

SUMMARY
We report the deep sequencing of small RNA populations derived from apex, internode 3, internode 6, internode 16, leaf +3, calli and suspesion cells from sugarcane cultivar Q117

DESIGN
Each vegetative tissue was sampled from three independent field grown plants, pooled and sequenced using the GAIIx platform. Calli and suspension cell cultures were sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL18064 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Saccharum sp.) GPL18065 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharum sp.)
