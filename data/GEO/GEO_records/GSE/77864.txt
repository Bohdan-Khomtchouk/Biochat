TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of tdc cluster delection mutant of Enterococcus faecalis V583

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
The aim was to study the transcriptional profiling of the tdc cluster delection mutant E. faecalis V583 Δtdc (non-tyramine producer) compared to the wild type strain E. faecalis V583 (tyramine producer). We compared the expression profile of the strains grown in M17 medium with glucose as carbon source and suplemented with tyrosine.

DESIGN
E. faecalis V583 Δtdc cells (test) compared with E. faecalis V583 cells (reference). Both strains grown in GM17 medium suplemented 15 mM tyrosine.
