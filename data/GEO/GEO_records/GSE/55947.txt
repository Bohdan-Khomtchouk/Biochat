TITLE
SUV420H2 over-expression affects on gene expression in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells stably over-expressing SUV420H2, a histone H4K20 methyltransferase. Several genes were significantly up- or down-regulated. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which H4K20me3 contributes to gene expression.

DESIGN
SUV420H2 stably over-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were cloned. Then total RNA was extracted from the SUV420H2 over-expressing cells and the parental MDA-MB-231 cells.
