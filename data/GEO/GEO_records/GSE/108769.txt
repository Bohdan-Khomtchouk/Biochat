TITLE
Histone variant H3.3-mediated chromatin remodeling is essential for paternal genome activation in mouse preimplantation embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3.3-mediated paternal chromatin remodeling is essential for the development of preimplantation embryos and the activation of the paternal genome during embryogenesis.

DESIGN
We collected embryos of WT, mH3.3KD and H3.3-addback at 50h after ICSI (8-cell or 16-cell stage). RNA-seq results confirmed excellent knockdown of both H3.3A and H3.3B mRNAs in mH3.3KD and H3.3-addback embryos.
