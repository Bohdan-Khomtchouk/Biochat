TITLE
Multi-Omic Integrated networks connect DNA methylation and miRNA with skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in type 2 diabetic obesity [Methylation data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle DNA methylation from type 2 diabetic volunteers before and after 16 weeks of chronic exercise training (two groups, one undergoing aerobic excercise and the other resistance training exercise)

DESIGN
A biopsy was collected from the right Vastus Lateralis under local anaesthesia andGenomic DNA was extracted from 5-10 mg muscle, Bisulphite conversion (Illumina) was checked using methylation specific PCR. 4 Î¼l of bisulphite-converted DNA was used for hybridization on Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip (Illumina)
