TITLE
Expression data of mouse embyonic fibroblasts established from Phgdh KO embryos (KO-MEFs) cultured with or without L-Ser

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
L-Ser deficiency leads to growth arrest, tissue malformation and embryonic lethality in mice. However, the molecular mechanism by which L-Ser deficiency impairs basic cellular function remains largely unexplored. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in KO-MEFs cultured with presence or absence of L-Ser, and tried to understand the underlying mechanism of growth-arrested phenotype of KO mice/MEFs elicited by L-Ser deficiency.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from KO-MEFs after 6 h incubation in L-Ser-depleted or -supplemented conditions and was purified. Three biological replicates for each treatment were used for amplification and labeling for microarray chip hybridization.
