TITLE
Expression data from Adipose Stem Cells (ASC) from morbidly obese and non-obese individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The adipose tissue is an endocrine regulator and a risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease when by excessive accumulation induces obesity. Although the adipose tissue is also a reservoir for stem cells (ASC) their function and “stemcellness” has been questioned. Our aim was to investigate the mechanisms by which obesity affects subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) stem cells. We used microarrays to analyze differences in transcriptomic profiles between the adipose stem cells from morbidly obese and non-obese individuals.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous white adipose tissues that were obtained during bariatric surgery (Obese) or liposuction (Lean) were donated by patients after obtaining informed consent. Three cases with BMI > 40 kg/m2 (ASCmo) and three controls with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (ASCn) were selected and processed extracting total RNA, processing and hybridizating on microarrays.
