TITLE
A polyadenylation factor subunit implicated in regulating oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The oxt6 mutant is an oxidative stress-tolerant Arabidopsis mutant that is deficient in a polyadenylation factor subunit.  Expression analysis suggests that impaired poly(A) site choice is responsible for the stress-tolerant phenotype. We used microarrays to understand the link between the polyadenylation defect and stress tolerance. Keywords: mutant, wild-type, complemented line comparison
