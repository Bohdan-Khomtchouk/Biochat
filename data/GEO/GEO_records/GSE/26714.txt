TITLE
Expression data from Tregs adoptively transferred in MHC II competent or deficient recipients

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Disruption of TCR /MHC class II interactions leads rapidly to alterations of the common CD4 Treg transcriptional signature Self-deprived, non-functional Tregs were compare to fully functional Tregs by microarrays.

DESIGN
Total T cells from the periphery of WT mice were adoptively transferred  into CD3Îµ-/- recipient mice lacking or not MHC class II molecule expression (MHC II- or MHC II+ recipient mice, respectively). Five days later, peripheral Tregs transferred in MHC II - competent (CD4CD25B6) or - deficient (CD4CD25IIko) recipient were purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
