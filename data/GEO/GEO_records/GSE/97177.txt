TITLE
Genome-wide multi-omics profiling reveals extensive genetic complexity in 8p11-p12 amplified breast carcinomas [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of human breast tumors. Genomic and expression profiling using 38K BAC array-CGH and Illumina HT-12 beadchips were performed on 53 invasive breast tumors to assess the impact of gene dosage on gene expression patterns and the effect of other mechanisms on transcriptional levels. Array-CGH results was validated by FISH using tumors showing 8p11-p12 DNA amplification and expression profiling was confirmed using qPCR for 11 transcripts. Low-level gain, high-level gain/amplification, heterozygous loss and homozygous deletion (henceforth referred to as gain, amplification, loss and deletion) were defined as log2 ratio thresholds set at +0.2, > = +0.5,  -0.2 and < =-1.0, respectively.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen tissue samples

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
