TITLE
Expression data from maize endosperm

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Despite much knowledge is well-known on the transcriptional and enzymological regulation of  many genes in starch synthesis, including SBEâ…¡b, Waxy, and SUS-SH1 genes, less information is available on their expression profiles as a consequence of their dysfunction. Hence, transcriptional adjustments in response to mutations were required for a better understanding of starch biosynthesis pathway, others metabolism and cell response. We used microarrays to detail the transcriptional adjustments in the endosperms of ae wx and sh1 at 15 days after pollination (DAP) compared to B73.

DESIGN
Maize endosperms at 15 DAP were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain  homologic endosperms of middle ears in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles.
