TITLE
Histone H2B K111A

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by histone H2B K111A mutant.

DESIGN
Comparison of genes whose mRNA levels are affected in a histone H2B K111A mutant yeast strain compared to wild-type yeast strain.
