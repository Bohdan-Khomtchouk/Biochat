TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Deletion RAD50, MRE11, XRS2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Deletion mutants of the yeast MRX complex (Rad50, Mre11 and Xrs2) were studied for gene expression levels. Significant difference in expression levels was observed in genes pertaining to DNA damage, cell cycle etc. as compared to the BY4741 wild type.
