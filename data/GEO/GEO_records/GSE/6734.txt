TITLE
piRNA libraries from Drosophila melanogaster ovaries

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5â€™ end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs, may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci. Keywords: small RNA libraries from Drosophila ovaries

DESIGN
small RNAs (23-29nt) were isolated from total ovarian RNA or from immunopreciptated Piwi/Aubergine/Ago3 complexes. cDNA libraries were constructed after Pfeffer et al. 2005 (Nat. Methods) and sequenced at 454 Life Sciences. The used strain is OregonR. Only sequences matching the Release5 genome assembly (www.fruitfly.org) are considered.
