TITLE
Effect of PPAR Gamma Agonist Rosiglitazone on Carotid Artery Gene Expression after Knockout of Retinol Binding Protein 7 (RBP7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the role of retinol binding protein 7 (RBP7) in PPAR gamma mediated regulation of target gene expression in the carotid artery, RNA-Seq was used to quantitate gene expression in carotid artery from both wild-type and RBP7 knockout mice after ligand-mediated activation of PPAR gamma with Rosiglitazone.

DESIGN
Carotid artery were removed from wild-type (WT) and RBP7 knockout (KO) mice and treated with either Rosliglitazone (ROSI, 10 uM) or vehicle DMSO (CONT) for 24 hrs.

PLATFORM
