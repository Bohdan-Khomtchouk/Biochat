TITLE
50 ppm Patulin treatment for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Patulin, 4-hydroxy-4H-furo[3,2c]pyran-2(6H)-one, is one of the most popular and characterized mycotoxin observed in agricultural products. However the mechnisims of toxicity by this chemical is not well understood.  Thus, we characterized the cytotoxicity of patulin using yeast transcriptome systems.  The expression profile of mRNA after exposure yeast cells to patulin was similar to those after the treatment by antifungal agricultural chemicals such as thiuram, maneb, and zeneb.   The Patulin treatment activated protein degradation especially proteasome activities, sulfur amino acid metabolisms, and oxidative stress defense system.  DNA alkylation damages was also suggested and this seems to be repaired by recombinational and excision repair mechanism.  We also list the indicator genes for the detection of patulin in agricultura product. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Series containes 3 independent experiments and high and low power scanns for each independent experiment.
