TITLE
Effect of enzyme IIANtr on gene expression in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Enzyme IIANtr (encoded by ptsN gene) is a component of the nitrogen phosphotransferase system (PTS). It has previously been shown that the dephosphorylated form of EIIANtr is required for the derepression of ilvBN encoding acetohydroxy acid synthase I (AHAS I) catalyzing the first step common to biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Here we examine the effect of deletion of ptsN gene on global gene expression by microarray analysis. Most of the genes down-regulated in a ptsN mutant are controlled by sigma 70, while all the up-regulated genes are controlled by sigma S. As intracellular levels of sigma factors in the ptsN mutant were similar to those of the wild-type strain, this implied that the balance of sigma activities is modified by ptsN deletion.
