Differences found in expression of cell surface

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
A comparison of " maturing " and " prespawn " ovarian and testicular transciptomes was performed to determine the genes that are involved in regulating gametic and accessory cell function during maturation and development of the rainbow trout gonad.  To identify some fo the genes involved in these processee, total RNA was compared between three-year-old normal vs two-year-old normal (maturing) and three-year-old normal vs two-year-old precocious (prespawn) gonadal tissue.
