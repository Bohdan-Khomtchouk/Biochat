Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3201 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: Analysis of copy number variation across modENCODE Drosophila cell line by high throughput sequencing.  We observe numerous copy number variations for the different cell lines, with each cell line having a distinct ploidy signature. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: deep sequencing analysis. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Cell Line: CME-W1-Cl.8+; Tissue: dorsal mesothoracic disc; Developmental Stage: third instar larval stage; Sex: Male;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Cell Line CME-W1-Cl.8+ In this experiment, there is no ChIP step. Simply separate the polytene dna from the tissue (cell line) and seq them, if more reads (than other regions) then they are the CNV regions. Two independent samples were merged to generate the single wiggle file.

PLATFORM
