TITLE
Characterization of gene expression in trigeminal nerves of BDIX, BDIV, BDIX.BDIV-Mss4a and BDIX.BDIV-Mss4d rats of both sexes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes being differentially expressed between a) female and male rats within each strain and b) tumor susceptible and tumor resistant strains using Microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Isolation of total RNA from pooled untreated trigeminal nerves of 85 day old rats and gene expression analyses using RatRef-12-v1 and GenomeStudio 2010.

PLATFORM
GPL6101 Illumina ratRef-12 v1.0 expression beadchip
