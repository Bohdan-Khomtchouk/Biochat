TITLE
Gene expression analysis of murine peritoneal macrophages deficient for SAMHD1 and IFNAR

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the contribution of type-1 IFN signalling to the upregulation of IFN- stimulated genes in SAMHD1-deficient cells, we performed global gene expression analysis of SAMHD1-deficient IFNAR-/- macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from ten SAMHD1-deficient IFNAR-/-  and six SAMHD1-deficient controls were FACS sorted. RNA was subjected to next generation mRNA sequencing.
