TITLE
Androgen receptor splice variants mediate enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to compare the gene expression programs mediated by androgen/AR vs. constitutively active, truncated AR variants in castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cells.  Because constitutive activity of truncated AR variants can mask androgen/AR target genes, the androgen/AR transcriptional program was assessed by silencing the trucnated AR 1/2/3/CE3 variant with siRNA targeting AR exon CE3 and treating cells with vehicle (ethanol) or 1nM DHT.  Similarly, because full-length AR activity can mask truncated AR variant target genes, the AR variant transcriptional program was assessed under castrate conditions by selectively silencing full-length AR with siRNA targeting AR exon 7, and comparing this profile with CWR-R1 cells transfected wtih siRNA targeting AR exon 1, which silences all AR expression (full-length and truncated AR variants).

DESIGN
CWR-R1 cells were maintained under castrate conditions in long term culture in order to enrich for the population of cells harboring a 48kb intragenic deletion in AR intron 1.  These late-passage CWR-R1 cells were electroporated with siRNAs targeting AR exon 1, AR exon 7, or AR exon CE3.  Electroporated cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics and 5% charcoal-stripped, steroid-depleted medium and allowed to recover for 48h.  After this 48h recovery, electroporated cells were switched to serum-free RPMI 1640 with 1nM DHT or 0.1% ethanol (vehicle control) for an additional 24h prior to extraction of total RNA.  Three independent biological replicates were performed.
