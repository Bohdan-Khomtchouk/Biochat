TITLE
Differential gene expression profiling of MIHA cells transfected with C-terminal truncated HBx mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the differentially expressed transcriptomes between MIHA cells transfected with empty vector control or different C-terminal truncated HBx mutants (14 or 35 amino acid carboxyl-terminal truncation - i.e. d14 and d35)

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MIHA cells stably overexpressing empty vector control or different C-terminal truncated HBx mutants (delta 14 and delta 35) were generated by PolyA mRNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform
