TITLE
cms4:19 and at chr3-Comparing nuclear gene expression in two CMS-systems using microarray technology

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
ra05-11_cmsrapeseed - cms4:19 and at chr3 - -To understand how/if fertility and the mitochondrial background are interlinked. -To understand how the mitochondrial background influences the nuclear gene expression. -Compare and describe the total nuclear gene expression of CMS vs. fertile and CMS vs. Restored. -Describe and analyse genes that differ in expression (of special interest are genes that differs in both comparisons). -Group genes e.g. floral genes, highly expressed genes, transcription factors, nuclear encoded genes targeted for the mitochondrion. -Comparing two CMS-systems to elucidate differences and similarities between them.  - Flower buds from four different B. napus lines (fertile cv Hanna, CMS-line 4:19, restored line 46, cv Hanna with the additon of A. thaliana chr 3) at two developmental stages (stages 0-5 and stage 8). Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison
