TITLE
MicroRNA expression in DU145 sublines metastatic to lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of non-coding RNA profiling by array in sublines of DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines created by in vivo cycling Cell lines created by removal and growth of metastatic human DU145 tumor cells from mouse lymph node (metastasized from prostate xenograft) for LN cells and extracted from lung after intravenous injection (ivLU cells). Cell line numebr represented number of in vivo cycles of metastatic selection

DESIGN
Six condition experiment, individual cell line for each sample on array

PLATFORM
GPL7723 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.11.0 - hsa, mmu & rno
