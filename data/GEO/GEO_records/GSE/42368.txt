TITLE
p53-dependent regulation of gene expression following DNA damage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are prevalent genes with frequently exquisite regulation but mostly unknown functions. Here we demonstrate a role of lncRNAs in guiding signal transduction. DNA damage activates transcription of DINO (Damage Induced NOncoding) via p53. DINO knockdown blocks DNA damage-induced gene expression and cell cycle arrest. Conversely, enforced expression of DINO activates damage signaling without DNA damage. DINO binds p53 and selectively promotes SET7 methylation of p53 at lysine 372 over other substrates, which stabilizes p53 in an auto-amplification loop. Our results suggest that inducible lncRNA can achieve catalysis-like effects to rewire cellular signaling networks.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from human fetal lung fibroblasts, HCT116 p53+/+, or HCT116 p53-/- cells  treated with doxorubicin or sham for 26 hours. Human fetal lung fibroblasts were transfected with siRNAs targeting DINO or non-targeting control and subsequently treated with doxorubicin for 26 hours.
