TITLE
Effects of LKB1/STK11 expression on MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pcDNA-vector or pcDNA-LKB1 were analyzed for changes in gene expression. Results provide insight into genes regulated by LKB1 signaling with implications in tumor and metastasis suppression in breast cancer.

DESIGN
4 samples, duplicates of -vector and -LKB1 stable cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
