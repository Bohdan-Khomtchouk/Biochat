TITLE
DNF7 is required for the persistence of rhizobia in the nitrogen fixation zoneÂ 

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We compare the transcription profile Using Solid5500XL-S system between the  wild-type A17 and DNF7 null mutant Medicago truncatula genontype after 17 days of inoculation with S. meliloti WSM419.

DESIGN
RnaSeq analysis were performed in A17 and 6V genotype
