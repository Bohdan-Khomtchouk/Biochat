TITLE
Gene expression based identification of potential genes involved in Fanconi anemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fanconi anemia is a rare inherited hematological disorder which commonly presents with bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities and susceptibility to cancer with high rates of prevalence in ethnic populations.  The objective of this study was to identify potential genes that aid in the progression of the disease or produce its principal symptoms and to hypothesize enabling roles for certain genes that are not part of the central molecular machinery causing the disease.

DESIGN
A total of 2 Fanconi anemia samples were collected from patients who displayed characteristic FA features. All of them gave positive results for the DNA breakage test after mitomycin C treatment. Samples were referred by Dr. Sheila Mohan of REFAIN (Registry for Fanconi anemia in India). Whole genome microarray analysis of peripheral blood from 2 patient samples and one normal individual. Sequential analysis of microarray data was carried out using gene ontology and pathway analysis to identify candidate genes.
