TITLE
Energy Metabolism during Anchorage-Independence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The detachment of epithelial cells, but not cancer cells, causes anoikis due to reduced energy production. Invasive tumor cells generate three splice variants of the metastasis gene osteopontin. The cancer-specific form osteopontin-c supports anchorage-independence through inducing oxidoreductases and upregulating intermediates/enzymes in the hexose monophosphate shunt, glutathione cycle, glycolysis, glycerol phosphate shuttle, and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Osteopontin-c signaling upregulates glutathione (consistent with the induction of the enzyme GPX-4), glutamine and glutamate (which can feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle). Consecutively, the cellular ATP levels are elevated. The elevated creatine may be synthesized from serine via glycine and also supports the energy metabolism by increasing the formation of ATP. Metabolic probing with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamate, or glycerol identified differentially regulated pathway components, with mitochondrial activity being redox dependent and the creatine pathway depending on glutamine. The effects are consistent with a stimulation of the energy metabolism that supports anti-anoikis. Our findings imply a synergism in cancer cells between osteopontin-a, which increases the cellular glucose levels, and osteopontin-c, which utilizes this glucose to generate energy.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MCF-7 cells transfected with  osteopontin-a, osteopontin-c and vector control were generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, by Illumina HiSeq.
