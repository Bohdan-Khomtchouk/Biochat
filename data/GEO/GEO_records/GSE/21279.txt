TITLE
Small RNA Solexa sequencing of human liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied small RNA Solexa sequencing technology to identify microRNA expression in human liver samples from surgically removed liver tissues including three normal liver tissues (distal normal liver tissue of liver hemangioma), an hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected liver, a severe chronic hepatitis B liver, two HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC, and an HCC without HBV or HCV infection. All samples were collected with the informed consent of the patients and the experiments were approved by the ethics committee of Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China. We investigated the miRNome in human normal liver and suggested some deregulated abundantly expressed microRNAs in HCC. center_name: National Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology & Institute of Immunology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNome in human liver samples from surgically removed liver tissues including three normal liver tissues (distal normal liver tissue of liver hemangioma), an hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected liver tissue, a severe chronic hepatitis B liver tissue, an HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and adjacent liver tissues of different regions,an HBV-related HCC tissue and adjacent liver tissue, an hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC tissue and adjacent liver tissue, and an HCC without HBV or HCV infection and adjacent liver tissue. All 15 human liver tissue samples.
