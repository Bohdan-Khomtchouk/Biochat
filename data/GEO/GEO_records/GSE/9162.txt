TITLE
Major differences in gene expression profiles revealed in day-25 trophoblast but not embryonic discs from cattle clones

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
To better understand the problems associated with cloning, gene expression profiling of AI- and SCNT-derived bovine (day 25 of pregnancy) fetuses was performed.  The embryonic disc and the extraembryonic tissues for each fetus were analyzed separately using a bovine oligoarray. Clustering of all the expression profiles showed clustering by tissue, but no separation of AI vs. SCNT samples was observed.  Statistical analysis using a mixed model revealed 188 differentially expressed genes between the extraembryonic tissues and 10 differentially expressed genes between the embryonic discs of AI- and SCNT-derived fetuses.  Between the tissue types > 9,000 genes showed differential expression, of which 2,127 that showed > =2-fold difference in expression.  The data generated in the current experiment clearly shows that the main problem with SCNT pregnancies is related to abnormal gene expression in the extraembryonic tissues.
