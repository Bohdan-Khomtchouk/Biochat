TITLE
Expression data from mouse adrenal glands extracted from wild-type and sf1:Cre; Prkar1a Fl/Fl (KO) adrenals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prkar1a encodes one of the regulatory subunits of PKA. Prkar1a gene ablation in the adrenal cortex is associated with profound phenotypic alterations, constitutive PKA activation and reciprocal inhibition of WNT signallilng pathway We used microarrays to analyse gene expression in response to Prkar1a gene ablation

DESIGN
Adrenal glands were dissected from KO (4) and wild-type littermate (4) mice
