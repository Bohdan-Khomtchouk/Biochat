TITLE
Influence of 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T3) on differentiating progenitor cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation assays with neural progenitor cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) showed elongated neurite outgrowth under influence of 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (concentrations 50 nm and 100 nm). For analysis, neural cells were stained with TUJ1 (beta-Tubulin III). Microarray analysis should enlighten these results on a genetical basis and give hints about the regulation pathways.

DESIGN
We analyzed 2 groups with 3 samples each: 1 group consistent of cells treated with 100 nm T3 for 1 day and 1 control group consistens of cells without T3 treatment
