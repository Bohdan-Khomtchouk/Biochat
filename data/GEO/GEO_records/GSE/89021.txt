TITLE
Gene expression in matched samples of peripheral whole blood collected and processed using the PAXgene vs Tempus system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare gene expression in whole blood samples collected in PAXgene RNA or Tempus collection tubes, and processed using  the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit or Tempus Spin RNA isolation Kit, respectively.

DESIGN
Whole blood samples of 9 healthy individuals were collected into one PAXgene and one Tempus tube, and total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit and the Tempus Spin RNA Isolation Kit, respectively. Total RNA concentrations were determined and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Reagent Kit (Agilent).  One color microarray analysis was performed using the SurePrint G3 Human Gene expression 8Ã—60K one-color microarray kit (Agilent Technologies) and the Low input QuickAmp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to manufacturer's instructions.

PLATFORM
