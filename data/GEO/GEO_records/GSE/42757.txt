TITLE
Adult stem cells in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
RNAseq experiments to identify gene expression changes following gamma irradiation

DESIGN
Adult male Schistosoma mansoni (strain: NMRI) were subjected to 200 Gy of  gamma irradiation and cultured in vitro for 48hr hours.  After 48hr germ line tissues were removed and RNA was extracted from remaining somatic tissues.  Samples were processed for RNAseq using Illumina procedures.
