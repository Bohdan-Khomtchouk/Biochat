TITLE
Prediction and Testing of Novel Transcriptional Networks Regulating Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Commitment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model to study the signaling mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and commitment to differentiation. We hypothesized that genes critical to stem cell fate would be dynamically regulated at the initiation of commitment. Time course microarray analysis following initiation of commitment led us to propose a model of ESC maintenance in which highly regulated transcription factors and chromatin remodeling genes (down-regulated in our time course) maintain repression of genes responsible for cell differentiation, morphogenesis and development (up-regulated in our time course). Microarrays of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 shRNA knockdown cell lines confirmed predicted regulation of target genes.  shRNA knockdowns of candidate genes were tested in a novel high throughput screen of self-renewal, confirming their role in ESC pluripotency. We have identified genes that are critical for self-renewal and those that initiate commitment and developed draft transcriptional networks that control self-renewal and early development. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Gene expression in Oct4 knockdown, Sox2 knockdown and their empty vector contol ES cells was analyzed.
