TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in subventricular zone after stroke: miR-124a regulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells through Notch signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression data of miRNAs from adult neural progenitor cells in subventricular zone after stroke.

DESIGN
Genome-wide profilings of miRNAs were measured in cultured non-ischemic (N=3) and ischemic SVZ (N=3) neural progenitor cells using miRNA microarray.
