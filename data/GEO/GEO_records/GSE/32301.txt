TITLE
Expression profiling of RBM38-knocked down and control MCF7 cells with and without doxorubicin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of MCF-7 cells transfected with a scramble or RBM38 siRNA and incubated with or without doxorubicin. The hypothesis tested in the present study was to assess the impact of RBM38 depletion on gene expression of normal growing and doxorubicin-stressed MCF-7 cells. Results provide information about doxorubicin and/or RBM38-responsive genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated MCF-7 cells transfected with a scramble or RBM38 siRNA (72h) and incubated with or without doxorubicin (24h).
