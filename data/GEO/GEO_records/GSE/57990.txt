TITLE
Polycomb group proteins adjust the threshold for retinoic acid mediated signaling during early proximal-distal patterning in forelimb development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a pivotal role in epigenetically silencing development-related genes, restricting their expression to appropriate tissues. However, in some instances PcG target genes must also be dynamically regulated in response to developmental signals encountered during morphogenesis. Here we examine the role of PcG factors in early forelimb bud patterning, a process that relies on various morphogenetic signals. Depletion of Ring1 proteins, which are essential components of Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1), led to dramatic deficiencies in forelimb formation and proximal-distal regionalization. Gene expression analysis identified Meis2 and Meis1 as critical PRC1 targets genes in early distal specification, with PcG proteins counteracting retinoic acid (RA) signaling to control their expression. Importantly, in this system, PcG factors appear to function by adjusting the threshold for RA signaling, revealing an unexpected role of polycomb proteins in dynamic gene regulation during development.
