TITLE
Mouse in vitro fertilized four-cell stage embryos: High hydrostatic pressure (HP) treated vs. Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse oocytes were treated with 20 MPa hydrostatic pressure for 60 minutes at 37 Â°C. The HHP treated oocytes and their untreated controls were fertilized by ICSI and cultured till four-cell stage, when the transcription profiling experiment was performed.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, Four-cell stage embryos from HP treated oocytes vs. four-cell stage embryos from control oocytes. Biological replicates: 3 HP treated replicates, 3 control replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
