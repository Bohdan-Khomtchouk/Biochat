TITLE
Expression analysis of laser cut germaria vs laser cut apex of testes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we used laser cutting microdissection and RNA amplification to profile the gene expression in wildtype female germaria and male apex of the testes.  These tissue contain germline stem cells and early dividing germ cells.  Our goal was to identify genes expressed in these cell types.

DESIGN
A direct microarray design of laser cut germaria vs laser cut apex of testes.  Four biological replicates are included with two dye-swaps.
