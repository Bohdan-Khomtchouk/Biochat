TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of chromatin landscape in cerebellar granule cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped the binding sites of Chd7 in cerebellar granule cells, and compared with the pattern of H3K27ac. To examine the impact of Chd7 loss to Top2b binding, we mapped the binding sites of Top2b in control and Chd7 mutant cells

DESIGN
Examine the binding pattern of Chd7, H3K27ac and Top2b

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
