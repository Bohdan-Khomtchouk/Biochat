TITLE
Global gene expression profile of INS1E cells, hIAPP-INS1E cells and rIAPP-INS1E cells.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is the main component of amyloid deposits in type 2 diabetic patients. Cells overexpressing the human transcript of IAPP (hIAPP) present defects in insulin secretion. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from the rat pancreatic beta-cells INS1E stably transfected with human (hIAPP) or rat (rIAPP) IAPP, which lead to the overexpression of the different variants of IAPP protein. We also include INS1E cells with empty vector as control.

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed from 3 INS1E clones stably transfected with different IAPP transcripts.
