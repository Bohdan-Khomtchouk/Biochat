TITLE
Short-term Activin A and BMP4 stimulation experiments with human ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was carried out to identify the short-term effects of Activin A and BMP4 stimulation on gene expression in human embryonic stem cells grown in a chemically defined medium. Keywords: Growth factor stimulation experiment

DESIGN
hES cells were adapted to chemically defined medium, replated, and, three days after passaging, stimulated with either recombinant Activin A or BMP4. Data are from independent experiments (distinct non-stimulated controls for Activin A and BMP4 experiments - two biological replicates each).
