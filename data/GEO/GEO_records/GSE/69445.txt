TITLE
Crohn's disease risk variant in GPR65 alters lysosomal function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using an siRNA screen we identify a role for GPR65 in the defense against intracellular pathogens. Epithelial cells and macrophages lacking GPR65 exhibited impaired clearance of intracellular bacteria as well as an accumulation of aberrant phagosomes and lysosomes. Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in genes associated with lysosomal function.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT or Gpr65-/- mice were harvested for RNA analysis.
