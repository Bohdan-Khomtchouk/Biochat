TITLE
Aspergillus fumigatus transcriptome under normoxia and hypoxia conditions

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
To better understand the effect of hypoxia, RNA-Seq technology was used to profile the Aspergillus fumigatus during adaptation to hypoxia at 12, 24 and 36 h time points.

DESIGN
Four samples examined: from the fungus grown under normoxia and hypoxia conditions
