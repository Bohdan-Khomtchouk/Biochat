TITLE
Hydroxymethylation at gene regulatory regions directs stem cell commitment during erythropoiesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells were differentiated into erythroid lineage. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of 5hmC affinity pulldown and RNAseq were performed in four time point of different stages of erythroid differentiation.

DESIGN
4 RNA-Seq Samples (d0, d3, d7 and d10); 4 affinity-pulldown  (d0, d3, d7 and d10), and 4 input samples  (d0, d3, d7 and d10).

PLATFORM
