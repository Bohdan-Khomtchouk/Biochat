TITLE
Characterization of a Medicago truncatula P450 monooxygenase mutant

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to characterise a P450 monooxygenase mutant involved in the biosynthetic pathway of haemolytic saponins. Saponins are a group of glycosidic compounds with an antimicrobial function. The gene CYP716A12 is responsible for an early step in saponin biosythesis. Transcriptome analysis of a CYP716A12 mutant was performed to investigate its function.

DESIGN
6 samples were used in the experiment: 3 biological replicates of CYP716A12 mutant plants and 3 biological replicates of wild-type plants.
