TITLE
Identifying alterations of gene expression induced by two teratogenic agents which induce a similar phenotype

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samples used for hybridization consisted of non-pooled (NP) RNA extracts from 8 groups in each of two time periods after drug administration: oil vehicle treated control embryonic limb bud mesoderm and ectoderm, phosphate buffered saline vehicle control embryonic limb bud mesoderm and ectoderm, acetazolamide treated embryonic limb bud mesoderm and ectoderm, and cadmium sulfate treated embryonic limb bud mesoderm and ectoderm. Forty-eight hybridization experiments were on non-pooled (NP) individual RNA extracts. Keywords: Cadmium or Acetazolamide drug course over time in embryonic limb mesoderm and ectoderm.
