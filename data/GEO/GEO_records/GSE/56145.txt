TITLE
Changes in granulosa cells gene expression associated with growth, plateau and atretic phases in medium bovine follicles.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Granulosa cells originating from three different phases of antral follicle growth were compared: growing (G), plateau (P) and atresia (A), as categorized by flow cytometry profiles of DNA. The growing and atretic conditions were each hybridized against the plateau condition as a reference in order to understand the specific biological mechanisms modulated in this class of follicles.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Plateau, Growing vs Atretic granulosa cells. Biological replicates: 4 . Dye-swap experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
