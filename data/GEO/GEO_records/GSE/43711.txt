TITLE
OsMOM1 regulated genes in rice: Control transgenic vs OsMOM1a/b double knockdown transgenic

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of young leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) comparing a control transgenic line transformed with p*7GWIWG2(I)-hpt with a double knockdown transgenic line of OsMOM1 genes. Rice has two orthologues (OsMOM1a and OsMOM1b) of Arabidopsis MOM1 gene, which transduces RNA-directed DNA methylation signals to repressive histone modification. To obtain the double knockdown line, at first, single knockdown lines for each OsMOM1 gene were produced with transformation using p*7GWIWG2(I)-hpt-OsMOM1a or p*7GWIWG2(I)-hpt-OsMOM1b. Then a double knockdown plant was selected from progenies of a sexual cross between the single knockdown lines. Both OsMOM1 constructs produce hairpin RNAs and efficiently silence the both target OsMOM1 genes. In the double knockdown line, neither of transcripts from OsMOM1 genes was detected with RNA blot. The double knockdown line might make levels of epigenetic marks (DNA and histone modifications) modified. Goal was to determine the effects of epigenetic change by knockdown of OsMOM1 genes on global gene expression in rice genome.
