TITLE
RNAseq of memory cocktail versus IL-2 grown OT-I CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytotoxic T cells are typically expanded ex vivo for adoptive immunotherapy by culture with IL-2.  This culture period leads to a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of effector function, as well as a loss of in vivo proliferative capability and anti-tumor efficacy. Here, we report antigen-specific and polyclonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells in a cocktail of cytokines and small molecules that leads to a memory-like phenotype in mouse and human cells even during extended culture, leading to enhanced in vivo expansion and tumor control.

DESIGN
OT-I CD8 T cells were cultured for 14 days in either IL-2 or a cocktail of memory inducing small molecules and cytokines (IL-7, IL-21, 2-deoxyglucose and TWS119). Populations were sorted, IL-2 cells were CD44+CD62L-, cocktail cells were sorted into CD44+CD62L-, CD44+CD62L+ and CD44lowCD62L+ populations, and naive OT-I cells were CD44-CD62L+. Total RNA was extracted from each population and prepared for sequencing as three technical replicates.
