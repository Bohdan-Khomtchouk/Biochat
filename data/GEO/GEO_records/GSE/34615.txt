TITLE
Ovarian cancer cell lines [Baseline profiling]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of a panel of 41 human ovarian cancer cell lines for the study of ovarian cancer biology, drug response and drug sensitivity.

DESIGN
Ovarian cancer cell lines were either obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (CAOV3, OV90, OVCAR3, SKOV3, TOV112D), the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, England (A2780CP, A2780S); Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan (CHI, CHIcisR, M41, M41CSR, Tyknu, and TyknuCisR), or were kind gifts from Dr. Patricia Kruk, Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL; and Susan Murphy, PhD, Dept of OBGYN/Division of GYN Oncology, Duke University, Durham, NC (A2008, C13, CAOV2, FUOV1, HeyA8, IGR-OV1, IMCC3, IMCC5, MCAS, OV2008, OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, OVCA433, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, OVCAR8, Dov13, BG1, Ovary1847, OVCAR10, OVCAR2, SK-OV-4). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburg, PN), 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro; Manassas, VA), and 1% nonessential amino acids (HyClone; Hudson, New Hampshire). Mycoplasma testing was performed every six months following manufacturerâ€™s protocol (Lonza, Rockland ME).
