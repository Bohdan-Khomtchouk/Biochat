TITLE
H4K20me1 contributes to downregulation of X-linked genes for Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We compared the pattern of H4K20me1 at the L3 stage in wild-type and set-4 mutants by ChIP-seq. In wild-type, H4K20me1 levels on the X chromosome are higher than on autosomes. In set-4 mutants, this difference is lost.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of H4K20me1 at the L3 stage in wild-type and set-4 mutant L3 larvae.
