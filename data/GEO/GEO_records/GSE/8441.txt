TITLE
Inadequate protein intake affects skeletal muscle transcript profiles in older humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inadequate dietary protein intake causes adverse changes in the morphology and function of skeletal muscle.  These changes may be reflected in early alterations in muscle mRNA levels. Microarray analysis was used to assess whether inadequate protein intake differentially affects skeletal muscle transcript levels and expression profiles in older adults. Keywords: dietary intake response

DESIGN
11 older males and females (aged 55-80 y) consumed controlled diets that contained 1.2 g protein•kg-1•d-1 (adequate protein) for one wk and then  0.5 g protein•kg-1•d-1 (inadequate protein; IP group; n=11) for a second wk.  RNA was isolated from fasting-state vastus lateralis biopsies obtained at the end of each period and the transcript levels were determined using the Affymetrix U133A array
