TITLE
Inadequate protein intake affects skeletal muscle transcript profiles in older humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inadequate dietary protein intake causes adverse changes in the morphology and function of skeletal muscle.  These changes may be reflected in early alterations in muscle mRNA levels. Microarray analysis was used to assess whether inadequate protein intake differentially affects skeletal muscle transcript levels and expression profiles in older adults. Keywords: dietary intake response
