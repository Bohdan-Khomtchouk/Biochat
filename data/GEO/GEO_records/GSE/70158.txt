TITLE
Dietary selenium levels affect selenoprotein expression and support the interferon-Î³ and IL-6 immune response pathways in mice [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were fed Se-deficient or Se-adequate diets for 6 weeks. Liver and lung tissue were harvested and processed for RNA-Seq, ribosome profiling, and microarray analysis. From these studies, we identified changes in mRNA levels and translation of selenoprotein genes and genes regulated by interferon-gamma. Cytokine profiles of serum indicated that interferon-gamma and IL-6 levels were increased in the Se-adequate mice relative to Se-deficient mice.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of liver tissue from mice fed Se-deficient or Se-adequate diets
