TITLE
Dynamics of Sox2 and Esrrb occupancy during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into trophoblast stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism underlying the versatility in transcriptional regulation by Sox2 and Esrrb, we compared genome-wide binding sites of Sox2 and Esrrb in embryonic stem (ES) cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).

DESIGN
A tetracycline-inducible Oct3/4 knockout ES cell line ZHBTc4 was treated with Tet for 4 days in the presence of FGF4 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
