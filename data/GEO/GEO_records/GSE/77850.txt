TITLE
Molecular subtypes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [pancreatic cancer cell lines]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to examine the transcriptional profile of pancreatic cancer cell lines and assess if the molecular subtypes observed in tumor samples were represented in existing cell line models.  Cell line models allow us to investigate if the molecular subtype observed in tumor have unique sensitivity profiles to anticancer drugs.

DESIGN
29 pancreatic cancer cell lines were compared to a mixed reference pool of 30 pancreatic cancer cell lines to identify cell line specific gene expression.
