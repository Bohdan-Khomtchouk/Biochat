TITLE
Expression data from C2C12 myotubes infected with adenovirus expressing Gli1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to determine the effects of over-expression of Gli1 on gene expression in C2C12 myotube cultures. C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate for 4 days. At that time, when > 80% of nuclei were incorporated into multi-nucleated syncitial myotubes, we infected the cultures with recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP alone or GFP and a full length human Gli1. Media was changed 12 hours later. Cultures were lysed 60 hours after the initial infection. Gli1 over-expression induces de-differentiation of myotubes and proliferation of myoblasts.

DESIGN
Results provide insight into the molecular basis of SHH signaling on skeletal muscle cells.
