TITLE
Transcriptomics response to miR-644 overexpression in three breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to investigate the effect of microRNA-644 overexpression by chemical mimics on gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. To this purpose control and microRNA-644 mimics are used to transfect MDA-MB-231 cells, SK-BR-3 cells, and MCF-7 cells respectively. Transcriptomics profiling was performed with Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 BeadChip microarray.

DESIGN
Three cell lines are treated with scramble microRNA mimic (control herein) and microRNA-644 mimic (miR-644 herein), with two replicates per condition. mRNA expression is compared between miR-644 and control treatment within each cell line, respectively.
