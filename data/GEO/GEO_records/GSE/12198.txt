TITLE
Primary NKcells vs. NKAES-derived NK cells vs. NKcells stimulated by low/high dose IL2 after 7days of culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of NKAES-derived NK cells after 7 days of culture compared to primary human NK cells and NK cells stimulated by low or high dose IL2 after 7 days of culture.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, primary NK cells vs. NKAES-derived NK cells after 7 days of culture vs. NK cells stimulated by low/high dose IL2 after 7 days of culture. Biological replicates: 5 control, 5 NKAES-derived NK cells, 3 NK cells stimulated by low dose IL2, 3 NK cells stimulated by high dose IL2 independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
