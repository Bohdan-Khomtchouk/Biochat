TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mouse brain endothelial cells and glioma endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and vascularized malignant brain tumor. Anti-VEGF therapy is widely used for the treatment of GBM, however it has shown only minor impact on patient survival. Thus, more precise molecular mechanisms for glioma angiogenesis are needed for the advance in the treatment of GBM. Here, we investigated gene expression profile of brain endothelial cells and glioma endothelial cells using RNA sequencing to validated special molecular features of glioma endothelial cells.

DESIGN
To reveal molecular mechanisms underlying vascular characteristics of high-grade glioma, we established mouse orthotopic glioma model by intracranially injecting GL26l glioma cells into congenic B6 genetic background mice. We further compared tumor vessels with non-tumor brain vessels at the molecular level. For in-depth understanding of different gene expression between tumor vessels and brain vessels, we purified endothelial population from tumor and brain tissues and performed RNA-sequencing analysis. Three independent sets of RNA were obtained from normal brain endothelial cells and glioma endothelial cells.
