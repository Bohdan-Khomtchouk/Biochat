SUMMARY
In modern clinical neuro-oncology the pathological diagnoses are very challenging creating significant clinical confusion and affecting therapeutic decisions and prognostic estimation. We investigated whether gene expression profiling, coupled with class prediction methodology, could be used to predict prognosis of gliomatosis cerebri in a more consistent manner then standard pathology. We report the results of a molecular study in  fifty-nine cases of gliomatosis cerebri, correlating these results with prognosis. TP53 and PTEN gene sequences were analyzed and microarray expression profiling were also performed. At the 24 month follow-up, 17 patients were alive, while 42 patients were died. We identified a 23 gene signature able to predict patient prognosis with microarray gene expression profiling. With the aim to produce a prognostication tool useful in clinical investigation we studied the expression of this 23 gene signature by RT-qPCR. Real time expression values relative to these 23 gene features were used to built a prediction method able to distinguish patients with good prognosis (more likely responsive to therapy) from patients with a bad prognosis (more likely irresponsive to therapy). These results demonstrated not only strong association of gene expression patterns with the survival of the patients but also a robust reproducibility of these gene expressionâ€“ based predictors.
