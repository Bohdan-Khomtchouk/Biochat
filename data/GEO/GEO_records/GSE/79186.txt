TITLE
Chronic Alcohol Consumption Alters micro-RNA Radiation Responses in the Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence suggests that lifestyle-related factors may influence radiation responses and the resulting cancer risks through epigenetic mechanisms, such as miRNA regulations. Chronic alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for various pathologies, including alcoholic liver disease. We have recently shown that consumption of Japanese sake promotes glutathione metabolism and anti-oxidative activities in the liver of irradiated C57BL/6 mice. Here we show that chronic alcohol consumption resulted in elevated ciculating levels of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± and that it triggered specific miRNA regulations (such as the upregulation of the radio-resistant miR-210) that are susceptible to influence the resulting radiation effects in the mouse liver.
