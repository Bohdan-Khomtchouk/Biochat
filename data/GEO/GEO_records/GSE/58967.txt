TITLE
RNA seq analysis of day of pregnancy 14 ovine conceptuses

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
RNA seq analysis was conducted to determine gene expression in the day 14 ovine conceptus. This was used in conjunction with the day 14 PPARG ChIP-seq analysis to identify genes bound by PPARG which were also expressed or not expressed in the day 14 conceptus. Understanding changes in gene expression during early pregnancy is critical to improving fertility and reproductive efficiency in ruminants.

DESIGN
RNA seq analysis of 4 conceptuses from 4 individual Day 14 pregnant columbia/rambouillet crossbred ewes
