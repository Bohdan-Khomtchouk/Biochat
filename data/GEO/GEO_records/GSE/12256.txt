TITLE
TBP ChIP-chip on Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During mitosis, TATA-binding protein(TBP), which remains bound to DNA during mitosis, recruits PP2A and also interacts with a subunit of the condensin complex to allow efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin near these promoters to inhibit their compaction. These result suggest that TBP function is not only important for expression of genes transcribed bDuring mitosis, TATA-binding protein(TBP), which remains bound to DNA during mitosis, recruits PP2A and also interacts with a subunit of the condensin complex to allow efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin near these promoters to inhibit their compaction. These result suggest that TBP function is not only important for expression of genes transcribed by all three RNA polymerase during interphase, but also for transmitting the memory of gene activity through mitosis to daughter cellsy all three RNA polymerase during interphase, but also for transmitting the memory of gene activity through mitosis to daughter cells

DESIGN
We use ChIP-chip approach to identify TBP-bindind sites in mitotic Jurkat cells at genome-wide level. Input DNA fragments and  DNA fragments immunoprecipitated by TBP antibodies by ChIP assay on mitotic Jurkat cells were used to probe the Affymetrix Genechip human tiling 2.0c to identift TBP-binding sites in mitotic Jurkat cells. Input and ChIP sample were replicated three times as following: Input rep1, TBP ChIP1, Input rep2, TBP ChIP2, Input rep3, TBP ChIP3.
