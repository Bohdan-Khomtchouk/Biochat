TITLE
Epigenetic modifications and chromosome conformations of the beta globin locus throughout development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells provide an alternative to using human embryos for studying developmentally regulated gene expression. The co-expression of high levels of embryonic epsilon and fetal gamma globin by the hESC-derived erythroblasts allows the interrogation of epsilon globin regulation at the transcriptional and epigenetic level which could only be attained previously by studying cell lines or transgenic mice. In this study, we compared the histone modifications across the beta globin locus of the undifferentiated hESCs and hESC-, FL-, and mobilized PB CD34+ cells-derived erythroblasts, which have distinct globin expression patterns corresponding to their developmental stages. We demonstrated that the histone codes employed by the beta globin locus are conserved throughout development. Furthermore, in spite of the close proximity of the epsilon globin promoter, as compared to the gamma or beta globin promoter, with the LCR, a chromatin loop was also formed between the LCR and the active epsilon globin promoter, similar to the loop that forms between the gamma or beta globin promoters and the LCR, in contrary to the previously proposed tracking mechanism.

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells, hESC-, FL-, and PB derived erythroblasts were studied. The enrichment of H3K4me3 and AcH3 acrossed the beta globin locus was studied using ChIP-seq.
