TITLE
Expression data from podocytes cultured in vitro treated with thapsigargin +/- forskolin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to gain mechanistic insights of the protective effect of forskolin on thapsigargin-induced podocyte death by assessing, analyzing and comparing the respective gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of vehicle (DMSO)-, thapsi-, and thapsi+fors-treated podocytes were analyzed. 3 replicates per condition. Vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells were served as control/reference samples.

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
