TITLE
ChIP-Seq for Yrr1 protein on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells carrying different YRR1 alleles in response to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we constructed three isogenic strains of S96 yrr1Î” background (its native YRR1 gene was knocked out) carrying three different YRR1 alleles, YRR1_S96, YRR1_YJM789, YRR1_S96-I775E, respectively. We then conducted chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for Yrr1 protein on the three strains grown in Yeast Peptone Dextrose medium (YPD) and YPD + 4NQO.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for Yrr1 protein was performed in biological triplicates on S96 cells carrying three different YRR1 alleles grown in YPD and YPD + 4NQO. Immune-precipitated DNA were sequenced for all the three cultures and input genomic DNA was sequenced for one culture.
