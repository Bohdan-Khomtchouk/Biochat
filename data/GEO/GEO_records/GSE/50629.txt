TITLE
Polyubiquitination analysis upon GSK3 inhibition in HeLa cell extracts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HeLa cell extracts with or without GSK3 enzyme inhibition were assayed using protein microarrays in order to detect GSK3-dependent changes in protein polyubiquitination.

DESIGN
HeLa lysates in triplicates were supplemented with ubiquitin and incubated on protein microarrays (ProtoArray 5.0; Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of the GSK3 inhibitor SB-216763. Polyubiquitination of the arrayed proteins was detected using specific antibodies. ProtoArray 5.0 contains over 9,000 full-length human proteins purified and arrayed in duplicate under native conditions to maximize functionality.
