TITLE
Extension of glycogene expression pattern analysis in the prefrontal cortical region of Schizophrenic human post-mortem brain samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders Extension of previous studies investigating Glyco-Gene Expression in Schizophrenia ( ). From previous analyses, a group of 9 genes associated with the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids were identified as altered in subjects with schizophrenia, with most differences detected in subjects with short DOI and not in chronic illness. The enzyme expression changes are of particular interest as they are important to the synthesis of cerebrosides and sulfatides, which are enriched in membranes making up myelin. There are known deficits in myelin and white matter in schizophrenia so changes in these enzymes may represent a mechanism accounting for these deficits. Furthermore, clusters of co-regulated genes were identified using new software for weighted gene co-networks. This may represent the first molecular definition of different subtypes of schizophrenia, a very heterogeneous psychiatric disorder.
