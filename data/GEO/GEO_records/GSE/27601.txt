TITLE
Extension of glycogene expression pattern analysis in the prefrontal cortical region of Schizophrenic human post-mortem brain samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on the molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders Extension of previous studies investigating Glyco-Gene Expression in Schizophrenia ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27356 ). From previous analyses, a group of 9 genes associated with the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids were identified as altered in subjects with schizophrenia, with most differences detected in subjects with short DOI and not in chronic illness. The enzyme expression changes are of particular interest as they are important to the synthesis of cerebrosides and sulfatides, which are enriched in membranes making up myelin. There are known deficits in myelin and white matter in schizophrenia so changes in these enzymes may represent a mechanism accounting for these deficits. Furthermore, clusters of co-regulated genes were identified using new software for weighted gene co-networks. This may represent the first molecular definition of different subtypes of schizophrenia, a very heterogeneous psychiatric disorder.

DESIGN
For this follow up study, microarray analyses experiments were  performed on an additional cohort of subjects with schizophrenia in order to, 1) Assess how this group of glycosphingolipid-related genes is altered in disease and control states, and 2) Further determine if co-regulated genes will cluster in the new cohort, which will consist of subjects with a range of durations of illness. For these studies, 32 human samples (16 control and 16 Schizophrenic) were  labeled and hybridized to 26 GLYCOv2 arrays
