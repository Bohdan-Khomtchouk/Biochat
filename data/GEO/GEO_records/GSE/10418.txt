TITLE
flg22 time course-Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment: Gene profiling in microRNA mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - flg22 time course - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - 14-day old seedlings (Col-0 and fls2 KO) treated with 10uM of flg22 (flagellin derived peptide) over a one hour timecourse. Keywords: time course,treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
7 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
