TITLE
Treg cells limit IFN-g production to control macrophage accrual and phenotype during skeletal muscle regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report transcriptional characterization of skeletal muscle macrophage subsets in normal and injured muscle after intramuscular injection with cardiotoxin. We profiled transcriptional differences in macrophage subsets from mice depleted of Treg cells using Foxp3-DTR mice. We uncovered an IFN-g-centered regulatory loop, in which Treg cells inhibit NK and T cells to control macrophage accumulation and phenotype during muscle regeneration.

DESIGN
Mice were injected with cardiotoxin intramuscularly and muscle macrophage subsets were sorted by FACS directly into TriZol. Gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
