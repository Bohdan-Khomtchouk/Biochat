TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA expression profile in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder and affects approximately one third of the general population.Recent studies have shown that long non-coding (lncRNA) plays critical roles in a myriad of biological processes and human diseases,Since the roles of lncRNA in NAFLD remain unknown,they were investigated in the study.Our findings indicate that the expression profiles of lncRNAs has changed in NAFLD as compared with normal liver, and may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and potential novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets for NAFLD.

DESIGN
Microarray expression profiling of mRNAs and lncRNAs were conducted using RNA extracted from five NAFLD liver tissues and five normal liver samples.
