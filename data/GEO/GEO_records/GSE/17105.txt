TITLE
Gene expression regulated by G-actin switch

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analysed the G-actin regulated transcriptome by gene expression analysis using previously characterised actin binding drugs. We found many known MAL/MRTF-dependent target genes of serum response factor (SRF) as well as unknown directly regulated genes.

DESIGN
Three conditions were used for the microarray analysis: control NIH 3T3 cells, cells treated with cytochalasin D, and cells treated with latrunculin B and cytochalasin D. For each condition, three independent biological replicates were analysed.
