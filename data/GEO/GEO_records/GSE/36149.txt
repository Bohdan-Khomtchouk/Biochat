TITLE
Gene expression data from obatoclax-treated SEM-K2 and RS4:11 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effects of the pan-anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family small molecule inhibitor, obatoclax mesylate (GeminX Pharmaceuticals), on gene expression were evaluated by microarray analysis in order to gain insights into the killing mechanism by this compound in two human MLL-AF4 cell lines. The results of the gene expression profiling substantiated other lines of evidence derived from genetic and chemical cell death pathway inhibition, Western blot analysis, flow cytometric apoptosis assays, and electron microscopic analyses, showing triple apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis death pathway activation by this agent. The results also demonstrated modulation of a number of novel targets of obatoclax encoding various cell death factors at the gene expression level.

DESIGN
SEM-K2 and RS4:11 cells were treated with obatoclax or vehicle for 6 hours.  After treatment, total RNA was extracted and cRNA was prepared and hybridized with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 microarrays. There were a total of 3 treatments per cell line (vehicle, obatoclax at the 72 h EC50, and obatoclax 3x 72 h EC50) and 2 biologic replicates per condition.
