TITLE
RNA sequencing data from triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAseq was performed on WHIM2 and WHIM30 PDX mammary tumors, brain metastases, and single cell suspensions over time.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression profiles between two PDX models of triple-negative breast cancer, and between primary tumors, cell suspensions, and brain metastases within the PDX lines.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
