SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Xenografts of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Keywords: Human Cancer

DESIGN
Briefly, primary HCCs obtained during liver resection were minced into fine fragments capable of passing through an 18-gauge needle, mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and injected in the subcutaneous flanks of 8-week-old male severe combined immune deficient (SCID/SCID, The Jackson Laboratory, Harbor, ME) mice. Six to eight mice were injected for each primary tumor. Growth of established tumor xenografts was monitored twice weekly by vernier caliper measurement of tumor length (a) and width (b), and tumor volume was calculated as (a x b2) / 2. Serial passages of xenograft lines were obtained by dissecting tumors from sacrificed animals and reinjecting the dissociated tumor cells into successive generations of SCID mice as described above. Seven xenograft lines were studied in this report (2-1318, 5-1318(1), 5-1318(3), 2006, 26-1004, 26-1004(cirr), and 30-1004). Xenografts 2-1318 and 5-1318(1) were derived from Hep B-positive patients.
