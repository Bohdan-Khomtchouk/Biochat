TITLE
High Concentrations of Atmospheric Ammonia Induce Alterations of Gene Expression in the Breast Muscle of Broilers (Gallus gallus) Based on RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Background: High concentrations of atmospheric ammonia are one of the key environmental stressors affecting broiler production performance, which causes remarkable economic losses as well as potential welfare problems of the broiler industry. Previous reports have demonstrated that high levels of ammonia can alter body fat distribution and meat quality of broilers. However, the molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways in breast muscle altered by high concentrations of ambient ammonia exposure on broilers are still unknown. Results: This study utilized RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptomes of breast muscles to identify differentially enriched genes in broilers exposed to high or low concentrations of atmospheric ammonia. A total of 267 promising candidate genes were identified by differential expression analysis, among which 67 genes were up-regulated and 189 genes were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the up and down-regulated genes were involved in the following two categories of cellular pathways and metabolisms: Steroid biosynthesis (gga00100) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway (gga03320), which both participate in the lipid metabolism processes. Conclusions: This study suggests that longtime exposure to high concentrations of aerial ammonia can change fat content in breast muscle, meat quality and palatability via altering expression levels of genes participating in important lipid metabolism pathways. This study maybe provides new information that could be used for genetic breeding and nutritional intervention in production practice of broilers industry in the future.

DESIGN
Breast muscle mRNA profiles of 42-day old Arbor Acres male broilers exposed to 3 ppm (control) and 75 ppm (treatment) concentrations of atmospheric ammonia were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
