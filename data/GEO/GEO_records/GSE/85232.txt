TITLE
Generation of intestinal progenitor cells from mouse fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to cells that closely resemble intestinal stem cells (ISCs), through the state of fetal-type progenitor cells, called FIPCs. The induced ISCs (iISCs) exhibit self-renewal capacity and intestinal multi-lineage differentiation potential. Upon transplantation, iFIPCs and iISCs reconstitute colonic and intestinal epithelia, respectively.

DESIGN
We conducted comparative global gene expression analyses among MEFs, iHep cells, iISC-derived budding organoids, Crypt-derived budding organoids, iFIPC-derived spherical organoids and budding organoids, and FI-derived spherical organoids and budding organoids.
