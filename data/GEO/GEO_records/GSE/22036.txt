TITLE
Identification of genes that regulated by IRF4 in human cutaneous T cell lymphoma HuT-102 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray analysis showed an interesting up-regulation in the set of genes controlling the development of Th1, mainly IFN-gamma, and other type 1 interferon response genes including CXCL10 in IRF4 knocked-down HuT-102 cells.

DESIGN
HuT-102 cells, a human cutaneous T cell lymphoma, were transiently transfected with siRNAs against human IRF4 or firefly luciferase. Cells were incubated for 60 h at 37 centigrade. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
