TITLE
Gene expression profiling of IGROV1 cells after in vitro treatment with ascitic fluid from human ovarian cancer bearing mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CpG-ODN demonstrated anti-tumor activity in IGROV-1 ascites tumor-bearing mice. To evaluate if soluble molecules present in ascitic fluid, presumably released by innate immune cells via TLR9 stimulation, is directly involved with gene expression modulation a microarray experiment was performed.
