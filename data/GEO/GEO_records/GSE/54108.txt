TITLE
A cDNA microarray analysis was performed on shRNA KDs of EZH2, SUZ12, BMI1, or CBX8 HepG2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins including EZH2, SUZ12 ,BMI1,CBX8 and so on, which specifically catalyze trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and methylated H3K27 can be recognized by other specific binding proteins to compress chromatin structure, leading to the transcriptional repression of the target genes. To explore a potential functional implication of PcG components in HCC, we stably transfected HepG2 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing shRNA that specifically targets EZH2, SUZ12, BMI1, or CBX8. A cDNA microarray analysis was performed on shRNA KDs of EZH2, SUZ12, BMI1, or CBX8 HepG2 cells. To obtain a broader understanding of the molecular network of PcG in HCC, the whole genome microarray expression profiling was performed on shRNA KDs of EZH2, SUZ12, BMI1, or CBX8 HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression results from shRNA KDs of EZH2, SUZ12, BMI1 or CBX8 HepG2 cells.
