TITLE
Transcription in adult mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix Gene Arrays (1.0 ST) to compare gene expression across different murine tissues. Arrays were used to find disallowed genes in tissues.

DESIGN
Different tissues were dissected from 10-12 week old C57Bl6 mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
