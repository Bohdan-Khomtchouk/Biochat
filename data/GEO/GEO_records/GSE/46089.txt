TITLE
Notch responsive genes in the T29 cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse Ikaros-deficient thymic lymphoma cell line T29 was transduced with a retrovirus expressing an fusion protein between a dominant-negative form of Mastermind and the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Cells trreated with Ethanol or 4-hydroxy-tamoxyfen for 24h were profiled.

DESIGN
We used expression of an inducible ersion of the dominant negative Mastermind protein in an Ikaros-deficient cell line to identify Notch-regulated genes
