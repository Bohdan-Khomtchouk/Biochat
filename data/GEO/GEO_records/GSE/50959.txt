TITLE
Differential gene expression in neuroblastoma cells after transfection with control siRNA, N-Myc siRNA-1, N-Myc siRNA-2, lncMycN siRNA-1 or lncMycN siRNA-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N-Myc oncoprotein induces neuroblastoma by modulating gene transcription, and long noncoding RNAs exert biological effects by regulating gene expression. We analysed whether N-Myc and the long noncoding RNA lncMycN mediate the expression of common subsets of genes.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma Kelly cells were transfected with control siRNA, N-Myc siRNA-1, N-Myc siRNA-2, lncMycN siRNA-1 or lncMycN siRNA-2. RNA was extracted from the cells 48 hours after siRNA transfections, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with Affymetrix microarrays.
