TITLE
Bap1 loss results in EZH2 dependent transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) in control and Bap1-deficient bone marrow cells. Loss of Bap1 in the hematopoietic compartments results in an MDS-like disease. These data allow for the examination of the genetic underpinnings of Bap1 loss in disease.

DESIGN
Whole bone marrow cells from mice treated with polyI:polyC at three weeks of age were extracted from Mx1-Cre positive and Mx1-Cre negative Bap1f/f littermates. Bone marrow cells were red cell lysed, stained and sorted for GMP cells (Lineage-c-Kit+Sca1-CD34+Fc?). RNA was extracted for RNA-Seq studies to assess transcriptional changes with Bap1 loss in GMPs.
