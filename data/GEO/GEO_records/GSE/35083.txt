TITLE
Expression data of the splenocytes from mice at 6th of Plasmodium chabaudi infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During malaria infection is observed a robust immune response culminating on release of inflammatory mediators. This exacerbated immune response is involved in malaria symptoms and mortality. There are evidences that this response is mediated by innate immunity where pattern recognition receptors have a key role. We used microarrays to elucidate some pro-inflammatory genes that are differential expressed during P. chabaudi infection, a malarial murine model

DESIGN
Spleen from C57BL/6, MyD88, or IFN-gamma knockout mice non-infected or after 6 days post infection with 105 P. chabaudi infected red blood cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. This time point was chose to coincides with rupture of red blood cells \since this event of the parasite life cycle is related with malaria outcomes.
