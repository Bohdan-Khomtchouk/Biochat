TITLE
Genome wide mapping of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in trophoblast progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be differentiated into progenitors resembling trophoblast upon exposure to BMP4. Putative trophpblast progenitors express APA cell surface marker Using trophoblast progenitors at day 2.5 of BMP4-induced differentiation, here we profile H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin marks that mark active and inactive genes, respectively. Double occupancy indicates bivalency

DESIGN
Undifferentiated hESC and hESC treated with BMP4 for 2.5 days (cell line H9) were FACS-sorted to isolate APA+, APA- and SSEA5+ cell populations. Sorted cells were subjected to ChIP with anti-H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 antibodies followed by next generation sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
