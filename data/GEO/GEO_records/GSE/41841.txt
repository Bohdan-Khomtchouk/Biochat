TITLE
Bombyx mori Argonaute2 associated small RNAs

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
As important roles of small RNA pathways, AGO proteins mediate interaction of incorporated small RNAs with their targets. The resolution of AGO associated small RNAs showed a significant landscape of AGO proteins and their binding small RNAs. To characterize small RNAs that associated with BmAGO2 protein in Bombyx mori, the small RNA population associated with BmAGO2 in BmN cells was extracted from the AGO immunoprecipitated complex and the small RNAs between 17nt to 50nt separated by a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were subjected to library construction and deep sequencing.The high throughput sequencing yielded a total of 11691441 reads, representing 813,702 unique reads with a abundance from 5731905 to 1.

DESIGN
Small RNA associated with AGO2 of BmN cell infected with ie1-bacmid recombinant viruses were performed by high-throughput using Hiseq 2000.
