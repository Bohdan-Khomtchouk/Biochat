TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between Hep3B tumors treated with sorafenib plus mouse-IFN treatment and those treated with sorafenib alone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our experiments with a xenograft model, mouse-IFN (mIFN) treatment was suggested to exaggerate the antitumor effects of sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo. We explored how mIFN enhances the in vivo antitumor effects of sorafenib.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles in developed Hep3B tumors receiving sorafenib plus mIFN treatment were compared with those noted in Hep3B tumors receiving sorafenib treatment alone in the mouse xenograft model.
