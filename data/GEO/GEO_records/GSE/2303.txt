TITLE
Rat liver response to Clofibrate, DEHP or VPA

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The project had 2 goals: 1) To evaluate the transcriptional response of 3 prototypical toxicants (Clofibrate, VPA, and DEHP) on rat lever. 2) To evaluate the impact pooling samples has on data analysis. Keywords = Clofibrate Keywords = Diethylhexyl phthalate Keywords = Phthalic acid bis(2-ethylhexyl ester) Keywords = Sodium Valproate Keywords = Valproic Acid Keywords = VPA Keywords = vehicle Keywords: other

DESIGN
Male SD rats were given a single dose of one of 3 prototypical toxicants or dosed with vehicle. The toxicants used were: 1000mg/kg Clofibrate (in 0.9% saline) 2000mg/kg Sodium Valproate (in distilled water) 20g/kg DEHP (in distilled water) Animals were sacrificed at 4, 24, 48, or 168hrs post-dosing (only 48 and 168hrs for vehicle-treated animals) One of the goals of this study was to assess the impact pooling RNA samples has on the array data. For each treatment and vehicle group there are 3-5 individual samples, as well as 1 pooled sample. 10ug of total RNA were hybridized to Affymetrix RG_U34A arrays according to the manufacturer's protocol. Signal intensities were generated using MAS5, with global scaling set to 1500.
