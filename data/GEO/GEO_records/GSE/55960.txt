TITLE
Chromosomal Architecture of Arabidopsis and its Implication in Transposon Intergration

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Efficient storing and readout of genetic information is not only dependent on tight epigenetic regulation but also on the spatial organization and folding of chromosomes. Although the epigenome of the model plant Arabidopsis has been extensively studied, its interplay with chromosomal architecture is less well understood. We show that chromosomal architecture is tightly linked to the epigenetic state and furthermore how physical constraints such as nuclear size influence folding principles of chromatin. In addition to global principles of chromatin organisation, we describe a novel nuclear structure, termed KNOT, in which genomic regions of all five Arabidopsis chromosomes highly interact. These regions are characterized as heterochromatic islands within the euchromatin and likely represent preferred landing sites for transposons, suggesting a novel transposon defence mechanism in the Arabidopsis nucleus.

DESIGN
HiC experiments were performed on Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 wildtype, homozygous crwn1-1, and homozygous crwn4-1 14-day-old seedlings

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
