TITLE
LEM-2 ChIP-seq to study chromatin anchoring

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation against the nuclear envelope protein LEM-2 to detect association to the nuclear periphery. LEM-2 ChIP was performed on early embryo fixed extracts for wild-type and two mutants that have altered position of a perinuclear chromatin reporter.

DESIGN
LEM-2 ChIP on early embryo chromatin extracts of three different genotypes: wild-type, met-2 set-25_delta_delta and cec-4_delta, in two independent biological replicas
