TITLE
MicroRNA expression in control vs. ethanol exposed MCF-7 breast cancer cells in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is the microRNA experiment from the study of ethanol effects on the cultured cell line MCF-7, which is derived from a human malignancy. Cells were cultured in 6 well plates for a period of 4 weeks in the presence or absence of 25 mM ethanol. Cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, and RNA was extracted using the Mirvana kit for total RNA extraction. RNA samples were analyzed for microRNA prevalence by LC Sciences of Houston, Tx, USA. The results from 2 separate experiments were normalized and collected as the MultiArray Analysis Data presented here. The miR values are on an arbitrary scale.

DESIGN
There are 2 experiments, each containing a control (no ethanol) sample and a sample that was exposed to 25 mM ethanol for 4 weeks.

PLATFORM
GPL16601 MRA-1001_miRHuman_18 (miRNA named version)
