TITLE
CMV infection drives adaptive epigenetic diversification of NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying human NK cell phenotypic and functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins following cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Intriguingly, geneome-wide analyses revealed patterns of DNA methylation that were strikingly similar between CMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, but differed from those of canonical NK cells.

DESIGN
A total of 23 samples were analyzed (4 sorted NK cell subsets and 2 sorted T cell subsets each from 4 individual donors). In one donor only 5 subsets were analyzed. Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA was hybridized to the Illumina Human Methylation450 BeadChip
