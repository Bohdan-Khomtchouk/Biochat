TITLE
Sauchinone controls hepatic cholesterol homeostasis by the negative regulation of PCSK9 transcriptional network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed transcript profiling of sauchinone treated with various doses on HepG2 cells using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform and analyzed differential gene expression at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
mRNA levels were examinated in sauchinone treated with various doses, in two biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
