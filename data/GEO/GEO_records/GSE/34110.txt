TITLE
Gene expression study after 3 days of cold exposure in a Solanum tuberosum cultivar called Desirée

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
The molecular response to cold exposure was studied in the leaves of an S. tuberosum clone using cDNA microarray. Differentially expressed genes were classified according to their known or predicted function and their expression ratio as compared to the control. The major changes upon cold exposure in Desirée leaves were observed in the photosynthesis-related genes, which were down-regulated, whereas cell rescue, detoxication and transcription factor-related genes were mostly up-regulated. We also observed an increased expression of polyamine and proline synthesis-related genes, as well as some carbohydrate-related genes such as sucrose synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase.

DESIGN
Gene expression was followed at day 3 after the beginning of the treatment: cold (4°C) and control conditions. For each condition, 4 independent biological replicates were sampled.
