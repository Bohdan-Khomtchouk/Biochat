Genome-wide maps of cytosine methylation, cytosine hydroxylmethylation and small non coding RNAs in mouse ES cells and upon guided differentiation to mesoendoderm cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide maps of cytosine methylation, cytosine hydroxylmethylation and small non coding RNAs in mouse ES cells and upon guided differentiation to mesoendoderm cells. Mouse embryonic stem cells (E14) were guided differentiated into mesoendoderm lineages by activin-A induction. cells in three time points (day0, day4 and day6) were collected. The genome-wide studies on three cell types were summerized as following: cytosine methylation data were generated using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq); DNA product for 5-hmC_ChIP-seq is generated by a selctive chemical labeling method (Nat. Biotechnol. 2011, 29, 68-72). E14 Day0 data for MRE-seq and MeDIP-seq are released first in previous publication and included in prior series GSE36114

DESIGN
ChIP-seq, 5-hmC-seq, MeDIP-Seq, MRE-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and RNA-seq on activin-induced differentiating ES cells at 3 time points.
