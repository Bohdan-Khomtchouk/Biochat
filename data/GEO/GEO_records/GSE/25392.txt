SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2769 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Steven Henikoff. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: poly A+ RNA was isolated and used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA probes.  Labeled cDNA and labeled genomic DNA were hybridized to NimbleGen microarrays (2-color hybridizations).  These experiments are used as controls for nucleosome salt fractionations.
