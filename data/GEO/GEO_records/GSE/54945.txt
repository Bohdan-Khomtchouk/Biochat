TITLE
The effect of androgens on CD4 T-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hormonal milieu influences immune tolerance as well as the immune response against viruses and cancer, but the direct effect of androgens on cellular immunity remains largely uncharacterized. We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of androgens on murine CD4 T-cells by micro-array analysis

DESIGN
Male mice were castrated, or received sham surgery. Four weeks later, CD4 cells were sorted by FACS.  Splenocytes were pooled from 3 mice to be analysed on each micro-array chip. 2 micro-array chips were used for each group (containing samples from 6 mice total for each group)
