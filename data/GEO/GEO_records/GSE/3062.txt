TITLE
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays Hybridized With Varying Amounts of Starting Material

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were hybridized with varying amounts of starting material to determine whether different measurements of gene expression were observed. Keywords: Affymetrix starting material study

DESIGN
1 ug, 2, ug, 5, and 10 ug of Stratagene universal human reference RNA was used to setup a series of reactions which were subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.  1 ug samples were performed in triplicate and the entire experiement was repeated.
