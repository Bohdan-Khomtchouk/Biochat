TITLE
The expression profile of 5-fluorouracil pathway genes in colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study addressed involvement of fourteen 5-fluorouracil pathway genes in the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma patients. The major goal of our study was to investigate associations of gene expression of enzymes metabolizing 5-fluorouracil with therapy response and survival of colorectal carcinoma patients Downregulation of DPYD and upregulation of PPAT, UMPS, RRM2, and SLC29A1 transcripts were found in tumors compared to adjacent mucosas in testing and validation sets of patients. Low RRM2 transcript level significantly associated with poor response to the first-line palliative 5-FU-based chemotherapy in the testing set and with poor disease-free interval of patients in the validation set.

DESIGN
Testing and validation sets comprising paired tumor and adjacent mucosa tissue samples from 119 patients were used for transcript profiling by quantitative real-time PCR. Intratumoral gene expression levels were correlated with clinical data of patients.

PLATFORM
