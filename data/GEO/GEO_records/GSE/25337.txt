TITLE
Gene expression data of Sox17-GFP(+) mouse definitive endoderm before and after expansion on mesenchyme.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem cells containing a Sox17-GFP construct were differentiated using growth factors (Activin A and Wnt3A) to definitive endoderm.  Sox17-GFP(+) cells were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting and either used for total RNA harvest OR continued in culture in the presence of primary pancreatic mesenchymal cell lines.  At the end of 6 serial passages on mesenchyme, the Sox17-GFP(+) cells were again sorted and the RNA was harvested for arrays.

DESIGN
Samples were prepared as described in summary, with technical duplicates for each of the following 3 categories: 1. Unpassaged (P0) endoderm, 2. Endoderm passaged 6 times (P6) on mesenchyme 1, and 3. Endoderm passaged 6 times (P6) on mesenchyme 2.
