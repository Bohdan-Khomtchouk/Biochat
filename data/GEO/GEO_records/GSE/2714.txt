TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for STAT1 on Human Hela S3 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT1 ChIP-chip performed on Human Hela S3 Cells for three different platforms. Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts) (5 biological replicates), custom maskless array tiling most of ENCODE with 50mer oligonucleotides end-to-end (3 biological replicates) and custom maskless array tiling most of ENCODE with 36mer oligonucleotides end-to-end (2 biological replicates). The chromatin-immunoprecipitation protocol is the same for all samples, however the labelling and hybridization protocols differ between Nimblegen and custom maskless arrays.
