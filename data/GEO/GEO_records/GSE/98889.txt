TITLE
Zka virus (ZIKV) persistently infects primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZIKV alters transcriptional responses of infected cells to avoid immune detection. We have compared the transcriptional responses of ZIKV-infected hBMECs and mock-infected hBMECs. Examination of transcriptional responses of ZIKV-infected hBMECs versus mock-infected hBMECs

DESIGN
10 total samples were analyzed twice. We generated the following measure of gene-level expression from > 20,000 genes detected by Affymetric Clariom S chip arrays. Fold-changes between ZIKV-infected and mock-infected cells at each time point were determined using Affymetrix TAC software.
