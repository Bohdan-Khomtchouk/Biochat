TITLE
Transcript Profiling of Common Bean Embryo Regions at Globular Stage Using Laser Capture Microdissection Coupled with RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Phaseolus vulgaris

SUMMARY
We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to capture globular stage common bean embryo proper and suspensor, and profiled the transcriptome of these two embryo regions using next-generation sequencing. Our long-term goal is to understand the region-specific differentiation processes that occur during early embryo development and how genes are activated specifically in the suspensor and embryo proper.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of transcripts from laser-captured embryo proper and suspensor regions of common bean globular stage embryo. Two biological replicates were collected for each embryo region.

PLATFORM
GPL18673 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Phaseolus vulgaris)
