TITLE
Calcium responsiveness in Arabidopsis using calmodulin antagonists

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to identify early calcium up/down-regulated genes in response to rapid cytosolic Ca2+ transients in Arabidopsis thaliana. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
The experimental design include 4 different experiments: 1. TFP response. 2. W7 response. 3. W7 (W7 + Ca) Vs. W7 pretreated with La3+ (W7 -Ca). 4. W7 pretreated with La3+ (W7 - Ca) Vs. DMSO pretreated with La3+ (control). For each experiment there are three independent biological repeats, including one Dye swap.
