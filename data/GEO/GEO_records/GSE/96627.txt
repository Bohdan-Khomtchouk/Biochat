TITLE
Transcriptomic response to 24-hour food deprivation in four hypothalamic nuclei

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothalamus has an established role in the central control of energy homeostasis.  In this study, we examine the gene expression changes in four discrete hypothalamic nuclei across 24-hour food deprived versus ad libitum fed mice.

DESIGN
Using wild-type fed or 24-hour fasted male mice, we laser-capture microdissected four hypothalamic nuclei for RNA sequencing: the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), arcuate nucleus (ARC), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN).
