ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:  The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) resulting from a Mesp1Cre driven ablation of Hira in the heart at E11.5 and E12.5. Methods: RNA extraction was done in triplicate from Mesp1Cre;Hira-/fl and Mesp1Cre;Hira+/fl embryonic hearts at E11.5 and E12.5 using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit. RNAseq was processed by the ICH genomics facility, reads were aligned and normalised using BOWTIE and  DEseq R package. Strand NGS 2.5 software was used to re-analyse the aligned files (.bam). By applying the Mann Whitney unpaired test, Benjamini Hochberg False discovery rate (FDR) and filtering the genes using adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 1.5, 95 % of the results were identical to the DEseq package used by the UCL Genomics facility. Results: We identified 360 coding transcripts changed in the mutant hearts (Mann Whitney unpaired test, Benjamini Hochberg FDR, p ≤ 0.05, FC ≥ 1.5) with no trend towards up- or down-regulation of global transcription (48.8% down vs 51.2% up) at E12.5. Conclusions: This work analyses the role of HIRA in mouse cardiac development. It was found that Tnni2 is the most upregulated gene in the absence of Hira. qRT-PCR validation of 25 targets. Little ( < 5%) or no variation of fold change between RNAseq and qRT-PCR data were observed.

DESIGN
Cardiac mRNA profiles of 11-day and 12-day embryonic days Mesp1Cre control (Ctrl) and Mesp1Cre;Hira-/fl (mut) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
