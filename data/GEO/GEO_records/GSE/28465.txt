TITLE
Effects of overexpression of Sox2 on gene expression in adult mouse intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of changes seen in the adult mouse intestine in response to Sox2 overexpression, gene expression was analyzed in the ileum upon 2-day Doxycycline (DOX) treatment of mice containing Dox-inducible Sox2 transgene. Repression of Cdx2 and of its intestinal targets was observed and confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining. This effect of Sox2 was distinct from the effect of overexpression of Oct4.

DESIGN
6-8 week old TetON-Sox2, rtTA controls (no TetOP-Sox2 transgene), TetON-Oct4, and TetON-Sox2 X TetON-Oct4 mice (2 replicates) were treated for 2 days with 2 mg/ml DOX or were left untreated. Intestines (ileum part) were collected and total mRNA was extracted.
