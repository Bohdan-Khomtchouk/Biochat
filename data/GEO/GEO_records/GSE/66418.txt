TITLE
Specific IMPC gene expression signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polarity defects are a hallmark of most carcinomas. Cells from invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPCs) of the breast are characterized by a striking cell polarity inversion and represent a good model for the analysis of polarity abnormalities. We have performed an in-depth investigation of polarity alterations in 24 IMPCs, compared with invasive carcinomas of no special type (ICNST). We used microarrays to compared gene expression profilings of IMPC with ICNST in a training set and in validation one.

DESIGN
124 breast cancer samples: 73 IMPC and 51 ICNST (training set: 63 samples and validation set: 61 samples)
