TITLE
Comparative gene-expression analysis on the first-generation offspring of irradiated male and female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Invstigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in kidney of the male offspring of BALB/c male and female mice exposed to 1 Gy of acute X-rays The design of this study is further described in Abouzeid Ali, H. E., R. C. Barber, and Y. E. Dubrova. 2012. The effects of maternal irradiation during adulthood on mutation induction and transgenerational instability in mice. Mutat. Res. 732(1): 21-25. (PMID: 22289278).

DESIGN
A six 12x135K chip study using total RNA extracted from kidney of control and treated BALB/c male mice. The expression of 42,575 genes was measured with at least two-fold technical redundancy.
