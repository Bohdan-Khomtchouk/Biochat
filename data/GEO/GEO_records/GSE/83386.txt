TITLE
Gene expression of Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from Depressed Patients after in-vitro treatment with fluoxetine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used whole gene gene expression profiling to identify potential gene expression biomarkers associated for the treatment individualization of depressive disorders.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured after 21 days of in-vitro treatment with therapeutical concentrations of fluoxetine in n=10 LCLs derived from depressed patients with documented clinical treatment outcome.
