TITLE
The microRNA profile of human periodontal ligament-derived stem cells subjected to dynamic tensile strain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to investigate the microRNA expression profile of mechnically strained human periodontal ligament-derived stem cells, and SurePrint G3 Human v16 miRNA Array (Agilent) was employed as a screening platform. We discovered 39 differentially expressed microRNAs between the stretched and the static control group.

DESIGN
Human periodontal ligament-derived stem cells were cultured on elastic silicone membranes and either subjected to a dynamic mechanical strain protocol (2hr, 5% elongation, 0.5Hz) or left undisturbed. Total RNA was collected and extracted by TRIzol. RNA samples with 28S/18S ratios in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 were used for microRNA microarray analysis using the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human v16 miRNA Array Kit. The samples in each group were triplicated.
