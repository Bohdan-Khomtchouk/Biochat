TITLE
Systematic analysis of the pro and anti-inflammatory activation of mouse myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inflammation is a fundamental physiological process and a key line of defense against pathogen invasion. Inflammation is exquisitely controlled: Too high and inflammation can be dangerous to the organism, but too low and the invading pathogen can escape suppression. Multiple opposing molecules initiate either a pro or anti inflammatory program, of particular interest is the pro-inflammatory bacterial endotoxins and an opposing anti-inflammatory pathway involving IL-10 and STAT3. Much work has been expended in understanding these two pathways in macrophages, key cells in the myeloid system. But other cells of the myeloid system also show a response to endotoxin and IL-10. These myeloid cell types have been less well explored. With the aim to understand similarities and differences amongst myeloid cells we performed RNA-seq analysis on 5 cells from the myeloid system: Macrophages, Neutrophils, splenic dendritic cells, mast cells and eosinophils. We treated the cells with IL-10 or LPS (endotoxin), either separately or in combination. Although the 5 cell types show much similarity in the outcome of the pro inflammatory response, the broad outline of their pro and anti-inflammatory response is highly divergent between the 5 myeloid cell types.

DESIGN
RNA-seq data from 5 myeloid cell types, treated with IL-10, LPS or both in combination. Samples are in biological duplicate.
