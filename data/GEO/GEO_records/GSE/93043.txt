TITLE
The pluripotency factor Zfp281 coordinates transcriptional and epigenetic control of epiblast maturation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The early development of mouse embryos involves a tightly regulated series of lineage specification events. Following implantation, these events include maturation of the pluripotent epiblast and simultaneous establishment of the embryonic axes. Here we report that Zfp281, a transcription factor shown to be required for transitioning cells in culture from na√Øve to primed states of pluripotency, is essential for mouse embryonic development by regulating epiblast maturation. Transcriptomic analyses of Zfp281 mutant embryos revealed a failure in activating Nodal signaling in the epiblast leading to failure in establishing the anterior-posterior axis, and impaired epiblast maturation. Our study establishes Zfp281 as a critical factor that coordinates transcriptional and epigenetic control of pluripotent epiblast maturation.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing analysis was performed in WT and Zfp281KO mouse embryos at E6.5. Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Zfp281 was performed in mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) by ChIP sequencing.
