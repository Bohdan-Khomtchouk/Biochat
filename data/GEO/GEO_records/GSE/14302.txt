TITLE
Identification of human Myc- and Lin-28B-responsive transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to examine the consequences of Myc and Lin-28B induction on the transcriptome, P493-6 cells (human EBV-transformed B lymphocytes) were infected with a retrovirus that produces human Lin-28B or empty virus as a control. Gene expression profiles were then monitored in the high and low Myc state using Affymetrix microarrays.
