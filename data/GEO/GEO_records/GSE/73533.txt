TITLE
Gene Expression of Double Positive LCK:Hdac3 KO 3w old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in double positive (DP) thymoctes from 3w old LCK Hdac3 conditional KO mice. In this data set we sorted GFP double positive (DP) thymocytes from 3w old mice to identify possible signaling and transcripitonal programs that might explain the DP to single positive block in cell maturation

DESIGN
Total RNA was pooled from 2 WT and 2 LCK:Hdac3 KO mice for a total of 3 biological replicates.
