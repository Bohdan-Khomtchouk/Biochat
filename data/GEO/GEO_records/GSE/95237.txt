TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state and chromatin accessibility in CD8 T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand epigenetic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell differentiation, we performed ChIP-seq of 4 histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) and ATAC-seq to probe chromatin states and accessibility. We identified subset-specific regulatory elements (enhancers and promoters) from chromatin states and predicted key transcription factors from accessible regulatory regions using ATAC-seq.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different histone modifications and open chromatin in 4 cell types.
