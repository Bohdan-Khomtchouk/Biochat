TITLE
Tag-seq in eye-antennal and wing imaginal discs of D.melanogaster, D.yakuba, and D.virilis; RNA-seq in wild-type and glass mutant D.melanogaster eye-antennal imaginal discs.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study we use Tag-sequencing in eye-antennal and wing imaginal discs across Drosophila species to determine a set of conserved eye-specific developmental genes. Next, we perform motif discovery analysis using the tool i-cisTarget, to depict the core gene developmental network underlying compound eye photoreceptor. The Glass position weight matrix appears as the most highly overrepresented motif, thus positioning Glass as a master regulator in compound eye photoreceptor development. Differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq in D.melanogaster wild-type eye-antennal versus glass mutant [gl 60j] shows that the majority of our predicted Glass targets show strong downregulation in the glass mutant.
