TITLE
Transcription profile of B cells isolated from peripheral lymph nodes of wild-type vs CCR7-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional profile of B cells isolated from peripheral lymph nodes of CCR7-/-C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 mice respectively. B cells were sorted as follows: CD19+, CD3-, CD11c-, CD11b-, NK1.1-, GR-1-. Very few genes were differentially regulated in CCR7-/- B cells, however the expression of a number of genes associated with B-cell activation was increased in CCR7-/- B cells compared to WT B cells. Our data suggest a role of CCR7 signaling in B-cell activation processes.

DESIGN
12 purified RNA samples (6 samples of each genotype), originated from 12 individually facs-sorted cell samples, were used for the microarray study. 3 RNA samples per genotype were pooled, giving rise to 2 wildtype- and 2 Ccr7 knock-out pools. In each of the 2 dual-color microarray hybridizations, samples from 1 wildtype and 1 Ccr7 knock-out pool were cohybridized. Microarray hybridizations 1 and 2 were performed in a dye-swap approach.
