TITLE
Expression data from human 3D skin models in response to IL-31 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease with increasing prevalance, is closely associated with skin barrier defects. A cytokine related to disease severity and inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation is IL-31. To identify its molecular targets, IL-31-dependent gene expression was determined in 3-dimensional organotypic skin models. In this data set we include expression data from human 3D skin models treated with or without IL-31 for 2, 8, 24 and 48 hours.  As a source of keratinocytes HaCaT cells were used. These are immortalized primary keratinocytes. Human dermal fibroblasts were derived from a skin biopsy.

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples were analyzed. We compared the control vs the IL-31 treated sample for each time point.
