TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of telomerase-regulated genes in MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of purified telomerase deficient (Terc-/-) and WT LSCs was performed in order to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the susceptibilities of Terc-/- LSCs in vivo. Results provide important information on the response of LSCs to telomerase deficiency, such as telomerase-dependent genes, and dysregulated cellular functions including cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair, altered cellular morphology, cellular function and maintenance, and activated programmed cell death.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from G3 Terc-/- LSCs compared to WT LSCs (MLLAF9gfp+, lin-, kit+, Fcgr+) purified from primary recipients at individual disease onset.
