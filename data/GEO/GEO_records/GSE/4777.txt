TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in embryos in wich the nodal-related genes have been inhibited and in control embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Embryos were injected with either water or Cerberus Short mRNA and harvested at Stage 10.5 for RNA analysis. Keywords: Knock-down analysis

DESIGN
Embryos from three different spawnings where injected at one cell stage with either water or Cerberus Short mRNA and cultured to early gastrula stage 10.5 for RNA isolation. Some embryos were cultured to further development to check their phenotypes. Each slide was hybridised with a mixture 1:1 of sample and control cDNAs, each labelled with a different dye. Hybridisations were carried out as dye-swapped technical replicates, therefore six microarray slides were hybridized

PLATFORM
GPL3728 Xenopus tropicalis genome oligo set
