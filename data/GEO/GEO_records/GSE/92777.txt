TITLE
Expression data from human clear-cell renal cell carcinoma cell line 769-P after overexpression of FOXK2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common urological malignant neoplasms. In addition, ccRCC is a highly aggressive cancer with a concomitant poor prognosis. Forkhead box K2 (FOXK2) has been reported to involve in many molecular mechanisms.However, little is known about the role FOXK2 plays in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Our previous study showed that FOXK2 mRNA and protein expression were decreased in human ccRCC tissues and suppressed the proliferation of ccRCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We used microarrays (Affymetrix HTA2.0 Array) to detail the differentially expressed genes after overexpression of FOXK2, and aim to find potential one or more target gene/genes of FOXK2

DESIGN
We conducted the genome-wide transcriptome profiling of human ccRCC cell line 769-P after transfection with pLV-EGFP-FOXK2 (overexpression of FOXK2) and plv-EGFP empty vector (control)
