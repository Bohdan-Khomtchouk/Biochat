TITLE
Transcription Factors Sp8 and Sp9 Coordinately Regulate Olfactory Bulb Interneuron Development [RNA-seq 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To asses changes in gene expression profiles from the P30 wild type littermate control olfactory bulbs and conditional double knockout olfactory bulbs of hGFAP-Cre; Sp8 Flox/Flox; Sp9 Flox/Flox mice. Methods: Total RNA was isolated and sequenced from the olfactory bulbs of the P30 wild type littermate controls or hGFAP-Cre; Sp8 Flox/Flox; Sp9 Flox/Flox mice in tetrad using an illumina high-seq 2500. Raw data was analyzed using TopHat. Genes were considered changed  which performed fold-change > =2 and FDR < =0.05. Changed genes were then filtered to reveal the downstream targets of Sp8 and Sp9. Results: 31 genes were significantly increased and 74 genes were significantly decreased in expression level due to the loss of Sp9 and Sp8 expression.
