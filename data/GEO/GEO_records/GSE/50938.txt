TITLE
Global reprogramming of the cellular translational landscape facilitates cytomegalovirus replication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling establishes that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) exerts an extensive, unforeseen level of specific control over which cellular mRNAs are recruited to or excluded from polyribosomes. The landscape of translationally-regulated host mRNAs regulates HCMV replication. The HCMV imposed translational signature shares similarities with cancer cells

DESIGN
Two biological replicate experiments were performed profiling total and polysomal mRNAs from i) HCMV-infected vs mock-infected cells and ii) uninfected cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing doxycyclin (dox)-inducible HCMV UL38 +/- dox. Analysis of translationally-controlled host genes in HCMV-infected cell and cells expressing the HCMV UL38 gene product
