TITLE
Chemical perturbation of Trypanosoma brucei procyclic form cells

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
T. brucei PF cells were treated with several chemical reagents and anti-trypanosomatid drugs. The effect of each chemical perturbation on the transcriptome of T. brucei was examined by transcript profiling of treated vs. control cells. The results indicated widespread changes, suggesting that the transcriptome of T. brucei is highly responsive to environmental factors that perturb its metabolic and biological pathways.

DESIGN
11 chemical perturbations, each co-hybridized with a common reference RNA from control non-treated cells. One array per treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL10221 JCVI PFGRC Trypanosoma brucei 19K v4 array designed primarily based on strain TREU927
