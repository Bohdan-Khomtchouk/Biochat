TITLE
Global gene expression of Ruegeria pomeroyi strain DSS3 in response to glucose, ammonium, phosphate, or sulfate limitation

ORGANISM
Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3

SUMMARY
We used the previously designed oligonucleotide-based microarray (Burgmann et al. Environmental Microbiology 2007, 9: 2742-2755) to detect the transcripts of R. pomeroyi DSS-3 genes when the cells were cultured under steady-state carbon (glucose), nitrogen (ammonium), phosphorus (phosphate), or sulfur (sulfate) limitation.

DESIGN
A total of 14 mRNA samples were hybridized to the arrays (three biological replicates from glucose, ammonium, phosphate, or sulfate limitation and one technical replicate each for ammonium or sulfate limitation)
