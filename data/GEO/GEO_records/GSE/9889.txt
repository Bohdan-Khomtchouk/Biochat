TITLE
mef2 activity levels differentially affect gene expression during Drosophila muscle development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The conserved Mef2 transcription factor is a major regulator of gene expression and differentiation.  Recent genomic studies have identified a large number of mef2-regulated target genes with distinct temporal expression profiles during Drosophila myogenesis.  However, the question remains as to how a single transcription factor can control such diverse patterns of gene expression.  The aim of this project was to investigate whether there are genes with different mef2-requirements for their expression during muscle differentiation in vivo during the development of Drosophila melanogaster. Keywords: allelic series comparison
