TITLE
Tthe transcriptional profile analysis of mice liver CD8+ T cells from dnTGFβRII (TG) mice VS.dnTGFβRII CXCR3-/- (TGC3) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Based on the data we obtained we next focused on potential intrinsic changes of CD8+ T cells. Gene expression proﬁles of CD8+ T cells isolated from livers of both the TG and TGC3 mice were analyzed by gene microarray.

DESIGN
The gene expression proﬁles of liver CD8+ T cells from two groups of mice (TG VS.TGC3) were analyzed using an oligonucleotide microarray, to identify the role of chemokine receptor CXCR3 in CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation.
