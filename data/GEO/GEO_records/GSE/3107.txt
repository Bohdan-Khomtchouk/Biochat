TITLE
mgrA acts as a repressor of the rlrA pathogenicity islet

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pneumoniae normally resides in the human nasopharynx in a non-disease state.  In response to yet unknown triggers it can descend to the lower respiratory tract and/or invade the bloodstream.  Regulation and activation of virulence genes play essential roles in this process of disease development.  A putative transcriptional regulator in S. pneumoniae, MgrA, with homology to a virulence gene activator, mga, of Group A streptococcus (GAS) was previously identified as being required for development of pneumonia in a murine model.  In this work we confirm that mgrA is required for both nasopharyngeal carriage and pneumonia.  Transcriptional profiling by microarray technology through the growth course of a strain that bears a deletion of mgrA (AC1500) with that of a strain that over expresses Mgra (AC1481) is used to show that MgrA .  This is manifested phenotypically by a decrease in adherence to epithelial cells in tissue culture since rlrA pathogenicity islet contains genes mediating adherence.
