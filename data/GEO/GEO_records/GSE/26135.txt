TITLE
Gene analysis of flagellin-treated nasal mucosa of Duox2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the roles of DUOX2 in flagellin- induced inflammatory response in mouse nasal mucosa. Wild type (Duox2+/+) and Duox2 knockout (Duox2-/-) mice were stimulated with 1 Î¼g/ml of flagellin for 4h. 422 genes ( > 2 fold) were up-regulated in nasal mucosa of Duox2+/+ that was treated with flagellin and the full list of genes is presented in Supplemental Table II. These genes included the following defense- and immune response-related genes : Cytokine/chemokine-related genes (CCL20, CCR2, CCR5, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL16, IL18RAP, TNFAIP2, IL1B EAR2, FPR1), Granulocyte-related genes (IL8RB, MPO, PRG2, PPBP, PRG3), interferon-related genes (IFITM6, IFI47), macrophage related genes (IL1B, S100A9), and T-cell mediated immune response related genes (H2-Q6, IL1F9). In addition, signal transduction (PPBP, OLFR60, P2RY10) and cell adhesion (SELL, SELP, ICAM1, DSG1A, DSG3, VCAM1) related genes were also increased by flagellin treatment. These genes were selected based on the biological processes and molecular functions of their gene ontology. However, the increase of inflammation and immune response related genes by flagellin treatment were diminished in the nasal mucosa of the Duox2-/- mice compared with that of Duox2+/+ mice.

DESIGN
Wild type (Duox2+/+) and Duox2 knockout (Duox2-/-) mice received either PBS (control) or flagellin (5 ug/ml) intranasally for 4h.
