TITLE
Therapeutic potential of induced neural stem cells for spinal cord injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The spinal cord does not spontaneously regenerate after injury and a treatment that ensures functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is still not available. Recently, fibroblasts have been directly converted into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) following the forced expression of different combinations of transcription factors. Although directly converted iNSCs have been considered as a potentialcell source for clinical applications, their therapeutic potential has not been investigated yet. Here we show that iNSCs directly converted from mouse fibroblasts enhance the functional recovery after SCI in rats. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were directly converted into iNSCs using four transcription factors (Brn4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). iNSCs showed gene expression profiles similar to cNSCs as determined by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
MEFs were derived from C3H mouse strain embryos at embryonic day (E)13.5 after removing the head and all internal organs including the gonads and the spinal cord. 5x10^4 fibroblasts were transduced with replication-defective retroviral particles coding for Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Brn4. After 48 h, the transduced fibroblasts were cultured in standard NSC medium. iNSC clusters were observed 4-5 weeks after transduction and expanded. Both MEFs and cNSCs were used as negative and positive control, respectively.
