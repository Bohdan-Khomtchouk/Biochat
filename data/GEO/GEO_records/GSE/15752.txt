TITLE
Gene regulation by the RcsCB two-component system and the auxiliary protein TviA in S. Typhi

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
In response to osmolarity, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) regulates genes required for Vi capsular antigen expression oppositely to those required for motility and invasion. Previous studies suggest that osmoregulation of motility, invasion and capsule expression is mediated through the RcsC/RcsD/RcsB phosphorelay system. Here we performed gene expression profiling and functional studies to determine the role of TviA, an auxiliary protein of the RcsB response regulator, in controlling virulence gene expression in S. Typhi. TviA repressed expression of genes encoding flagella and the invasion associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) through repression of the flagellar regulators flhDC and fliZ, resulting in reduced invasion and reduced expression of FliC. Both RcsB and TviA reduced expression of flhDC, but only TviA altered flhDC expression in response to osmolarity. These data suggest that the auxiliary TviA protein integrates a new regulatory input into the RcsB regulon of S. Typhi, thereby altering expression of genes encoding flagella, the Vi antigen and T3SS-1 in response to osmolarity.
