Human cells infected with Mucormycosis-causing strains from clinical settings

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mucormycosis is an increasingly common, life-threatening fungal infection caused by fungi belonging to the subphylum Mucormycotina, order Mucorales. The major risk factors for mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, treatment with corticosteroids, organ or bone marrow transplantation, neutropenia, trauma and burns, malignant hematological disorders, and deferoxamine-therapy in patients receiving hemodialysis. Amphotericin B (AmB) remains the only antifungal agent approved for the treatment of invasive mucormycosis. Because fungi belonging to the mucorales order are relatively resistant to AmB, high doses are required, which frequently causes nephrotoxicity and other adverse effects. In the absence of surgical removal of the infected focus (such as excision of the eye in patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis), antifungal therapy alone is rarely curative. Even when surgical debridement is combined with high-dose AmB, the mortality associated with mucorÂ¬mycosis is > 50%. In patients with prolonged neutropenia or disseminated disease, mortality is 90-100%. Rhizopus oryzae is by far the most common organism isolated from patients with mucormycosis, and is responsible for approximately 70% of all cases of mucormycosis. Recent epidemiological data collected from transplant centers have demonstrated a striking increase in the number of reported cases of mucormycosis. Furthermore, mucormycosis outbreaks are also known to follow natural disasters as was the case following the tsunami that devastated Indonesia in 2004 and the tornadoes that destroyed Joplin, Missouri in June 2011.  Hence, there exists a large impetus to identify particular virulence factors and biomarkers associated with mucormycosis, which would lead to a rational approach to develop new antifungals and vaccines to prevent deaths specifically due to mucormycosis. In order to better understand the complex nature of the host pathogen interaction during mucormycosis, we performed dual species RNA-seq on 5 different Mucorales strains during in vitro infection of endothelial or epithelial cells.

DESIGN
5 different strains of Mucorales (see below) were used to infect two different types of human tissue culture monolayers of either epithelial cells or endothelial cells. RNA from the infection mixtures were harvested at 90 minutes post infection.

The negative control samples were the host or C. albicans cells alone in tissue culture media for the same amount of time. RNA extractions were performed using RiboPure RNA Purification Kit, yeast (Life Technologies, AM1926) following manufacturer's protocols RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols RNA-Seq Base calls were performed using the bulit in Illumina basecaller. Sequenced reads were mapped to each fungal genome and the human genome using TopHat v. 1.4. RPKM values were calculated for the genes in the human genome. Genome Build: Homo sapiens.GRCh37.71
