TITLE
double mutant sbe-The impact of some genes mutations implicated in the amidon metabolism

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af30_starch_circadian_rythm - double mutant sbe - The scientific aim is to study the impact of some genes mutations implicated in the amidon metabolism on the expression profils of other genes and in particular those of the carbonated metabolism. Those analyses will be done from RNAs (total or messenger) extracted from leaves at various time of the day and the night - Biological question : what is the impact of the absence of both branching enzymes II on the expression of the genes involved in carbon metabolism in the Arabidopsis leaves? Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
