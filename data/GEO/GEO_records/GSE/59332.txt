TITLE
Self-Enforcing Feedback Activation between BCL6 and Pre-B Cell Receptor Signaling Defines a Distinct Subtype of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BCL6fl/fl mouse bone marrow pre-B cells were transduced with an TCF3-PBX1 vector. The TCF3-PBX1 transduced BCL6fl/fl pre-B cells were then transduced with an empty vector (EV), or a Cre vector for Cre-mediated BCL6 deletion. Effect of BCL6 deletion in the TCF3-PBX1 pre-B cells were studied by Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
TCF3-PBX1 transduced BCL6fl/fl mice bone marrow pre-B cells were tranduced with an empty vector (EV) or a Cre vector for BCL6 deletion
