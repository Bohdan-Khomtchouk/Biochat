TITLE
NINJA connects JAZ proteins to the co-repressor TOPLESS

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
NINJA (At4g28910)  and TOPLESS proteins function as negative regulators of jasmonate responses. Our results point to TPL proteins as general co-repressors that affect multiple signalling pathways through the interaction with specific adaptor proteins. This new insight reveals how stress- and growth-related signalling cascades use common molecular mechanisms to regulate gene expression in plants.
