TITLE
NINJA connects JAZ proteins to the co-repressor TOPLESS

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
NINJA (At4g28910)  and TOPLESS proteins function as negative regulators of jasmonate responses. Our results point to TPL proteins as general co-repressors that affect multiple signalling pathways through the interaction with specific adaptor proteins. This new insight reveals how stress- and growth-related signalling cascades use common molecular mechanisms to regulate gene expression in plants.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Col-0 vs. plants silencing NINJA (RNAi-NINJA) and both Col-0  vs RNAi NINJA treated with coronatine  . Biological replicates: 4 control replicates untreated , 4 RNAi NINJA untreated replicates, 4 control treated replicates and 4 RNAi NINJA treated replicates
