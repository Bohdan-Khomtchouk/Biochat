TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SRC-1/NCOA1 and Erα/ESR1 binding in chromatin obtained from the ERα stably transfected U2OS osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS-ERα) with ChIP-SEQ.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of SRC-1 in estrogen signaling in bone, a genome-wide analysis of ERα and SRC-1 binding sites in the absense and presence of E2 was conducted.

DESIGN
Cells were grown in CSS media for 3 days, and treated with vehicle (EtOH) or estrogen (10^-8M) for 45 minutes and immediately harvested for chomatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
