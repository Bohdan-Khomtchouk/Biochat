TITLE
Genome-wide molecular characterisation of CNS PNET and Pineoblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
sPNETs are highly malignant embryonal brain tumours of poor prognosis. The underlying biology is poorly understood. To address this we therefore performed high resolution genetic analysis. 36 CNS PNETs and 8 PBs were analysed using the Affymetrix 100K and 500K Mapping Set to identify copy number imbalance at both the chromosome and gene level. Keywords: Affymetrix 100K SNP array, Affymetrix 500K SNP arrays

DESIGN
36 CNS PNETs and 8 PBs with constitutional controls
