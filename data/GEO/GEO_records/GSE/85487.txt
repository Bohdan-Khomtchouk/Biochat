TITLE
Effects of IFN-a and IFN-b on ex vivo ATL patient pbmcs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data contained in this record are used to differentiate between the effects of IFN-a and IFN-b on 48h cultures of the ex vivo pbmcs of ATL patients, using Affymetrix microarrays (HuGene 1.0).

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes between ex vivo PBMCs of ATL patients, cultured in parallel for 48h with either no treatment, 1000 IU IFN-a treatment or 1000 IU of IFN-b treatment
