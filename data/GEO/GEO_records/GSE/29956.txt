TITLE
Gene expression analysis of prostate tumors arisen in TRAMP mice in which mast cells are pharmacologically stabilized or genetically ablated.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of prostate tumors arisen in TRAMP mice in which mast cells are pharmacologically stabilized or genetically ablated.The hypothesis tested in the present study was that mast cells inhibition or absence impacted prostate tumor development and histotype. Results demonstrate that prostate tumors arisen in TRAMP mice in which mast cells are pharmacologically stabilized or genetically ablated have a neuroendocrine signature.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tumors from 24 wks old TRAMP mice chronically treated with sodium chromoglycate (cromolyn) since 8 wks of age, and from 24 wks old TRAMP KitW-sh mice, compared to untreated 30 wks old TRAMP mice and to non tumoral prostates
