TITLE
miR-975 overexpression effect on Drosophila cell lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila simulans ; Drosophila virilis

SUMMARY
We overexpressed the conspecific miR-975 in the cell lines derived from multiple Drosophila species (i.e. S2 cells from Drosophila melanogaster; ML82-19a cells from Drosophila simulans and WR-Dv-1 cells from Drosophila virilis). Comparison of the miR-975 effect between different cell lines provide insight into the rewiring of regulatory network through the evolution of new microRNA.

DESIGN
We examined conspecific miR-975 effect in three cell types. Empty vector (pUAST-only) was transfected as control. Two biological replicates were done for each treatment.
