TITLE
Mapping transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II in C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A large portion of the mammalian genome is associated with the nuclear lamina (NL).  Here we have documented genome-wide transcriptional activities by measuring the densities, locations and orientations of transcriptionally-engaged RNA polymerase II in mouse C2C12 myoblasts using global run-on sequencing. Interestingly, a significant fraction (~20%) of NL-associated genes were detected to be transcriptionally active.
