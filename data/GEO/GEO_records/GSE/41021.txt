TITLE
Retinoic acid determines the in vivo fate-commitment of splenic pre-dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression changes of FACS sorted splenic CD11b+CD8a- and CD11b-CD8a+ cDC subsets reconstituted in vivo following total body irradiation in combination with exogenous retinoic acid or vehicle control.

DESIGN
Mice maintained on a control diet were subjected to 6 Gy total body irradiation and then provided exogenous retinoic acid or vehicle control beginning on D(+)3 after irradiation. All treated mice also received adoptive T cell transfer of either Trp-1 CD4+ or Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells, rVV, and IL-2.  Splenic cDCs were isolated on D(+)10 after total body irradiation by FACS sorting.
