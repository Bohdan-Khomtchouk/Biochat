SUMMARY
Strains lacking indicated genes were transformed with GST-YPT1.  Ypt1p was IPd with anti-GST ab and associated rna was analyzed. A genetic modification design type is where an organism(s) has had genetic material removed, rearranged, mutagenized or added, such as knock out. GeneticModification: gene deleted from parent strain
