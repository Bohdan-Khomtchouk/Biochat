TITLE
Reciprocal regulation of genes expression by Ephedra herba in mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis was conducted using the brain tissue of mouse orally administrated aqueous extracts of Ephedra herba, in which the expression level of many genes were altered depending on the duration of treatment time. In particular, temporal changes in the expressions of genes can be classified into two major reciprocal patterns.

DESIGN
Aqueous extracts of Ephedra herba were administered orally at dosage of 50 or 1,250 mg/kg once daily for 1, 3 and 10 consecutive days on mice. Expression level of genes from brain tissue was compared to that from untreated control mice.
