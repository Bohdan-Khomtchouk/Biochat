TITLE
HeLa cell: DUSP2 overexpression vs. control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MAPK-specific phosphatase, dual-specificity phosphatase-2 (DUSP2), was negatively regulated by HIF-1a under hypoxia. To identify the downstream genes regulated by DUSP2, microarray analysis was performed. Agilent two color microarray  was used to examine the molecular profile after DUSP2 overexpression

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control HeLa vs. DUSP2-overexpressed-Hela cells. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 transfected replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
