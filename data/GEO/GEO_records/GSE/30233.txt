TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis - Comparison of wild type SMR5 under nitrogen surplus and starvation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
In this approach, total transcript of the Mycobacterium smegmatis wild type SMR5 was compared under nitrogen surplus and starvation. This resulted in the change of transcript patterns of more than 500 genes due to nitrogen or general starvation response. Genes involved in uptake and assimilation of ammonium and alternative nitrogen sources showed enhanced transcript levels, genes involved in cell growth, protein biosynthesis etc showed reduced transcript levels. Two biological replicates were analyzed.
