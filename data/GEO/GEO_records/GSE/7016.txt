TITLE
Knock out Nur77 - Gene regulation studies in different organs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nur77 is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is expressed in various types of cells and mediates diverse biological processes. The knock out Nur77 has a mutation in exon 2. Ligands of the nuclear receptor are unknown. Keywords: Dual colour hybridisation on cDNA microarrays, Nur77, Knock out

DESIGN
DNA chip technology has been exploited for RNA expression profiling analysis. Close to genome-wide microarrays were used for identification of changes in gene expression levels in lung, heart, spleen, testis, skeleton muscle, brown adipose tissue of Nur77-/- mice. 7 pooled mutant mice were hybridised in repetitions against a pool of 7 reference mice (Nur77+/+). In total 24 chip hybridisations were performed including 50% dye swap experiments.

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
