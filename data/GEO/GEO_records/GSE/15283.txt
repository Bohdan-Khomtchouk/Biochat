TITLE
Profiling of FACs sorted subpopulations of iPS cells from cell surface marker profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two independent induced pluripotent stem cell lines: ES4CL1 (derived from foreskin) and MR90C2 (derived from lung Fibroblast) were maintained on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in the presence of ESC media containing DMEM, 20% knock-out serum replacement with 100ng/mL of bFGF.  7 days after seeding, cells were harvested in TrypLE Express and FACs sorted using antibodies detecting the presence of cell surface antigens GCTM-2 and CD9. 4 independent fractions were isolated after cell sorting: P4 (CD9-Negative, GCTM-2 Negative); P5 (CD9-Low, GCTM-2 Low); P6 (CD9-Medium, GCTM-2 medium) and P7 (CD9-High, GCTM-2 High).  Each individual experiment was performed in triplicate. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Three consecutive passages of both ES4CL1 and MR90C2 cells were grown in standard conditions, FACs sorted cells collected, and total RNA isolated.   Microarray was performed on a total of 24 samples, (3 replicates of 4 FACs sorted populations from two independent cell lines).
