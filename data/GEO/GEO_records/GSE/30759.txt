TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and cancer tissue from the uterine cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in normal and cancer tissue from the uterine cervix. There are a total of 63 samples, 15 samples of normal histology and 48 cervical cancers. The normal cervical samples were from women who underwent a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. The 48 cervical cancers were from women who were treated at the Innsbruck Medical University between 1990 and 2006.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 63 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
