TITLE
Germination and appressorium formation in Magnaporthe grisea

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
This series examines differential gene expression during germination and appressorium formation by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.  Conidia were germinated on either the hydrophobic (inductive) or hydrophilic (non-inductive) side of GelBond.  RNA was extracted from conidia and following incubation for 7 and 12 hours.  RNA from two biological replications of each treatment was pooled in equal amounts and labeled with both cy3 and cy5 dyes using the Agilent Technologies Low Input Linear Amplification Kit.  Hybridizations were performed on Agilent Technologies whole genome oligo rice blast arrays (product G4137A) using manufacturer prescribed protocols and reagents in an interlaced loop design in which each treatment was paired with every other.  This series contains a total of 10 hybridizations; each treatment was used in 4 hybridizations (2 with cy3 and 2 cy5).  Spot fluorescence was normalized using Lowess within and between microarray slides in Bioconductor and gene expression profiles analyzed in GeneSpring. Keywords: other
