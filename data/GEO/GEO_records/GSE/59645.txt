TITLE
Gene expression of whole hippocampus 24hr post-injury in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters and dysregulates the expression of thousands of genes in the brain. Since some of the most common problems in TBI patients are learning and memory deficits, we are studying the effects of TBI on the hippocampus, a region of the brain which is essential for learning and memory and which is known to be particularly vulnerable to TBI. We are interested in understanding how potential neuroprotective drugs alter the TBI-induced gene expression profile. The objective of this study is to elucidate and compare the differential gene expression profiles in the hippocampus of naive, sham-control, TBI and TBI plus drug treated rats. JM6, PMI-006 and E33 are three compounds with neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.  Our goal is to determine if different neuroprotective compounds have similar effects on common gene targets. These genes and the cell signaling pathways linked to them would then be the target of new therapeutic strategies for TBI.

DESIGN
Rats were prepared for fluid percussion traumatic brain injury or sham injury (na√Øve rats had no anesthesia and were not handled in any way and gene expression in their brains serve as baseline data) and 24 hr post-injury, hippocampi were obtained, and stored in RNA later. Total RNA was isolated, quantitified and used for Agilent microarray analysis at GenUs Biosystems. Each group of naive, sham control, TBI and TBI plus JM6, TBI plus PMI-006 and TBI plus E33 (estrogen) has three biological replicates.
