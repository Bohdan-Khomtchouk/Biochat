TITLE
Microarray analysis of fruit flesh of European pear ‘La France’ during fruit development

ORGANISM
Pyrus communis

SUMMARY
Comprehensive investigation of gene expression during fruit development and ripening in European pear (Pyrus communis).

DESIGN
Gene expression of fruit flesh development of European pear was measured from -7 to 182 days after full bloom (DAFB). 150 DAFB is harvested stage and 182 DAFB is after ripening by chilling treatment (2°C 12 days, then 15°C 20 days).
