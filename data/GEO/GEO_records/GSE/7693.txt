TITLE
Transcriptome of irradiated keratinocyte stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterise the response of keratinocyte stem cells to ionizing radiation, gene profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays (26068 probes). Cells were seeded in culture plates after cell sorting, irradiated the next day (2 Gy at 15 hours in culture), and RNA was prepared 3 hours after exposure. LOWESS normalisation was applied. Keywords: keratinocyte stem cells, irradiation, transcriptome
