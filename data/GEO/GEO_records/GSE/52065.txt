TITLE
Gene expression analysis upon stable SmcHD1 Knock Down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the role of SmcHD1 in regulating gene expression, we have stably knocked down SmcHD1 in HEK293 cells and looked at change in gene expression. shRNA3 and shRNA4 were used to target the expression of the  SmcHD1 gene (Genbank Accession number NM_015295). The protein levels of SmcHD1 were knocked down in excess of 90% normal levels in 293 cells. shRNA NC5 a scrambled control shRNA and did not change SmcHD1 protein levels in 293 cells.

DESIGN
Agilent single color 28004 was used on 9 Samples.
