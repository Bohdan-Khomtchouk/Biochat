TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling in 293T cells upon depletion of H1.2, Cul4A or PAF1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence suggests that linker histone H1 can influence distinct cellular processes by acting as a gene-specific regulator. However, the mechanistic basis underlying such H1 specificity and whether H1 acts in concert with other chromatin-altering activities remain unclear. To investigate the cooperative role of H1.2, Cul4A and PAF1  on gene regulation, genome-wide gene expression analysis is carried out in 293T cells expressing control shRNA, H1.2 shRNA, Cul4A shRNA or PAF1 shRNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 293T cells expressing NCsh, H1.2sh, Cul4Ash, or PAF1sh
