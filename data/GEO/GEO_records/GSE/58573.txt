TITLE
First ruxolitinib treatment of human alopecia areata patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two patients with alopecia areata were treated with systemic ruxolitinib.  Skin biopsies were taken before starting treatment and 12 weeks after starting treatment. We used microarrays to assess changes in gene expression of affected skin before and after starting treatment

DESIGN
Two patients with alopecia areata were recruited for our study.  Skin biopsies of affected scalp were taken prior to starting treatment with oral ruxolinitib.  Additional skin biopsies were taken 12 weeks after starting treatment.  Scalp skin biopsies were taken from patients without alopecia areata for comparison.  RNA was extracted, cDNA libraries were made and profiled on affymetrix microarray chips.
