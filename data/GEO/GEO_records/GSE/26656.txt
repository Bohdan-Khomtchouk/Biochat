TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Wnt-1 overexpressing melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to analyze the effects of Wnt-1 overexpression on the mRNA expression profile of human melanoma in a mouse xenograft model and correlated the results with then presence or absence of lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Affymetrix gene expression analysis revealed activation of canonical and non-canonical targets genes in response to Wnt-1 as compared with controls. In regard to lymphangiogenic factors, the amount of VEGF-C was the single best marker to correlate with the amount of lymph-angiogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA expression array of human melanoma orthotopically grown in SCID mice. Comparison includes mRNA expression profile of   two melanoma cell-lines (A375 and M24met) stably overexpressing control vector or Wnt-1 treated with or without CsA. Comparison #1 comprised Wnt-1 versus control in A375 and M24met melanoma, respectively. Comparison #2 comprised Wnt-1 + Cyclosporine A (CsA) versus Wnt-1 without CsA.
