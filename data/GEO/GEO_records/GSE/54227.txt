TITLE
A human integrin-α3 mutation confers major renal developmental defects.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrin-α3 plays a central role in the interplay of cells, morphogens and ECM, required for proper nephrogenesis, thus adding ITGA3 to the list of CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract)-causing genes.

DESIGN
we used renal tissue originally obtained from a patient with an ITGA3 mutation and assessed its gene expression profile as compared to controls

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
