TITLE
Ayu macrophages at 3.5 hours, 0, 0.5 or 5 ug/ml Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), gene expression array, three independent biological replicates

ORGANISM
Plecoglossus altivelis

SUMMARY
Ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, is an economically important amphidromous fish species cultured in East Asia. LECT2 is a liver derived cytokine and involved in many pathologic conditions, especially in immune regulation. To understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of LECT2 in immune response of ayu, macrophages were isolated from ayu head kidney. After treatment with 0, 0.5 or 5 μg/ml of LECT2 for 3.5 hour, gene expression profile in ayu macrophages was measured using gene expression array. Results showed that LECT2 treatment led to the altered expression of immune related genes in ayu macrophages.

DESIGN
Gene expression in ayu macrophages isolated from head kidney were measured after exposure to 0, 0.5 or 5 μg/ml LECT2 for 3.5 hours using gene expression array. Three independent experiments were performed using different ayu for each experiment for gene expression array analysis.
