TITLE
Time series gene expression data from adult rat tail MNs following spinal cord transection

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury leads to impaired motor and sensory functions. After spinal cord injury there is a an initial phase of hypo-reflexia followed by a developing hyper-reflexia, often termed spasticity. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the reappearence of plateau potentials in motor neurons and the development of spasticity after spinalizaion. To understand the moleclar mechanism behind this pheneomona we examined the transcriptional response of the motor neurons after spinal cord injury as it progress over time. We used a rat tail injury model where a complete transection of the caudal (S2) rat spinal cord leads to an immidate flaccid paralysis of the tail and a subsequent appearence of spasticity 2-3 weeks post injury that develops into strong spasticity after 2 months. Gene expression changes were studied in motor neurones 0, 2, 7, 21 and 60 days after comlete spinal transection.

DESIGN
Tail MNs were retorgradely labelled with flourogold injected into the muscle and intra peritoneally. 5-7 days after tracer injections the spinal cord was dissected out, snab frozen in liquid nitrogen, sliced in 10 um thick slices and fluorescent motor neurons were laser dissected into a collector tube to a total of ca. 50-200 cells pr sample. RNA was then extracted, two round amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix rat 230 2.0 arays. 31 samples were hybridized onto chips, 4 Spi-0 (Control), 6 Spi-2, 5 Spi-7, 8 Spi-21 and  8 Spi-60.
