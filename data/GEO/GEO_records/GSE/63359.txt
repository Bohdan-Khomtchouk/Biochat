TITLE
Expression data for peripheral human blood leukocytes gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression level in PBLs (peripheral blood leukocytes) could serve as biomarkers for symptomatic knee osteroarthritis (OA). We used microarrays to detail the significant genes that are down/up regulated in OA PBLs by studying both the control and OA groups. We would like to acknowledge NIAMS support through (AR052873 & AR054817) and U01-AR050911.

DESIGN
For patiens with or without OA, blood samples were collected. Total RNA isolated and were used for hybridization against the Human Genome U133A microarray.
