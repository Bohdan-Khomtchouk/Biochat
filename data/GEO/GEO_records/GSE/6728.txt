TITLE
Expression data for NMD inhibition in Mantle Cell Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of potential tumor suppressor genes using the GINI strategy in Mantle Cell Lymphoma cell lines Keywords: response to drug treatment

DESIGN
Inhibition of the NMD pathway was performed in Mantle Cell Lymphoma cell lines according to a modified protocol previously described (Noensie EN et al Nat Biotechnol 2001;19:434-439; Huusko P et al, Nat Gentet 2004; 36:979-983). The cells were treated with emetine or with emetine followed by incubation with actinomycin D during a time course. Mock treated cells were used as reference.
