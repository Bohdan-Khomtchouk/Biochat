TITLE
Expression of human C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion reproduces RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins but not neurodegeneration in BAC transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nuclear RNA foci are often associated with mis-regulation of RNA processing in repeat expansion diseases. Here we report transcriptomic analysis of mice expressing expanded G4C2 repeats, the most common genetic cause of FTD/ALS.  We show that the presence of numerous nuclear G4C2 repeat RNA foci does not cause extensive changes in RNA processing in this model organism.

DESIGN
Comparison of the transcriptomic profile of wild-type mice and mice expressing a human C9ORF72 BAC including 500 G4C2 repeats
