TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of human tonsillar TFH subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an IL4-capture assay followed by FACS sorting, to isolate IL4-secreting TFH cells from a human tonsil and compared their transcriptomic profiles with CXCR5hi PD1hi IL4-negative tonsillar TFH cells and IL4-producing CXCR5neg non-TFH cells (TH2 cells). Our studies validate the notion of functionally distinct TFH subsets and identify genes that are specifically expressed in and define the human IL-4 secreting TFH cell  subset.

DESIGN
T follicular helper cell subset mRNA profiles from human tonsils were generated by deep sequencing. Naive CD4 T cells, IL4-producing nonTFH CD4 T cells (i.e. TH2), and IL4-producing TFH cells and PD1hi TFH cells were analyzed.
