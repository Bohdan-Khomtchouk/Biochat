TITLE
Down-regulation of ECRG4, a candidate tumor suppressor gene  in human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ECRG4 is a promising tumor suppressor gene (TSG) recently identified in esophageal carcinoma. Its expression and prognostic value have never been explored in breast cancer. Using DNA microarray,  we examined ECRG4 mRNA expression in 353 invasive breast cancer samples. A meta-analysis was performed on a large public retrospective gene expression dataset (n=1,387) to analyze correlation between ECRG4 expression and histo-clinical features including survival.
