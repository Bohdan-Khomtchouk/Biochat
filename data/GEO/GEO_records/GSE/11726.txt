TITLE
Activity Deprivation-Induced Transcriptional Changes in the P21 Cochlear Nucleus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed whether cochlear removal-induced transcriptional changes in the cochlear nucleus (CN) were due to loss of electrical activity in the 8th nerve.  Pharmacological activity blockade of the auditory nerve for 24 h resulted in similar expression changes for only a subset of genes.  Thus, an additional factor not dependent on action potential-mediated signaling must also regulate transcriptional responses to deafferentation in the CN.
