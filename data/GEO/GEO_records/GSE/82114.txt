TITLE
The human blood transcriptome following sleep extension and sleep restriction: Heterozygote samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a cross balanced design human subjects were given one week of sufficient sleep and insufficient sleep (6 h per day). Following each of these conditions they were then kept awake for a day, a night and the subsequent day. During each of these periods of extended wakefulness 10 blood samples were taken, RNA was extracted from leukocytes, labelled and hybridised to human whole-genome microarrays

DESIGN
A total of 49 samples comprising 10 human subjects, for which three samples across multiple time-points/sleep conditions were collected.
