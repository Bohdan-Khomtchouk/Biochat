TITLE
Identification of p53-regulated microRNAs in Hapatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 suppresses tumor progression and metastasis by regulating a large set of genes and microRNAs. By profiling 92 primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 9 HCC cell lines, we found that p53 upregulates microRNAs including miR-200 and miR-192 family members.

DESIGN
By sequencing TP53 in 92 HCC samples, we classified the 92 samples into two groups (wt and mut). We also classified 9 HCC cell lines by testing p21 expression after DNA-damage mediated p53 activation. We then profiled microRNA expression in 92 HCC tissue samples and 9 HCC celll lines to identify p53-regulated microRNAs.
