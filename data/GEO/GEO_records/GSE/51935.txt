TITLE
Identification of renal distal convoluted tubules enriched genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The renal distal convoluted tubule DCT is a short part of the distal nephron with specific functions transporting ions and thereby modifying Na, Ca, Mg, K balance A transcriptomic analysis of the DCT was performed to identify specific gene expression which would implicate those genes in specific DCT function

DESIGN
Fluorescent DCT (EGFP+) were sorted out from a renal tubule suspension by a COPAS (Complex Object Parametric analyser and sorter). EGFP- and the total (ALL) fractions were also sorted by COPAS. Gene expression for each fractions (EGFP+, EGFP-, ALL) was performed in 4 mice

PLATFORM
