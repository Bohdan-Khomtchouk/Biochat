TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in SATB1-depleted breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation-coupled to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to profile genome-wide locations of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) epigenetic marks in SATB1-depleted MDA-MB-231 aggressive breast cells.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in a breast cancer cell line

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
