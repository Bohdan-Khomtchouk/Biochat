TITLE
Expression data from E12.5 NSP cells, CTL v REST shRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
REST is a master regulator of genes that are involved in the acqusition of neuronal fate. The role of REST is not well understood so we attempted to investigate the role of REST in the development of neural cells by analysing the genes that are upregulated when REST is knocked down via shRNA We used microarrays to assess the genes which were up and down regulated after REST is knocked down

DESIGN
E12.5 NSP cells were infected with either control or REST shRNA expressing lentiviruses and collected after 6 days for RNA extraction
