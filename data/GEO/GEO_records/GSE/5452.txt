TITLE
Tissue-specific signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiments described here aim to generate a set of gene expression profiles from prostate, liver and kidney tissues using a custom-designed oligo-array platform enriched in messages that map to intronic regions of known human genes. Expression profiles of these tissues were combined in order to find a tissue-specific signature of intronic transcripts. Keywords: Tissue-specific, Intronic transcripts

DESIGN
Equal amounts of 300ng of DNase-treated total RNA of each tissue sample (detailed below in section 2.3) were used to create amplified cyanine 3- and cyanine 5-labeled cRNA. Next, cRNA solutions were mixed and hybridized to oligo-array slide for 17 hours. Using this approach, we labeled 2 liver pool samples and 2 prostate samples, obtaining a total of 4 sets of microarray intensities from each tissue. Four sets of microarray intensities were also obtained by labeling 2 kidney pool samples with cy3 and 2 kidney pool samples with cy5.
