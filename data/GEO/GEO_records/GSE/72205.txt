TITLE
mRNA profiles in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we describe a mRNA profiling analysis of matched ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive duct carcinoma components of FFPE breast carcinomas with the purpose to identify potential prognostic markers

DESIGN
mRNA extracted from 15 matched DCIS/IDC and 14 pure DCIS preparations was profiled using Illumina DASL platform
