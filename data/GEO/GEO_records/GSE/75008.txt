TITLE
Down-regulation of the TGF-b pseudoreceptor BAMBI enhances TGF-b signaling and promotes invasion of Non-Small Lung Cancer: DNA methylation analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of lung cancer tissue samples and corresponding normal lung tissue samples of 40 patients. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Samples included 40 normal lung tissue samples and 40 lung cancer samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 80 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
