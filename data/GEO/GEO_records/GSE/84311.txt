TITLE
ChIP-Seq data of the Streptomyces venezualae protein Sven2756 (MtrA) over a time course of 10h, 12h, 14h, 16h, 18h and 20h.

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712

SUMMARY
We report the results of ChIP-Seq experiment investigating the MtrA TCS response regulator.  The experiment utilised an in trans copy of mtrA with an N-terminal 3xFlag tag encoded on the plasmid pMS82 (containing a phiBT1 integration site).  The experiment utilised beads associated with anti-flag antibodies, specific for the Flag tagged protein.  We report important targets involved in cell division and salt stress with key findings supporting the hypothesis that MtrA is essential. Samples were taken over a time course of 10h, 12h, 14h, 16h, 18h and 20h.

DESIGN
An mtrA::apr mutant with an in trans 3xFlag tagged copy of mtrA.  Due to the use of strain independent antibodies there is no clean negative control (as would be found with WT using mono/polyclonal antibodies specific to the WT protein.
