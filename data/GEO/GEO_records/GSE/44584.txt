TITLE
The Translation Initiation Factor eIF3h Targets Specific Transcripts to Polysomes during Embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We have sequenced the polysome-associated translating mRNAs from stage-matched wild-type and eif3ha morphant embryos at ~24 hpf stage to identify transcripts translationally regulated by eIF3ha. As a control, we have also sequenced total mRNAs from the stage-matched wild-type and eif3ha morphants as well at ~ 24 hpf.

DESIGN
Polysome-associated mRNAs were isolated from 300 zebrafish embryos. Total RNA was isolated from 50 zebrafish embryos. Single 36-base pair reads were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer Iix.

PLATFORM
GPL15583 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Danio rerio)
