TITLE
Full-length mRNA-Seq from single-cell levels of RNA and individual circulating tumor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed Smart-Seq, a new single-cell RNA-Seq library preparation method, on a variety of mouse and human RNA samples or cells.

DESIGN
We generated RNA-Seq libraries for dilution series of MAQC reference RNA and mouse brain RNA to assess technical reproducibility, and for a variety of individual cells including putative circulating tumour cells.
