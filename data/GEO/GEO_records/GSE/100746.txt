TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (lung squamous cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines ( EBC-1, SAS, A498 and PC3) were treated with miRNAs (miR-149-5p, miR-149-3p, miR-455-5p, miR-455-3p), siRNAs (si-MMP14, si-MYO1B).
