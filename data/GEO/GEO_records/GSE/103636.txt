TITLE
Human embryonic stem cells in AKIT, E8 and KSR/bFGF culture medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of KhES-1 and H9 human ES cells in growth factors-dependent (E8) and -independent (AKIT) medium in feeder-free culture condition and KSR/bFGF medium on a feeder-layer. Results provide insight into genetic stability in different culture media/conditions.

DESIGN
CNV and LOH analysis of KhES-1 and H9 human ES cells maintained in AKIT and E8 feeder-free culture, and KSR/bFGF on feeder culture.
