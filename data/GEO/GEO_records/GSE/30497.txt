TITLE
mRNA and miRNA expression analysis of developmental ethanol exposure in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
During early neurogenesis, multiple whole animal gene expression profiling studies revealed widespread changes in developmental mRNA and miRNA abundance in ethanol-exposed embryos. Consistent with a role for miRNAs in neurobehavioral development, miRNA target prediction analyses identified multiple miRNAs misexpressed in the ethanol exposed cohorts that were also predicted to target inversely expressed transcripts known to influence brain morphogenesis.

DESIGN
[mRNA] A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from pools of 75 tropical 5D zebrafish embryos at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). Embryos were exposed to control embryo medium, 100 mM ethanol, or 300 mM ethanol from 4-24 hpf, with four-fold biological redundancy per condition.  A single 12x135K Nimblegen array was used to measure the expression level of 38,489 genes from Danio rerio using 60-mer probes, with three-fold technical redundancy. [miRNA] A twelve chip study using miRNA recovered from pools of 75 tropical 5D zebrafish embryos at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post fertilization (hpf). Embryos were exposed to control embryo medium or 300 mM ethanol from 4-24 hpf, with two-fold biological redundancy per condition.  Control samples were pooled and hybridized to a single array. 12 miRZebrafish arrays (based on MirBase release 12.0) were used to measure the expression level of 218 mature miRNA from Danio rerio, with 12-fold technical redundancy.
