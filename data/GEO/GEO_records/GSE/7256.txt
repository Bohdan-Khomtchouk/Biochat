TITLE
Identification of rice genes differentially expressed upon virulent infection by Magnaporthe grisea

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Two-week old rice plants (cultivar Nipponbare) were treated with either Magnaporthe grisea (virulent isolate FR13) spore suspension in gelatine or gelatine alone. Two time points were taken (3 and 4 days post inoculation- dpi). Disease symptoms were not visible at 3 dpi whereas they were at 4 dpi. Two biological repeats were done.
