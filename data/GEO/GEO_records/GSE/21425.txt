TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ABCB1 positive and ABCB1 negative OCM1A cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of ABCB1 positive and ABCB1 negative OCM1A cells.  ABCB1 is an ATP-dependent transporter efflux pump.  OCM1A cell line is derived from uveal melanomas.

DESIGN
6 samples (3 ABCB1 positive and 3 ABCB1 negative) from 3 independent ABCB1 shift assays were analysed
