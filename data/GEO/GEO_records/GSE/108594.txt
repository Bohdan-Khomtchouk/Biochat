TITLE
Lung cell transcriptome response to a wild type Mers-CoV

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in mouse lung cells infected with wild type Mers-CoV.

DESIGN
Mouse lung cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 3 PFU per cell.  Infected samples were collected in triplet time-matched mocks were collected in triplicate in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 2, 4, and 7 day post-infection. MERSCOV004.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
