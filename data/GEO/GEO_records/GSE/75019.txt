TITLE
Crosstalk between Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in dual-species biofilms.

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ; Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
We performed comparative analysis of transcriptomes of S. mutans in single biofilms and in mixed-biofilms with A. actinomycetemcomitans. We also compared the transcriptomic profiles of A. actinomycetemcomitans in single biofilms and A. actinomycetemcomitans in mixed biofilms with S. mutans. Finally we looked at the changes in gene expression in both organisms in time.

DESIGN
RNAseq of single species biofilms (S. mutans, A.act.) - 8 and 24 h, dual-species biofilms (S.mutans with A.act.) - 4, 6, 8,10, 12, and 24 h. All in duplicate. Using Illumina HiSeq.
