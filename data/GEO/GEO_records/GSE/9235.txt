TITLE
A binary redox control mode in gene expression and metabolism of plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To analyze the impact of photosynthetic redox signals, light sources with spectral qualities that preferentially excite either Photosystem I (PSI light) or Photosystem II (PSII light) were used. The light sources have been described in (Fey et al., 2005). Strong reduction and oxidation signals were induced by light shifts from PSI to PSII light (PSI-II) and the reverse light shift (PSII-I), respectivly. The acclimation responses were monitored at 0.5, 2, 8, and 48h after a light shift. Samples taken prior to changing the light quality (0h) served as control. Keywords: photosynthesis, redox regulation, light acclimation, retrograde signalling, long term response

DESIGN
Experiments were performed with plant material corresponding to pools of at least 250-500 individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0). To abtain healthy and unstressed plants, seedlings were initially grown for 21 days under white light (short day periods, 8-h light/16-h dark) on soil. Plants were then pre-acclimated to PSI-light for 3 days and reference samples were taken. Plants were then shifted to PSII light and tissue was harvested at the described time points. Similarly, samples were harvested before and after the reverse light shift. As additional control, plants acclimated to white light were also analyzed. RNA isolation: Leaf material was harvested and frozen in liquid N2 under the respective light source. Isolation of total RNA was performed as adapted from (Westhoff et al., 1991). Array analyses using the 3292-GST nylon array were performed as described earlier (Richly et al., 2003; Fey et al., 2005). Three independent experiments with different filters and independent cDNA probes were performed (for each timepoint).
