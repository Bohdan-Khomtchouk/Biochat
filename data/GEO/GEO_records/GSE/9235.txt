TITLE
A binary redox control mode in gene expression and metabolism of plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To analyze the impact of photosynthetic redox signals, light sources with spectral qualities that preferentially excite either Photosystem I (PSI light) or Photosystem II (PSII light) were used. The light sources have been described in (Fey et al., 2005). Strong reduction and oxidation signals were induced by light shifts from PSI to PSII light (PSI-II) and the reverse light shift (PSII-I), respectivly. The acclimation responses were monitored at 0.5, 2, 8, and 48h after a light shift. Samples taken prior to changing the light quality (0h) served as control. Keywords: photosynthesis, redox regulation, light acclimation, retrograde signalling, long term response
