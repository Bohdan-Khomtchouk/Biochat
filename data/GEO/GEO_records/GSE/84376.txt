TITLE
Identification miRNA expression profiles of human granulosa cells obtained from PCOS patients and control individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNA expression profiles of mural granulosa cells (MGCs) which were obtained from PCOS patients and control individuals were identified and compared.

DESIGN
MGCs in follicular fluid were obtained from PCOS patients and control individuals during oocyte pick up for in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. Total RNA of MGCs was isolated with QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). 500 ng of total RNA was labelled with FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labelling Kits (Affymetrix) and hybridised to Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 array which were were washed, stained and scanned according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
