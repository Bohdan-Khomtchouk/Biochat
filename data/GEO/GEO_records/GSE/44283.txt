TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by early embryo in bovine oviduct epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, we focused on the changes of mRNA expression in bovine oviduct epithelial cells in vitro co-cultured with embryos during preimplantation development in order to identify genes, which might be involved in embryo-maternal communication. For this purpose, we used large-scale cDNA microarray hybridizations to identify the genes differentially regulated in bovine oviduct epithelial cells (Boec) during in vitro culture. The main objective was to identify genes which are differentially expressed due to the presence or absence of bovine embryos on cell monolayers.

DESIGN
Global transcriptional profiling was performed using 13 days Bovine oviduct epithelial cells (Boec) cultured in vitro with SOF media RNA as control samples (BOEC_SOF_CTL, n=3) for comparison to the experimental samples taken at the same culture time (day 13) and stimulated by the presence of bovine embryos during the last 8 days of culture (BOEC_SOF+EMB, n=3).Gene expression analysis was carried out between Boec with or without stimulation of embryos representing a total of 6 slides (dye swap protocol).
