TITLE
Tet1 and Tet2 mediate epigenetic regulation of developmental genes by protecting DNA methylation canyons against hypermethylation [Bisulfite-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses whole methylome sequencing to characterize the methylomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF's). Two conditions were analyzed, MEF cells with intact TET1/TET2 enzymes (WT) and MEF cells with TET1/TET2 knocked out (DKO). Our results identify sets of differentially methylated genes which are correlated with TET1/TET2 induced expression changes of the corresponding genes.

DESIGN
Whole methylome analysis of M. musculus MEF cells. Two conditions were sequenced and analyzed, the first is wild type (WT), the second (DKO) corresponds to knock-out of TET1 and TET2 enzymes.

PLATFORM
