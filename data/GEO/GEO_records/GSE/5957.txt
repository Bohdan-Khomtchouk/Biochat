TITLE
gene profiles in prostate cancer and normal prostate tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among men in the world and the pathogenesis of prostate cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, we intended to disclose genes that might be involved in tumorigenesis using cDNA microarray technology. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
A total of 28 experiments were performed without replicates, using a pool of unrelated fetal tissues as common references. 25 experiments were done for prostate cancer versus common reference and 3 for normal prostate versus common reference. Prostate cancer and normal prostate samples were labeled with Cy5-dUTP. Common references were labeled with Cy3-dUTP.
