TITLE
Mechanism of Kindlin-2 regulating invasion and metastasis of human Hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the mechanism of Kindlin-2 regulating invasion and metastasis of human Hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed gene expression microarray analysis on Kindlin-2 knockdown LM3 cells and the control cells to compare the gene expression levels between the two groups.

DESIGN
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting Kindlin-2 and negative control (NC) were synthesized and cloned into the lentiviral vector. Lentivirus expressing shRNA was generated and used to infect LM3 cells. After 72h of infection, the infected cell lines were cultured in the medium containing 2ug/ml puromycin to select Kindlin-2 stable knockdown cell line.
