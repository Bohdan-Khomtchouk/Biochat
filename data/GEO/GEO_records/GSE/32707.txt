SUMMARY
A microarray analysis involving whole blood samples isolated from critically ill patients in the medical intensive care unit at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  Four groups of intubated subjects undergoing mechanical ventilation were recruited for the study: those with sepsis alone (Sepsis), those with sepsis + ARDS (se/ARDS), those with SIRS (SIRS), and those whithout sepsis, SIRS, or ARDS (untreated).  Blood was obtained from patients on the day of admission (day 0) and 7 days later.  RNA was isolated from the whole blood samples and microarrays were prepared to determine differential gene expression between the four groups.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from whole blood samples of critically ill patients
