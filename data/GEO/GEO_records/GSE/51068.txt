TITLE
High-throughput  expression profiling of OCI-Ly3 cell line upon treatment with a panel of 14 known drugs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) OCI-LY3 cell line treated with 14 different known drugs at 2 different concentrations and profiled at 6, 12 and 24 hrs after treatment. We used this gene expression data to design a challenge where participants were required to develop methods to predict activity of compound pairs using gene expression profile following single compound treatment, drug response curve of each compound and baseline genetic profile of OCI-LY3 cell line.

DESIGN
GeneChip HT HG-U219 array plates were used to analyze gene expression changes induced by treatment with 14 drug compounds in OCI-Ly3 cells at 6, 12 and 24h. 3 replicates were analyxed for each drug/time combination. Vehicle (DMSO)-treated control samples were used for comparison with each replicate. Altogether 282 samples were analyzed in this study.
