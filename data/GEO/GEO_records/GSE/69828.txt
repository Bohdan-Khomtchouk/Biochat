TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis seedlings in response to ARR1 or cytokinins, in the presence and absence of DELLA proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DELLA proteins interact with ARR1 and modulate its activity. We have investigated the effect of DELLA proteins on transcriptional regulation by ARR1

DESIGN
A dominant hyperactive allele of ARR1 was induced with dexamethasone in seedlings preincubated with paclobutrazol (allowing DELLA acummulation) or paclobutrazol+GA3 (promoting DELLA degradation)
