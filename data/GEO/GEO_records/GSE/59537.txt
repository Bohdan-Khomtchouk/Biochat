TITLE
Bone marrows from neuroblastoma patients: an excellent source for tumor genome analyses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in childhood. Presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis and at relapse is a common event in stage M neuroblastomas. Although the clinical heterogeneity of disseminated neuroblastomas is frequently associated with genomic diversity, so far, only little information exists about the genomic status of DTCs. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the varying amount of BM infiltrating tumor cells, which is usually below 30% even at diagnosis thereby hampering systematic analyses. Thus, a valuable chance to analyze metastatic and relapse clones is, so far, completely unexploited.  In this study, we show that the enrichment of tumor cells in fresh or DMSO frozen BM samples with a minimum of 0.05% or 0.1% infiltration rate, respectively, by applying magnetic beads technique increased the DTC content to a sufficient level to allow SNP array analyses in 49 out of 69 samples. In addition, we successfully used non-enriched BM samples with â‰¥30% DTCs including non-stained and immunostained cytospin and BM smear slides for SNP array analyses in 44 cases.  We analyzed the genomic profile of DTCs by an ultra-high density SNP array technique with highest performance detecting all segmental chromosomal aberrations, amplified regions, acquired loss of heterozygosity events and minor aberrations affecting single genes or parts thereof.

DESIGN
Affymetrix CytoScan HD arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow or tumor samples.
