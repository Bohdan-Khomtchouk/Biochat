TITLE
Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals distinct populations of glucagon-like peptide-1 producing cells in the mouse upper small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enteroendocrine L-cells release hormones that control metabolism and appetite and are targets under investigation for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Understanding L-cell diversity and expression profiles is critical for identifying target receptors that will translate into altered hormone secretion. We performed single cell RNA sequencing of mouse L-cells from the upper small intestine to distinguish cellular populations, revealing that L-cells form 3 major clusters: a group with typical characteristics of classical L-cells, including high expression of Gcg and Pyy; a cell type overlapping with Gip-expressing K-cells; and a unique cluster expressing Tph1 and Pzp that was predominantly located in duodenal villi and co-produced 5HT. Expression of G-protein coupled receptors differed between clusters, suggesting the cell types are differentially regulated, and would be differentially targetable. Our findings support the emerging concept that many enteroendocrine cell populations are highly overlapping, with individual cells producing a range of peptides previously assigned to distinct cell types.
