TITLE
Effects of blackcurrant extract on gene expression on TIG113.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate new health functions by blackcurrant extract (BCE), we compare altered of the genes expression before and after BCE (1.0μg/ml) treatment in TIG113.

DESIGN
TIG113 cells were seeded in culture dish and maintain to confluent. Then medium replace with phenol-red-serum-free DMEM medium with or without BCE (1.0μg/ml). After the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C 5% CO2.
