TITLE
DNA methylation profiling in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray targeting promoters of cancer-related genes was used to evaluate DNA methylation at 935 CpG sites in 517 invasive breast tumors from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), a population-based study of invasive breast cancer.  Concensus clustering using methylation (Î²) values for the 167 most variant CpG loci defined 4 clusters differing most distinctly in hormone receptor (HR) status, intrinsic subtype (luminal versus basal-like) and p53 mutation status. Supervised analyses for HR status, subtype, and p53 status identified differentially methylated CpG loci with considerable overlap (n=266).  Concensus clustering also defined a hypermethylated luminal-enriched tumor cluster 3; gene ontology analysis of cluster 3 hypermethylated loci revealed enrichment for developmental genes, including homeobox domain genes (HOXB13, PAX6, IPF1, EYA4, DLK1, IHH, ISL1, TBX1, SOX1, SOX17). The hypermethylated luminal-enriched cluster 3 independently predicted poorer survival in multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, and this finding was confirmed in analysis of luminal A tumors.  This study demonstrates epigenetic heterogeneity among breast tumors of a single intrinsic subtype, and shows that epigenetic patterns are strongly associated with HR status, subtype, and p53 mutation status. Among HR+ tumors, a gene signature characterized by hypermethylation of developmental genes may have prognostic value. Genes differentially methylated between clinically-important tumor subsets have roles in differentiation, development, and tumor growth and may be critical to inducing and maintaining tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes.
