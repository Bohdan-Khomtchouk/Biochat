TITLE
Host transcriptional reprogramming across diverse strains of the rice bacterial leaf streak pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzicola

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq of leaves of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare 48 hours after inoculation with 10 geographically diverse strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of bacterial leaf streak, particularly the role of transcription activator-like effectors in the disease.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare leaves at 48 hours after inoculation with 10 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzicola with three biological replicates for each compared to three replicates of mock inoculated O sativa as the control
