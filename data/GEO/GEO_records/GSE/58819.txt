TITLE
Trichloroethylene-induced mRNA expression changes in B6C3F1 mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine changes, if any, in the expression of mRNAs in the liver tissue of mice, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes responsive to Trichloroethylene (TCE) treatment.  In our results, the expression levels of 431 mRNAs were changed after TCE exposure, of which 291 were up-regulated and 140 were down-regulated. Using qPCR, we validated six of the mRNA expression changed genes, viz., Jun, Cdkn1a, Rad51b, Uhrf1, Svil and Ihh.

DESIGN
Six B6C3F1 male mice were oral administrated with either corn oil or TCE (dissolved in corn oil, 1000mg/kg b.w per day) for 5 days.  The expression changes of mRNAs in TCE exposured mouse liver were screened by whole genome microarray expression profiling and were validated by qPCR.
