TITLE
Identification of miRNA, lncRNA and mRNA-associated ceRNA networks and potential biomarker for MELAS with mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation [sequencing]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the regulating networks of dysregulated ncRNAs in Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with m.A3243G mutation.

DESIGN
The MELAS sample consisted of a muscle pool from 20 MELAS patients with m.A3243G mutation, and the Control sample consisted of a muscle pool from 20 healthy controls. LncRNA sequencing and miRNA array of muscle pools were performed by the service provider (LC Sciences). The secondary qRT-PCR validation of the most promising miRNAs and lncRNAs using individual samples were from the same group. The findings were all consistent with results from our high-throughput data.
