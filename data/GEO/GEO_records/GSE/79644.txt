TITLE
Changes in Bacillus anthracis CodY regulation under host-specific environmental factor deprived conditions

ORGANISM
Bacillus anthracis str. Sterne

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report here that CodY regulation is hierarchically regulated in response to environmental starvation.

DESIGN
Examination of codY null Bacillus anthracis Sterne in three environmentally deprived conditions, generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (101 cycles PE lane).

PLATFORM
