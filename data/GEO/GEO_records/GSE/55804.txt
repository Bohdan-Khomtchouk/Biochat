TITLE
Expression data from 26972c yeast Â± bHLHm1 (SAT1)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
26972c yeast cells were transformed with either empty vector (pYES3) or pYES3:Gm:bHLHm1. Cells were grown on low ammonium concentrations to observe transcriptional changes in the yeast genome in response to the soybean bHLHm1 transcription factor.

DESIGN
The ammonium transport mutant (26972c) was transformed with either a empty vector control (pYES3) or pYES3 containing GmbHLHm1.Independent replicates (3) for each treatment were grown for 12 hours in the presence of 1 mM ammonium and 2 % w/vol galactose to activate the Gal promoter located on pYES3.  Cells were harvested and total RNA extracted. Quantified RNA was analaysed using microarray analysis using the [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array.
