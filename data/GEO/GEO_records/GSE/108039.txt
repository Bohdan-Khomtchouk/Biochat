TITLE
The genome-scale DNA-binding of FadR transcription factor in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639

SUMMARY
This is ChIPseq result of FadR (Saci_1107), which is the only TetR family regulator presented in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The aim of the study is to gain insights into the function of TetR regulator by analyzing its whole genome binding sites.

DESIGN
genome-scale binding site identification with output and mock samples as control

PLATFORM
GPL24388 Illumina MiSeq (Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639)
