TITLE
RNA polymerase in pre-B-ALL cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[Gro-seq] Precursor B acute leukemia cells measured using global nuclear run-on sequencing [ChIP-Seq] The genome-wide occupancy of ser2 and ser5 phosphorylated RNA pol2 and H3K4me3 was measured in precursor B acute leukemia cells measured using chip-seq.

DESIGN
[Gro-seq] Nascent RNA expression profiles were generated at cells in various basal culture conditions. [ChIP-Seq] Performed from REH and Nalm6 cells cultured under basal culture conditions. Mnase digestion was used for DNA fragmentation. Antibodies against Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylated RNA polymerase and H3K4me3 compared to input. ****************************** This study includes reanalysis of Samples in Series GSE39878 (GSM980645, GSM980644), GSE60454 (GSM1480326), and GSE41009 (GSM1006728, GSM100672). The processed data files for the reanalyses are linked to GSE67540 as supplementary files (see the GSE67540_README.txt file for additional information).
