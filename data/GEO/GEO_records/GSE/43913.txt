TITLE
Expression analysis of colorectal carcinoma cells (D53wt) stably transfected with tetracycline responsive wild type P53

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of colorectal carcinoma cells stably transfected with tetracycline responsive wild type P53 on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Transcriptome-wide expression data was assessed by using TileShuffle (Otto C, Reiche K, Hackerm√ºller J. " Detection of differentially expressed segments in tiling array data " . Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1471-9. Epub 2012 Apr 6.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
