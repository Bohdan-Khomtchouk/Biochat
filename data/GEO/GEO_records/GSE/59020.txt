TITLE
ETS1 is a genome-wide effector of RAS/ERK signaling in epithelial cells (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ETS1 and RAS/ERK regulate a common gene expression program in establishing enviroment suitable for prostate cancer cell migration.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of luciferase knockdown (WT), ETS1 knockdown, and U0126 treated DU145 cells were generated using deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq. Knockdowns were stable shRNA expression from a lentiviral construct selected with puromycin.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
