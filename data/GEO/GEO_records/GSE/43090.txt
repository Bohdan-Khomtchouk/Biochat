TITLE
Exression profiling of 9-cisRA in adrenocortical carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumour with a poor prognosis. The currently available medical treatment options of adrenocortical cancer are limited. In the present study we examine the potential antitumoral effects of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cisRA) on the adrenocortical cancer cell line NCI-H295R.

DESIGN
For the gene expression profiling, H295R cells were treated for 24h with 9cisRA at a final concentration of 2.5*10-5, 5*10-5 and 7.5*10-5 M and for the contol with the same amount of ethanol.
