TITLE
Emodin inhibits macrophage alernative activation [Control-IL4-Emodin]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to fully characterize emodin's effects on macrophage alternative activation, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with IL4 with or without emodin and gene expression was analyzed using a whole genome microarray. Emodin significantly attenuated the IL4 induced changes in a large percentage of genes (60%) through inhibiting multiple signaling pathways. RT-qPCR was used to confirm the results in several genes associated with M2 macrophage activation including: Arg1, Chi3l3, and CD206.

DESIGN
Three-condition, one-color experiment: Vehicle control, IL4 or IL4-Emodin treated periferal WBC PMN samples: 4 biological replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
