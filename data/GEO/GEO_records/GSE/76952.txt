TITLE
Gene expression analysis of MCF12A human breast cultures exposed to ethanol or acetaldehyde [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF12A monolayer cultures were exposed to ethanol or acetaldehyde for eiher 1 week or 4 weeks Total RNA samples were assayed for gene expression and for microRNA expression. MicroRNA expression was accomplished using 2 experiments. The first experiment included untreated control, ethanol treated (4 weeks at 2.5 mM) and acetaldehyde treated (4 weeks at 1 mM). The data are presented in order of control1 for the ethanol and acetaldehyde treated samples followed by the ethanol and acetaldehyde treated samples, and then the control2 for the soft agar selected sample followed by the soft agar selected sample. The microRNA names are included in separate columns.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 in the presence of serum and growth factors. RNA was extracted using the miRVana kit and subjected to analysis of microRNAs.
