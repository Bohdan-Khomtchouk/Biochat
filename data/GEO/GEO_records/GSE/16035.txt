TITLE
Global gene profiling comparison between hydrogen sulfide- and N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neuronal deaths

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), present in abundance in the mammalian brain, has recently been demonstrated to induce a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic-necrotic continuum in murine primary cortical neurons, which was successfully attenuated upon application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. The current study focused on gaining an insight into the molecular mechanisms of H2Sâ€“mediated neuronal death pertaining to NMDA receptors activation through global gene expression  comparisons.

DESIGN
A total of 24 RNA samples were analyzed. There are 2 treatment conditions, namely 200uM sodium hydrosulfide and 200uM N-methyl-D-asparate. 3 replicates were collected for each of the selected time-points (5h, 15h and 24h), in addition to 6 replicates of shared vehicle control. The supplementary file 'GSE16035_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM401312-GSM401335.
