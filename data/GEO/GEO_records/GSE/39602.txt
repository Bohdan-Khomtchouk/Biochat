TITLE
Comparative analysis of Gallus gallus cecal epithelia following Eimeria tenella infection

ORGANISM
Eimeria tenella ; Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Relative expression levels of mRNAs in chicken cecal epithelia experimentally infected with Eimeria tenella were measured at 4.5 days post-infection. Two weeks old chickens were uninfected (negative control) or were orally inoculated with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella. Cecal epithelia samples were collected from > 12 birds in infected or uninfected group at 4.5 d following infections, in which samples from 4 birds were pooled together to form a total 3 biological replicates in each group. Parasite merozoites were also collected from four infected chickens at 5 d after infections. Uninfected control samples, merozoites and infection group samples were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used Affymetrix GeneChip chicken genome arrays to detail the chicken cecal epithelia gene expression in the control and E. tenella-infected birds.

DESIGN
Infected, uninfected chicken cecal epithelia and merozoites were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization with Affymetrix microarrays. Our goal was to analyze global transcriptome changes in chicken cecal mucous membranes in response to E. tenella infection in vivo. We used infected (T1,T2,T3; three biological replicates) and uninfected (Neg1, Neg2, Neg3; three biological replicates) samples to identify genes that were differentially expressed. Meanwhile, RNA and probes were also prepared from parasite merozoites (Mzt) from infected samples (Mzt) and used as an additional control in microarray hybridization.
