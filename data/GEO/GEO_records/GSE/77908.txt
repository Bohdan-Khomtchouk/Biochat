TITLE
Expression data from U-937 cells exposed to nanosecond duration electrical pulses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is unclear how nanosecond electrical pulses affect gene expression. We used microarrays to identify how cells respond to this specific type of stress

DESIGN
U-937 cells were exposed to 100, 10 nanosecond duration pulses at 150 kV/cm.  Gene expression was analyzed 4 hrs post exposure
