TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization of human embryonic stem cell lines deposited in the National Stem Cell Bank

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Purpose of this series of experiments is to identify copy number variations, duplications, and deletions in human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines deposited to the National Stem Cell bank and reveal the difference between different hES cell lines. CGH can achieve these aims at higher resolution. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
