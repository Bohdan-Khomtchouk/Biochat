TITLE
Array CGH comparison of genomic sequence content between tissues from the same animal

ORGANISM
Petromyzon marinus

SUMMARY
DNA was isolated from tissues (blood, sperm, or liver). DNA from different tissues from the same organism were labeled with alternate fluorophores (Cy3 or Cy5) and hybridized to a custom array that was designed from lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) genomic sequence.

DESIGN
1 animal - sperm vs. blood, 2 animals - blood vs. liver
