TITLE
Expression data from human ESCs-derived neural precursors (NPs) and neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analyses on human ESCs-derived NPs and neurons carrying loss-of-function mutation in the MeCP2 gene.

DESIGN
Neural precursors and differentiating neurons at 2 and 4-week were used for RNA extraction and affymetrix microarrays. We added ERCC RNA spike-in controls to normalize to cell number input.
