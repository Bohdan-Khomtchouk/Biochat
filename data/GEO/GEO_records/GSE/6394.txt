TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for RNA Polymerase II using monoclonal antibody (8WG16) on GM06990 Cells [unpublished]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase II ChIP-chip using monoclonal antibody (8WG16) performed on GM06990 cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaces every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts). Goal was to identify Pol II-binding regions. Use of this data requires permission from its producers. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin using Pol II antibody (8WG16) or normal rabbit IgG was hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array containing overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. Samples are three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL2533 Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array (HG17) with 50mer probe at 38bp interval for RenLab
