TITLE
Pervasive transcription-dependent chromatin remodeling influences the replication initiation program

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report here the importance of pervasive transcription in the regulation of replication origins activity in S. cerevisiae. Replication profiles and chromatin profiles were obtained by BrdU-seq and MNase-seq respectively.

DESIGN
BrdU-seq was performed 70min after release from G1-phase at 18Â°C in Nrd1-AA, Nrd1-AA dSet2 and Ysh1-AA strains. MNase-seq was performed after 1h of Rapamycin treatment in Nrd1-AA cells.

PLATFORM
GPL21656 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
