TITLE
microRNA expression in human brain development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profile the expression of micoRNAs in the human brain at prenatal, early childhood, and adult timepoints

DESIGN
37 prenatal cerebral tissue samples, 11 postnatal cerebral tissue samples, 2 adult total brain samples (FirstChoice Human Brain Reference RNA cat# AM6050 and FirstChoice Human Brain Total RNA cat# AM7962*. *The current FirstChoice Human Brain Total RNA (2013), is from a 78 year old white female, while the FirstChoice Total RNA used in this deposited data set was from an 81 year old white male, which is no longer available through Ambion/Life Technologies.)

PLATFORM
GPL16783 NCode Human miRNA Microarray V3
