TITLE
mRNA expression analysis of undifferentiated Dicer -/- (27H10) embryonic stem cells after miRNA transfection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the transcript expression levels in Dicer knock-out embryonic stem (ES) cells 24 hours after transfection with either control siRNA agains Renilla luciferase or miRNA Mimics (Dharmacon) of mmu-miR-290 cluster members in order to identify primary targets of miR-290 cluster miRNAs. Keywords: Comparison of effect of two different transfections on transcriptome of Dicer-KO ES cells
