TITLE
Gene expression analysis of bone biospies from nine patients with endogenous Cushings syndrome before and after  treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus are classical parts of endogenous Cushingâ€™s syndrome (CS), and insulin resistance is a feature of cortisol excess. CS patients display characteristics including hyperglycemia, abdominal obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and elevated triglycerides, and arterial hypertension. Hypercortisolism is a well known cause of bone loss, and patients with CS frequently display low bone mass and fragility fractures. Cortisol excess inhibits bone formation, increases bone resorption, impairs calcium absorption from the gut, and affects the secretion of several hormones, cytokines, and growth factors with potential influence on bone metabolism. Bone biopsies from nine CS patients, before and mean 3 months after surgery, were screened for expressional candidate genes using Affymetrix human Gene Plus 2.0 Arrays. Analyses were performed to identify genes in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and genes in glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis.

DESIGN
Expression levels were examined in bone biopsy samples from 9 patients with endogenous cushing syndrome, before and mean three months after surgery.
