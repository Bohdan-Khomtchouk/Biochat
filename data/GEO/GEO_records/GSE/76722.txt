TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of muscle Treg cells from IL-33 treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report gene expression of Treg cells isolated from injured muscle in IL-33 vs PBS treated mice. Male Foxp3-GFP C57BL/6 reporter (2 months old) mice were injured intramuscularly with cardiotoxin/rIL-33 (0.3 ug/muscle). Tregs were sorted directly into Trizol from injured muscle 4 days post-injury.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of muscle Tregs from IL-33 vs PBS injured mice.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
