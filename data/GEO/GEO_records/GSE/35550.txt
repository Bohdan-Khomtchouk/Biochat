TITLE
Analysis of 22G siRNA triggered siRNA amplification and 3' 2'-O-methylated small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Small RNAs, including piRNAs, miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs, bind Argonaute proteins to form RNA-silencing complexes that target coding genes, transposons and aberrant RNAs. To assess the requirements for endogenous siRNA formation and activity in C. elegans, we developed a GFP-based sensor for the endogenous siRNA 22G siR-1, one of a set of abundant siRNAs processed from a precursor RNA mapping to the X chromosome, the X-cluster.  Silencing of the sensor is also dependent on the partially complementary, unlinked 26G siR-O7 siRNA. We show that 26G siR-O7 acts in trans to initiate 22G siRNA formation from the X-cluster. The presence of several mispairs between 26G siR-O7 and the X-cluster mRNA, as well as mutagenesis of the siRNA sensor, indicates that siRNA target recognition is permissive to a degree of mispairing. From a candidate reverse genetic screen, we identified several factors required for 22G siR-1 activity, including the Argonaute ergo-1 and the 3' methyltransferase henn-1. Quantitative RT-PCR of small RNAs in a henn-1 mutant and deep sequencing of methylated small RNAs indicate that siRNAs and piRNAs that associate with PIWI clade Argonautes are methylated by HENN-1, while siRNAs and miRNAs that associate with non-PIWI clade Argonautes are not. Thus, PIWI-class Argonaute proteins are specifically adapted to associate with methylated small RNAs in C. elegans. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
