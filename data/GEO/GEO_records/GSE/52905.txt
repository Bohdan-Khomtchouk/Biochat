TITLE
Extensive oscillatory gene expression during C. elegans larval development [Ribosome footprinting]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We report the presence of extensive, transcriptionally controlled oscillations in the C. elegans, developmental transcriptome. Furthermore, using ribosome profiling, we show that these oscillating transcripts are actively translated.

DESIGN
Ribosome-profiling analysis of a timecourse that was collected over C. elegans development

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
