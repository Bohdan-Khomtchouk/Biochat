TITLE
miRNA expression profile associated with response to Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from a discovery cohort The discovery cohort includes12 RA patients (6 responders and 6 non-responders) treated with TwHF was detected by Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 arrays.

DESIGN
To identify potential serum microRNA biomarkers, which are predictive of  rheumatoid arthritis patients' response to TwHF.

PLATFORM
GPL21572 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array [ProbeSet ID version]
