TITLE
Environmental factors transmitted by aryl hydrocarbon receptor influence severity of psoriatic skin inflammation [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Environmental stimuli are known to contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis and that of other autoimmune diseases, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that senses environmental stimuli, modulates pathology in psoriasis. AhR-activating ligands reduced inflammation in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients, whereas AhR antagonists upregulated inflammation. Similarly, AhR signaling via the endogenous FICZ ligand reduced the inflammatory response in the imiquimod-induced model of psoriasis and AhR deficient mice exhibited a substantial exacerbation of the disease, compared to AhR sufficient controls. Non-haematopoietic cells, in particular keratinocytes, were responsible for this hyper-inflammatory response, which involved increased reactivity to IL-1beta and upregulation of AP-1 family members of transcription factors. Thus, our data suggest a critical role for AhR in the regulation of inflammatory responses and open the possibility for novel therapeutic strategies in chronic inflammatory disorders.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from skin explants taken from AhR heterozygous or knock-out mice treated pericutaneously with imiquimod for 0 and 2d.
