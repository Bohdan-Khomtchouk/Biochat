TITLE
Investigation of gene expression changes after mindfulness awareness program or health education program

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Research shows that mindfulness practice can alter the expression of genes associated with energy metabolism, telomere maintenance, inflammatory and stress response. The aim of this study was to determine if mindfulness awareness practice (MAP) or health education program (HEP) might reverse cognitive impairment and/or prevent further cognitive decline in 60 subjects (aged 60-90). We investigated the  gene expression changes in subject with mild cognitive impairment randomized to either group after 9 months. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array to determine the differential gene expression between Pre- and Post-treatment samples from MAP and HEP group.

DESIGN
This is an intervention study with a control group of HEP participants. Sixty subjects with mild cognitive impairment were randomised to either MAP or HEP group. MAP participants were taught mindfulness awareness practice techniques. HEP participants were taught healthy living topics related to maintaining and improving cognitive function. Total of 18 sessions were conducted for 40 minutes weekly for 12 weeks and thereafter 40 minutes monthly for 6 months. Blood sample (1-3ml) was collected in Tempus Blood RNA Tube from 51 subjects before the start of intervention (Pre-treatment) and 36 subjects after nine months (Post-treatment)
