TITLE
The lncRNA HOTAIR Modulates DNA-Methylation in Mesenchymal Stem Cells via Triple Helix Formation (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non coding RNAs are implemented in epigenetic changes and regulation of gene expression. HOTAIR is a promising lncRNA concerning epigenetic regulation. We performed HOTAIR overexpression and knockdown experiments in mesenchymal stromal cells derived from bone marrow. After two weeks cells were harvested and RNA and DNA were isolated. Analysis of gene expression was performed with Human Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). Analysis of DNA methylation was performed with Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, USA)

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of BM-MSC upon HOTAIR retroviral Overexpression and siRNA mediated Knockdown.
