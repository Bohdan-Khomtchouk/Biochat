TITLE
Identification of transcription factor Pha-4 binding regions

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We identified the DNA binding sites for transcription factors Pha-4 in C. elegans. Transcription factor genes were tagged with GFP and their expression examined throughout the C. elegans life cycle. The binding sites were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
