TITLE
Identification of the regulatory circuit of PhoB in Bacteroides fragilis strain YCH46

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis ; Bacteroides fragilis YCH46

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profiles of the wild-type (WT) and the phoB-mutant strain in B. fragilis strain YCH46 during phosphate (Pi) starvation.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA isolated from the WT culture and the phoB mutant culture under Pi-excess (6.6 mM) or Pi-limiting (0.0066mM) condition. Each sample contains duplicated data.

PLATFORM
GPL13213 Bacteroides fragilis YCH46 gene expression 4x72K array [2007-08-21_GFC235_Bfla_60mer_4plex]
