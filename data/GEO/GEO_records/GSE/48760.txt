TITLE
Transcriptomes of the hybrid mouse diversity panel subjected to Isoproterenol challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes performed on left ventricular heart samples from mice of the hybrid mouse diversity panel, a set of over a hundred inbred strains of mice.  In this project, the strains were challenged with Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist to induce cardiac hypertrophy and failure.  Results are useful for the analysis of heart-related traits in mice

DESIGN
Mice were given three weeks of ISO @ 20ug/g/day for three weeks, then sacrificed.  Left ventricles from these mice and matched controls were used for transcripome analysis.
