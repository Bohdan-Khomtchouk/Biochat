TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in preimplantation kidney biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify early markers to predict post-transplantation outcomes we performed a transcriptome analysis in pre-implantation kidney biopsies from deceased donors searching for genes associated with DGF and graft function one year post-transplantation.

DESIGN
We studied 54 pre-implantation kidney biopsies from deceased donors. Twenty seven recipients with and 27 without DGF. Within DGF group 13 had prolonged DGF (pDGF, DGF lasting > 14 days). Renal function at one year post-transplantation was evaluated using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using abbreviated MDRD formula. The group with poor renal function at one year post-transplantation, low eGFR ( < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), was composed by 18 patients and the high eGFR group (â‰¥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) by 35 recipients.
