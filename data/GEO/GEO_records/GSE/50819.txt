TITLE
modENCODE_White Lab: genome-wide ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data [D. yakuba H3K27me3]

ORGANISM
Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains genome-wide binding profile of the factor H3K27me3 from D.yak_WPP generated by ChIP and analyzed on Illumina Genome Analyzer.

DESIGN
A validated dataset is comprised of three biological replicates for ChIP-chip experiments and two replicates for ChIP-seq and meet the modENCODE quality standards. The control sample is the chromatin Input used for ChIP. Factors binding profiles are generated by using specific antibodies for the protein of interest.

PLATFORM
GPL11000 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Drosophila yakuba)
