TITLE
HDAC3-dependent regulation of H3K9 acetylation in IECs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other chronic inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria.  However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from IBD patients exhibit decreased expression of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Further, genome-wide analyses of murine IECs that lack HDAC3 (HDAC3ΔIEC) revealed that HDAC3 deficiency resulted in dysregulated gene expression coupled with alterations in histone acetylation.  Critically, conventionally-housed HDAC3ΔIEC mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria.  In addition, HDAC3ΔIEC mice exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.  Strikingly, rederivation of HDAC3ΔIEC mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis, and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria.  Collectively, these data indicate that the HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis.

DESIGN
Analyses of histone acetylation in primary IECs from HDAC3FF (3 biologic replicates) and HDAC3ΔIEC (3 biologic replicates) mice were conducted utilizing ChIP-seq for H3K9Ac.
