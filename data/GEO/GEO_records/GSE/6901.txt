TITLE
Expression data for stress treatment in rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Drought, salinity and sub-optimal temperatures are stresses that cause adverse effects on the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. In this study, we have analyzed the expression profiles of rice genes under control and abiotic stress conditions using microarray technology to identify the genes differentially expressed during various abiotic stresses. Keywords: Stress treatment

DESIGN
Seven-day-old light-grown rice seedlings grown under controlled conditions and those subjected to various abiotic stress conditions were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates of each sample were used for microarray analysis. For salt treatment (SS), the rice seedlings were transferred to a beaker containing 200 mM NaCl solution for 3 h. For desiccation (DS), rice seedlings were dried for 3 h between folds of tissue paper at 28±1 degree C, in a culture room. For cold treatment (CS), the seedlings were kept at 4±1 degree C for 3 h. The seedlings kept in water for 3 h, at 28±1 degree C, served as control (Seedling).
