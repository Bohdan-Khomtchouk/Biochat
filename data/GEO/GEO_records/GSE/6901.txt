TITLE
Expression data for stress treatment in rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Drought, salinity and sub-optimal temperatures are stresses that cause adverse effects on the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. In this study, we have analyzed the expression profiles of rice genes under control and abiotic stress conditions using microarray technology to identify the genes differentially expressed during various abiotic stresses. Keywords: Stress treatment
