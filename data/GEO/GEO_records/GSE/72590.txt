TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of the impact of 2'-fucosyllactose supplementation on intestinal adaptation following ileocecal resection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify the impact of 2'-FL supplementation on adaptive response following extensive intestinal resection. Methods: Transcriptomic profiles were obtained from mice undergoing ileocecal recection (8-10 week old male mice) and again at 8 weeks post-surgery.    At the time of resection and again at 8 weeks post-op, small bowel samples were obtained from treatment and control animals and submitted for mRNA profiling.  During these 8 weeks treatment animals (n=3) received 2'-FL supplementationion while controls (n=3) received only standard diet. Results: We observe enrichment in genes and pathways related to anti-microbial peptides, metabolism, and energy processing.  Supplementation of 2'-FL increases energy availability and enhances the adaptive response.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 mice at 8 to 10 weeks of age were submitted to ileocecal recection.  Following resection, half were supplemented with 2'-FL for 8 weeks; small bowels were obtained and submitted for mRNA profiling,
