TITLE
mRNA profiling of YCC3 gastric cancer cell line upon CTNNB1 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Beta-catenin is a major component of Wnt signaling pathway and a crucial player in gastric cancer. To delineate the complex transcription program governed by CTNNB1 in gastric cancer cells, CTNNB1 was silenced in YCC3, a commonly used Wnt signaling activated gastric cancer cell line and the resultant changes in genome-wide mRNA expression pattern was profiled using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from YCC3 gastric cancer cell line transfected with CTNNB1 siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA and profiled using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
