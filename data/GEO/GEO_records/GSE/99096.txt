TITLE
Global transcriptional responses to oxidative stress conditions in lactobacillus plantarum

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Bacteria cope with and adapt to stress by modulating gene expression in response to specific environmental cues. In this study the transcriptional response of lactobacillus plantarum CAUH2 to oxidative stress conditions was investigated via RNA-seq. The work provides detailed insights into the mechanisms through which L. plantarum responds to oxidative stress conditions and increases understanding of bacterial adaptation in natural and industrial settings.

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed. Cells challenged by oxidative stress (H2O2) for 30 min were tested compared to the control. The control group and the H2O2-treated group both has 3 biological replicas.
