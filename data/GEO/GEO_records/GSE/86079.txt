TITLE
RNAseq transcriptome analysis reveals developmental heterogeneity among mouse bone marrow monocyte subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: In our study, we identified a heterogeneity among bone marrow (BM) Ly6Chi monocytes, which can be subdivided the expression of CXCR4. In order to understand the development of BM monocytes, the goal of this experiment is to compare the transcriptome of these 2 BM Ly6Chi monocyte subsets to those of the common monocyte progenitor (cMoP) and Ly6Clo monocytes.

DESIGN
4 BM monocyte subsets (cMoP, Ly6ChiCXCR4hi, Ly6ChiCXCR4lo and Ly6Clo) from 3 different mice were sorted using a BD Aria III. Total RNA was extracted, converted to cDNA and run through deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
