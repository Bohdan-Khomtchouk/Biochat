TITLE
Microarray screening for microRNAs differentially expressed in whole blood samples of patients with clinically significant rejection after liver transplantation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether differentially expressed microRNAs in peripheral blood could be associated with clinically significant, histologically proven acute cellular rejection after liver transplantation, a microRNA microarray screening was performed with RNA isolated from PaxGene whole blood samples from patients with ACR within the first three postoperative weeks and from patients without clinical signs of rejection within the first 6 months after transplantation.

DESIGN
19 blood samples from 19 patients with biopsy proven acute cellular rejection within the first 21 days after transplantation (taken prior or immediately after the start of the anti-rejection therapy), and 17 blood samples from 16 randomly selected stable controls (taken at the postoperative days [POD] 7 or 14).
