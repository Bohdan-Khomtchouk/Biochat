TITLE
Genome-wide effect of inhibition of glutamine transporter ASCT2 in PC-3 cells by BenSer or GPNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the global effects of ASCT2 inhibition, we used next generation sequencing to determine mRNA expression changes in PC-3 cells treated with BenSer or GPNA for 48 h.

DESIGN
Examination of two different ASCT2 inhibitors BenSer and GPNA in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
