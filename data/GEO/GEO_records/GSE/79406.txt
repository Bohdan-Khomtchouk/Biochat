TITLE
Expression data of the NOTCH1 leukemia mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established the NOTCH1 leukemia mouse model, and then established the iPS model from the leukemia cells. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of  leukemia cells, the partially reprogrammed cells and the iPS cells.

DESIGN
Colonies were picked up for RNA extraction on Affymetrix microarrays. We handled the groups at four stages:  Leukemia cells, GFP+ cells, GFP- cells, iPS cells..

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
