TITLE
De novo copy number variations in cloned dogs (Nimblegen)

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
De novo copy number variations in cloned dogs from the same nuclear donor In this study, we aimed to identify de novo post-cloning CNV events and estimated the rate of CNV mosaicism in cloned dogs with the identical genetic  background.

DESIGN
We analyzed CNVs in seven cloned dogs using the nuclear donor genome as reference by array-CGH
