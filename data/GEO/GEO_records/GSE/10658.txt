TITLE
IL-9/mast cell-mediated intestinal permeability predispose to oral antigen hypersensitivity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small intestine of a pool of three Wt mice and a pool of 3 IL-9tg mice in a balb/c backround. We demonstrated that intestinal IL-9 over expression predispose to oral antigen sensitization Keywords: TG vs WT

DESIGN
In the study, we hybridized RNA from 6-8 week old small intestine of wild type (WT) control and Interleukin 9 (IL-9Tg) to Affymetrix MOE430 2 GeneChipÂ® arrays. Each sample is a pool of three mice.
