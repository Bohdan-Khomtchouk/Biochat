TITLE
Transcriptional profile of ecdysoneless mutants and Wild Type controls

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparisons of temperature sensitive mutants (ecdysoneless) at permissive and restrictive temperatures to identify genes under control of ecdysone hormone. Also, Wild Type Strain (Canton S), controls for temperature sensitive genes, are included at the temperature used for restrictive temperatures.
