TITLE
Expression data from human amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) treated with ethanol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of ethanol may vary from induction of apoptosis to the inhibition of proliferation, differentiation, migration or other function.  The complex and diverse response of fetal cells to ethanol has prompted us to use a bioinformatics approach to study the effect of ethanol on fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid-derived (AFSC). To characterize the global response of human AFSC to ethanol, gene expression profiles of AFSC treated with or without 100mM ethanol for 48 hours were analyzed. Keywords: stem cells, amniotic fluid-derived stem cells, ethanol, alcohol
