TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of human colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of anticancer drugs relies on preclinical models closely recapitulating the molecular profile observed patients. We report here the transcriptional profiles of 155 stable cell lines derived from colorectal cancer and related tissues. For these lines, also mutational and pharmacological profiles are available, which enables their stratification into clinically relevant subgroups.

DESIGN
Illumina array-based mRNA expression profiles were generated for 155 established colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines cultured in vitro under standard conditions. All cell lines have been checked for genetic identity by STR analysis. The identity of one cell line (SNU70) was not confirmed by STR. Two cell lines (FHS and FHC) are of non neoplastic origin, being derived from human fetal intestine.
