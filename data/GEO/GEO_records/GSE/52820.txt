TITLE
miRNAs expression profiles in HepG2 cells treated with SAHA and/or 5-Aza-CdR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs that play important roles in the liver carcinogenesis from NASH, miRNA expression profiles were examined. Some miRNAs showed aberrant expression in HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) from NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). These miRNAs were  regulated by DNA methylation, and could be potential therapeutic targets for HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) from NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis).

DESIGN
STAM mice, a model for HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) from NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) were used. miRNA expression profiles in HCC and non-tumor liver tissues in STAM mice were examined. For in vitro study, miRNA expression profiles in HepG2 cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR and/or SAHA were examined.
