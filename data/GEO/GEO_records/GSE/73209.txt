TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Wilms tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The global gene expression pattern of  Wilms tumors in comparison with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and non-neoplastic fetal and adult kidneys.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 32 fresh frozen Wilms tumors, 2 CCSKs, 2 non-neoplastic adult kidneys and comercially obtained RNA from 4 fetal kidneys, were hybridized to Illumina humanHT-12 v4.0 Expression BeadChip at the SCIBLU Lund University, Sweden ( http://www.lth.se/sciblu ).
