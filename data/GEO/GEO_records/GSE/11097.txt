TITLE
Coordinated Changes in Xenobiotic Metabolizing Enzyme Gene Expression in Aging Male Rats: Brown Norway and F344

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to gain insight into the effects of aging on susceptibility to environmental toxins, we characterized the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) from the livers of male Brown Norway and F344 rats across the adult lifespan. To examine metabolic processes across lifespan after challenge with a xenobiotic compound, Brown Norway rats were exposed to 1.0 g/kg body weight toluene by oral gavage in corn oil (4ml/kg body weight) or corn oil alone. Keywords: age effect on toxin susceptibility
