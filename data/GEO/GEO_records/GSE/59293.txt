TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 in Ezh2-conditional iMEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genomic distribution of H3K27me3 in a clone of c-Myc iMEFs (clone C2) either i) wild-type for Ezh2, ii) in the presence of overexpressed exogenous Ezh2, iii) Ezh2-mutant, and iv) Ezh1/Ezh2 pre-deletion (Ezh1/Ezh2 introduced before deletion of endogenous Ezh2) and Ezh2 post-deletion rescue (Ezh2 re-introduced in Ezh2-mutant cells).

DESIGN
Experiment 1: H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in C2 iMEFs either Ezh2 WT, Ezh2-mutant or Ezh2 post-rescue condition. Experiment 2: H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in C2 iMEFs either Ezh2 WT, Ezh2-mutant, in the presence of overexpressed Ezh2, in Ezh1 pre-rescue condition and in Ezh2 pre-rescue condition.
