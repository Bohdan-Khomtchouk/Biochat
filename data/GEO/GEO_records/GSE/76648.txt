TITLE
Global Genome Repair factors are essential for shaping the DNA methylation landscape in Arabidopsis [BS-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the methylome analysis of Arabidopsis plants deficient for the expression of 2 factors involved in global genome repair using whole genome bisulfite sequencing technology

DESIGN
Methylomes of global genome repair deficient Arabidopsis plants
