TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Low level of H3 Lys4 tri-methylation is a signature feature of silenced chromatin regions.  We used microarray to analyze the contribution of S. cerevisiae H3 Lys4 demethylase Jhd2p in silenced chromatin formation process.

DESIGN
Total RNA from two JHD2 gene altered strains : jhd2 deletion and JHD2 over-expression, together with a set1 deletion strain (Set1p: H3 Lys4 methlase) were analyzed with Affymetrix Yeast 2.0 array.  We sought to dissect Jhd2p functions into H3 Lys4 methylation related and unrelated parts by comparing microarry results of JHD2 and SET1 gene altered strains.
