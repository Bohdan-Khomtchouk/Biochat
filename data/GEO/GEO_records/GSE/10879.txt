TITLE
Expression data of hormone-responsive MCF-7 cells versus estrogen-deprived MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen deprivation using aromatase inhibitors is currently the standard of care for patients with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, prolonged estrogen deprivation leads to drug resistance (i.e. hormone-independent growth). We therefore used DNA microarray analysis to study the gene expression profiles of wild-type MCF-7 cells (which are sensitive to antihormone therapy) and long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A breast cancer cells (which are resistance to estrogen-deprivation; aromatase inhibitor resistant). Transcriptional profiling of wild-type MCF-7 cells and estrogen deprived MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A cells was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Keywords: breast cancer cells, estrogen

DESIGN
We wanted to study the gene expression profiles of the different cell lines in their growth media without any drug treatment. Therefore, MCF-7, MCF-7:5C, and MCF-7:2A cells were grown in estrogen-free media (phenol red-free RPMI medium supplemented with 10% 4X dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum) until they were 70-80% confluent then RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
