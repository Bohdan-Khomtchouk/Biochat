TITLE
Heritable DNA methylation marks associated with susceptibility to breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA Methylation analysis of 210 affected and unaffected individuals from 25 Australian families with multiple cases of breast cancer without carrying a mutation at breast cancer susceptibility genes. Genome-wide methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K platform.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 210 whole blood samples was bisulfite converted and hybridised to the Infinium HumanMethylation450K (Illumina)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
