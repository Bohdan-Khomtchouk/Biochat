TITLE
Drop-Seq analysis of P14 mouse retina single-cell suspension

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A cell suspension was prepared from wild-type P14 mouse retinas, and single-cell mRNAseq libraries were generated with Drop-Seq.

DESIGN
Drop-Seq was performed on four separate days using the same age (P14) and strain (C57BL/6).  On day 1, replicate 1 was obtained.  On day 2, replicates 2 and 3 were obtained.  On day 3, replicates 4-6 were obtained.  On day 4, replicate 7 was obtained.
