TITLE
The full transcription map of mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus papillomavirus type 1

SUMMARY
The comprehensive analysis of MmuPV1 expression was performed using total RNA-seq of wart tissues obtained from infected FoxN1nu/nu mice.

DESIGN
Athymic FoxN1nu/nu mice were experimentally infected with quasivirions containing MmuPV1 synthetic genome at three anatomical sites (ear, muzzle, and tail). The warts tissues formed at the infection sites were harvested together with uninfected control ears for total RNA extraction and RNA-seq using Illumina platform was performed on ribo-minus total RNA.

PLATFORM
GPL24037 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus papillomavirus type 1)
