TITLE
Expression data from prostate tumors of TRAMPxPWK/PhJ F2 cross

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that germline variation influences susceptibility to aggressive prostate tumor We examined the changes in gene expression in tumors obtained from TRAMPxPWK/PhJ F2 mice

DESIGN
Transgene-positive (Tg+) F2 males were bred by crossing Tg- sires to Tg+ dames. 27 tumor samples were analyzed, which were obtained from Tg+ F2 males
