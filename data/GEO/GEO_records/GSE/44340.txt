TITLE
Time series of gene expression in murine ES cells with different sex chromosome complement during EpiSC differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ES-cells with different sex chromosome compliment were differentiated into EpiSC, samples were taken  every 4-12 hours for 84 hours in total. The original data for the XX-cells is also available as GSE34243, but normalisation of these differs.

DESIGN
Mouse Pgk12.1 ES cells or E14 cells with different sex chromosome compliment were differentiated into EpiSC, samples were taken  every 4-12 hours for 84 hours in total
