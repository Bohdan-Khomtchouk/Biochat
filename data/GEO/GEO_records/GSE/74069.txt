TITLE
ChIP-seq of the androgen receptor (AR) in MDAMB453 cells after androgen stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Serum starved MDAMB453 cells were serum starved and treated for 4 hours with vehicle control (ethanol), 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 10nM) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 10nM). AR binidng peaks were determined. Subsequent analysis showed that binding sites for androgen receptor are enriched at breast cancer risk loci.

DESIGN
Each ChIP experiment was carried out in duplicate and consensus AR binding peaks were called. The conditions were vehcle (ethanol) treated, DHT and MPA stimulated cells.
