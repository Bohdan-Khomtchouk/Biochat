TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of the primitive erythroid (EryP) lineage differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During mammalian postimplantation development, primitive erythroblasts (EryP) or red blood cells are the first cell type to be specified from nascent mesoderm, late in gastrulation.   EryP arise in the yolk sac from a transient wave of progenitors, enter the circulation soon thereafter, and continue to mature in a stepwise and synchronous fashion.  We have taken advantage of a transgenic mouse line in which a green fluorescent reporter is expressed specifically in the EryP lineage to identify and purify EryP at different stages of maturation from  E7.5 through E12.5.  A transcriptional profile that encompasses key developmental landmarks of this lineage was determined using a genome-wide microarray analysis (Illumina platform).

DESIGN
Dataset is a lineage-specific transcription profiling of EryP development on consecutive days from E7.5 through E12.5.  At least 3 independent biological replicates were used for each developmental time point.

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
