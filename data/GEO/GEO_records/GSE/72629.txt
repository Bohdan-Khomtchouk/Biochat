TITLE
Acute loss of TET function results in aggressive myeloid cancer in mice [WGBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the DNA methylation in LSK cells from  the bone marrow of wildtype or  Tet2/3 DKO mice.

DESIGN
In order to address the impact of the loss of Tet2/3 proteins in DNA methylation in LSK  cells, we compared by WGBS the methylome of wild and, Tet2/3 DKO LSK cells in bone marrow.
