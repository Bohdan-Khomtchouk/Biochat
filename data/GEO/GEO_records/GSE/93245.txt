TITLE
Expression data from transfection of two different antisense oligonucleotides in HuH7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to globally profile the gene expression changes observed after 24h when transfecting antisense oligonucleotides in HuH77 cells

DESIGN
Two different antisense oligonucleotides, denoted SPC3302 (n=3) and SPC3833 (n=3), were transfected into HuH7 cells and gene expression changes relative to mock-treated controls (n=3) were measured by microarray after 24h.
