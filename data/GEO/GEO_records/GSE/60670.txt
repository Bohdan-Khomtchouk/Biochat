TITLE
High-resolution transcriptome analysis reveals neuropathic pain gene-expression signatures in spinal microglia after nerve injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microglia activation contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. To identify changes of microglial gene expression during their activation after peripheral nerve injury, we employed microarray analysis of individually collected pools of 10 spinal microglia cells

DESIGN
After the L4 SNT, spinal cords of mice were used for microarray experiments at POD1 and POD7. Six biologically independent hybridizations were performed for each condition. cDNA was synthesized from pooled ten microglia which were collected from three spinal cord slices of an individual mouse and then used for each microarray chip.
