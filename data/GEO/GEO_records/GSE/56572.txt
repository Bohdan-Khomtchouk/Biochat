TITLE
Quantitative sequencing of 5-formylcytosine in DNA at single-base resolution

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytosine base modifications 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC) are present in mammalian DNA. Here, reduced bisulfite sequencing is developed for quantitatively sequencing 5fC at single-base resolution. This method is then applied with oxidative bisulfite sequencing to gain a map of 5mC, 5hmC and 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
12 samples, reduced representation bisulphite treatment: 4 replicates each for bisulphite (BS), oxidative BS (oxBS) and reduced BS (redBS) for the detection of 5mC, 5hmC and 5fC. Mouse (strain B6C) embryonic stem cells.

PLATFORM
