TITLE
Xylella fastidiosa Study on different growth media

ORGANISM
Xylella fastidiosa

SUMMARY
The arrays were hybridized against cDNAs labeled during reverse transcription reactions, which were obtained from bacteria grown under two different conditions (liquid XDM2 and liquid BCYE).

DESIGN
A total of 2,600 primer pairs were synthesized and then used to generate fragments using the PCR technique. The chips were spotted, hybridized, scanned and analyzed in our laboratory.

PLATFORM
GPL7554 UNESP Xylella fastidiosa array version 1
