TITLE
Quercetin supplementation and CD14+ monocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quercetin has been described to have a wide range of beneficial effects in humans, ranging from anti-carcinogenic properties to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. We tested whether a daily supplementation of quercetin leads to reproducible changes in gene expression profiles of human monocytes. Keywords: individual compound treatment

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were isolated from three healthy volunteers before and after a 2 wk supplementation period of 150mg quercetin per day. With this design every subject served as his or her own control (baseline sample = control)
