TITLE
Classification of  Myeloma Using Global MicroRNA Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myeloma is a heterogeneous disease. In this work we used global microRNA profiling to classify clinical samples from UK MRC Myeloma IX, and developed a microRNA-based “outcome classifier” for risk stratification.

DESIGN
Global microRNA expression profiling was carried out in 163 newly diagnosed samples from CD138+ cell selection

PLATFORM
