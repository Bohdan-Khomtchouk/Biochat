TITLE
Expression data of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from control or urethane treated  AJ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AJ mouse is susceptible to lung carcinogenesis from urethane treatment and is a good model for human adenocarcinoma.  We completed a study using microarray analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from control or urethane treated mice. A unique macrophage expression signature in the lung tumor microenvironment was able to correctly classify the lavage samples. Keywords: AJ mouse control and urethane treatment carcinogenesis protocol
