TITLE
Expression data of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from control or urethane treated  AJ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AJ mouse is susceptible to lung carcinogenesis from urethane treatment and is a good model for human adenocarcinoma.  We completed a study using microarray analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from control or urethane treated mice. A unique macrophage expression signature in the lung tumor microenvironment was able to correctly classify the lavage samples. Keywords: AJ mouse control and urethane treatment carcinogenesis protocol

DESIGN
RNA from bronchoalveolar lavage cells of age matched untreated AJ mice controls (C) or from urethane treated (T) AJ mice was prepared. Datasets were accurately classified using a unique macrophage gene expression signature derived from the tumor microenvironment.
