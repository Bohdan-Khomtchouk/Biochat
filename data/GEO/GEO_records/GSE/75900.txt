TITLE
Expression data on salivary glands tissues of 3rd instar larvae from w[1118] wildtype and dTCTP mutants.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila translationally controled tumor protein (dTCTP) is important to repair double stranded DNA breaks in cell nucleus. However, besides damaged DNA loci, dTCTP is also located in interbands region of polytene chromsomes of salivary gland tissues. To address whether dTCTP is involved in transcriptional regulation process, we performed microarrays in salivary gland tissues from dTCTP mutants and w[1118] wildtype control.

DESIGN
Salivary glands tissues were dissected and collected from 3rd instar larvae or each genotype for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
