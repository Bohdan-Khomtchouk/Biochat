TITLE
ChimeraScan: A tool for identifying chimeric transcription in sequencing data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing technologies have enabled de novo gene fusion discovery that could reveal candidates with therapeutic significance in cancer. Here we present an open-source software package, ChimeraScan, for the discovery of chimeric transcription between two independent transcripts.

DESIGN
Three cancer cell lines with known gene fusions

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
