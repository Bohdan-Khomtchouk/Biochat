TITLE
Sweet orange genes regulated by Xanthomonas citri (Xc) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (Ch), or Ch alone

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses of sweet orange leaves infiltrated with Xc in the presence or absence of Ch, or Ch alone This experiment was used to identify genes up-regulated by Xc independently of protein synthesis

DESIGN
Citrus leaves were infiltrated with a suspension of Xc with or without Ch, and mRNA was extrated and processed 8h post inoculation (8hpi)

PLATFORM
