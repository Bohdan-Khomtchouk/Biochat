TITLE
Cacao interactions with pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum theobromicola and pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora palmivora

ORGANISM
Theobroma cacao

SUMMARY
Seedlings grown from seeds from open-pollinated mother trees of genotype UF12 were grown and at two months of age used to analyze response to treatment with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum theobromicola and the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora palmivora.

DESIGN
Same microarray design as described in Maximova, S. N., Florez, S., Shen, X., Niemenak, N., Zhang, Y., Curtis, W., & Guiltinan, M. J. (2014). Genome-wide analysis reveals divergent patterns of gene expression during zygotic and somatic embryo maturation of Theobroma cacao L., the chocolate tree. BMC plant biology, 14(1), 185.
