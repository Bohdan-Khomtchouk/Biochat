TITLE
Song stimulation: Conspecific song vs Control and Heterospecific song

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of courtship song stimulated females in Drosophila melanogaster comparing females exposed to conspecific song to those exposed to either white-noise (control) or heterospecific song (D. simulans)

DESIGN
Three condition experiment, D. melanogaster (mel_song) song stimulated vs. Control (no_song) and vs. D. simulans (sim_song) stimulated females. Biological replicates: 7 for D_mel_song, 4 for no_song, 3 for D_sim_song. One replicate per array. Each sample contains 120 pooled female heads, collected from three independent experiments. Technical replication: two arrays with reverse labeling for each contrast.
