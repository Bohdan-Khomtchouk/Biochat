TITLE
The C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II is Modified by Site-Specific Methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in mammals undergoes extensive post-translational modification, which is essential for transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here, we show that the CTD of RNAPII is methylated at a single arginine (R1810) by the transcriptional co-activator CARM1. Although methylation at R1810 is present on the hyper-phosphorylated form of RNAPII in vivo, Ser-2 or Ser-5 phosphorylation inhibit CARM1 activity towards this site in vitro, suggesting that methylation occurs before transcription initiation. Mutation of R1810 results in the mis-expression of a variety of snRNAs and snoRNAs, an effect that is also observed in Carm1-/- MEFs.  These results demonstrate that CTD methylation facilitates the expression of select RNAs, perhaps serving to discriminate the RNAPII-associated machinery recruited to distinct gene types.

DESIGN
To address the function of RNAPII methylation, we generated Raji cell lines expressing an RNA Polymerase II resistant to α-amanitin and carrying either wild-type R1810 or an arginine to alanine substitution at that same residue, abolishing R1810 methylation of the CTD. In cells cultured in α-amanitin, the α-amanitin-resistant mutants fully replaced the functions of endogenous RNAPII, allowing us to study if gene-expression is affected by the absence of R1810me
