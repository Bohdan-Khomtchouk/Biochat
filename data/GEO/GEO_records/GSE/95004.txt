TITLE
Scalable generation of Schwann cell precursors from human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schwann cells (SCs) are an absolute prerequisite for development of effective treatment of myelin disorders and nerve injuries. However, human sources of functional, myelinating SCs are extremely limited. Here, we have developed a novel, efficient strategy for producing directly an unlimited supply of functional human SCs via successful derivation of expandable Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (hPSC-SCPs). Functional and molecular characteristics of SCs from hPSC-SCPs (hPSC-SCP-SCs) appeared to be similar to those of authentic Schwann cells. As a novel therapeutic target, transplanted hPSC-SCP-SCs effectively promoted axonal regeneration through directly myelinating regenerated-axons in sciatic nerve injured mice. Here, we present hPSC-SCPs and hPSC-SCP-SCs as an outstanding resource to use for investigating human Schwann cell pathology and biology and for translational approaches to PNS and CNS repair and regeneration.

DESIGN
These data include global gene expression of 13 samples including 4 kinds of SCP, 4 kinds of SC, 2 kinds of neural crest stem cells (NCSC), 2 kinds of iPSC and 1 kind of hESC (H9).
