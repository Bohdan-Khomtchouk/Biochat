TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of murine microglia from embryonic development to adulthood

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of murine microglia from different stages of development was performed. Results showed that different phases of microglia development had different group of genes up-regulated for specific functions.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from microglia/progenitors from E10.5 embryos to adult mice. Gene expression analysis was done to observe DEGs and differential pathway analysis.
