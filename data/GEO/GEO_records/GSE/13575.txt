TITLE
Mouse lung cells' gene expression difference compared with that of MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse somatic lung cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the MEF cells. This difference gave the mouse somatic lung cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the mouse ES cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between mouse somatic lung cells and mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
There were two replicates sample of the mouse somatic lung cell named 1, 2. And the control cells were the MEF cells. Mouse somatic lung cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the MEF cells were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the mouse somatic lung cells' gene expression difference compared with that of MEF cells.
