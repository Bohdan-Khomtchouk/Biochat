TITLE
A diet enriched with biologically active substances as a protecting factor against carcinogenesis process induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rat liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a diet enriched with biologically active compounds to protect against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine - induced carcinogenesis in 14-month old rats liver.Â 

DESIGN
Rats from control and experimental groups after 14 months of experiment were given 5 times 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) by intraperitoneal treatment  at a dose of 30mg/kg of body weight once a week to induce the process of carcinogenesis. RNA from their livers were hybridized to Agilent two color microarrays with a common reference. Then, the transcriptomic profile of these livers were compared to the transcriptomic profile of 14-month rats received the same control diet and diet enriched with biologically active substances, but without 1,2-dimethylhydrazine - induction (data from GEO Submission - GSE51657).
