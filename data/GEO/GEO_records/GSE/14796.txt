TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of E. coli W3110 normal colonies vs. L-form colonies

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. W3110

SUMMARY
Expression data comparing typical E.coli colonies grown on BHI and BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4 to L-form colonies grown on BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4+Penicillin G. Keywords: one time point

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis of E.coli colonies grown on BHI and BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4 (controls) with L-form colonies grown on BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4+Penicillin G (experimental). An isolated colony of fresh W3110 was grown for 5hrs to log phase, dilutions of the inoculmn were spread onto three media: BHI, BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4, and BHI+Sucrose+MgSO4+Penicillin G to yield isolated colonies. Isolated control colonies which grow overnight were harvested the next day while isolated L-form colonies which do not grow until 48-72 hrs were harvested after 72hrs. All colonies were harvest with a PBS moistened sterile swab and dipped into a sterile microcentrifuge tube containing 500ul of PBS. RNA was isolated from pelleted cells using MasterPure RNA Purification Kit and reverse transcribed for making probes for array hybridization on E.coli Genome 2.0 Affymetrix microarrays.
