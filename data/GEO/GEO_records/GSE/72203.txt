TITLE
Gene Expression by array after Ferritin Knockdown in Preferential Iron Trafficking Characterizes Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas display hierarchies with self-renewing cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). RNA sequencing and enhancer mapping revealed regulatory programs unique to CSCs causing upregulation of the iron transporter transferrin, the top differentially expressed gene compared to tissue-specific progenitors. Direct interrogation of iron uptake demonstrated CSCs potently extract iron from the microenvironment more effectively than other tumor cells. Systematic interrogation of iron flux determined that CSCs preferentially require transferrin receptor and ferritin - two core iron regulators - to propagate and form tumors in vivo.  Depleting ferritin disrupted CSC mitotic progression, through the STAT3-FoxM1 regulatory axis, revealing an iron-regulated CSC pathway. Iron is a unique, primordial metal fundamental for earliest life forms, and on which CSCs have an epigenetically programmed, targetable dependence.

DESIGN
Ferritin Light chain (FTL) or Ferritin Heavy Chain (FTH1) were knocked down by shRNA and compared to control shRNA treatment in 5 GBM stem cell lines. Affymetrix arrays were used to determine gene expression changes after ferritin knockdown.
