TITLE
Human Papillomavirus 16 E5 modulates the expression of host microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of human papillomavirus 16 E5 oncogene on cellular gene expression in human epithelial cells was studied.

DESIGN
Alterations in cellular gene expression due to human papillomavirus type 16 E5 oncogene were studied in triplicate microarray screens. Epithelial cells where E5 expression was induced for 0, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96h were compared to control cells.
