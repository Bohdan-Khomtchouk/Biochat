Genomic Profiling of Adult Male Germ Cell Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic profiling of a panel of 74 adult male germ cell tumors of various histologies from primary and metastatic sites using high resolution BAC array CGH. See Pubmed ID # 17943972. Completed Study: Statistical analyses were performed to identify regions that were frequently altered in all tumors, as well as in specific histologic subsets and from different tumor sites (i.e., primary gonadal, primary extra-gonadal, and metastatic). Target genes of altered regions were also identified using corresponding tumor expression data (see GEO GSE3218 for expression data). Ongoing: 1) Analysis of high level amplifications and multiple copy number gains and losses and underlying target genes. 2) Regional alterations associated with patient outcome Keywords: tumor profiling
