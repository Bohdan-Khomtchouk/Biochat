TITLE
Expression data from mouse testis following chronic exposure to acrylamide via the drinking water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acrylamide is a reproductive toxicant that has been detected in foods such as potato chips and breads. The consequences of chronic exposure to acrylamide in the human diet are unknown; however we previously reported that exposure to acrylamide at levels equivalent to human exposure produced high levels of genetic damage in early male germ cells of mice [Nixon et al. ToxSci 129(1), 135–145 (2012)]. In the present study, we examined changes in testicular gene expression in these mice to examine the potential mechanisms involved in acrylamide induced DNA damage in male germ cells and to provide a better understanding of the reproductive toxic effects of acrylamide in the male.

DESIGN
Adult male mice were subjected to chronic acrylamide exposure via the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 µg/ml for 1, 6 and 12 months. The testes were collected at each time point for RNA extraction and hybridization on an Illumina Sentrix Mouse ref-8 v2 Beadchip.
