TITLE
Oncogenic Functions of the Transcription Factor LSF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of LSF in less aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells resulted in highly aggressive, angiogenic and multi-organ metastatic tumors while inhibition of LSF significantly abrogated growth and metastasis of highly aggressive HCC cells in nude mice. We used microarrays to identify the downstream genes mediating the effects of LSF in HCC cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were compared between Control-8 and LSF-17 clones of HepG3 cells.
