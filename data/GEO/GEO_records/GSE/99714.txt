TITLE
Distinct mesenchymal lineages and niches promote epithelial self-renewal and myofibrogenesis in the lung [Single cell RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNAseq using the 10x gemcode platform on bulk mesenchyme from one adult 6w old mouse.

DESIGN
Lungs were harvested from a 6-week old adult mouse and digested to generate a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was stained with antibodies directed against Epcam, CD31 and CD45. DAPI was included as a live/dead stain. Cells that were negative for DAPI, EPCAM, CD31 and CD45, were sorted into collection buffer. The purified cells, referred to as bulk mesenchyme, were manually counted and subsequently loaded onto the 10x Genomics instrument, libraries were prepared according to the manufacture's protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
