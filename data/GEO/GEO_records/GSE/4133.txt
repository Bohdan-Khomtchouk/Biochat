TITLE
The Genome Wide Distribution of Acetylated Histone H4 Remodelled through Human Primary Myoblast Differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The simultaneous genotyping of tens of thousands of SNP using SNP microarrays is a very important tool that is revolutionizing genetics and molecular biology. In this work, we present a new application of this technique by using it to assess chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) as a means to assess the multiple genomic locations bound by a protein complex recognized by an antibody. We illustrate the use of this technique with an analysis of the change in histone H4 acetylation, a marker of open chromatin and transcriptionally active genomic regions, which occur during the differentiation of human myoblasts into myotubes. Our results are validated by the observation of a significant correlation between the histone modifications detected and the expression of the nearby genes, as measured by DNA microarrays. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
This super series is composed of the following subset series: GSE4131: Triplicate Affymetrix HGU133A/B expression chips were hybridized to RNA extracted from myoblasts and myotubes. GSE4132: Triplicate Affymetrix 10K ax 13339 SNP chips were hybridized to DNA from myoblasts and myotubes.
