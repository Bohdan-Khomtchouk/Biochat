TITLE
Expression data of Pioglitazone- or vehicle-treated CD4+FoxP3- T cells transduced with Foxp3+/- Pparg1 (or Pparg2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified Pparg as a major orchestrator of the phenotype of adipose-tissue resident regulatory T cells (VAT Tregs). To explore the contribution of Pparg1 and 2 in the generation of the VAT Tregs-specific gene signatures, CD4+FoxP3- T cells were transduced with Foxp3+/- Pparg1 (or Pparg2), treated with Pioglitazone or vehicle, and double sorted for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified (double-sorted) T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled. Triplicates were generated for all groups. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
