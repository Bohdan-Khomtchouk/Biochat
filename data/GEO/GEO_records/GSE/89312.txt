TITLE
The flowering-related genes responsible for differences in bolting time between two radish lines

ORGANISM
Raphanus sativus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that determine the differences in flowering times between two radish lines, NH-JS1 (late bolting) and NH-JS2 (early bolting) by high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis. In total, 71,188 unigenes were identified by reference-guided assembly, of which 309, 788, and 980 genes were differentially expressed between the two inbred lines after 0, 15, and 35 days of vernalization, respectively.

DESIGN
Examination of different flowering time between two radish inbred lines. Leaves mRNA profiles of 0, 15, 35day old NH-JS1 and 2 radish were generated by deep sequencing, in replicate, using Illumina hiseq2000.
