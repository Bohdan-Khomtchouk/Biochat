TITLE
Phf19 knockdown effect on F9 embryonal carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PCL family protein Phf19/Pcl3 is one of the accessory components of the PRC2 core complex, and Phf19 is highly expressed in murine ES cells and an ES cell-like embryonic carcinoma cell line, F9 cells. Here we performed microarray analysis of embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 following Phf19 knockdown by shRNA. Knocking down Phf19/Pcl3 in F9 embryonic cells led to derepression of numerous PRC2 direct target genes.

DESIGN
4 sampels including 2 shRNA vector control cell lines and 2 shPhf19 cell lines were used for RNA extraction and Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
