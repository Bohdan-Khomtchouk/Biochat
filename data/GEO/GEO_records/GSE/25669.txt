TITLE
Sorted leukocyte populations from acute HIV-1 patients.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify cell-type specific contributions to the acute HIV transcriptional signature identified in the CHAVI 001 acute 32 prospective cohort.

DESIGN
Four AHI patients and four healthy individuals were apheresed and different leukocyte populations were sorted by flowcytometry. Genome wide transcriptional profiling was done for AHI B cells (n=4), Healthy B cells (n=2) , AHI CD4 T cells (n=3), Healthy CD4 T cells (n=4), AHI CD8 T cells (n=4), Healthy CD8 T cells (n=2), AHI polymorphonuclear cells (n=2), Healthy polymorphonuclear cells (n=3), AHI monocytes (n=3), Healthy monocytes (n=4), AHI NK cells (n=3), Healthy NK cells (n=3) making a total of 37 samples.
