TITLE
Critical role of histone turnover in neuronal transcription and plasticity [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Turnover and exchange of nucleosomal histones and their variants, a process long believed to be static in post-replicative cells, remains largely unexplored in brain. Here, we describe a novel mechanistic role for HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) and proteasomal degradation associated histone dynamics in the regulation of activity-dependent transcription, synaptic connectivity and behavior. We uncover a dramatic developmental profile of nucleosome occupancy across the lifespan of both rodents and humans, with the histone variant H3.3 accumulating to near saturating levels throughout the neuronal genome by mid-adolescence. Despite such accumulation, H3.3 containing nucleosomes remain highly dynamic–in a modification independent manner–to control neuronal- and glial- specific gene expression patterns throughout life. Manipulating H3.3 dynamics in both embryonic and adult neurons confirmed its essential role in neuronal plasticity and cognition. Our findings establish histone turnover as a critical, and previously undocumented, regulator of cell-type specific transcription and plasticity in mammalian brain.

DESIGN
All ChIP-seq samples were generated to test the impact of neuronal activity/adult physiological plasticity on histone turnover in the central nervous system. This was tested in cultured neurons and astrocytes, FACS purified neurons or FACS purified Glia.
