TITLE
mRNA expression under alkylating condition in wild-type strain and ttha1564 deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We analyzed the expression profile of wild-type strain and ttha1564 deletion mutant strain of Thermus thermophils HB8 under alkylating condition.  In wild type strain, 107 genes and 96 genes were over 2-fold up- and under 0.5-fold down-regulated by alkylation, respectively. In ttha1564 deletion mutant, 35 genes and 12 genes were over 2-fold up- and under 0.5-fold down-regulated by alkylation, respectively. Keywords: stress response comparison The T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type and delta ttha1564 strains were cultured in TT medium (0.4%(w/v) polypeptone, 0.2%(w/v) yeast extract, 0.1%(w/v) NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, (pH 7.5)) at 70째C until the OD600 reached 0.8. The cultures were then divided into two flasks and an equal volume of TT medium prewarmed at 70째C was added.  One of the media culture of each strain contained 100 micro g/ml MNNG.  We confirmed that the cells can continue to grow in TT medium containing 100 micro g/ml MNNG but DNAs are alkylated sufficiently (Onodera, 2011).  After further cultivation at 70째C for 10 min, the diluted cultures were collected into an equal of 100% ethanol and stored at -80째C.  The procedures used for extraction of crude RNA, synthesis of cDNA, labeling of cDNA fragment, hybridization to a TTHB8401a520105F GeneChip (Affymetrix) and data analysis were basically the same as those described previously (Agari et al., 2008; Shinkai et al., 2007).  To determine the mRNA expression level of each sample, image data for the three independent samples were processed.
