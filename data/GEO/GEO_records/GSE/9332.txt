TITLE
Study of Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) effect on primary human monocytes transcription profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent lipid mediator of inflammation, implicated in numerous diseases including atherosclerosis. We have used primary human monocytes, which express both receptors, to analyze transcriptional responses to LTB4. Comparisons were made between LTB4- and vehicle-treated samples at the same time point.  The analysis showed that expression of 72 genes was upregulated at least two-fold at two time points. These genes include multiple chemokines as well as some genes with unknown function. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Cells were stimulated with LTB4 for various times. For each time point, there is one treated sample and one vehicle control. After isolation, each RNA sample is hybridized to duplicate CodeLink chips.
