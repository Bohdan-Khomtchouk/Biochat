TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of lungs from six different mouse strains after infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus [set 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Susceptible (DBA/2J, 129/SvImJ,  A/J) and Resistant (SM/J, C57BL/6J, Balb/cJ) mouse strain were inoculated with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus (A/Hong Kong/213/2003) for 72 hours or not infected (control animals). Differences in expression were analyzed and used to identify candidate genes and pathways that contributed to the difference in H5N1 pathogenesis in these two groups of mice.

DESIGN
Female 6-8 weeks old animals were inoculated with H5N1 virus or not and 72 hours later the lungs were obtained and immediately homogenized in Trizol. The extracted RNA was submitted for Illumina Gene expression profiling.
