TITLE
How C/EBPa creates an elite cell state for reprogramming to pluripotency [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Bcell, upon ectopic expression of the transcription factor Cebpa for 18h, can be reprogrammed to iPS with extremely high efficiency. To understand the molecular control of this phenomena we performed multiple high throughtput functional genomic analysis.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic by microarray in Bcell, Bcell+Cebpa18h, Bcell+Cebpa18h+OKSM1d, Bcell+Cebpa18h+OKSM2d, ES cells

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
