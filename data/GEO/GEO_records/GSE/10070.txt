TITLE
Gene Expression in MCF10A cells through Differentiation on Transwells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the differences occurring in MCF10A cells as they polarize and differentiate in the Transwell® model, we performed gene expression profiling with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.  Four experimental time points, were sampled:  conventional cultures of MCF10A cells grown on plastic (Monolayer) and MCF10A cells plated on Transwells® sampled at three TEER values, 200-300 Ω cm2 (Base), 1400-1600 Ω cm2 (Midpoint), and 3000-3200 Ω cm2 (Plateau). Keywords: Mammary Epithelial Cell Differentiation
