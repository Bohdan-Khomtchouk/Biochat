TITLE
Chicken gut DM asymmetry

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
HH stage 21 chicken dorsal mesentery is laser microdissected into four morphological compartments, and subject to global expression analyses on Affymetrix Chicken 3' microarray Goal is to identify genes expressed in each of left epitelium, left mesenchyme, right mesenchyme, right epithelium; genes on the left may be direct or indirect transcriptional targets of Pitx2.

DESIGN
Three biological experiments were performed, among which 1939 laser cut sections were collected for RNA analyses. Transcript targets from a single biological experiment were pooled and hybridized to a single chip. Thus, the experiment was run in biologcal triplicate with no technical replicates. Three biological replicates with four cell compartments each gives a total of 12 samples in the collection.

PLATFORM
GPL3213 [Chicken] Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array
