TITLE
Dynamic time course mRNA profiling of human skeletal muscle cell differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine the miRNA expression profile of in vitro differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells and to couple changes in individual miRNA expression to effects on target genes by transcriptome profiling of mRNA expression. mRNA expression profiling at three different time points during the in vitro differentiation process of human skeletal muscle cells from three subjects. RNA was harvested from myoblasts before and 4 and 10 days after induction of differentiation.

DESIGN
Temporal, time-course design with paired analysis (3 subjects). Biological replicates: 3 at day 0, 3 at day 4, and 3 at day 10. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
