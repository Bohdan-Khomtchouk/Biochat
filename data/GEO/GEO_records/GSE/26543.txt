TITLE
The influence of aging, environmental exposures and local sequence features on the variation of DNA methylation in blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of non-pathologic peripheral blood from subjects with no history of cancer. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in peripheral blood. Samples included 205 normal control peripheral blood samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 205 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
