TITLE
CD4+ T Cells Gene Expression-Based Biomarkers in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: To discovery biomarkers in JIA base on gene expression from RNA sequencing on CD4+ T Cells Method: Paired-end Ilumina sequencing to capture gene expression of CD4+ T cells from JIA individuals with active disease and patients in clinical remission on medication.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing on CD4+T cells consist of JIA patients

PLATFORM
