TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the P1 bladder isolated from SMAA or SMAGA (Acta2 or Actg2) transgenic and wild type mice. (GUDMAP Series ID: 2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder. The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing bladder. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in laser capture microdissected components of the developing bladder. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. As a first step we sought to determine if expression of the reporter gene (EGFP or EYFP) used to identify smooth muscle cells altered the gene expression profile of the bladder. Keywords: Comparison of postnatal day 1 bladders.

DESIGN
Postnatal day 1 bladders were isolated from transgenic and wild-type mice to determine the effects of transgene expression on the gene expression profile in the bladder.
