TITLE
Gene expression of sorted Eomes+ and Eomes‒ γδ T cells from spleen of Eomes-IRES-GFP mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a transcription factor with a crucial role regulating cytotoxic function, development and survival of immune cells. Although it is known that γδ T cells can express Eomes, its function on those cells is still largely unknown. Using Eomes-IRES-GFP mice we were able to sort for Eomes+ and Eomes‒ γδ T cells populations and get their gene expression profiles, bringing light to the role of Eomes on γδ T cells.

DESIGN
Eomes+ and Eomes‒ γδ T cells samples were obtained from three completely independent flow cytometric sorts.  As a source, cells from spleen from 4 to 6 Eomes-IRES-GFP were prepared for each sort.
