TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the acuM null mutant

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Deletion of AcuM caused attenuated virulence in mouse models of Aspergillosis, we carried out the microarry to figure out pathways have been changed to affect the virulence.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus  mycelium comparing mutant ΔacuM with wild type Af293, and complemented strain ΔacuM ::acuM  with mutant  ΔacuM .  Three time points comparison under RPMI: 8 hour, 18 hour, 24 hour. Biological replicates: 2, independently grown and harvest. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL10341 JCVI Aspergillus fumigatus AF293 29.9K amplicon array
