TITLE
Mediator binding to UASs is broadly uncoupled from transcription and cooperative with TFIID recruitment to promoters

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mediator is a conserved, essential transcriptional coactivator complex, but its in vivo functions have remained unclear due to conflicting data regarding its genome-wide binding pattern obtained by genome-wide ChIP. Here, we used ChEC-seq, a method orthogonal to ChIP, to generate a high-resolution map of Mediator binding to the yeast genome. We find that Mediator associates with upstream activating sequences (UASs) rather than the core promoter or gene body under all conditions tested. Mediator occupancy is surprisingly correlated with transcription levels at only a small fraction of genes. Using the same approach to map TFIID, we find that TFIID is associated with both TFIID- and SAGA-dependent genes and that TFIID and Mediator occupancy is cooperative. Our results clarify Mediator recruitment and binding to the genome, showing that Mediator binding to UASs is widespread, partially uncoupled from transcription, and mediated in part by TFIID.

DESIGN
We used ChEC-seq to map the genome-wide binding of Mediator and its relationship to TFIID in budding yeast. ChEC-seq was performed as described in PMID 26490019.
