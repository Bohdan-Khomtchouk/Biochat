Murine prostate epithelial cells (PECs) were obtained from Ccnd1-/- and Ccnd1+/+ FvB mice (2-3 months of age). RNA extracted from PECs (3 technical replicates for each group) was labeled and used to probe Affymetrix 430_2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Three control Ccnd1+/+ PECs were compared to three Ccnd1+/+ PECs.
