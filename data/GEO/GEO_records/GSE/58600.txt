TITLE
Clinical biomarkers of pulmonary carcinoid tumors in never smokers via profiling miRNA and target mRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify clinically meaningful biomarkers in pulmonary carcinoid tumors (PCTs), a member of neuroendocrine neoplasms, via profiling miRNAs and mRNAs.

DESIGN
Fifty-one individuals who had never smoked tobacco products and developed PCTs between 1997 and 2008 were studied. A group of 47 carcinoids tumors were analyzed; each with paired tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples (at least 5 cm away from the primary tumors). There are 24 pairs of tumor/normal samples in FF tissues, and 23 pairs of tumor/normal samples in FFPE. The expression status of 1145 miRNAs was generated by Illumina miRNA Arrays.
