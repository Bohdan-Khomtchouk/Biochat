TITLE
Identification of downstream genes regulated by OsMADS2

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To gain mechanistic insights on OsMADS2 functions in rice spikelet development, we have employed global expression profilling to identify the genes regulated by OsMADS2. Transgenic rice panicle RNAs were compared with the wild type panicle RNA of similar developmental stage. Genes downregulated in transgenic lines will be those which expression requires functional OsMADS2 whereas upregulated genes will need OsMADS2 for their repression. Keywords: Comparative expression profile analysis

DESIGN
Two independent biological RNA pools of dsRNAiOsMADS2 transgenic panicles were compared with a single wild type RNA pool in two different hybridizations. A third hybridization was performed with reciprocally dye-lebeled wild type RNA and one of the mutant RNA.
