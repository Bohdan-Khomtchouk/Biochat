TITLE
Expression profile for Drosophila Sox14 at onset of metamorphosis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis of RNA obtained from w1118 and w1118;sox14L1/sox14L1 animals staged at pupariation to identify genes regulated by Drosophila Sox14 at the onset of metamorphosis.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from whole Drosophila w1118 and w1118; sox14L1/sox14L1 animals selected immediately after pupariation was hybridized on Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Arrays. Each genotype was assayed independently three times with samples obtained from 10 prepupae.
