TITLE
Evaluation of technical (array-to-array) reproducibility of L. vannamei microarray

ORGANISM
Litopenaeus vannamei

SUMMARY
Five aliquots of the same RNA sample were labeled and hybridized in parallel to the L. vannamei microarray, in order to assess the technical reproducibility of the tool Keywords: technical validation

DESIGN
A sample of gill total RNA was divided in 5 identical aliquots, and each aliquot was labeled and hybridized to an array. The co-relation among the global expression profiles obtained was assessed.
