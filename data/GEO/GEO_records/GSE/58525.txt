TITLE
Expression data from WIF1 induced LN-229 (GBM cell line)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and due to the invasive nature it cannot be completely removed. We have recently shown that the WNT inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), a secreted inhibitor of WNTs, is downregulated in glioblastoma and acts as strong tumor suppressor. In search of a mediator for this function differential gene expression profiles of WIF1-expressing cells were performed. MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA and key positive regulator of invasion, emerged as the top downregulated gene. Indeed, knock-down of MALAT1 reduced migration in glioblastoma cells, without effect on proliferation.

DESIGN
LN-229 cells  induced with Doxocyclin to express WIF1 were compared to the non-induced control (two biological replicates each)
