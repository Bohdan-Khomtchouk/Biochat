TITLE
Exogenous BAPN administration does not regulate gene expression in primary murine lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary murine lung fibroblasts or ATII cells were either treated with vehicle or 1mM BAPN for 24 h. Overall, only one change in gene expression was found in the corrected p values in fibroblasts group in this microarray study.

DESIGN
Four vehicle treated samples after 24 h of exposure and four BAPN treated (1mM) samples after 24 h of exposure, were used for this microarray study.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
