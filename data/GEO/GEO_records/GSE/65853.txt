TITLE
Expression data of the seedlings of Arabidopsis wild type and css1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare global gene expression patterns between Arabidopsis wild type and css1, a mitochondria-related mutant (Nakagawa and Sakurai, Plant and Cell Physiol. 47(6): 772-783). The result identified several classes of upregulated genes by the mutation including JA biosynthesis and signaling.

DESIGN
The total RNA was prepared from 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on agar plates containing 2% sucrose and used for microarray hybridization. Two replicative hybridization experiments per genotype (wild-type and css1) were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
