TITLE
Impact of the knock down of sulfite reductase on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Sulfite reductase (SiR) plays an essential role in the assimilatory sulfur reduction pathway by catalyzing the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. The T-DNA insertion mutant line sir1-1 shows lower amounts of SiR transcript, protein and lower activity and is severely affected in growth. In this study we performed global transcriptome analysis to investigate the impact of the mutation in the shoot of 7-week-old plants.

DESIGN
Wild type and sir1-1 mutant plants were grown on soil under short day conditions until they reached the 7th week from sowing.
