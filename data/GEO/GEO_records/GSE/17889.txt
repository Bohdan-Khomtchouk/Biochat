TITLE
Invasion-mediating genes in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From the parental breast cancer cell line MCF7 (weakly invasive), we progressively selected hyperinvasive subclones. We compared the gene expression between the parental MCF7-I0 and the hyper-invasive cells MCF7-I6. We used Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying weakly and highly invasive breast cancer cells derived from the human breast cancer cell line MCF7.

DESIGN
The hyper-invasive subclones were selected using Matrigel invasion chambers as a model for the invasion process in vivo. The cells that invaded through the membrane were cultured and re-introduced into an additional invasion assay. This methodology was repeated to give rise to a subclone of MCF7 cells that had invaded six times; these were termed MCF7-I6 cells. The invasive capacity of MCF7-I6 cells was shown to be more than 11 times greater than the parental cells, which we denote as MCF7-I0. Thus, these hyper-invasive cells were present within the heterogeneous population, and we speculated that differences in gene expression between the MCF7-I6 cells and the parental cells MCF7-I0 may be involved in the invasion process.
