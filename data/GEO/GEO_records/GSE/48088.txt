TITLE
Expression of miRNAs in breast tumor from very youn women ( < 36) and women above 65 years old

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression from breast tumor tissue obtained from two groups of breast cancer (BC) patients: one group formed by women younger than 36 years and the other group by women older than 65 years.

DESIGN
We selected breast tumor tissue samples from 21 women under 36 years old and 12 women above 65 years old, without BRCA mutation and without metastases. We selected a pool of samples in which all the subtypes were representated, in young patients as well as in older patients, to avoid expression biass. We add three samples from breast tissue of cancer-free women to minimize the age-related expression biass. Our aim was to compare miRNA expression between young women and older women, considering normal tissue as a reference.
