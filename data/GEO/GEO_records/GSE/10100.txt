TITLE
Aflatoxin B1 treatment with 10,000 ppm for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The number and type of synthetic chemicals that are being produced worldwide continues to increase significantly. While these industrial chemicals provide numerous benefits, there is no doubt that some have potential to damage the environment and health. Toxicity must be evaluated and use must be carefully controlled and monitored in order to minimize potential damage. DNA microarray technology has become an important new technique in toxicology. We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism for toxicological study because it is a simple, fast-growing eukaryote that has been thoroughly characterized. In order to evaluate toxicity by newly synthesized or mixture chemicals, toxicity-induced gene expression alteration profiles by known chemicals should be collected. A lethal effect of a certain kind of mycotoxin is weak to yeast. The amount of exposure to yeast used the maximum dissolution density for afratoxin B1 (CAS; 1162-65-8) (10000 ppm, IC80ï¼‰. Because the data that was able to be trusted was not obtained, it is not possible to have analyzed toxicity. Keywords: stress response
