TITLE
Orientsia tsutsugamushi stimulates an original gene expression program in monocytes: relationship with gene expression in patients with scrub typhus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of Genome wide expression was performed to demonstrate diagnostic potential of expression profiling and to identify host response genes in scrub typhus. The results showed that there is a unique expression pattern in peripheral blood leukocytes of scrub typhus infected patients that could discriminate scrub typhus from the other infections and also provided insight into host transcriptional responses to this paticular infection.

DESIGN
Genome-wide expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with scrub typhus were compared to those from healthy control and from patients with dengue fever, murine typhus or malaria.
