TITLE
Inducible Gata1 Suppression Expands Erythro-Megakaryocytic Progenitors from Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells represent a potential source of megakaryocytes and platelets for transfusion therapies. However, most current ES/iPS cell differentiation protocols are limited by low yields of hematopoietic progeny. Mutations in the mouse and human genes encoding transcription factor GATA1 cause accumulation of proliferating, developmentally arrested megakaryocytes. To exploit this clinical observation, we engineered wildtype (WT) murine ES cells to express doxycycline (dox)-regulated Gata1 short hairpin (sh) RNAs. In vitro differentiation with dox and thrombopoietin (Tpo) resulted in approximately 1013-fold expansion of immature hematopoietic progenitors. Upon dox withdrawal with multilineage cytokines, GATA1 expression was restored and the cells differentiated into erythroblasts and megakaryocytes. With Tpo alone, dox-deprived progenitors formed mainly mature megakaryocytes that generated functional platelets in vivo. Our findings provide a novel, readily reproducible strategy to expand ES-cell derived megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and direct their differentiation into megakaryocytes producing functional platelets in clinically relevant numbers.

DESIGN
3 classes of samples were compared 1) fetal liver derived megkaryocytes 2) G1ME (Gata1â€“ megakaryocyte-erythroid)  3) G1ME2 (engineered wildtype (WT) murine ES cells to express doxycycline (dox)-regulated Gata1 short hairpin (sh) RNAs)
