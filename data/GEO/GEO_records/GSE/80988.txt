TITLE
mRNA expression data from human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (hPGES), normal ESCs (H9) and human fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the derivation of human haploid ESCs from parthenogenetic haploid embryos. We used RNA-seq to compare the gene expression levels among human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (hPGES), normal human ESCs (H9) and human forskin fibroblasts and identified that these cells  express conventional ESCs pluripotent markers and most maternally imprinted genes were  down-regulated.

DESIGN
To avoid the influence of diploidized cells on the expression profile, we collected samples from FACS of cells at G1/G0 stage by staining Hochest 33342. We used normal human ESCs and human fibroblast as control. Gene expression profiles of all the cell lines were analysed on illumina Hiseq 2500.
