TITLE
Expression data from the dorsal and lateral lobes of the prostates of TRAMP mice treated with OSU-CG5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells undergoing malignant transformation often shift their cellular metabolism from primarily oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs), such as 2-deoxyglucose and resveratrol, that target this shift in cellular metabolism have been effective in inhibiting cancer cell growth in vitro, and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. We recently developed a novel ERMA, OSU-CG5, that exhibits higher in vivo activity than previously described ERMAs. In this study, we investigated the effect of OSU-CG5 on global gene expression in the dorsal and lateral lobes of the prostate of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, and on its ability to suppress lesion progression in these mice.

DESIGN
Intact male TRAMP mice were randomized into 2 groups and treated for 4-weeks (from age 6 to 10 weeks) with a vehicle or 100 mg/kg/day OSU-CG5 via oral gavage. At the end of the study, the urogenital tracts were collected and prostates microdissected. RNA was extracted from the dorsal and lateral lobes of the prostates from 3 mice per group, and Affymetrix microarrays were performed.
