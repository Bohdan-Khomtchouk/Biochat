TITLE
Gene expression in blood of obese pediatric patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences between groups of children with obesity and healthy controls. The objective of the study was to identify new molecular markers of hypertension in obese pediatric patients. A total of 12 children with obesity and 20 healthy children were enrolled in the study. The whole genome expression was assessed in leukocytes using GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray.

DESIGN
Microarray comparison of genome expression in blood mononuclear cells between two groups of children (obese, healthy).
