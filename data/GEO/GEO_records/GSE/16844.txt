TITLE
Integrated pathways for neutrophil recruitment and inflammation in leprosy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neutrophil recruitment is pivotal to host defense against microbial infection, but also contributes to the immunopathology of disease.  We investigated the mechanism of neutrophil recruitment in human infectious disease by bioinformatic pathways analysis of the gene expression profiles in the skin lesions of leprosy.  In erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), which occurs in patients with lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), and is characterized by neutrophil infiltration in lesions, the most overrepresented biologic functional group was 'cell movement' including E-selectin, which was coordinately regulated with IL-1beta.  In vitro activation of TLR2, upregulated in ENL lesions, triggered induction of IL-1beta, which together with IFN-gamma, induced E-selectin expression on, and neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells.  Thalidomide, an effective treatment for ENL, inhibited this neutrophil recruitment pathway.  The gene expression profile of ENL lesions comprised an integrated pathway of TLR2/FcR activation, neutrophil migration and inflammation, providing insight into mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment in human infectious disease.
