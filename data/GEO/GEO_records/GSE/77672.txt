TITLE
Genome-wide identiﬁcation of circular RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To exlore more circRNAs involved in Arabidopsis thaliana, we deeply sequenced 14 samples including whole plants from four developmental stages (rosette leaves > 1 mm in length; rosette growth complete; 50% of flowers to be produced have opened; first silique shattered), aerial part of plants from four stress treatments (control, drought, salinity and heat), five organs (roots, stems, leaves, flowers and siliques) and a mixed sample from whole plants across the lifespan (cotyledons emergence, rosette leaves﹥1 mm, rosette growth complete, first flower open, flourishing florescence, first silique shattered, senescence). The total RNA was purified by rRNA-depletion and linear RNA removal with RNAseR, and paired-end (PE) sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500 (read length, PE125, the mixed sample) and Illumina Hiseq X Ten (read length, PE150, 13 independent samples) platforms. We obtained 181.97 Gb raw data (151.37 Gb from 13 samples and 30.6 Gb from a mixed sample) and identified 5861 circRNAs with expression quantity. We annotated the parent genes of these circRNAs and predicted their target sites of microRNAs.

DESIGN
A genome-wide identiﬁcation and analysis of circRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana were performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and Illumina Hiseq X Ten platforms.
