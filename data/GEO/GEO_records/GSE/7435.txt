TITLE
Heparan sulfate in skin wounds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Standardized skin wounds were established surgically on mice and allowed to heal during a 15-day period. Expression of genes related to heparan sulfate biosynthesis was studied in wound bed and edges during the healing process. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from wound edge (regenerating skin) and wound bed at 2, 6 and 15 days post wounding, as well as from intact control skin. Three animals were used for each time point.
