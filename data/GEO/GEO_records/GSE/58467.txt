TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF(pCF10) Gene Expression During Infection

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
Changes in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF(pCF10) gene expression at 4 hours post-infection in a rabbit model of subdermal abscess formation were studied using RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Samples consisted of RNA from the input inoculum and RNA collected from the subdermal chambers four hours after inoculation. Two biological replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
