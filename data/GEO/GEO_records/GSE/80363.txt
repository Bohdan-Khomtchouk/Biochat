TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma associated fibroblast cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cancer associated fibroblasts at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that tumor induced DNA methylation in cancer associated fibroblasts and thus regulated the gene expression in cancer associated fibroblasts. Results showed gene expression level in cancer associated fibroblasts changed  after coculture with pancreatic cancer cells.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stem cells and 09.05CAFs which was primary cultured fibroblasts either cultured alone or co-cultured with pancreatic tumor cells then purified by anti-FAP antibody coupled Dynabeads. Total RNA were abtained and gene expression were compared between cultured alone and cocultured.
