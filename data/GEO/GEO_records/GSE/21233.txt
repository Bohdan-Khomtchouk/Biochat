TITLE
Expression data from C2C12 mouse myoblast with treatment actinomycin D

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dramatic changes in gene expression occur in response to extracellular stimuli and during differentiation.  Although transcriptional effects are important, alterations in mRNA decay also play a major role in achieving rapid and massive changes in mRNA abundance.  Moreover, just as transcription factor activity varies between different cell types, the factors influencing mRNA decay are also cell-type specific. We have established the rates of decay for over 7000 transcripts expressed in mouse C2C12 myoblasts.

DESIGN
To estimate mRNA decay rate in mouse muscle cells, we treated C2C12 mouse myoblasts with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription and collected samples at 0, 10, 50, 110 and 230 min.
