TITLE
Distinct cell cycle control in na√Øve and primed mouse pluripotency [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cell cycle of primed pluripotent mouse serum ESCs is characterised by a shortened G1-phase. Here we assessed the differences in cell cycle between serum ESCs and naive 2i ESCs.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs were cultured either in serum conditions or 2i conditions. Cells were fixed chromatin was extracted. Biological replicate included.
