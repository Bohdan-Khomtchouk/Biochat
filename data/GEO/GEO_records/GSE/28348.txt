TITLE
Changes in H3K4 methylation in KDM5A/JARID1A/RBP2 knockout cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to determine H3K4me3 distribution in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient for RBP2 compared with wild-type cells. RBP2 modifies methylated lysine residues on histone tails. As a result of this analysis, we identified genomic regions with changed H3K4me3 status and described these in gene ontology (GO) categories.

DESIGN
Examination of histone methylation in the absence of histone demethylase RBP2

PLATFORM
