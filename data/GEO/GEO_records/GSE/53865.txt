TITLE
System analysis of microRNAs in the development and aluminium stress responses of the maize root system.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Four sRNA libraries were generated and sequenced from the early developmental stage of primary roots (PRY), the later developmental stage of maize primary roots (PRO), seminal roots (SR), and crown roots (CR). Through integrative analysis, we identified 501 miRNAs (246 conserved and 255 novel ones) and found that the expression patterns of miRNAs differed dramatically in different maize roots.

DESIGN
we generated and sequenced four maize small RNA libraries from the early developmental stage of primary roots (PRY), the later developmental stage of maize primary roots (PRO), seminal roots (SR), and crown roots (CR) using Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology

PLATFORM
GPL9141 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Zea mays)
