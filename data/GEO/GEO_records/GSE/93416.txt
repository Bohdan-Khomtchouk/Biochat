TITLE
Expression Profiling of MEFs and SKOM induced reprogramming cells after modulation of Cell cycle and Dnmt1 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To generate association of DNA methylation level and gene expression profile, we applied RNA-sequencing on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after the modulation of cell cycle and Dnmt1 expression level. To characterize how these factors affect somatic reprogramming, samples of MEFs induced by Yamanaka factors (Sox2, Klf4, Oct4, cMyc) was also included. The cell cycle was accelerated by shRNA targeted to p53, and the expression of Dnmt1 was manipulated by either over expression or knock down.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of cell cycle modulated MEFs and SKOM induced reprogramming cells. SKOM-induced cells were grown either in the presence of Vitamin C (Vc) or absence of Vc.
