TITLE
Expression data of HBV positive cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine host factors that regulate HBV, cells positive for and negative for HBV were compared. We identified three transcription regulators (HNF4A1, HNFA2, HNFA3) that support HBV replication

DESIGN
14 cell lines were analyzed, including 4 liver cells  (2 HBV positive; 2 HBV negative) and 10 non-liver cell lines (all HBV negative)

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
