TITLE
FOXP3-mediated inhibition of a global gene regulator is required for maintaining Treg cell commitment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are characterized by the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3. Mutations in FOXP3 cause autoimmunity in mice and humans. Here, Treg cells as well as conventional T cells were isolated from B-CLL patients and analyzed by global gene expression analysis in order to identify biological differences in Treg cells of CLL patients.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated peripheral CD4+ T cells of CLL patients, separated into CD25 negative and positive subpopulations.
