TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Prdm11 knockout mice after OVA challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM family members encode for progeins functionally associated with the control of cell proliferation, differentiation as well as apoptosis action in cell and tissue-specific menner. As important factors in maintenance and differentiation of human and mouse ES cells several PRDM family members were identified. Prdm11 has and outsider position within the PRDM family due to the lack of zinc-finger domains. However, a zic-finger binding motive i present and likely assue the function of protein-protein interactionl. Prdm11 was described as a candidate for tumor suppresser. However, the function of this gene is still unknown. Our study give evidence a new functional association of Prdm11 in allergic disease and asthma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 1/2 lung of 4 female mice of each analysed group (widltype, wildtype challenged, mutant, mutant challenged)

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
