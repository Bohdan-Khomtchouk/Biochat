TITLE
Resveratrol treatment of daf-16 mutant C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Eggs were isolated by hypochlorite treatment and allowed to hatch in the absence of food as L1 stage arrested worms in S-buffer. Worms were then transferred to large plates containing NGM alone or NGM+ resveratrol and allowed to grow till young adult stage (ca 40 hours). Worms were harvested and total RNA extracted using trizol reagent. Poly-A+ RNA was isolated using Qiagen midi-prep kit and used for microarray hybridization. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed.
