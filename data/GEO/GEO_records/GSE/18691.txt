TITLE
Expression data of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells derived pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EC cells derived pluripotent stem cells could prolong the development of tetraploid aggregated mice; and the increased pluripotecny of EC cells derived pluripotent stem cells coincided with the recovery of many critical genes. Therefore, EC cells derived pluripotent stem cells were really the intermediates between EC cells and ES cells. And they had specific molecular characteristics, which may account for the improved pluripotency observed. We took use of microarray method to screen out the differentially expressed genes during the reprogarmming of EC cells; and the investigation of these genes may provide us with more about the transition between tumorigenesis and pluripotency.

DESIGN
EC cells (P19), P19 cells derived pluripotent stem cells (N7P8) and ES cells (R1) were collected for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.In order to eliminate the varience, these kinds cells were all cultured in ES medium; and feeder cells were cleared out. And every sample had three biological repeats.
