TITLE
Expression data from immature pDC and pDC activated with CpG 1826 and influenza virus PR8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CpG 1826 binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR)9, whereas influenza virus PR8 activates pDC via TLR7. Differential stimulation of pDCs is expected to result in unique activation mechanism(s) leading to a different phenotypically and functionally matured pDC We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the maturation process of pDC activated with CpG 1826 and influenza virus PR8. We identified a distinct expression profile of upregulated immunomediators. Keywords: time course
