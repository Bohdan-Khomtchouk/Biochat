TITLE
Expression data from immature pDC and pDC activated with CpG 1826 and influenza virus PR8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CpG 1826 binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR)9, whereas influenza virus PR8 activates pDC via TLR7. Differential stimulation of pDCs is expected to result in unique activation mechanism(s) leading to a different phenotypically and functionally matured pDC We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the maturation process of pDC activated with CpG 1826 and influenza virus PR8. We identified a distinct expression profile of upregulated immunomediators. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Sorted pDCs were cultured for 1h and 4hs in medium control or with 5 Âµg/ml CpG 1826 or 300 HAU/ml purified influenza A/PR/8 virus. The first experiment (e1) included pDC in media and stimulated with CpG for 4h. In two other independent experimental batches (e2 and e3), we obtained samples of sorted pDC cultured in medium alone (med), and with CpG or PR8 (flu) for 1h and 4h. RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed using standard protocols. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of pDCs at different time points under defined activation conditions in order to decipher the temporal resolution of expression profiles during the process of their maturation.
