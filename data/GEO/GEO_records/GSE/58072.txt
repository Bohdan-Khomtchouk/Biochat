TITLE
Gene expression profile after SYT9 re-expression during differentiation of CSB-KD SH-SY5Y cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CSB-depletion induced SH-SY5Y differentiation defects can be partially rescued by re-expression of SYT9 gene. This study characterizes the transcriptome signatures upon SYT9 re-expression in CSB-KD SH-SY5Y cells after RA treatment.

DESIGN
The Nimblegen human 12 x 135K gene expression array was used to characterize the transcriptome landscape of CSB-KD SH-SY5Y cells overepressing SYT9 before and after RA treatment.
