TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human telomerase fibroblasts stimulated with dsDNA90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of dsDNA90 stimulated human telomerase fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) after STING siRNA treatment. Genes whose expression that are affected by cytosolic DNA in a STING dependent manner will be identified and signaling pathways regulated by STING will be elucidated.

DESIGN
hTERT-BJ1 cells were transfected with non-specific or STING siRNA for 72 hours followed by dsDNA90 stimulation for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted for array analysis.
