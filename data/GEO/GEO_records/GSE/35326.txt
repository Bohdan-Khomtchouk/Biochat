TITLE
KC001: Genome wide expression profiling of the mesodiencephalic region led to the identification of novel factors involved in early and late dopaminergic development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meso-diencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons are critical for motor control and cognitive functioning and their loss or dysfunction is associated with disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), schizophrenia and addiction. However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying mdDA neuron development and maintenance. Here, we determined the spatiotemporal map of genes involved in the development of mdDA neurons to gain further insights into their molecular programming. Genome-wide gene expression profiles of the developing ventral mesencephalon (VM) were compared at different developmental stages leading to the identification of novel regulatory roles of neuronal signaling through nicotinic acthylcholine receptors (Chrna6 and Chrnb3 subunits) and the identification of novel transcription factors (OC1 and 2)) involved in the generation of mdDA neuronal  field. We show here that Pitx3 in cooperation with Nurr1 are the critical components in the activation of the Chrna6 and b3 subunits in mdDA neurons. Furthermore, we provide evidence of two divergent  regulatory pathways resulting in the expression of Chrna6 and Chrnb3 respectively.

DESIGN
Embryonic ventral midbrain (VM) tissue was used to generate RNA samples for microarray analysis. Each sample consists of pooled RNA from three embryonic VMs, and is hybridized twice (in both dye orientations) against a common reference RNA (KC001-ref) consisting of pooled RNA from adult VMs. Each embryonic stages E10.5, E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5 is analysed from three independant samples.
