TITLE
Genomic definition of multiple ex vivo Treg sub-phenotypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells that express the FoxP3 transcription factor are essential for lymphoid homeostasis and immune tolerance to self. Other non-immunological functions of Treg cells, such as controlling metabolic function in adipose tissue, are also emerging. Treg cells originate primarily in the thymus, but can also be elicited from conventional T cells by in vivo exposure to low-dose antigen or homeostatic expansion, or by activation in the presence of TGFβ in vitro. Treg cells are characterized by a distinct transcriptional signature controlled in part, but not solely, by FoxP3. For a better perspective on transcriptional control in Treg cells, we compared gene expression profiles of a broad panel of Treg cells from various origins or anatomical locations. Treg cells generated by different means form different sub-phenotypes identifiable by particular combinations of transcripts, none of which fully encompass the entire Treg signature. Molecules involved in Treg effector function, chemokine receptors, and the transcription factors that control them are differentially represented in these subphenotypes. Treg cells from the gut proved dissimilar to cells elicited by exposure to TGFβ, but instead they resembled a CD103+Klrg1+ subphenotype preferentially generated in response to lymphopenia.

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled for sorting, and replicates or triplicates were generated for all groups. RNA from 1-5 x 104 cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix M430v2 microarrays. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern, and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
