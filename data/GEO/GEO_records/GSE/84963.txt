TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of PTTH-stimulated Bombyx prothoracic gland

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
This is part of a cross-species approach to characterize transcriptional response of the insect prothoracic gland (PG) to the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Genome-wide response of the PG to PTTH was analyzed in vitro in Bombyx and in vivo in Drosophila, and the results were compared to identify common components in the PTTH signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Bombyx PGs were incubated in vitro for 1 or 3 hours with or without 10 nM recombinant PTTH. 12-18 larvae were used to prepare each RNA sample, and the experiment was conducted twice. Total RNA samples from two independent preparations were combined to obtain a single RNA sample for each treatment, which was subjected to RNA-seq.
