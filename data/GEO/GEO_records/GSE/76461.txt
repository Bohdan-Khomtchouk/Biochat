TITLE
The role of Sgf73 occupancy

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sgf73, a core component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) co-activator complex, is the yeast orthologue of ataxin-7, which in humans undergoes CAG ? polyglutamine repeat expansion to produce the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7).   We recently documented that deletion of SGF73 dramatically extends replicative lifespan (RLS) in yeast.  To define the basis for Sgf73-mediated RLS extension, and to further explore the molecular function of Sgf73/ataxin-7 we performed ChIP-Seq for Sgf73 in yeast to identify its regions of DNA binding. The aim of the study was to uncover the underlying mechanisms controlled by Sgf73. This information will be used to understand the role of Sgf73 target genes in yeast aging pathways and possibly highlight pathways of mammalian aging regulation and SCA7 neurodegeneration in humans.
