TITLE
Investigation of differential gene expression in menthol treated and control (untreated) cell lines in  CaCO2 human cell line during apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify changes in gene expression with apoptosis, we investigated differential gene expression in a colon carcinoma model established in human cell line CaCO2. We arrayed 384 oligos (representing 384 genes including positive and negative controls) related with Apoptosis for detection of differences at gene expression levels in some of the very important apoptotic biomarkers

DESIGN
We arrayed 384 genes related with Apoptosis including control for detection of differences at gene expression levels in some of the very important apoptotic biomarkers. Those arrayed oligos gene chip were co- hybridized with labeled cDNA probe prepared from total RNA isolated from menthol treated and untreated control cell lines to find out the differential behaviour of the genes related to Apoptosis. Two-condition experiment, Control (untreated vs menthol treated ) Human cell lines CaCO2.
