TITLE
Gene expression profiling in mouse livers after administration of both hydrogen-rich water and hydrogen gas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Molecular hydrogen is a hopeful agent for oxidative stress-related and/or inflammatory disorders. However, the molecular mechanism for these therapeutic effects of hydrogen still remains to be fully elucidated. We examined whether molecular hydrogen alters gene expression levels in normal mouse livers by DNA microarray analysis. We identified 140 mouse genes that were upregulated (31 genes) or downregulated (109 genes) after three weeks of the inhalation of 2% hydrogen-containing air with oral intake of hydrogen-rich water. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that hydrogen influenced expression of NF-kB- and NFAT-regulated genes. Western blot analysis showed that hydrogen attenuated Erk, p38 MAPK, and NF-kB signaling in mouse livers.

DESIGN
We divided 10-week male BALB/c mice into two groups: 1) control group: fed with control water in air (n=4), 2) hydrogen-treated group: fed with hydrogen-rich water in 2% hydrogen/98% air (n=4). Hydrogen-rich water (0.7mM dissolved hydrogen) was generated from distilled water with 0.44 mM Na2SO4 using Aquela Blue, a water-electrolyzing device to produce electrolyzed hydrogen-saturated water near neutral pH (MiZ Co., Ltd, Fujisawa, Japan). The control water was prepared by gently stirring hydrogen-rich water in open air for 24 hours. Hydrogen-rich water or control water was administrated ad libitum to the mice with a 50-ml closed glass vessel equipped with an outlet line having a ball bearing. After 3-week rearing, the mice were sacrificed and their livers were removed for RNA extraction. We mixed equal amount of RNA from four mice in each group (control vs. hydrogen-treated) and compared gene expression profile by microarray.
