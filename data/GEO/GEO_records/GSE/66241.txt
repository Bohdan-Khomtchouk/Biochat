TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of PARKIN deficient patient fibroblast and iPSC lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole genome gene expression in control and PARKIN patient lines. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the deficient of PARKIN expression affects multiple pathways. Results provide important information on relationship between PARKIN and mitochondria related gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from patient fibroblast and iPSC compare to control fibroblast and iPSC.
