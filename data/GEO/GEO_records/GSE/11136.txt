TITLE
Identification of Genes and Gene Ontology Process Critical to Skin Papilloma Development in Tg.AC Transgenic Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study analyzes gene expression associated with papilloma development in Tg.AC v-Ha-ras transgenic mice and identifies novel genes and biological processes that may be critical to skin carcinogenesis in these mice.  Epidermal abrasion was used to synchronously induce epidermal regeneration in FVB/N wild type and transgenic Tg.AC mice.  Skin papillomagenesis was uniquely induced in Tg.AC mice, and gene expression profiling was carried out using a 22,000 element mouse DNA microarray.  Histological analysis showed that papillomas developed at a high rate by day 30 after abrasion in transgenic animals, while no papilloma developed in wild type mice.  Transgene specific differentially expressed genes were identified at day 30 post-abrasion and these genes were annotated using EASE software and literature mining.  Annotated and non-annotated genes associated with papilloma development were identified and clustering analysis revealed groups of genes that are coordinately expressed.  A number of genes associated with differentiation and development were also physically clustered on mouse chromosome 16, including 16B3 that contains several Stefins and stefin-like genes, and 16A1 containing a number of keratin associated protein genes.  Additional analyses presented here yield novel insights into the genes and processes involved in papilloma development in Tg.AC mice. Keywords: Time course of papilloma tumorigenesis between genetically modified strains after skin abrasion.
