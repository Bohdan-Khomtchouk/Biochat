TITLE
Meiotic time-course expression profile

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To investigate the dynamics of the meiotic transcriptome and to ensure meiotic synchrony of our samples, we measured RNA abundance in vegetative cells, respiratory (pre-meiotic) cells and in synchronously sporulating cells at various times after transfer to sporulation media (SM).
