TITLE
Meiotic time-course expression profile

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae SK1

SUMMARY
To investigate the dynamics of the meiotic transcriptome and to ensure meiotic synchrony of our samples, we measured RNA abundance in vegetative cells, respiratory (pre-meiotic) cells and in synchronously sporulating cells at various times after transfer to sporulation media (SM).

DESIGN
SK1 yeast strain SHy002 (MATa/MATÎ± ho::LYS2/ho::LYS2 leu2::hisG/leu2::hisG lys2/lys2 ura3/ura3) < br > Meiotic Time Course with samples collected during vegetative growth (YPD), respiratory growth (pre-meiotic/YPA 8 hours) and 0 hr, 1.5hr, 3hr, 4.5hr, 6hr, 9hr and 12hr after transfer to sporulation media (SM). < br > 3 separate biological replicates were used for each condition/time-point. < br > Total RNA from each sample was hybridized competitively with a genomic DNA common reference. < br > The expression analysis was carried out from the same biological samples as the FAIRE analysis. < br >
