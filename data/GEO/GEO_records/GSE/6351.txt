Expression data from peripheral blood from healthy and predisposed individuals

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of the underlying genetic defects in patients with a rare and peculiar phenotype is challenging. Here we have utilized whole genome expression profiling, and identified a homozygous germline mutation in the DDB2 gene in a patient with several facial tumors. The feasibility of using blood derived RNA, diminishing costs of the technology, and the limited number of samples needed provide this approach a powerful new tool that may substantially aid in such gene identification efforts. Keywords: disease vs control
