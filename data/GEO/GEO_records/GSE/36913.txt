TITLE
Bj_indole-3-acetic acid 1 mM vs. non-treatment

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mid-logarithmic phase cultures exposed to a 1 mM shock treatment of indole-3-acetic acid for 3 hours.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates were prepared for cells shocked with 1 mM  indole-3-acetic acid during growth and for non-treated cells. A total 6 arrays which includes dye swap were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL5341 USDA Bradyrhizobium japonicum 8.5K (BJ_USDA110_Oligo_Array)
