TITLE
Distinct gene expression profiles associated with the susceptibility of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression profiles of flow cytometry-sorted, different pathogen-specific CD4+ T cell populations from the same peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), to identify molecular parameters that regulate differential susceptibilities of these CD4+ T cells to HIV infection. The results reveal distinct gene expression profiles between CMV-specific and tetanus toxoid/Candida-specific CD4+ T cells that involved selective upregulation of comprehensive innate antiviral

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from CFSE-low, flow-sorted pathogen-specific CD4+ T cells were analyzed for global gene expression. Changes in gene expression were compared between CMV to combined TT/Candida, or TT/CMV and Candida/CMV.
