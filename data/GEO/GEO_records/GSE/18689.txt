TITLE
Genes regulated by high calcium medium in parathyroid tissue explants from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate genes modulated in the parathyroid glands by calcium, expression levels of mRNA for all genes expressed in parathyroid tissue explants (PTEs) obtained from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (I-HPT) were analyzed by oligo-DNA microarray. PTEs obtained from 4 patients with I-HPT were precultured in normocalcemic medium (Ca++ 1.0-1.1 mM) for 7 days and then cultured in hypocalcemic medium (Ca++ 0.60 mM) or hypercalcemic (Ca++ 1.60 mM) medium for an additional 7 days. As expected, expression levels of mRNA for PTH and chromogranin A were decreased to less than 50%ã€€in hypercalcemic medium. Furthermore, oligo-DNA microarray analyses followed by GeneSpring GX analyses revealed that 7 genes were up-regulated by more than 2-fold and more than 30 genes were down-regulated by more than 1/2 in PTEs obtained from patients with I-HPT.  Interestingly, 9 of these genes (up-regulated genes: chemokine ligand 8[CCL8], multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region protein 1 [MCTP1]; down-regulated genes: matrix metallopeptidase-9 [MMP9], B-box and SPRY domain-containing protein [BSPRY], nitric oxide synthase 2A [NOS2A], parathyroid hormone [PTH], cartilage acidic protein 1 [CRTAC1], chromogranin A [CHGA], and fibrin 1 [FBLN1]) were involved in calcium metabolism or calcium-signaling pathways in the parathyroid tissue. Unexpectedly, however, the expression level of mRNA for alpha-klotho was variable, and it was not constantly decreased in hypercalcemic medium under the present experimental conditions. Although it was not possible to use normal parathyroid tissue, this is the first reported study to have investigated the expression levels of mRNA for all genes in human parathyroid adenomas that are modulated by high calcium concentration in organ culture.

DESIGN
Organ culture experiments, cultured in low vs.high calcium medium.
