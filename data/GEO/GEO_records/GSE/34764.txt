TITLE
Expression data from mouse lung epithelium after allergen challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes occur in the lung epithelium after allergen challenge that may give insight into asthma pathogenesis and we sought to identify novelepithelial genes induced by allergen exposure. We used microarrays to identify up-regulated genes induced by allergen challenge in lung epithelium.

DESIGN
Epithelal brushing of the large airways in mouse lungs was performed 24 hours after  Alternaria allergen or PBS control challenge 24.  Collected epithelial cells underwent RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. There are a total of 6 samples, 3 allergen and 3 control samples.
